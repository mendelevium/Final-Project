(Gerry Broome/AP)

As a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly years ago, Republican Scott Walker pushed two key measures to limit abortions. Neither was successful.

But as governor on Friday, Walker signed legislation requiring that women get an ultrasound before having an abortion and mandating that doctors who perform the procedure have admitting privileges at a local hospital. Opponents say the bill would force at least two clinics in Wisconsin to close.

The measures are part of a wave of abortion limits passed this year by conservative lawmakers and governors, who have approved more than 40 restrictions in statehouses around the country, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks the issue.

The push has been aided by the expanded control of state governments by Republicans, who now hold a majority of governerships and legislatures and who enjoy veto-proof majorities in twice as many states as Democrats. Some of the measures were also fueled by outrage over the conduct of providers such as Philadelphia late-term abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell, who was convicted of murder charges this spring.

By mobilizing partisans on both sides, the abortion issue is poised to figure more prominently in the 2014 and 2016 elections than most strategists would have expected six months ago.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), widely seen as a presidential contender, is weighing whether to play a leading role on the issue by sponsoring a Senate bill to ban abortions 20 weeks after fertilization. Rubio is attempting to shore up support among conservatives who opposed his role in crafting a Senate immigration bill.

In North Carolina, the state Senate adopted a sweeping bill Wednesday that includes a ban on sex-selective abortions and on abortion coverage in insurance offered in the state’s health exchange. It also requires abortion clinics be held to the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers and have a transfer agreement with a local hospital.

In Texas, the legislature convened a second special session this week to take up a bill similar to North Carolina’s, which state Sen. Wendy Davis (D) successfully blocked through a filibuster in late June.

“It’s not as if there’s some central mastermind strategy that’s organizing action on the state level,” said Maureen Ferguson, senior policy adviser at the Catholic Association. “It really is a response of the people and the growing pro-life sentiment in the country.”

But abortion rights activists and their Democratic allies say the push will work to their political advantage in upcoming congressional and gubernatorial races, allowing them to portray Republicans as more focused on extreme social issues than on bolstering the economy. Many of the abortion measures also face court challenges that could delay implementation for months or years.

Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Rep. Steve Israel (N.Y.) said in an interview that the DCCC was already targeting 16 House Republicans who had voted in June for the 20-week abortion ban written by Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) or in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood in the last Congress.

“Republicans have shown they can’t help themselves from pursuing an ideological agenda, and they are further alienating independent and moderate voters,” Israel said. “They are pulling themselves down on this issue.”

GOP officials say they do not expect abortion to become a decisive factor in upcoming races. Republican candidates will focus instead on economic issues and on controversy surrounding President Obama’s Affordable Care Act, they said.

“Like most campaigns, the issues that are discussed most are the issues that voters deal with on a day-to-day basis,” said Brad Dayspring, spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. “At the current moment, that seems to be jobs, the economy, making sure health care is affordable and making sure our children have the opportunities we were blessed with.”

Abortion is already a major campaign issue in some contests, including the Virginia governor’s race between GOP Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II and former Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe. But Cuccinelli campaign strategist Chris LaCivita said much of the focus is being driven by one side, which has attacked the attorney general for his opposition to abortion even in cases of rape and incest and his push to impose new requirements on abortion clinics.

“Ken Cuccinelli’s position on life is well known,” LaCivita said. “But the only people trying to make it a central issue are Terry McAuliffe and the Democrats.”

Some Republicans, however, say they are concerned that GOP lawmakers continue to mishandle the issue through clumsy statements that alienate women. During committee consideration of the House abortion bill last month, Franks touched off a firestorm when he said that “the incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low.”

The following week, Rep. Michael C. Burgess (R-Tex.) argued that sonograms suggest a young fetus can experience sexual pleasure. “If they’re a male baby, they may have a hand between their legs,” Burgess said. “If they feel pleasure, why can’t they feel pain?”

One Republican Party official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said the Franks bill “should have been a political win for us, and it was a messaging disaster. . . . Salacious, inappropriate comments coming out of male House Republicans’ mouths — it just damages the brand.”

Abortion opponents, who play a crucial role in the Republican base, have been pushing particularly hard for legislative action amid revelations about unsafe practices at some abortion clinics. Gosnell was convicted in May of first-degree murder in the deaths of three infants and of involuntary manslaughter in the death of an adult patient. Live Action, an anti-abortion group, has spurred state investigations of clinics by producing dozens of videos with undercover footage.

“House Republicans felt very strongly after the horrors committed by Kermit Gosnell we needed to protect life and protect women and children from these unsafe and inhumane practices,” said Rory Cooper, spokesman for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.). But he added, “Right now, we’re focused on energy and jobs.”

Public opinion has remained mostly supportive of the right to legal abortion since the 1990s, but many Americans are willing to impose tighter restrictions on the procedure. Under the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision, abortions can be performed until the point when an individual doctor determines a fetus’s viability, which is generally defined as up to 24 weeks of gestation. After that point, the government can prohibit the procedure if it provides safeguards for the mother’s health and well-being.

Fifty-five percent of respondents said abortion should be legal in all or most cases in an August 2012 Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll, with 42 percent saying it should be illegal in all or most cases. A Gallup poll in December 2012 found that while 61 percent of respondents supported keeping abortions in the first trimester legal, 64 percent thought second-trimester abortions should be illegal and 80 percent backed banning third-trimester abortions.

The pace of state abortion restrictions in recent years has accelerated, with more than 170 enacted since 2011, according to the Guttmacher Institute.

Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser, whose group plans to spend $1.5 million helping Cuccinelli, said Republicans can win at the ballot box if they “bring the public to a point of consensus” around issues such as a 20-week ban and tougher operating standards for clinics.

Democrats are doing their best to put all anti-abortion Republicans in the same camp as Todd Akin, whose Senate candidacy for a seat in Missouri collapsed last year after he suggested women don’t get pregnant in instances of “legitimate rape.”

Democrats pounced this week after Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) signed several new abortion restrictions into law while surrounded by a group of male legislators. Both the Democratic Governors Association and American Bridge 21st Century, a liberal super PAC, began highlighting the scene in political attacks.

Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols called the criticism unfounded. “The governor is pro-life and we believe these are reasonable policies to help protect human life,” he wrote in an e-mail.

But Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said Kasich’s move “will be an issue for him” in his reelection campaign next year. “These are going to be nationalized races in a way we haven’t seen with these state races, because people understand the things that are at stake,” she said.

(CNN) —

If you’re a tourist arriving in Israel, you might be asked to give authorities a look at your personal e-mail, in addition to your travel documents.

Israel’s attorney general said Wednesday that Shin Bet, the country’s internal security force, can search a foreign traveler’s e-mail, but only in exceptional cases in which “relevant suspicious signs” are observed. Israel says the practice is another way to fight terrorism.

The threat of using foreign citizens for terrorist purposes is a growing trend, the Israeli Attorney General’s Office said in a written response to an inquiry filed by an Israeli human rights group.

Yigal Palmor, a spokesman for Israel’s Foreign Ministry, told CNN: “Security may under the law demand this, but no one is forced to open their accounts to anyone they don’t want to.”

However, the attorney general’s decision said that if the traveler declined to give consent, it would be made clear that a refusal would be taken into consideration, along with other relevant factors, in deciding whether to allow entry into Israel.

The Association for Civil Rights in Israel received the information from the Attorney General’s Office after it asked whether Israel’s security forces could demand travelers’ e-mail and social media passwords. The association said the question was a reaction to media reports last year that several Palestinian-American travelers were asked to open their e-mail accounts and show airport security before being denied entry. The group received an answer this week.

“To be clear, this is a process whose execution is conditioned on the receipt of the passenger’s agreement, and that the latter is not required to give the investigating representative his password, as your letter suggests, but rather that the passenger himself executes entry to the e-mail account … ” The Attorney General’s Office wrote.

Lila Margalit, an attorney for the Association for Civil Rights, said the practice is a violation of privacy rights:

“A tourist who has just spent thousands of dollars to travel to Israel, only to be interrogated at the airport by Shin Bet agents and told to grant access to their e-mail account, is in no position to give free and informed consent,” she said Wednesday. “Such ‘consent,’ given under threat of deportation, cannot serve as a basis for such a drastic invasion of privacy. In today’s world, access to a person’s e-mail account is akin to access to their innermost thoughts and personal lives. Allowing security agents to take such invasive measures at their own discretion and on the basis of such flimsy ‘consent’ is not befitting of a democracy.”

Security checks at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport are known around the world as some of the most exhaustive and thorough, and this is one more layer that travelers should be aware of.

Jerusalem Travel Agency owner Margo Tarazi said she had heard of the practice but her clients had not experienced it:

“None of our clients have faced this problem yet. They come with official groups with their vouchers, and no one asks them about these things. However, if we do receive any groups with some people who are originally from Iran or from Syria, they are detained for several hours and asked to sign a paper not to cause any harm to the state of Israel during their visit.”

Critics of the practice worry it will be used to target Arabs or Muslims who communicate with Palestinian activists or organizations."

In a statement posted on its website, WikiLeaks denounced the Obama administration for its “bellicose response” to the American fugitive’s search for refuge from U.S. prosecution for disclosing top-secret NSA data surveillance operations.

“Over the past eight weeks we have seen the Obama administration show no respect for international or domestic law, but in the end the law is winning,” Snowden is quoted as saying after finally escaping more than a month of diplomatic limbo at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo International Airport. “I thank the Russian Federation for granting me asylum in accordance with its laws and international obligations.”

Snowden’s father, Lon, also expressed his gratitude to Russian President Vladimir Putin for protecting his son from the legal consequences of having violated his NSA confidentiality obligations.

In an interview broadcast Wednesday by Rossiya-24 television, the elder Snowden praised Putin and his government for having “the strength and resolve and convictions to protect my son.” Lon Snowden was in the process of arranging a visit to Moscow to see his son, the fugitive’s lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, told journalists after his client left the airport for an undisclosed location.

“Despite the ongoing pressure from the United States, which has been trying to interfere with this sovereign [asylum] process in violation of the U.N. Protocol on the Rights of Refugees, Russia has done the right thing and granted Mr. Snowden temporary asylum,” the unsigned WikiLeaks statement declared.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, from his own tentative refuge at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, pronounced Snowden’s grant of asylum in Russia a triumph in the global battle to protect those who expose what they consider illegal government behavior.

“This is another victory in the fight against Obama’s war on whistle-blowers. This battle has been won, but the war continues,” Assange said. “The United States can no longer continue the surveillance of world citizens and its digital colonization of sovereign nations.”

Russian human rights advocates were quick to point out, though, that Snowden has taken shelter in a country with a deplorable track record in defense of free speech and tolerance of dissent.

Lyudmila Alexeyeva, head of the human rights advocates of the Moscow Helsinki Group, said it was good that Snowden had finally escaped his protracted ordeal in the transit area of the capital’s main airport but noted that he now finds himself in a country with little regard for the ideals of freedom he professes.

“Having fought for the freedom and rights, Snowden has ended up in a country that cracks down on them,” Alexeyeva was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.

Human Rights Watch analysts also took note of the irony of the Kremlin coming to the defense of a self-styled champion of privacy and free speech rights.

“He cannot but be aware of the unprecedented crackdown on human rights that the government has unleashed in the past 15 months,” Rachel Denber, the rights group’s expert on Russia and other former Soviet states told the Associated Press by email.

Another Human Rights Watch commentator, Deputy Executive Director Carroll Bogert, advised Snowden in a tongue-in-cheek post on CNN’s news blog that he get familiar with certain expressions in the Russian language, such as “khuliganstvo” -- hooliganism, which might cover anything from getting in a fistfight to performance of a protest song denouncing Putin.

A letter from President Obama to Russian President Vladimir Putin, conveyed by Donilon, “is written in a constructive tone and has a number of proposals promoting bilateral dialogue and cooperation,” the Russian leader’s foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov, told reporters after the Kremlin get-together.

Ushakov said the White House is sending “positive signals” to Moscow, though he noted that Obama has not moved to tamp down the “Russophobia” in other parts of the American government, by which he meant Congress.

Donilon’s visit occurred after a weekend in which the United States and Russia each released lists of officials from the other country who were being barred from visits. The U.S. list, in compliance with the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act, targets 18 people deemed to be human rights violators. They are also subject to financial sanctions. The White House opposed the Magnitsky measure, but it was passed overwhelmingly by Congress.

The Russian list, released a day later, names officials associated with the Guantanamo prison camp and “enhanced interrogation,” as well as prosecutors and judges who have dealt with criminal cases involving several Russians.

Publicly naming people who are barred from entering a country is highly unusual; the Russians have called it provocative. The release of the lists follows a year of unraveling relations between the two countries, which began as Putin reassumed the presidency last spring. Russia has resisted the United States position on Syria, criticized American support for advocacy groups here, expelled USAID and accused Washington of trying to foment rebellion in the streets.

Passage of the Magnitsky law in December led to a Russian ban on American adoptions of Russian children.

Jay Carney, the White House spokesman, said Donilon went to Moscow to discuss a “full range” of issues, including Syria, trade and nuclear non-proliferation. Russia has already been notably critical of North Korean threats against South Korea and the United States.

“We understand we have differences, and we are very clear and transparent and candid about those differences and we engage with Russian officials on those differences,” Carney said. “But we also have areas where we can cooperate in ways that are useful and in the interest of both Russia and the United States.”

“As for us, we shall follow these positive signals,” Ushakov said.

Monday’s talks included, besides Putin, Ushakov and Donilon: U.S. Ambassador Michael McFaul; Rose Gottemoeller, assistant secretary of state for arms control; James Miller, under secretary of defense for policy; Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the Russian Security Council; Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov; Deputy Defense Minister Anatoly Antonov; and officials from the Russian Federal Security Service and the Foreign Intelligence Service.

Earlier Monday, Donilon met with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov afterward told the Itar-Tass news agency that Donilon had reiterated comments made last week by Secretary of State John F. Kerry when he met with him, acknowledging that there were “irritants” in relations between the two countries and pledging to try to ameliorate them.

“Let’s see,” Lavrov said. “We’ll judge by deeds and not by words.”

I am Ju Hong, the ""heckler"" that interrupted your speech at the Betty Ong Center in San Francisco last week. I spoke up not out of disrespect, however, either for you or our country. No, I spoke up -- and am writing to you now -- to ask that you use your executive order to halt deportations for 11.5 million undocumented immigrant families.

My family came to the United States from South Korea when I was 11 years old. Like many immigrants, my mother brought me to this country to seek a better life for her children.

I graduated from UC Berkeley, and am now pursuing a Master's degree in Public Administration at San Francisco State University. I have lived in America now for 13 years. I consider this country as my home. During my senior year in high school, however, I learned that my family had overstayed a tourist visa. We are undocumented immigrants.

As an American without papers, I was not able to get a job, obtain a driver's license, or receive governmental financial aid. When my mother was sick and in severe pain, she did not visit a doctor because she cannot procure medical insurance. And when my family's home was burglarized, she refused to call the police because she was afraid that our family would be turned over to immigration officials and deported.

Like many other undocumented immigrants, I was living in the shadows and living in fear of deportation. However, I have decided to speak out and stand up.

Immigration reform is not only a Latino issue, it's also an Asian and Pacific Islander issue -- in fact, it is a human rights issue. Currently, two million of the estimated 11.5 million undocumented immigrants in our country come from Asia. Under your administration, 250,000 undocumented Asian/Pacific Islander immigrants have been deported. While we only make up five percent of the country, we are disproportionately impacted by your immigration policies.

Last week, I was formally invited by White House staff to hear your remarks on immigration reform in San Francisco. As I stood in the stands behind you, I was hoping to hear about your plan to address the lives of 11 million undocumented people living in this country, like my family. And while you expressed your support for comprehensive immigration reform, you did not address how an average of 1,100 immigrants are deported every single day under your administration. You did not address how you deported 205,000 parents of U.S. citizens in the last two years. You did not address how, because of your administration's record number of deportations--nearly two million immigrants in five years, a record--families are being torn apart: spouses are being separated from each other, parents are being separated from their children, and our brothers and sisters are being separated from one another. You did not to address how your administration would end the anti-immigration deportation programs like ""Secure Communities."" You've deported more people than any other president in the U.S. history.

Interestingly, you talked about Angel Island during your speech. What you did not mention, however, is that more people are detained every single day in detention today than were detained yearly at Angel Island. You recognized Angel Island as a dark period in Chinatown's history, but you failed to recognize that more Asians and Pacific Islanders are in detention today than were in detention under the Chinese Exclusion Act. In fact, your administration detains up to 34,000 people per day, a record number of detainees in U.S. history.

Because you failed to address these issues, I was compelled to address the concerns of our community.

You claim that the President of the United States has no authority to stop the deportations. And yet, in June 2012, before the 2012 election, which you won with the help of Latino and Asian voters, you implemented Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. With the stroke of a pen, you dramatically changed the lives of hundreds of thousands of young people like me who can now live without the daily threat of deportation, and can legally work in this country for the first time in our lives.

I know that you support comprehensive immigration reform. But I also know that you have the power to stop the deportations, and that you have the power to stop the suffering, fear, and intimidation facing millions of immigrants like my family.

Your fellow American,

http://news.yahoo.com/voices-opposing-immigration-law-muted-august-070346071.html,,[],Voices opposing immigration law muted this August,"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — It was the kickoff of a ""Stop Amnesty Tour"" organized by the Tea Party Patriots and other groups. But the crowd was so sparse that immigrant advocates were soon gleefully circulating photos of the featured speaker, Republican Rep. Steve King of Iowa, standing alone on an empty stage.

The rally at a public park in Richmond, Va., earlier this month, along with the subsequent cancellation or postponement of several similar events, points to an emerging reality during Congress' five-week summer recess: Opposition to overhauling immigration laws appears notably muted, almost tame. Meanwhile, advocates who support comprehensive overhaul legislation are claiming they've changed at least a handful of minds among House Republicans.

During Congress' last attempt to remake the immigration system, in 2007, public backlash helped kill the bill as angry calls overwhelmed the Senate switchboard. This summer, other issues, notably President Barack Obama's health care law, seem to be topping the list of voters' concerns.

Constituents opposed to citizenship for immigrants in this country illegally are loudly voicing their views at Republican House members' town hall meetings this month. But advocates of immigration legislation that offers a path to citizenship are having some success getting their supporters to show up, too, even in heavily Republican districts.

""In a sort of immediate sense, Obamacare is what the party has decided they want to make a big deal of in these town halls, so that's frankly siphoning off a lot of outrage because the people ticked off about Obamacare are the same people ticked off about amnesty,"" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which opposes higher immigration levels.

Plus, the pro-immigration reform side is better organized and funded this time around and many establishment Republicans are on board. ""All of that put together means you're not going to see the same level of frantic activity,"" Krikorian said.

Story continues

What's less clear is how much it will matter once lawmakers return to Washington in September.

Immigration overhaul legislation, a top second-term priority for Obama, is in limbo after the Democratic-led Senate in June passed a far-reaching bill that includes tens of billions of dollars for border security, new visa programs to bring more high- and low-skilled workers to the country, requirements for employers to check all workers' legal status, and a 13-year path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants already in the country illegally.

GOP House leaders have rejected that approach, vowing instead to proceed with bills addressing individual immigration issues, beginning with border security. And although by advocates' count more than 20 House Republicans have now declared their support for some kind of citizenship path, the majority of House Republicans remain opposed, creating a potentially unbridgeable divide between the House and the Senate. Congress also faces looming deadlines on the debt ceiling and spending bills to keep the government running. It all adds up to a tough environment for getting an immigration bill to Obama's desk.

Nonetheless, pro-immigrant advocates are claiming success in their August recess efforts to pressure House Republicans to act on immigration in the fall. An unusual and deep-pocketed alliance of Catholics and evangelicals, labor unions, business groups and others have been targeting dozens of GOP members viewed as open to hearing them out, and say they'll have momentum on their side when Congress reconvenes.

""The big story I think of the August recess is that we haven't seen what some had predicted, this major anti-immigrant movement where members of Congress would be heckled into inaction,"" Galen Carey, vice president of government relations at the National Association of Evangelicals, said on a media call this week to announce a $400,000, 14-state radio ad campaign in support of immigration reform. ""We've seen very much that that has been a muted voice, but actually the pro-immigrant voice has been rather prominent at many of the town halls that we have observed.""

Although there have been no giant public rallies to draw national attention, pro-immigrant advocates have kept up a drumbeat of activity nationwide. They sent some 1,500 supporters into House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy's Bakersfield, Calif., district last week; delivered a 10,000-signature petition to Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas; and launched a statewide tour through Wisconsin, among other activities.

They're pointing to comments in the past few weeks from a handful of House Republicans, including Reps. Daniel Webster of Florida, Aaron Schock of Illinois and Dave Reichert of Washington, indicating qualified support for eventual citizenship for immigrants here illegally. So far, though, such comments have not become too widespread, and it's uncertain they'll add up to a real impetus for action in the fall.

But immigrant activists who'd been concerned that this summer could be a repeat of the last immigration fight — or of 2009, when irate voters trashed Obama's health care bill at unruly town hall meetings across the country — are starting to breathe easy.

The Stop Amnesty Tour event Aug. 12 in Richmond was to have been followed by events in other states, several of which subsequently disappeared from the Tea Party Patriots' website, according to an archived version circulated by the pro-immigrant group America's Voice. Organizers said most were going forward or rescheduled and disputed the claim by America's Voice that events were being canceled due to lack of interest.

""I think that when I heard about what happened at the Richmond event, we just look at what can we do to improve going forward, and one thing would be to give people more than 72 hours' notice,"" said Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of Tea Party Patriots. The group is working on the events with others, including NumbersUSA, which advocates lower immigration levels.

The Black American Leadership Alliance, which opposes allowing more immigrants into the country to compete for jobs, canceled a series of rallies, according to cached copies of Facebook postings collected by America's Voice. But Leah Durant, the group's founder, said those events were being held by local groups and the Black American Leadership Alliance was just trying to help support them.

""When I look at the focus of what's going on, I wouldn't say that there's no enthusiasm,"" Durant said. ""I hear from people every day who say they are very concerned about this."""

On Sunday, Mr. Obama stood in that same tiny prison cell — now a monument to Mr. Mandela, South Africa’s first black president — and showed his wife and two daughters the place where Mr. Mandela spent 18 of his 27 years behind bars during his long campaign to end his country’s policies of racial apartheid and oppression.

Later, Mr. Obama again invoked the legacy of Mr. Mandela, 94, who remained in critical condition at a Pretoria, South Africa, hospital, during a speech to the African people he delivered from the University of Cape Town.

In the speech, he called Mr. Mandela the ultimate testament to the process of peaceful change and said his daughters better understood his legacy now. “Seeing them stand within the walls that once surrounded Nelson Mandela, I knew this was an experience they would never forget,” Mr. Obama said."

Remember reading that England had arrested a guy for anti-Muslim Twitter postings in the aftermath of the Woolrich slaughter? And remember thinking, “Well, this is America, that can’t happen here”?

Oh yes it can. Obama’s Attorney for the Eastern district of Tennessee wants you to know that if you say something untoward about Muslims, the Federal government may imprison you.

Killian and Moore will provide input on how civil rights can be violated by those who post inflammatory documents targeted at Muslims on social media….Killian said Internet postings that violate civil rights are subject to federal jurisdiction.

The posting he offers as a “for instance” is an egregious one. And yet this country has long protected, absolutely, egregious speech, such as hardcore pornography, for a simple reason: Either you are at liberty to say what you will or you are not. If you are constantly double-thinking every word you might say, for fear of being prosecuted, you are self-censoring, in anticipation of a possible prosecution by the government.

Rather than having a system in which people were constantly worried about imprisonment for speech, our country has evolved a simple bright-line code: Speech of all kinds, with a few exceptions that can be counted on three fingers, is absolutely protected.

Remember, the importance of this bright-line, no-exceptions rule of free speech was preached to us, even when some of us might not have liked it so much, as when hardcore pornography was afforded absolute protection under the First Amendment. In the case of hardcore pornography, it was argued — successfully — that having each artist weigh the possibility of an obscenity prosecution was too much of a burden on his free speech rights, and would have, unavoidably, a chilling effect on speech.

That was the rule then, and that was the rationale.

But now comes the Obama Administration to tell you that Yes, you just might be imprisoned for something you say online, so you’d better Watch What You Say.

Remember when Ari Fleischer said that, without suggesting any kind of legal penalties? Remember how the media freaked out?

But now comes the US Attorney for the Eastern district of Tennessee explicitly telling you that you may be imprisoned if a political appointee decides your political speech has crossed a line.

Somehow, I don’t think Tim Robbins will be portentously howling us that a “chill wind” is blowing across our rights of free expression this week."

Is Not ‘Surprising’ Enough to Cover,"Many Times readers have been writing to me for several days about a story The Guardian broke last week, describing how the United States routinely shares with Israel intelligence information that the National Security Agency gathers on American citizens.

The story was published five days ago, and by late last week I was already hearing from dozens of readers. One of them was Phyllida Paterson, of Silver Spring, Md., who wrote:

48 hours and there is still nothing in The Times about how the N.S.A. shares U.S. citizens’ raw communications data with Israel. This explosive story ought to be front-page news. Word is spreading and The Times is losing credibility by the hour. Friends of mine who never before believed that newspapers suppressed news are shocked by the evidence before them. Do you really want to push more readers into the arms of The Guardian?

After a weekend in which no mention was made in The Times of the article, I asked the managing editor, Dean Baquet, about it on Monday morning.

He told me that The Times had chosen not to follow the story because its level of significance did not demand it.

“I didn’t think it was a significant or surprising story,” he said. “I think the more energy we put into chasing the small ones, the less time we have to break our own. Not to mention cover the turmoil in Syria.”

So, I asked him, by e-mail, was this essentially a question of reporting resources? After all, The Times could have published an article written by a wire service, like Reuters or The Associated Press.

“I’d say resources and news judgment,” he responded.

In a world with many news outlets, he said: “We can spend all our time matching stories, and not actually covering the news. This one was modest and didn’t feel worth taking someone off greater enterprise.”

The Times has been working on “enterprise” – that is, journalism that it produces itself, usually through investigative digging or other deep reporting – with The Guardian and ProPublica based on leaked information from the N.S.A. Many of the articles in recent months have been broken by The Guardian and The Washington Post, after the former N.S.A. contractor Edward J. Snowden’s leaking of the information.

The Times published the first of the articles in that collaboration this month, and there is more to come. I’ve written about this several times, most recently saying that it was good to see The Times getting more fully involved in developing these extraordinary revelations and resisting government requests to withhold the story.

I disagree, however, with Mr. Baquet’s conclusion on this one. I find it to be a significant development and something that Times readers should not have to chase around the Web to find out about. They should be able to read it in The Times."

A total of 295,822 tests have been conducted, including 1,339 on Sunday. UNB residence elevator eyed as possible source Public Health is investigating whether an elevator could be the source of transmission in the University of New Brunswick's Fredericton campus residence COVID-19 outbreak that still stands at 12 positive cases, as of Monday. Last week, Public Health and UNB looked into the ventilation system at Magee House and determined ""the risk is minimal,"" said Department of Health spokesperson Bruce Macfarlane. ""Public Health officials are now focusing their efforts to determine surface contacts within the elevator as the potential source of transmission,"" he said in an email. UNB's Magee House residence has about 180 adults and children living in the 101 apartment-style units, according to resident Martin Kutnowski.(Ed Hunter/CBC) According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, COVID-19 spreads from an infected person to others through respiratory droplets and aerosols (smaller droplets) created when an infected person talks, sings, shouts, coughs or sneezes. COVID-19 can also spread by touching something that has the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes with unwashed hands, the agency's website states. The outbreak at Magee House involves the variant first reported in India, which has two mutations that make it ""more concerning than all the others,"" Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Jennifer Russell has said. It is ""very, very, very aggressive in terms of being contagious and causing more severe symptoms."" Magee House is a seven-storey apartment-style residence designed for mature students, some of whom have families. The residents remain in isolation as Public Health deals with the outbreak. Paul Mazerolle, president and vice-chancellor of the University of New Brunswick, says isolation needs to happen at Magee House to prevent the spread of COVID-19.(Ed Hunter/CBC) Meanwhile, the UNB campus reopened Monday, as did the adjacent St Thomas University campus and nearby New Brunswick Community College campus, more than a week after they moved to essential services only in response to the outbreak. Faculty, staff and students can now go on campus as long as they follow relevant operational guidelines. ""COVID is difficult,"" said Paul Mazerolle, president of the University of New Brunswick. ""The uncertainty creates concern and we're not through this."" Monday marks day nine of the Magee House lockdown, and a third round of mass testing was scheduled for residents and staff on Sunday. As of Monday afternoon, Public Health was still awaiting the results. Alex Hill-Stosky, who lives with his family in Magee House, said many people in the building are either anxious or angry because of the lockdown. ""A lot of people feel we are test subjects rather than people,"" said the engineering student. Residents of Magee House at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton are in quarantine after at least 12 people tested positive for COVID-19. (Maria Jose Burgos/CBC) Mazerolle said he understands people are concerned and worried about their personal freedoms, but it's important to limit the spread of the virus. ""To minimize the potential spread, unfortunately people's movements need to be restricted for a limited period of time. … If we didn't restrict movement, we could be in a much worse situation."" Students have also expressed concerns over the residence's ventilation system. Mazerolle said the ventilation system has been checked twice and deemed safe by engineers with Public Health and the Department of Environment. ""From what I've been told by the experts, there's no evidence to suggest that the ventilation system is putting people at risk for COVID-19. Mazerolle expects Magee House to reopen on Saturday. ""We're looking forward to this coming to an end,"" he said. Public Health said the isolation period for Magee House individuals who have tested negative throughout the process could end Saturday. Meanwhile, the isolation for residents and staff of UNB's Elizabeth Parr-Johnston residence could be lifted as early as Wednesday, depending on the results of retests taking place Monday, said Public Health. So far, all test results have been negative. George Street Middle School reopens George Street Middle School in Fredericton reopened Monday, six days after students, staff and their families were urged by Public Health to self-isolate last week following a confirmed case of COVID-19. In a letter to parents on Sunday, Public Health said students and staff can return to school, and their families can return to work, with the exception of those who have been told by Public Health to self-isolate for 14 days. New Brunswick Public Health confirmed a case of COVID-19 at George Street Middle School in Fredericton last week.(Elizabeth Fraser/CBC) ""Custodial services have been through the school disinfecting high touch areas,"" said Dr. Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health.

Indeed, a country's long-term prosperity is best guaranteed by upholding the fundamental freedom of assembly, a freedom ""crucial to any healthy democracy.""

Unfortunately, as we've seen all too often during the past several years, particularly with regard to Occupy Wall Street, this freedom in America has been viewed as anything but absolute, and it could be rightfully argued that this right has been viewed as anything but crucial as well.

After all, this is a country with increasingly militarized police forces in which local cops are being armed with weapons suitable for the battlefield.

This is a country in which large gatherings of peaceful protesters, from Occupy Wall Street to Stop and Frisk marches, are increasingly being met with police responses that often look like this:

If we are to rebuke other nations for cracking down on protesters gathering to air their grievances in public, it is first necessary to remind ourselves just how ""crucial"" that right to do so actually is. How fundamental a right the freedom to assemble has been in shaping the character of our nation.

It is first necessary to re-examine the way in which we have been muting, with force, the voices of many in our own country who gather to protest before rebuking others.

Otherwise, to engage in such international rebukes is to engage in self-parody.

(CNN) —

On Monday, President Barack Obama’s two secretaries of state inadvertently collaborated with Russia’s foreign minister to shape a twist in the Syria debate that a day later is looking more and more like a possible way out of the current crisis.

It took an idea from being an off-the-cuff throwaway line through being an informal proposal to the point today where it will be proposed for consideration by the United Nations. Perhaps more importantly for the President, it may help save him from a political showdown in Congress where it seems increasingly likely he cannot win while adding a glimmer of hope to a story that for two weeks has been an unrelenting mess for the White House and of deep concern to the American people.

The first move came from the current secretary of state, John Kerry. In a statement that was initially seen as a slip of the tongue (probably because it was), Kerry raised the possibility that if Syria were to give up its chemical weapons, an attack might be avoided. Although the administration almost immediately backed away from the statement and the British foreign secretary characterized it as impossible, the idea quickly began to gain traction.

David Rothkopf

Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem announced that his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov had proposed that Syria’s chemical weapons be put under some form of international control as a way of forestalling a U.S.-led attack. Moallem went further, welcoming the initiative.

It turned out Kerry had spoken to Lavrov. And while Washington’s first response was natural skepticism given the misrepresentations of the Syrian government in the past, it became clear that if there was any chance such an initiative could spare the president the political debacle of a failed vote in the Congress – and possibly spare the country the costs of another military intervention in the region – some in the administration felt it was worth considering.

So, hours after a senior official had told CNN the Kerry statement was a “major goof,” the press office in the White House was claiming credit suggesting that the “credible threat” of a U.S. plan had triggered the diplomatic opening.

Next up, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who had already been teed up to offer a statement of support for her former boss/potential predecessor, made a brief statement that had to have been carefully cleared with the White House.

She called the idea that Syria might give up its chemical weapons an “important step” if the Russians and the Syrians actively followed up on it. This was yet another sign that the administration was hoping that the morning’s seeming misstep yield an opportunity to step away from a congressional showdown or at least buy some breathing room.

Further, while Clinton did not address the specifics of Obama’s proposed Syria intervention, she did say that she would support him.

Up until now, her silence on the issue was seen by some as an effort by the likely presidential candidate to distance herself from the Obama team’s muddled handling of the proposed Syria intervention. But Monday’s message not only showed her political loyalty to the president but it also emphasized the outsized influence of her views in America and around the globe.

In the wake of her remarks, there were initially reports that other nations, such as France, would welcome giving the Russian initiative a chance. The President framed it as a “potentially positive development.” Then on Tuesday, the Syrian government formally accepted the Russian proposal. The U.S. and France took the plan to the United Nations to give it the formal backing and oversight of that institution. It is still clearly a long way from being realized but there is momentum.

Nonetheless, even should it blow up, appearing to consider it allows Obama to be able to say he had exhausted all diplomatic options to resolve the problem. And for the more the hawkishly inclined, it would also be seen as reminder that military pressure is often key to producing peaceful, political outcomes.

Either way, for a moment, an idea that might ultimately seem to be in the interest of Obama, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and, arguably, the Syrian Opposition (to the extent they no longer might face chemical weapons) gained surprising traction. This was thanks in part to the seeming misstep of America’s current top diplomat, to his swift interaction with his Russian counterpart, and the added weight his predecessor’s views brought to the matter.

It is a long-shot proposal started perhaps by accident, promoted by parties who have regularly lied, and cautiously embraced by a U.S. administration whose policies in Syria have been incoherent by any measure. Regardless of whether it amounts to anything or not, it speaks volumes about how bad our options are.

He Previously Covered South Asia Mumbai', 'India', 'National Security The Washington Bureau.']",U.S. toll for Syria higher than others’,"The death toll given by the Obama administration for an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack is far higher than confirmed counts of two key allies and a main activist group, which said it was shocked by the U.S. figure.

In pressing Congress to authorize a military strike against Syria, the administration has asserted that the government of President Bashar Assad killed 1,429 people, including at least 426 children, in an Aug. 21 attack on the suburbs of Damascus.

But Britain and France have cited far lower numbers of confirmed deaths, raising questions about the intelligence the White House is using to make its case to launch missile strikes against Syria.

U.S. officials say they can’t disclose how they derived their figure without compromising intelligence, but they say it is based on a variety of sources and they stand by it.

British intelligence organizations said last week that they believed at least 350 people had been killed. French intelligence said Monday that it had confirmed at least 281 deaths through open-source videos, although its experts had created models that were consistent with as many as 1,500 deaths.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, generally regarded as one of the most reliable sources of information on casualty figures in Syria, says it has confirmed 502 deaths, including 80 children and 137 women. Rami Abdul-Rahman, a Syrian expatriate who runs the organization from his home in Britain, said he was shocked by the White House’s count.

“I don’t know where this number came from,” Abdul-Rahman said in a phone interview.

He said some Syrian opposition groups disseminate propaganda and exaggerated death tolls in an attempt to sway American politicians.

“The U.S. took this high number from one part of the Syrian opposition that is supported by the U.S. government,” Abdul-Rahman said. “We don’t trust them.”

U.S. intelligence officials said they didn’t base their assessment on reports from any single opposition group.

Adding to the confusion, a day after Secretary of State John F. Kerry said that “the United States government now knows that at least 1,429 Syrians were killed in this attack,” President Obama on Saturday only referred to “well over 1,000"" fatalities.

Kerry didn’t cite any casualty figures in his testimony Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. And according to an official familiar with a formal intelligence assessment sent to Congress, the document did not include those figures.

The casualty figures are important because the administration is resting its case for military action in part on the scale of the attack. A senior administration official said a previous use of chemical weapons by Assad’s military caused “100 to 150"" casualties, which prompted the Obama administration to offer lethal aid to Syrian rebels, but not to contemplate direct military action.

“This is a much larger scale of use,” the official said Friday. “It’s indiscriminate.”

U.S. intelligence officials said Tuesday that foreign intelligence agencies use different methods and resources and often arrive at different casualty counts. A British official in Washington said the British estimate was lower because it was released a few days before the American one.

Shawn Turner, a spokesman for the U.S. director of national intelligence, said, “The information that led to our understanding of the scale of the attack came from a number of sources, including international and Syrian medical personnel, videos, witness accounts and social media reports.

“We’ve said from the beginning that our estimates were preliminary and that we expect to update the number as we obtain more information,” he said.

A senior administration official, who would not be quoted by name discussing classified intelligence, said that Obama was not signaling any retreat from the higher figure and that officials believed the death toll could even go beyond 1,429.

A second official said, “The president has no intelligence reason to walk back from that number.”

The precision of the U.S. figure, given the initial confusion surrounding the attack and the often contradictory reports of the violence in Syria, also raised questions among some observers.

Anthony Cordesman, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote Monday that the U.S. estimate was “absurdly over-precise” and that Obama’s language created “a mix of contradictions over the most basic facts.”

Syria’s political and military opposition is severely fragmented. The U.S. figure more closely matches reports by pro-opposition organizations such as the Local Coordination Committees and the United Revolutionary Medical Office in eastern Ghouta, a Damascus suburb hit by the alleged chemical attack.

The latter group said it had documented at least 1,302 deaths, about two-thirds of which were women and children. That figure was cited by the U.S.-based Syrian Support Group, which has a federal license to funnel aid to Syrian rebels.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/857401.stm,2000-07-29 18:35:01,[],Immigration bond scheme scrapped,"An immigration bond scheme which would have forced certain visitors entering Britain to hand over about £3,000 has been dropped by the government.

The government has decided not to press ahead with the returnable deposit scheme after it stirred angry reaction among anti-racist and immigration support groups.

A pilot study of the proposals, aimed at people from some Asian and African countries whose visa applications might be considered borderline, was due to be introduced in the autumn.

Foreign Office Minister Keith Vaz confirmed on Saturday that the programme had been dropped for good.

Racist threat

Ministers have been hinting the scheme would be shelved since it sparked outrage from immigration campaigners and the General Secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union, Bill Morris.

In April Mr Morris said the scheme could encourage racists.

On Saturday he told BBC News Online the union welcomed the decision to drop the scheme.

""I'm delighted that people seeking to come to the UK will be judged on merit of their application rather than the size of their wallet,"" he said.

Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Simon Hughes added: ""The idea of bonds as a surety for visitors from some countries was clearly discriminatory.

""When will the government learn that what we need are sensible policies, not tough-sounding but half-baked ideas?""

First step

Mr Morris said the T&G would keep up pressure on the government to drop the ""iniquitous"" voucher system for asylum seekers.

Under the scheme, asylum seekers are given vouchers instead of cash to do their weekly shopping, which campaigners say is degrading.

They mounted protests outside supermarkets around England and Wales on Saturday, calling on retailers to pull out of the scheme.

""We believe the government should take the next step and abolish it,"" he said.

The National Assembly Against Racism and Indian Workers' Association Great Britain have also campaigned against the scheme and previous moves to charge up to £10,000 for relatives from the Indian sub-continent visiting residents in Britain.

The groups said the impact of the bond scheme could cause severe financial hardship for black families who are already over-represented among the poorest in Britain."

The Human Rights Watch organization urged that country’s government on Monday to reject a proposed law providing for adulterers to be stoned to death.

“It is absolutely shocking that 12 years after the fall of the Taliban government, the Karzai administration might bring back stoning as a punishment,” said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. Afghan President Hamid Karzai ""needs to demonstrate at least a basic commitment to human rights and reject this proposal out of hand.”

The Islamist Taliban militia that governed Afghanistan from 1996 until U.S.-led forces toppled its government in late 2001 used to put convicted adulterers to death by shooting them or stoning them.

A Justice Ministry-led working group is calling for a return to stoning adulterers “if there are four eyewitnesses,” Reuters reported Monday.

The Guardian newspaper reported that another punishment being considered was flogging.

Human Rights Watch urged international donors to use what leverage they have to convince Karzai to reject the proposal.

The group said the draft proposal metes out harsh punishments to men and women who have sex outside of marriage.

They face “stoning to death if the adulterer or adulteress is married,” and the punishment will be carried out in public in a predetermined location, HRW quoted the draft as saying.

What if they’re unmarried? Then they face “whipping 100 lashes.”

Human Rights Watch’s appeal came as President Barack Obama’s national security adviser, Susan Rice, was in Afghanistan to assess the situation there ahead of the planned pullout of U.S.-led combat troops by the end of next year.

“On behalf of President Obama, she is thanking the men and women who are away from their families this Thanksgiving and serving in harm’s way,” the White House said in a statement.

“She will hear directly from U.S. troops, diplomats, and development professionals about our efforts as we move toward the responsible conclusion of our combat mission at the end of 2014 and as we continue to strengthen Afghanistan to ensure that it can provide security, governance, and opportunity for its people,” the White House said."

The “Elder of Ziyon” blog has compiled a list of those to be released–and their victims. Here is a sample:

Atiyeh Salem Musa: killed Isaac (Aizek) Rotenberg, 67, Holocaust survivor, 1994 Isaac Rotenberg was born to Natan and Miriam Rotenberg in Poland on 15 March 1927. A selektzia was held in his city following the outbreak of the Second World War, and his family was sent to the Sobibór extermination camp. With the exception of him, his younger brother, and his sister, his entire family perished. He was taken with his brother to a labor camp. When a revolt broke out, the two succeeded in escaping the camp, but they lost track of each other in the ensuing commotion. Isaac then made his way to the forest and joined the partisans. In April 1947, Isaac reached the Land of Israel. He joined the IDF the next year, and fought in the War of Liberation in the north, near Kibbutz Manara. Isaac was married to Riva, and they had two children, Tzipora and Pinhas. He worked as a plasterer, and was a founder of the city of Holon. Upon reaching retirement age, he decided to continue working a few hours per day to keep himself busy. On 29 March 1994, during the Passover holiday, as Isaac was hunched on his knees, fixing a floor in his workplace in Petah Tikva, two of the Arab laborers on site attacked him and struck the back of his neck with axes. He was critically wounded, and entered a coma. Two days later, on 31 March, he died.

Hosni Faregh Sawalha–murder of Baruch Heisler, 24, 1990 On 2 December 1990, Yaacov missed his ride to his yeshiva [religious seminary] and instead boarded bus 66 from Petah Tikva to Tel Aviv. Three Arab terrorists boarded at the Pardes Katz stop, and immediately thereafter, at the junction of Ben Gurion Road and Jabotinsky Road in Ramat Gan, began stabbing passengers. Baruch Yaacov was murdered; three others were injured.

Esmat Omar Mansour–accessory to murder of Haim Mizrahi, 1993 Hayim Mizrahi was born to Mazal and Pinhas Mizrahi on 8 December 1963. He grew up in Bat Yam and Holon with his sisters, Margalit and Asnat, and his brother, Itzik. As a child, Hayim belonged to the junior league soccer team of Hapoel Tel Aviv. Following is army service, he became religious, moved to Beit El, and married Iris. On Friday, 29 October 1993, Hayim went to buy eggs from an Arab-owned farm near his home, as he was wont to do. He was greeted by terrorists who attacked him and fled in his vehicle after wounding him and stuffing him into the trunk. The terrorists proceeded to murder Hayim, then burned and abandoned the vehicle north of Ramallah. Hayim was 30 at the time of his death. He was put to rest in Holon Cemetery. Hayim was survived by his pregnant wife, his parents, his sisters, and his brother. Half-a-year after his murder, his daughter, Tehilla, was born.



Obama and Kerry insisted on the release of the terrorists and murderers, and Israel–fearful of losing U.S. support at the UN and against Iran–complied. That is the heavy price demanded by an administration that prides itself as tough on terrorists–while arming them and Syria and releasing them in Israel.

Associated Press

The life of the girl and the fetus are at high risk

Abortions for medical reasons have been outlawed since the 1973 military coup

The Chilean Senate rejected three bills last year that would have eased the total ban on abortions

SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — The case of a pregnant 11-year old girl who was raped in Chile by her mother's partner has set off a national debate about abortion in one of the most socially-conservative countries in Latin America.

Chileans were outraged on Friday after state TV reported that the girl is 14 weeks pregnant and was raped repeatedly over two years. Police in the remote southern city of Puerto Montt arrested her mother's partner, who confessed to abusing the fifth grader. The case was brought to their attention by the pregnant child's maternal grandmother.

Doctors say the girl's life and that of the fetus are at high risk. But in Chile, ending the pregnancy is not an option.

Chile allowed abortions for medical reasons until they were outlawed in 1973 by Gen. Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship. The current government of conservative President Sebastian Pinera has opposed any loosening of the prohibition.

Many Chileans were venting outrage on social media Friday. Some started an online campaign to demand legalization of abortion in cases of rape or health risks for the mother.

""When I heard about this little girl my first reaction was to support abortion because I think it's the best option in this case,"" said Eduardo Hernandez, a 30-year-old web designer.

""It's the first online petition I've signed in my life, but I think this case really deserves it,"" Hernandez said. ""We should have a law. I hope this case serves as precedent to have a serious discussion about abortion.""

The Chilean Senate rejected three bills last year that would have eased the absolute ban on abortions.

One of the bills would have permitted abortion if two doctors said it was needed because of risks to a mother's life or other medical reasons, such as a fetus with low chances of survival. Another one of the measures that was rejected would have allowed abortion in the event of rape.

Forty years after a brutal dictatorship, Chile remains firmly conservative in social matters. It legalized divorce in 2004, becoming one of the last nations in the world to grant married couples that right.

""Chile is a country that has modernized when it comes to its economy, but when it comes to its social and political culture, it has become stagnant and this is seen with the abortion issue,"" said Marta Lagos, head of the Santiago-based pollster Mori.

""It's a country that is adverse to change, that panics with any change, which is seen as a threat,"" Lagos said. ""The weight of Catholicism is still a major issue and we also have a millenary indigenous culture that always lived alienated from the rest of world. We're part of that millenary culture of isolation.""

The Roman Catholic Church retains a strong influence over society, although it has lost credibility since 2010, when four men alleged that they were abused by one of Chile's most revered priests when they were between 14 and 17 years old.

Pinera announced measures last year to combat child abuse, responding to a popular outcry over a spike in reports of these crimes. He toughened penalties on convicted pedophiles, increased the forensic institute's budget and created a children's ombudsman to protect their rights.

His center-right government also banned convicted pedophiles from working near children under a law that also requires those convicted of sexually abusing minors to be registered in a database. Reports of sexual abuse of children under the age of 14 rose by 22 percent in the first half of 2012.

But change comes slowly in Chile. An anti-discrimination law was stuck in Congress for seven years and only passed in 2012 after the killing of a gay man who was beaten by attackers who carved swastikas into his body.

""The Chilean elite is very conservative and this has had an influence in Congress,"" said Patricio Navia, a Chilean political scientist who teaches at New York University. ""Laws, therefore, change at a much slower pace than the rest of Chilean society. Because society is much less conservative than it was 15 or 20 years ago.""

Former president Michelle Bachelet, the frontrunner in the Nov. 17 presidential elections, favors legalizing abortion in cases of rape or risks to the health of the mother or the child. She spent the past several years heading the U.N. agency for women.

Her opponent, former Economy Minister Pablo Longueira, was close to Pinochet. He opposes abortion and the so-called day-after pill.

Daniel Alvarado, a prosecutor for the public ministry, told state TV that the case of the pregnant 11-year-old would be treated as a rape in any circumstance because at that age a person ""doesn't have maturity to consent to a sexual relationship within law.""

""It's not possible for any person at that age to have the capacity to understand the consequences on an act of that nature,"" Alvarado added.

In Latin America, only Cuba, Uruguay and some local governments make early abortions accessible to all women.

Uruguay recently passed a law authorizing elective abortions in the first three months of pregnancy in the most liberal law of its kind in Latin America. Passage of the law was widely seen as a landmark for a region in which many countries outlaw abortion in all circumstances."

Rochester (N.Y.) Democrat and Chronicle

Metals%2C chemicals%2C human waste were burned

Suit against contractor KBR on appeal

Department of Veterans Affairs setting up the registry of those exposed

ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- Timothy Lowery went to Iraq in 2007. He came home in 2010, and started showing symptoms of ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Three years later, he was dead.

This is the extent of what his family knows for certain.

But they have strong suspicions that daily exposure to burn pits — the massive, open-air ditches where the military dumped its waste and lit it ablaze — contributed to his condition.

Lowery, a plumber with one of the U.S. military's largest contractors, KBR, walked by the pits daily as he installed piping, painted runways, and otherwise worked to help keep Al Asad Airbase running. Every day, he breathed in air filled with the smoke of burning metals, chemicals, and human waste.

Across the country, other families are worried, too. Thousands of returning veterans and civilians are now attributing myriad symptoms — respiratory problems, neurological disorders, cancers and ALS — to exposure to the burn pits, which were located at dozens of bases throughout Iraq and Afghanistan.

""A lot of us got really sick from upper respiratory stuff,"" said Stacy Fogarty, an Air Force veteran who came home from Iraq with asthma and other breathing problems. ""They're doing the research right now, but my personal prediction is it's going to be like Agent Orange for this era. We just don't really know what the ramifications are yet.""

Many are trying to get the military to cover their medical costs. Others are suing KBR, which operated some of the burn pits, accusing them of dumping into them all manner of unapproved items — tires, oil, chemicals and medical waste.

For the Lowerys, the controversy has brought a fresh edge to their pain. Now, they're not sure whether his death was bad luck, or whether he spent his years overseas being slowly, steadily poisoned.

Agonizing death

Contracting ALS is, quite simply, a horrible way to die.

Over the course of months or years, the body starts to shut down one piece at a time. Motor functions are impaired and then lost. Speech gets more challenging. And eventually, the lungs give out.

It's almost always fatal; most people die in the first few years, and greater than 90 percent die within 10 years.

But the cruelest part, said Timothy Lowery's son Dylan, is that the disease leaves the brain almost completely untouched.

""All the while, you're totally of sound mind,"" said Dylan Lowery, 20, of Rochester. ""You know your surroundings. You know what's happening. ... It's just degrading.""

For Timothy Lowery, the first symptoms came when he returned to his home in Georgia in late 2010. His girlfriend and future wife Kate Lowery noticed that he had tremors in his arm, and when he tried to go back to work as a plumber in July 2011 he came home saying that he was too weak and that he wasn't capable of doing the job any more.

""I've never seen him cry before as the way he did then,"" said Kate Lowery, 49, of Hampton, Ga.

Lowery, who had lived for much of his life in Dansville, came back to the Rochester area in January 2012, hoping to find a job that he could handle. Upon arriving, family members noticed him slurring his speech.

Soon, Lowery started dragging his foot when he walked. He had trouble turning the ignition in his car. He steadfastly refused to go to a doctor. But in July 2012, his condition worsening, his sisters forced him into a car and drove him to Strong Memorial Hospital. His diagnosis came shortly afterward.

In his final months, his family started asking questions about his time overseas. The burn pits, which on Al Asad Airbase were operated by the military, were almost always active, he said. His work — 13 hours a day, every day, always outdoors — took him to every area of the base, and he walked by the burn pits regularly.

Dust and sand from the surrounding climate would mix with the smoke from the pits. The mixture was in the air all the time, and Lowery often wore goggles to keep it out of his eyes.

In October 2012, with his faculties starting to fail him completely, he moved back to Georgia to be with Kate. They got married in February, just one month before his death. He was 51 years old.

'Anything and everything'

Only one study has been done on the long-term health effects of burn pits. The study, conducted by the Institute of Medicine in 2011, could not draw any concrete conclusions about the adverse effects.

Meanwhile, returning veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars have continued to assert that burn pits were the cause of their problems.

Fogarty, 27, of Greece, N.Y., served in the Air Force at Joint Base Balad in Iraq, and was responsible for dumping hospital supplies into burn pits on the base. Fogarty said that material that was considered a biohazard was disposed of elsewhere, but that everything else went into the pits, which were burning constantly.

""Whatever we had to get rid of, we burned: beds and trash, used supplies,"" said Fogarty. ""Anything and everything: there were (airplane) parts in there.""

Earlier this year, after an audit that blasted burn pit operations at Camp Leatherneck in Afghanistan by the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, lawmakers moved to establish a registry for service members and veterans who were exposed to potentially toxic fumes from the pits in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Department of Veterans Affairs is currently setting up the registry.

The lawsuits, meanwhile, have targeted KBR because the company was responsible for waste disposal and burn pit operation on about a third of the military's bases.

Fifty-seven of those suits — 44 class-actions and 13 individual suits, representing several hundred people and families — were combined into a single case in Maryland. In the suit, plaintiffs accuse KBR of negligent operation of the burn pits: using them to dispose of hazardous waste and items on ""do not burn"" lists, failing to take steps to minimize smoke from the pits, and using the pits instead of incinerators, among other allegations.

One potential witness, Rick Lamberth, a former KBR employee, testified to Congress in 2009 that he personally witnessed KBR employees dump chemical decontamination materials, biomedical waste, plastics, oil, and tires into burn pits in violation of military regulations.

Lamberth, who served 31 years in the Army Reserve and spent time in Kuwait, Afghanistan and Iraq in military and civilian capacities, testified that he had suffered from shortness of breath and skin rashes, and had spit up bloody mucus since returning from Iraq.

He also alleged that KBR knew that the pits were dangerous, and that management attempted to cover up such information.

""When I tried to report violations, I was told by the head of KBR's Health Safety and Environment division to shut up and keep it to myself,"" said Lamberth in 2009. ""At one point, KBR management threatened to sue me for slander if I spoke out about these violations.""

In response to the allegations that unapproved material was disposed of in the KBR-operated burn pits, a spokesman for the company said those reports are anecdotal and cannot be supported by evidence.

""We've looked extensively at our records and we clearly don't have records that would substantiate that,"" said Mark Lowes, vice president of litigation for KBR Inc.

In a phone interview earlier this week, Lowes said that the military decided what was supposed to be disposed of in the burn pits, and was regularly monitoring KBR's operations.

""They would come in and evaluate our performance,"" said Lowes. ""If we were causing a huge problem, inconsistent with what they want, they'd be chewing on us and giving us poor evaluations for what we'd done.""

The class-action lawsuit against KBR was dismissed earlier this year. The judge ruled that KBR should be afforded the same legal protection as the military. (Soldiers cannot sue the armed forces for injuries sustained while on active duty.)

Attorneys for the plaintiffs have appealed the decision."

http://news.yahoo.com/myanmar-leader-making-landmark-white-house-visit-080232268.html,,[],Myanmar leader making landmark White House visit,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Former general Thein Sein on Monday becomes the first Myanmar president to be welcomed to the White House in almost 47 years, crowning a dramatic diplomatic rehabilitation for his nation after years of international isolation.

But activists are angry about President Barack Obama hosting Thein Sein, and lawmakers are wary. The Myanmar leader has led the shift from decades of direct military rule, but has stalled on some reform commitments and failed to stop bloody outbursts of ethnic violence.

Thein Sein previously served in a repressive junta, and his meetings at the White House and Congress would have been all-but-impossible before he took the helm of a nominally civilian government in 2011. His name was only deleted from a blacklist barring travel to the U.S. last September.

He arrived in Washington Saturday, six months after Obama made history with an unprecedented U.S. presidential visit to the country also known as Burma. The administration's outreach to Myanmar's generals has provided an important incentive for the military to loosen controls on citizens and reduce dependence on China.

Myanmar has been rewarded by relaxation of tough economic sanctions, and Thein Sein will be addressing American businessmen keen to capitalize on the opening of one of Asia's few untapped markets.

""President Thein Sein's visit underscores President Obama's commitment to supporting and assisting those governments that make the important decision to embrace reform,"" the White House said in its announcement of Monday's visit.

It will be the first by a Myanmar leader since a September 1966 visit by Ne Win, an independence hero-turned dictator, who began the nation's descent from regional rice bowl to economic basket case. Thein Sein visited New York last September for the U.N. General Assembly but didn't come to Washington.

The U.S. last month announced it is considering duty-free access for Myanmar to U.S. markets, and there could be progress Monday toward a bilateral trade and investment framework agreement.

Story continues

The most significant outcome of Thein Sein's trip could be a symbolic one. Obama is expected to use ""Myanmar"" — the country name adopted by the junta in 1989 — when he meets Thein Sein. However, the U.S. will keep using ""Burma"" in official documents.

Thein Sein will be accorded the protocol due to a foreign president, yet his Washington welcome will pale next to that granted last September to Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader who met Obama and was presented by Congress with the highest civilian award it can bestow.

Human rights activists and Myanmar campaigners have sharply criticized the administration for inviting Thein Sein, arguing it sends the wrong message and wastes leverage to press for further democratic change. The administration says it is important to signal U.S. support for his reform agenda, likely still opposed by military hardliners.

Thein Sein told the Washington Post in an interview Sunday that the military ""will always have a special place"" in government.

The military governed Myanmar for five decades and retains a quarter of parliamentary seats, giving it an effective veto over constitutional amendments — including changes that would be required to allow Suu Kyi to run for the presidency in crucial 2015 elections.

Outside the White House on Monday, about 30 activists opposing Thein Sein's visit protested corruption in the government and treatment of ethnic Kachins in a northern region blighted by fighting between army and rebel forces. ""We need real changes in Burma to stop the violations,"" said an organizer of the rally, Ye Htut of the International Foundation for Burma National Congress.

Ahead of Thein Sein's trip, Myanmar released at least 19 political prisoners in what has become a pattern for amnesties that coincide with high-profile international meetings as a way of highlighting the government's benevolent policies. Right groups say at least 160 political detainees are still held.

The government has permitted the International Committee of the Red Cross access to its notorious prisons for the first time in seven years. But hasn't allowed adequate humanitarian access to conflict zones where tens of thousands have been displaced. Authorities have failed to stop, and may have abetted in some cases, an explosion in communal violence that has killed hundreds and led to segregation of Muslim communities.

The U.S. State Department on Monday again designated Myanmar as a country of special concern for its severe violations of religious freedom, as it has since 1999 in an annual global assessment. It said the government promoted Buddhism, practiced by the majority, over minority faiths that include Islam.

The department said there were credible allegations of the involvement of local border security authorities in the burning of villages during the communal violence in western Rakhine State, and of Muslims being arbitrarily detained since June, and reportedly denied food, water, and sleep. Some deaths in custody were reported, the department said.

The U.S. Campaign for Burma said Thein Sein's trip follows a troubling downward trend in Myanmar, and that ""instead of honoring an abusive leader"" the U.S. should tie its concessions to conditions.

Thein Sein told the Post that allegations the Myanmar army condones or even participates in ethnic pogroms against the nation's Muslim minority were a ""pure fabrication.""

If you’re running for office, it’s best not to make incendiary comments about rape. That appears to be as much the case in Indonesia as it is in the United States.

Daming Sanusi, a candidate for the Indonesian Supreme Court, has fueled outrage in the predominantly Muslim country by suggesting that rape victims enjoy being violated.

He made the comments Monday in front of a parliamentary commission hearing to determine if he was a fit for the top court, according to the official Indonesian news agency Antara.

In response to a question about whether the death penalty should be applied in rape cases, Daming reportedly said, “Consideration needs to be taken thoroughly for the imposition of death penalty for a rapist because in a rape case both the rapist and the victim enjoy it.”

News of his comments quickly spread on social media, prompting anger, disgust and calls for Daming’s candidature for the Supreme Court to be shot down.

CNN iReport: Women of Indonesia

“We ask legislators not to give the judge position to Daming, as he had offended people`s feeling by uttering inappropriate statement,” Ridwan Bakar, a spokesman for the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation, said Tuesday.

As the furor grew, Daming issued an apology, acknowledging that his words were “out of control.”

In a news conference, he said that he was nervous in the session in front of the lawmakers and made the comment as a joke.

“I made the remark without realizing it can harm people’s feeling,” Antara cited him as saying.

Damage is done

But his contrition appeared to be too little too late.

“The damage has been done,” Primastuti Handayani, the managing editor of the Jakarta Post wrote in a commentary published Wednesday. “Nothing he said in his apology can heal the wound he caused.”

She also noted that Daming is not the first Indonesian official to make controversial comments about rape, highlighting the case last year of Jakarta Governor Fauzi Bowo, who said women should avoid wearing miniskirts on public transport to avoid “any unwanted consequences.”

Indonesian political figures began to distance themselves from Daming amid the outrage this week, and his chances of being selected as a Supreme Court justice seemed to wither.

Opinion: Why have men lost touch with reality over rape?

The chairman of the parliamentary commission, Gede Pasek Suardika, said that Daming’s remarks were inappropriate and that the public outcry against him would be taken into consideration. Members of the commission from the Prosperous Justice Party recommended against selecting him.

The controversy that sprung up around Daming mirrors outrage in the United States over remarks about rape made by Republicans Richard Mourdock and Todd Akin.

Once leading in the polls, Mourdock and Akin both lost their Senate races to Democrats in November after their comments on pregnancy and rape were widely circulated.

When asked on a local news show what he thought about abortion in the case of rape, Akin set off the controversy when he said, “First of all, from what I understand from doctors, that’s really rare. If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.”

Mourdock was participating in a televised debate when he said, “Life is that gift from God that I think even if life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen.”

And Rep. Phil Gingrey, Republican of Georgia, revived the furor last week when he commented on the cases of Mourdock and Akin, and reportedly suggested Akin was “partly right.”

Gingrey later said his words, reported by the Marietta Daily-Journal, had been misconstrued.

And, for a while, with Republicans freaked out by the ground they have lost among Latino voters, such legislation looked unstoppable. But now, not so much.

On Friday, the Republican National Committee passed a resolution calling on Congress to pass immigration reform, but the version of reform they want provides only renewable work permits, not a path to citizenship, for undocumented residents of the U.S.

That is not what Obama and the Democrats have called for, nor what Republican Sens. Marco Rubio and John McCain have been pushing, nor what was hammered out in a Senate bill by the bipartisan “Gang of Eight.”

All of them see a path to citizenship as a crucial element in the legislation. But the RNC’s position reflects the view of many Republicans, including many members of the House GOP, that no one should be rewarded for sneaking into the country, even if they happened to be babies when they were sneaked in and have now grown up to go to college or serve in the military.

Democrats and pro-reform Republicans, such as McCain and Rubio, hoped to soften the hard line against offering citizenship by promising that border security would be beefed up even more than it has been. This is despite plenty of evidence that one big reason so many undocumented people have taken up residence in the United States is because crossing the border with Mexico has become so difficult and perilous. Where once Mexican citizens came and went with the rhythm of seasonal work, now they stay because the border has been militarized.

Nevertheless, despite the possibility that more rigid border controls may actually be keeping Mexican nationals on this side of the border and despite the fact that illegal entries are at a 40-year low -- partly because of increased security, but even more because of demographic and economic changes in Mexico -- many Republicans insist that many more millions of tax dollars need to be spent on a problem that is largely resolved.

They get their wish in the current immigration legislation, yet they show no inclination to reciprocate by giving an inch on citizenship -- even for the kids who grew up here and have no other country they want to call their own.

Since the rise of tea party politicians in 2010 and the election of many of their kind to Congress, the inflexible and sometimes irrational opposition of these right-wing absolutists has stymied sensible bipartisan legislation that could help fix a broad array of problems, from creating jobs to building roads and bridges. Thanks to them, immigration reform may be the next good idea that goes nowhere."

(CNN) —

It was with a heavy heart that I heard Edward Snowden has been granted, and apparently accepted, temporary asylum in Russia for one year. Short of locking him naked in solitary confinement as an example to other leakers, as was done to Bradley Manning, Russia is exactly where the American intelligence community wants Snowden.

How better to discredit Snowden’s warnings of the threat posed to civil liberties by our ever-growing surveillance state than to ceaselessly point out that he has found sanctuary in the arms of the FSB, the successor to the KGB? I suspect this latest development will nix any possibility of reform of domestic surveillance operations coming out of the House Judiciary Committee.

Of course, at this point, where else could Snowden go? He had spent five weeks in Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport. That had to be a purgatory on earth. By leaning on our allies, America had effectively trapped him there. One should not take too seriously, though, the outrage expressed by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Congress over this latest Russian perfidy. By fleeing to America’s traditional bogeyman, Snowden has seriously blunted his own effectiveness. He has become an easy target for the U.S. government to demonize.

Into whose hands has Edward Snowden actually put himself? With nowhere else to go, he is now physically under the control of a government whose leadership under Vladimir Putin has raised human rights alarms worldwide for the alleged killing of dissenting reporters, the jailing of performance artists like Pussy Riot and – most recently – the criminalization of homosexuality.

Putin’s thumbing of the nose to the Obama administration may be seen as a great thing for Snowden and his fate, but it’s important to bear in mind that today’s Russia is no more a bastion of free speech than China.

Opinion: How Putin’s move could help Snowden and U.S.

Years ago, I was convicted of espionage, sentenced to 40 years imprisonment, and packed off in chains to a federal penitentiary. It was more than I could endure, so one cold winter night I escaped through the razor wire.

I at once became America’s most wanted fugitive. I was hunted high and low by the FBI and the U.S. Marshals Service. I was shot at and chased and forever looking over my shoulder. I too contemplated seeking sanctuary in Russia. I thought long and hard about it because there was an easy route through Havana to Moscow. But I could not stomach the thought of it. I decided I would rather live the life of a hunted fugitive in my own country than spend my years controlled as a puppet of the KGB. After my arrest in 1977, I spent 25 years in prison.

Contrary to what many believe, my partner and I did not give information to the Soviet Embassy to aid the Soviet Union. I did what I did because I wanted to publicize and strike back at the U.S. intelligence community for the things I saw that outraged me. It was a mistake that cost me dearly, and one that I lived to regret. I suspect Snowden will come to regret his actions just as deeply. This, more than anything else, would be the greatest tragedy of all.

Opinion: What’s in it for Russia?

There is no doubt in my mind that Edward Snowden will rather be anywhere else on earth than in the arms of Putin’s Russia. Of course, there are two exceptions to that statement: He does not want to be dead and he does not want to be sitting naked in an American solitary confinement cell. I do not see that his choices were all that great.

Meanwhile, the U.S. surveillance state will go on stockpiling the sensitive personal data of the American people.

The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court will continue to function as a secret rubber stamp to spy on our own citizenry.

The bulk collection of our telephone data will mushroom.

The addresses of all letters and packages mailed and received will continue to be photographed by the U.S. Post Office.

Internet companies will continue to be bent to the secret purposes of the surveillance state.

The NSA will go on recording all our e-mail.

Opinion: Snowden is an unwanted guest in Putin’s Russia

Transparency, public disclosure, and open debate will be stifled as America becomes the world’s first cyber-superpower. And politicians of both parties will go on fearing to resist lest they be blamed should a cyber-attack happen.

Our surveillance state is only just beginning to flex its technological muscles. We have nothing to lose but our civil liberties.

Sanger']",White House Tries to Prevent Judge From Ruling on Surveillance Efforts,"WASHINGTON — The Obama administration moved late Friday to prevent a federal judge in California from ruling on the constitutionality of warrantless surveillance programs authorized during the Bush administration, telling a court that recent disclosures about National Security Agency spying were not enough to undermine its claim that litigating the case would jeopardize state secrets.

In a set of filings in the two long-running cases in the Northern District of California, the government acknowledged for the first time that the N.S.A. started systematically collecting data about Americans’ emails and phone calls in 2001, alongside its program of wiretapping certain calls without warrants. The government had long argued that disclosure of these and other secrets would put the country at risk if they came out in court.

But the government said that despite recent leaks by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor, that made public a fuller scope of the surveillance and data collection programs put in place after the Sept. 11 attacks, sensitive secrets remained at risk in any courtroom discussion of their details — like whether the plaintiffs were targets of intelligence collection or whether particular telecommunications providers like AT&T and Verizon had helped the agency.

“Disclosure of this still-classified information regarding the scope and operational details of N.S.A. intelligence activities implicated by plaintiffs’ allegations could be expected to cause extremely grave damage to the national security of the United States,” wrote the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr."

House Democratic bill picks up third Republican co-sponsor

Bill mirrors Senate%27s immigration%2C but includes a border security plan drafted by GOPers

Critics say it%27s too little too late%2C give immigration reform little chance of passing this year

WASHINGTON — A Democratic bill in the House to overhaul the nation's immigration laws is picking up Republican support, though well short of the votes needed to pass the measure.

Rep. David Valadao, R-Calif., on Wednesday became the third Republican to co-sponsor the bill, which includes a pathway to citizenship for the nation's 12 million undocumented immigrants.

Valadao, the son of Portuguese immigrants whose family runs a dairy farm, said in an interview with USA TODAY that his background, and that of his district, which is 72% Hispanic, was a big factor in his decision.

""I grew up in an immigrant family, I grew up in an immigrant community and I work in an immigrant-dependent industry. So it's not like this is a stretch for me,"" he said.

Valadao said the slow pace of immigration legislation in the House also contributed to his decision.

""This isn't really a shot at leadership, but more, 'Guys, this is important to me, we have to move and we have to be part of this solution,'"" he said. ""It doesn't matter how conservative of a district you come from - we have a system that we need to fix.""

Valado's decision to join Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., and Jeff Denham, R-Calif., in co-sponsoring the bill comes at a critical time for immigration reform in Congress.

There are 231 Republicans in the House and the GOP leadership has overseen hearings on separate bills tackling individual immigration issues. It has not favored a single bill to handle all issues.

A bill needs 218 votes to pass the House and the Democratic bill has 186 Democratic co-sponsors. Adding three GOP votes still falls well short of a majority for passage.

The Senate passed a sweeping overhaul to the nation's immigration laws in June that provides a pathway to citizenship for the country's undocumented immigrants, doubles the size of the Border Patrol and revamps the legal immigration system to bring in more high-tech and low-skilled workers.

But even Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., one of the architects of that bill, has questioned whether that bill is the best way forward. Rubio said Rubio's spokesman, Alex Conant, said the ""all or nothing"" approach they took in the Senate ""would result in nothing.""

Rubio and House Republican leaders say they would rather move forward with the ""piecemeal"" approach in which Congress considers smaller bills that tackle individual pieces of the nation's immigration laws.

House committees have approved a handful of bills that address border security, grant immigration enforcement powers to local and state police officers, increase the number of visas for high-tech workers and require U.S. businesses to check the immigration status of new hires.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has said he is ""hopeful"" that immigration could be voted on by the full House before the end of the year, but he has given no timetable.

""These guys signing on (to the Democratic bill) are kind of like people left standing when the music stops in musical chairs,"" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which opposes the Senate immigration bill. ""Just as the prospects of a bill passing are declining, these people are signing on.""

Supporters of the Democratic bill see something else happening.

Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, a group that supports the Senate immigration bill, said the increasing support of the Democratic bill puts more pressure on GOP leaders to get moving on immigration.

""Does it mean that this bill is going to be brought up sometime soon? Probably not,"" Sharry said. ""But does it ratchet up the pressure on house leadership to get something going? Yeah. It'll make it harder for House leadership to slow-walk this thing to death.""

The bill, H.R. 15, is sponsored by Rep. Joe Garcia, R-Fla. It is mostly a replica of the Senate's immigration bill, but it eliminates the $46 billion border security plan adopted in the Senate and replaces it with a border security plan authored by Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, and was approved unanimously by the House Homeland Security Committee.

Garcia said he was encouraged by the latest addition to his bill, and said he's pushing to bring more on board. He hopes it will reach a point where House leadership is forced to bring it to the floor, where it could pass with most Democrats and a couple-dozen Republicans, similar to the vote that ended the government shutdown.

""The same way we found votes on the budget, I think Speaker Boehner will see the votes here,"" Garcia said."

And, for a while, with Republicans freaked out by the ground they have lost among Latino voters, such legislation looked unstoppable. But now, not so much.

On Friday, the Republican National Committee passed a resolution calling on Congress to pass immigration reform, but the version of reform they want provides only renewable work permits, not a path to citizenship, for undocumented residents of the U.S.

That is not what Obama and the Democrats have called for, nor what Republican Sens. Marco Rubio and John McCain have been pushing, nor what was hammered out in a Senate bill by the bipartisan “Gang of Eight.”

All of them see a path to citizenship as a crucial element in the legislation. But the RNC’s position reflects the view of many Republicans, including many members of the House GOP, that no one should be rewarded for sneaking into the country, even if they happened to be babies when they were sneaked in and have now grown up to go to college or serve in the military.

Democrats and pro-reform Republicans, such as McCain and Rubio, hoped to soften the hard line against offering citizenship by promising that border security would be beefed up even more than it has been. This is despite plenty of evidence that one big reason so many undocumented people have taken up residence in the United States is because crossing the border with Mexico has become so difficult and perilous. Where once Mexican citizens came and went with the rhythm of seasonal work, now they stay because the border has been militarized.

Nevertheless, despite the possibility that more rigid border controls may actually be keeping Mexican nationals on this side of the border and despite the fact that illegal entries are at a 40-year low -- partly because of increased security, but even more because of demographic and economic changes in Mexico -- many Republicans insist that many more millions of tax dollars need to be spent on a problem that is largely resolved.

They get their wish in the current immigration legislation, yet they show no inclination to reciprocate by giving an inch on citizenship -- even for the kids who grew up here and have no other country they want to call their own.

Since the rise of tea party politicians in 2010 and the election of many of their kind to Congress, the inflexible and sometimes irrational opposition of these right-wing absolutists has stymied sensible bipartisan legislation that could help fix a broad array of problems, from creating jobs to building roads and bridges. Thanks to them, immigration reform may be the next good idea that goes nowhere."

COVID-19 has claimed the life of another New Brunswicker, pushing the total number of COVID-related deaths in the province to 38, Public Health announced Monday, along with 15 new cases. A person in their 90s in the Edmundston region, Zone 4, has died ""as a result of COVID-19,"" according to a news release. The person resided at Pavillon Beau-Lieu, a special care home in Grand Falls, where there's an outbreak involving the variant first reported in South Africa. Health Minister Dorothy Shephard said she is saddened by the news. ""I join all New Brunswickers in sharing sincere condolences with this person's loved ones during this difficult time,"" she said in a statement. On Sunday, Public Health announced another resident of the special care home, someone in their 80s, had died in hospital ""as a result of COVID-19."" With the 15 new cases, there are now 142 active cases of respiratory disease in the province. Six people are in hospital, including two in intensive care. The breakdown of the new cases is as follows: Moncton region, Zone 1: one case: A person 30 to 39 This case is a contact of a previously confirmed case. Saint John region, Zone 2: three cases: A person 30 to 39 A person 40 to 49 A person 50 to 59 One case is under investigation, one case is travel-related and the other is a contact of a previously confirmed case. Fredericton region, Zone 3: five cases: A person under 19 A person 30 to 39 A person 40 to 49 Two people 60 to 69 Three of the cases are contacts of a previously confirmed case and two are travel-related.

New Brunswick has had 1,954 confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic started just over a year ago. There have been 1,773 recoveries so far. A total of 295,822 tests have been conducted, including 1,339 on Sunday. UNB residence elevator eyed as possible source Public Health is investigating whether an elevator could be the source of transmission in the University of New Brunswick's Fredericton campus residence COVID-19 outbreak that still stands at 12 positive cases, as of Monday. Last week, Public Health and UNB looked into the ventilation system at Magee House and determined ""the risk is minimal,"" said Department of Health spokesperson Bruce Macfarlane. ""Public Health officials are now focusing their efforts to determine surface contacts within the elevator as the potential source of transmission,"" he said in an email. UNB's Magee House residence has about 180 adults and children living in the 101 apartment-style units, according to resident Martin Kutnowski.(Ed Hunter/CBC) According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, COVID-19 spreads from an infected person to others through respiratory droplets and aerosols (smaller droplets) created when an infected person talks, sings, shouts, coughs or sneezes. COVID-19 can also spread by touching something that has the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes with unwashed hands, the agency's website states. The outbreak at Magee House involves the variant first reported in India, which has two mutations that make it ""more concerning than all the others,"" Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Jennifer Russell has said. It is ""very, very, very aggressive in terms of being contagious and causing more severe symptoms."" Magee House is a seven-storey apartment-style residence designed for mature students, some of whom have families. The residents remain in isolation as Public Health deals with the outbreak. Paul Mazerolle, president and vice-chancellor of the University of New Brunswick, says isolation needs to happen at Magee House to prevent the spread of COVID-19.(Ed Hunter/CBC) Meanwhile, the UNB campus reopened Monday, as did the adjacent St Thomas University campus and nearby New Brunswick Community College campus, more than a week after they moved to essential services only in response to the outbreak. Faculty, staff and students can now go on campus as long as they follow relevant operational guidelines. ""COVID is difficult,"" said Paul Mazerolle, president of the University of New Brunswick. ""The uncertainty creates concern and we're not through this."" Monday marks day nine of the Magee House lockdown, and a third round of mass testing was scheduled for residents and staff on Sunday. As of Monday afternoon, Public Health was still awaiting the results. Alex Hill-Stosky, who lives with his family in Magee House, said many people in the building are either anxious or angry because of the lockdown. ""A lot of people feel we are test subjects rather than people,"" said the engineering student. Residents of Magee House at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton are in quarantine after at least 12 people tested positive for COVID-19. (Maria Jose Burgos/CBC) Mazerolle said he understands people are concerned and worried about their personal freedoms, but it's important to limit the spread of the virus. ""To minimize the potential spread, unfortunately people's movements need to be restricted for a limited period of time. … If we didn't restrict movement, we could be in a much worse situation."" Students have also expressed concerns over the residence's ventilation system. Mazerolle said the ventilation system has been checked twice and deemed safe by engineers with Public Health and the Department of Environment. ""From what I've been told by the experts, there's no evidence to suggest that the ventilation system is putting people at risk for COVID-19. Mazerolle expects Magee House to reopen on Saturday. ""We're looking forward to this coming to an end,"" he said. Public Health said the isolation period for Magee House individuals who have tested negative throughout the process could end Saturday. Meanwhile, the isolation for residents and staff of UNB's Elizabeth Parr-Johnston residence could be lifted as early as Wednesday, depending on the results of retests taking place Monday, said Public Health. So far, all test results have been negative. George Street Middle School reopens George Street Middle School in Fredericton reopened Monday, six days after students, staff and their families were urged by Public Health to self-isolate last week following a confirmed case of COVID-19. In a letter to parents on Sunday, Public Health said students and staff can return to school, and their families can return to work, with the exception of those who have been told by Public Health to self-isolate for 14 days. New Brunswick Public Health confirmed a case of COVID-19 at George Street Middle School in Fredericton last week.(Elizabeth Fraser/CBC) ""Custodial services have been through the school disinfecting high touch areas,"" said Dr. Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health. ""Everyone who has not been identified as a close contact should feel confident to return to normal activities."" The George Street and UNB cases are linked, Public Health said earlier. Voting in self-isolation Elections New Brunswick is encouraging people who are under COVID-19 isolation and haven't voted in the May 10 municipal election yet but wish to do so to contact their local returning office to find out what options are available. With election day less than a week away, the options available are starting to decrease, said Kim Poffenroth, municipal election officer. Municipal election officer Kim Poffenroth asks everyone to be patient as election officials, who are all temporary workers hired for just a few days of work, do their best to deliver these elections during the 'unusual and challenging circumstances of this pandemic.'(Screenshot/ParlVu) ""Our municipal returning officers will gladly work with these individuals to determine the best way to arrange for them to vote, based on their current situation,"" she said in a statement. Options may include voting by mail, if time permits, curbside voting, and other forms of contactless voting. ""We will do our utmost to make sure every New Brunswicker is provided with the opportunity to vote, while at the same time respecting public health rules and protecting the thousands of people working for us during these elections,"" Poffenroth said.

Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for their “rendition” policy that allowed suspected terrorists to be detained overseas in foreign countries and interrogated at the direction of the US government. Hollywood even made a movie about it, so you know it was important.

Along with Guantanamo Bay, rendition was cited as an example of the un-constitutional Bush/Cheney dictatorship running rough-shod on the Geneva Conventions and basic human rights.

As a candidate, Barack Obama indicated that he would reverse the policy in an article in Foreign Affairs.

To build a better, freer world, we must first behave in ways that reflect the decency and aspirations of the American people… This means ending the practices of shipping away prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far-off countries, of detaining thousands without charge or trial, of maintaining a network of secret prisons to jail people beyond the reach of the law.

Two days into his presidency, Obama quietly continued the evil rendition policy, and it has continued ever since. Last week it was revealed that three new detainees were taken prisoner in the small African country of Djibouti and interrogated by American agents:

U.S. agents accused the men — two of them Swedes, the other a longtime resident of Britain — of supporting al-Shabab, an Islamist militia in Somalia that Washington considers a terrorist group. Two months after their arrest, the prisoners were secretly indicted by a federal grand jury in New York, then clandestinely taken into custody by the FBI and flown to the United States to face trial. The secret arrests and detentions came to light Dec. 21 when the suspects made a brief appearance in a Brooklyn courtroom.

Other than a small handful of news reports, the continuing rendition has received little or no attention and absolutely no condemnation from opinion writers who were hysterical over the Bush-era policies.

They could be criticizing Obama over his rendition policy, or they could be hammering him over his hypocrisy. They could be… if they were interested in truly speaking truth to power. But, President Obama is their guy, so rendition is just fine under his watch."

Press secretary Jay Carney’s comments came after U.S. District Court Judge Gladys Kessler urged Obama to personally address the controversy over the hunger strike at the notorious facility. Kessler dismissed a suit from a Guantanamo detainee who argued that the government will infringe upon his religious freedom by force-feeding him during the Muslim holiday of Ramadan, which begins Tuesday, but called the practice “painful, humiliating and degrading"" and pressed the president to act.

Asked about Kessler's comments, Carney told reporters at his daily briefing, ""On the questions of litigation I would refer you to the Department of Justice and the Defense Department, which obviously runs Guantanamo Bay, I would refer you to them for specifics about the hunger strikers.""

But ""we don’t want these individuals to die. And, you know, the action being taken is to prevent that from happening,"" he underlined. Obama ""understands that this is a challenging situation.""

Jihad Dhiab, a Syrian detainee who was cleared for release by the Guantanamo Review Task Force in 2009 but has remained imprisoned, sued with three other detainees over the military's policy of forcibly feeding detainees who are on hunger strike and lose a certain amount of their body weight.

Dhiab claimed that the forced feeding would violate his religious freedom during the month of Ramadan, when devotees are supposed to fast until sundown each day. It is the U.S military and prisons policy not to allow prisoners to starve themselves, but the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, the World Medical Association and other groups have said the practice is inhumane and that people should have the right to starve themselves in protest. Dhiab is one of 45 Guantanamo prisoners on a force-feed list, with a total of 106 captives on hunger strike. Only 60 of the 166 Guantanamo prisoners are not currently on hunger strike.

Carney reiterated Obama's wish to close the facility.

It is unclear whether those statements before the Miranda rights warning would be admissible in a criminal trial and, if not, whether prosecutors even need them to win a conviction. Officials said physical evidence, including a 9 mm handgun and pieces of a remote-control device commonly used in toys, was recovered from the scene.

The suspect, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, told authorities that his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, only recently recruited him to be part of the attack, two U.S. officials said. The CIA, however, named Tamerlan to a terrorist database 18 months ago, officials said Wednesday, an acknowledgment that will undoubtedly prompt congressional inquiry about whether investigators took warnings from Russian intelligence officials seriously enough.

The U.S. officials who spoke to The Associated Press were close to the investigation but insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case with reporters.

Tamerlan, whom authorities have described as the driving force behind the plot, was killed in a shootout with police. Dzhokhar is recovering in a hospital from injuries sustained during a getaway attempt.

Authorities had previously said Dzhokhar exchanged gunfire with them for more than an hour Friday night before they captured him inside a boat covered by a tarp in a suburban Boston neighborhood backyard. But two U.S. officials said Wednesday that he was unarmed when captured, raising questions about the gunfire and how he was injured.

More than 4,000 mourners at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology paid tribute to a campus police officer who authorities say was gunned down by the bombing suspects.

Among the speakers in Cambridge, just outside Boston, was Vice President Joe Biden, who condemned the bombing suspects as ""two twisted, perverted, cowardly, knockoff jihadis.""

Investigators have said the brothers appeared to have been radicalized through jihadist materials on the Internet and have found no evidence tying them to a terrorist group.

Dzhokhar told the FBI that they were angry about the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the killing of Muslims there, officials said.

How much of those conversations will end up in court is unclear. The FBI normally tells suspects they have the right to remain silent before questioning them so all their statements can be used against them.

Under pressure from Congress, however, the Department of Justice has said investigators may wait until they have gathered intelligence about other threats before reading those rights in terrorism cases. The American Civil Liberties Union has expressed concern about that.

Regardless, investigators have found pieces of remote-control equipment among the debris and were analyzing them, officials said. One official described the detonator as ""close-controlled,"" meaning it had to be triggered within several blocks of the bombs.

An FBI affidavit said one of the brothers told a carjacking victim during their getaway attempt, ""Did you hear about the Boston explosion? I did that.""

Officials also recovered a 9 mm handgun believed to have been used by Tamerlan from the site of a Thursday night gunbattle that injured a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority officer, two U.S. officials said.

The officials told the AP that no gun was found in the boat. Boston police Commissioner Ed Davis said earlier that shots were fired from inside the boat.

Asked whether the suspect had a gun in the boat, Davis said, ""I'm not going to talk about that.""

Kurt Schwartz, director of the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, did respond to the report.

""Within half a mile of where this person was captured, a police officer was shot. And I know who shot him."" Schwartz said. ""And there were three bombs that went off, and I know where those bombs came from. ... To me, it does not change anything. This guy was captured alive and will survive. True or not true, it doesn't change anything for me.""

Dzhokhar's public defender had no comment on the matter Wednesday. His father has called him a ""true angel,"" and an aunt has insisted he's not guilty.

The suspects' parents, Anzor Tsarnaev and Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, plan to fly to the U.S. from Russia on Thursday, the father was quoted as telling the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. The family has said it wants to take Tamerlan's body back to Russia.

In Russia, U.S. investigators traveled to the predominantly Muslim province of Dagestan and were in contact with the brothers' parents, hoping to gain more information.

Investigators are looking into whether Tamerlan, who spent six months in Russia's turbulent Caucasus region in 2012, was influenced by the religious extremists who have waged an insurgency against Russian forces in the area for years. The brothers have roots in Dagestan and neighboring Chechnya but had lived in the U.S. for about a decade.

At MIT, bagpipes wailed as students, faculty and staff members and throngs of law enforcement officials paid their respects to MIT police Officer Sean Collier, who was ambushed in his cruiser three days after the bombing.

The line of mourners stretched for a half-mile. They had to make their way through tight security, including metal detectors and bomb-sniffing dogs.

Boston native James Taylor sang ""The Water is Wide"" and led a sing-along of ""Shower the People.""

Biden told the Collier family that no child should die before his or her parents, but that, in time, the grief will lose some of its sting.

""The moment will come when the memory of Sean is triggered and you know it's going to be OK,"" Biden said. ""When the first instinct is to get a smile on your lips before a tear to your eye.""

The vice president also sounded a defiant note.

""The purpose of terror is to instill fear,"" he said. ""You saw none of it here in Boston. Boston, you sent a powerful message to the world.""

In another milestone in Boston's recovery, the area around the marathon finish line was reopened to the public, with fresh cement still drying on the repaired sidewalk. Delivery trucks made their way down Boylston Street under a heavy police presence, though some damaged stores were still closed.

""I don't think there's going to be a sense of normalcy for a while,"" Tom Champoux, who works nearby, said as he pointed to the boarded-up windows. ""There are scars here that will be with us for a long time."""

Should federal judges weigh in on a president's decision to pursue and kill terrorists overseas?

The suggestion, raised at this week's nomination hearing of John Brennan to be CIA director, goes to the heart of the debate on whether President Barack Obama or any U.S. leader should have unfettered power to order the targeted killing of Americans overseas who are al Qaeda terrorists.

Some Democratic senators argued there should be a check on the president's authority to use lethal force, particularly against Americans, as occurred in September 2011 when a CIA-operated armed drone killed American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen.

Al- Awlaki was a senior operational planner for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula who had been linked to a number of terrorist plots against the United States.

One solution offered at the hearing was to create a new court to oversee such presidential decisions.

Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said she would review ideas for legislation ""to ensure that drone strikes are carried out in a manner consistent with our values,"" including a proposal to create ""an analogue of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to review the conduct of such strikes.""

The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) is a top-secret body that reviews federal warrants to intercept electronic communications of suspected foreign agents and terrorists. One reason is to protect Americans from improperly or inadvertently having their communications collected.

Creating a similar type of court to oversee lethal actions taken overseas may be easier said than done.

The intelligence panel has yet to begin drafting legislation, a Feinstein aide told Security Clearance. For now, the panel was reading through proposals and suggestions by experts and commentators.

According to the aide, who spoke on condition of not being identified, writing a bill raised ""a lot of questions to wrestle with."" Consultations with the Judiciary and Armed Services Committees as well as the White House must occur before a final proposal can be developed, the aide added.

Ben Powell, the former general counsel for the Director of National Intelligence, said legislators will have to deal with ""a number of thorny legal issues ... with very complex implications"" to put an FISC-style court together.

According to Powell, major questions that must be addressed include specifying what the court would rule on, such as whether the target was part of al Qaeda or posed an imminent threat or was unlikely to be captured.

In addition, legislation would have to define whether the court's rulings would cover U.S. citizens who don't belong to al Qaeda but pose an imminent threat, as well as what role it would have in issues outside the United States, he said.

Powell also said legislators would have to clarify how the new court interacted with the president's constitutional power to defend the nation, specifically whether a new law would seek to limit such power.

Some legal experts believe the court's review would be limited to determining whether an individual should be put on a target list.

University of Texas law professor Robert Chesney wrote on Lawfare Blog that the question should be ""whether there ought to be judicial review of some kind in connection with the nomination process pursuant to which particular person may be pre-cleared for the possibility of using lethal force, a decision made long in advance of an actual attack decision.""

However, Chesney raised the issue of whether such a system would be constitutional, especially if it went beyond just considering American citizens.

Powell questioned whether any court would even accept the role, saying ""it would immerse the court deeper and deeper into national security judgments.""

At a recent American Bar Association panel discussion, retired federal Judge James Robertson said he would want no part of such a role.

""That's not the business of judges to decide without any adversary party to sign a death warrant for somebody who is on foreign soil, for anybody, but certainly not for an American citizen on foreign soil,"" Robertson said.

Chesney said proponents of the court should think twice if they expect judges will ever rule against a government decision to target a particular person.

""Judges famously tend to defer to the executive branch when it comes to factual judgments on matters of military or national security significance,"" Chesney said. ""Especially when the stakes are as high as they will be represented to be in such cases.""

At Brennan's confirmation hearing, Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine, argued for establishing a new court, saying the president should not be the ""prosecutor, the judge, the jury and the executioner.""

Brennan told King such a court was ""worthy of discussion,"" but added: ""The commander in chief and the chief executive has the responsibility to protect the welfare, the well being of American citizens"" from terrorist attacks."

Davidson Previously Was An Assistant City Editor At The Washington Post', 'A Washington', 'Foreign Correspondent With The Wall Street Journal', 'Where He Covered Federal Agencies', 'Political Campaigns.']",New film looks at ‘War on Whistleblowers’,"The Obama administration’s approach to federal whistleblowers has been likened to “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.”

On the good doctor’s side, President Obama has important accomplishments in protecting the rights of whistleblowers. Yet whistleblower advocates are fuming at the administration’s actions against federal employees whom it considers to be leakers of national security information.

“There’s a schizophrenia within the administration,” said Tom Devine, legal director of the nonprofit Government Accountability Project. “It’s been Obama versus Obama on whistleblower policy. Until recently, there was a virtual free-speech advocacy for whistleblower job rights that’s unprecedented, more than any other president in history.

“At the same time,” Devine added, “he has willingly allowed the Justice Department to prosecute whistleblowers on tenuous grounds.”

That last point — the Mr. Hyde side — is the focus of the new film “War on Whistleblowers: Free Press and the National Security State.” (Disclosure: The documentary features comments by Dana Priest, a Washington Post colleague.) It is a project of the Brave New Foundation, a social justice advocacy organization. The film is being shown in theaters in New York City and Los Angeles, but the main distribution channels will be iTunes, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and cable systems.

The Justice Department rejects the notion that it is overzealous in its prosecution of those the government calls national security leakers.

“Unauthorized disclosures of classified information cause damage to our national security and we take the investigation and prosecution of such matters very seriously,” Dean Boyd, a Justice Department spokesman, said via e-mail. “In these and all other cases, Justice Department investigators and prosecutors follow the facts and the law to determine whether charges are appropriate.”

The Justice Department does not target whistleblowers, he added: “However, we cannot condone the knowing and willful disclosure of classified information to the media or others not entitled to such information. An individual in authorized possession of classified information has no authority or right to unilaterally determine that it should be made public or otherwise disclose it.”

The film recognizes the president’s good side, with a quick nod by Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight. The “good news,” she said, is passage of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act, which Obama supported, and his directive providing protection for national security whistleblowers. That mention, however, is not until 59 minutes into the 66-minute film.

Balanced? No. But the stories about the government’s aggressive moves against federal employees who worked to uphold the finest traditions of public service are chilling and deserve the notice and outrage the film hopes to generate.

Franz Gayl’s is the first case presented. The Defense Department civilian employee was punished for his efforts to save the lives of U.S. troops at war.

“Hundreds of Marines were tragically lost and probably thousands maimed unnecessarily, so I said, let’s replace the Humvees with what are called MRAPs, Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles,” he says in the film.

After taking his concerns to Pentagon officials with no luck, he went to the news media. Then the blowback hit. He was stripped of his security clearance, the lifeline for national security workers, and suspended.

“They were using all these personnel actions against me,” he said. “I’m the substandard employee, bottom 3 percent, unreliable, untrustworthy, et cetera, et cetera. After investigations and after all these personnel actions and reprisals, I was placed on administrative leave.

“I was fearful. If I have to leave the government now and I don’t have security clearances, we’re gonna have to move away. I can’t get a job around here. You can’t do anything without a security clearance around [the] D.C. area. I knew that life was gonna go ‘foof,’ fall off a cliff.”

Gayl was fortunate to have whistleblower advocates who cushioned his fall. And in November 2011, after intervention by an Office of Special Counsel that was re-energized by Obama, the military’s threat to suspend Gayl indefinitely was lifted and his security clearance was reinstated.

There’s a lot left out of his story in this space, and similar stories of other whistleblowers can’t be mentioned at all. Gayl’s is a distressing tale of Uncle Sam playing the bully, making life hell for a federal employee who fought to better protect American troops.

“I’m now working back at the Pentagon in the office from which I was removed,” Gayl says at the end of the film. “I feel very lucky, because I received a lot of support from a lot of outsiders that I don’t think every person in my situation gets.”

The film makes you wonder how many more trampled, and largely unknown, federal whistleblowers like Gayl are out there.

http://news.yahoo.com/surveillance-critics-face-obama-oval-office-234633724.html,,[],Surveillance critics face Obama in Oval Office,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Struggling to salvage a massive surveillance program, President Barack Obama faced congressional critics of the National Security Agency's collection of Americans' telephone records Thursday as snowballing concerns made new limitations on the intelligence effort appear increasingly likely.

Obama and Vice President Joe Biden joined lawmakers on both sides of the issue for an Oval Office meeting designed to stem the bleeding of public support and show Obama was serious about engaging. Among the participants were the NSA's most vigorous congressional supporters — the top Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate intelligence panels — alongside its most stern critics, including Democratic Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mark Udall of Colorado.

The lawmakers departed the rainy White House grounds without speaking to reporters. But in interviews later, they said there was a consensus that the surveillance efforts are suffering from perception problems that have undercut trust among the American people.

""There is openness to making changes,"" said Rep. C.A. ""Dutch"" Ruppersberger of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.

Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, top Republican on the Senate's intelligence panel and a strong NSA defender, said Obama and the lawmakers didn't agree to take specific steps but brought up a number of proposals that will be fleshed out over the August congressional recess.

""A lot of ideas were thrown out,"" Chambliss told The Associated Press. ""Nothing was concluded.""

Wyden, in an interview, said he and Udall had sought to convince Obama of the urgency of addressing rising concerns. He said he proposed strengthening the government's ability to get emergency authorization to collect an individual's phone records, so that pre-emptive collection of everyone's records would no longer be necessary.

""I felt that the president was open to ideas — and we're going to make sure he has some,"" Wyden said after returning to Capitol Hill.

Story continues

Wyden and two Senate colleagues also unveiled legislation Thursday to overhaul the secret federal court that oversees the programs, which critics decry as largely a rubber stamp. The senators aim to make the court created under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, more adversarial by creating a special advocate who could argue for privacy during closed-door proceedings and appeal decisions. A companion bill would diversify the court's bench by ending the chief justice's sole authority to pick its judges.

""These bills do not compromise national security, but they put a necessary opposing view in the FISA court and assure ideological diversity of judges,"" said Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M. Another of the bill's sponsors, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said the Obama administration was receptive to the ideas, although White House officials declined to comment.

Debate over the line between counterterrorism and invasion of privacy has been heating up since former government contract systems analyst Edward Snowden leaked classified documents exposing the NSA's monumental capability to sweep up data about phone and Internet use, including programs that store years of phone records on virtually every American. Snowden's revelations have prompted a national rethinking over government surveillance powers that have grown since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Russia decided on Thursday to grant temporary asylum to Snowden, who has been in a Moscow airport hotel for more than a month, despite America's insistence that the fugitive be sent home to face prosecution on espionage charges.

In Washington, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said he stressed to Obama the role Congress must play in ensuring that U.S. spying isn't infringing on Congress' intent or on civil liberties. He said his committee would further probe the issue, including in a classified hearing he's hoping to hold in September.

Extending its efforts to defend the programs to the public, the White House pledged to help Americans understand as much as possible about how they work, even as it staunchly defended their efficacy in keeping a post-9/11 America safe.

""That process will continue,"" said White House spokesman Jay Carney. ""But I don't think that we can sensibly say that programs designed to protect us from terrorist attack are not necessary in this day and age.""

The more information about the programs the government has released, the more it has fed even greater concerns about the scope of the surveillance and whether Obama's national security team has been truthful in describing it publicly in the past.

After the administration on Wednesday declassified more documents about an email mining program, Wyden said they showed the government had ""repeatedly made inaccurate statements to Congress"" about the effectiveness in countering terrorism. And new details released about the phone records program created new fodder for critics by confirming for the first time that, when investigating one suspected terrorist, the government can also examine records of people who called people who called the targeted individual — netting millions of people's records in a single request.

Meanwhile, the head of the NSA openly clashed with lawmakers including Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., over the agency's statements that telephone and email data collection helped foil 54 terror plots.

Rising tensions have stoked concern at the White House that surveillance programs Obama considers crucial will soon be undermined or even dismantled — despite the fact that many Democrats and Republicans in Congress have come to the NSA's defense.

Leahy, the Judiciary Committee chairman, has threatened to seek to end the phone records program if it's not proven effective. And Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., signaled Thursday that unless an agreement is reached on releasing more of the secret court's opinions, he would push Congress to use its ""power of the purse"" to compel their disclosure by withholding funding for certain programs.

Even some staunch advocates for a tough national security stance have become outspoken critics, including Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., who helped write the USA Patriot Act but now says the phone records collection goes far beyond what he envisioned and may not be renewed. Sensenbrenner was among the lawmakers who shared concerns in the session Thursday with Obama and top officials, including Biden, National Security Advisory Susan Rice and White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler.

The White House also was spooked by a House vote last week to dismantle the program, which failed by a narrow 217-205 margin.

""This Sunday, the president under pressure as he faces a growing debate about how safe we are at home from terror....."" ""This morning, a debate about the state of our homeland security in a new age of terror."" ""I think there's the broader topic we're broaching here about national security, about our own personal freedoms in America, coming out of the Boston bombing, is in part ongoing concern about terrorism."" ""Is there something here that somehow gets to why we're more vulnerable now.....?"" ""Are there questions that have to be answered that reflect how vulnerable we are and what we're doing about it?"" "".....What does this tell us about what we're up against here.....? And this question of 'Are we any safer?'"" "".....We're dealing with radicalization inside the homeland. How do we deal with it?"" ""It's a security question. Two years after Osama bin Laden has been killed, are we safer as a country or not?"" ""Do we need to sacrifice privacy in order to be safer? Is that going to be the immediate lesson from the Boston bombing?"" ""Boston was an exclamation point about the ongoing terror threat and this new age of terror.....""

Gregory's short ""Post-show thoughts"" web video is titled ""Keeping America Safe."" Another clip from the show, featuring the gruesome Rudy Guiliani, is titled ""Privacy may become cost of safety.""You get the point. We Are Not Safe. Terror. Must Keep Safe. Terror. Are We Less Safe? More Safe? Equally Safe? Terror.It's worth pausing to consider how amazingly irrational all of this is and how the quixotic project of Keeping America Safe only seems to interest the political and media classes when it revolves around combating the virtually nonexistent specter of terrorism.First, a simple look at the facts about this alleged New Age of Terror that exists only in David Gregory's imagination. In 2011, the most recent year for which we have data, 17 Americans were killed by terrorism, a number that's basically consistent with previous years. Significantly more Americans (26) were killed by lighting. ""Death by furniture"" constitutes a comparable threat.But even these figures fail to fully convey the irrationality at play here. Gregory is evidently obsessed withterrorism in particular. Of those 17 Americans killed by terrorism in 2011,were killed in the United States. In 2010, too, not a single American was killed by domestic terrorism. More Americans were killed by syphilis in 2011 than by terrorism in the entire decade after 9/11. Death by domestic terrorism is so rare as to render it absurd to even discuss. David Gregory devoted nearly an entire show to it.Note that more than 122,000 died from accidental injury and 53,000 died from the flu and pneumonia in 2011. One could cite any number of statistics to illuminate the silliness of this obsession. Most instructive, though, is to compare terrorism to gun violence, which at least falls under a similar category. Gun violence is killing tens of thousands of Americans annually. Yes, the media have paid a reasonable amount of attention to gun violence over the past few months, but never in the context of Keeping America Safe, which clearly conveys asense of urgency. The focus on the Terror Threat is just fanatically out of proportion relative to the coverage of virtually any other ""threat"" one can think of. Devoting an entireto syphilis and the current state of medical research on syphilis would make more sense than this.The obsession with domestic terrorism serves important objectives of the political class. It provides a rationale for further eroding privacy and civil liberties - more in sorrow than anger, of course (Gregory: ""Do we need to sacrifice privacy in order to be safer?""). To the extent that domestic terrorisma threat, it makes no distinction based on class (as in the case of 9/11), as opposed to gun violence, which, by and large, targets America's underclass. It keeps Americans scared, obedient, and supportive of their leaders (a New Age of Terror is hardly an appropriate time for dissent).We should never accept this stupid obsession with Terrorism just because it's become so ubiquitous since 9/11. It's the responsibility of thinking citizens to relentlessly point out how truly irrational it is and how it so transparently involves ulterior motives.

Gathers Data on Social Connections of U.S. Citizens,"WASHINGTON — Since 2010, the National Security Agency has been exploiting its huge collections of data to create sophisticated graphs of some Americans’ social connections that can identify their associates, their locations at certain times, their traveling companions and other personal information, according to newly disclosed documents and interviews with officials.

The spy agency began allowing the analysis of phone call and e-mail logs in November 2010 to examine Americans’ networks of associations for foreign intelligence purposes after N.S.A. officials lifted restrictions on the practice, according to documents provided by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor.

The policy shift was intended to help the agency “discover and track” connections between intelligence targets overseas and people in the United States, according to an N.S.A. memorandum from January 2011. The agency was authorized to conduct “large-scale graph analysis on very large sets of communications metadata without having to check foreignness” of every e-mail address, phone number or other identifier, the document said. Because of concerns about infringing on the privacy of American citizens, the computer analysis of such data had previously been permitted only for foreigners.

The agency can augment the communications data with material from public, commercial and other sources, including bank codes, insurance information, Facebook profiles, passenger manifests, voter registration rolls and GPS location information, as well as property records and unspecified tax data, according to the documents.

""The programs are secret in the sense that they are classified. They are not secret, in that every member of Congress has been briefed,"" he said during a speech in San Jose, Calif. ""These are programs that have been authored by large bipartisan majorities repeatedly since 2006.""

""Your duly elected representatives have consistently been informed,"" he said.

News outlets revealed this week that vast spying programs began under President George W. Bush and have continued under Obama. The Guardian reported Wednesday that the National Security Agency had obtained a court order to collect phone records from Verizon Wireless customers, while The Washington Post reported Thursday of the existence of a program launched in 2007 called PRISM, which tracks information from nine leading U.S. Internet companies: Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, AOL, YouTube, Apple, PalTalk and Skype.

In response to a question after his speech, Obama defended the programs as essential to combating terrorist threats. ""They may identify potential leads with respect to folks who might engage in terrorism,"" he said.

He also argued that some have overstated the impact of the programs. ""Some of the hype we've been hearing over the past day or so -- nobody has listened to the content of people's phone calls,"" he said.

""I welcome this debate and I think it's healthy for our democracy,"" he continued. ""I think it's a sign of maturity, because probably five years ago, six years ago, we might not have been having this debate.""

Obama portrayed the programs as a trade-off between security and civil liberties. ""I think it's important to recognize that you can't have 100 percent security, and also then have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience. We're going to have to make some choices as a society,"" he said.

He also expressed his displeasure that the domestic spying programs' existence was leaked to the press. ""I don't welcome leaks,"" he said. ""There's a reason these programs are classified.""

The president's full-throated defense of the programs, albeit with the qualification that he welcomes debate, is unlikely to quell the outrage over the revelations. Obama ran as an antidote to Bush's policies in 2008, but the reports reveal that he has continued many of them, leading to concerns over the reach of the national security state.

Obama went on to defend those who operated the programs as ""professionals."" ""In the abstract, you can complain about 'Big Brother' and how this is a potential program run amok. But when you actually look at the details, then I think we've struck the right balance,"" he said.

(CNN) – The names of dozens of detainees held at the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were released for the first time on Monday after a newspaper sued the federal government for the information.

The list identifies 46 inmates being held for “continued detention” at the facility, which President Barack Obama has vowed to close. The report was made public after a lawsuit from the Miami Herald. The Obama administration first acknowledged that detainees were being held indefinitely in Guantanamo in 2010, but didn't make their identities public until now.



As of Tuesday, 104 of the 166 current Guantanamo detainees are staging a hunger strike. They are protesting their treatment and indefinite detention, resulting in force feedings of 44, according to Capt. Robert Durand, a spokesperson for the Joint Task Force.

Durand said they ""do not comment on the detainees in Camp 7."" That camp holds 15 ""high-value detainees,"" so the accrual number of detainees on strike could be higher.

The list released Monday was the product of a 2010 federal review of the status of each detainee, which was commissioned by President Barack Obama as a step toward closing the facility.

Obama has recently renewed his vow to shut the prison established last decade to house suspected terrorists.

Of the 46 detainees listed for indefinite detention, the report shows that 26 are from Yemen, 10 are from Afghanistan, three are from Saudi Arabia, two each are from Libya and Kuwait, and one each are from Kenya, Somalia and Morocco.

Human rights groups have long protested the detention of suspected enemy fighters who haven’t been charged with crimes.

The government says the detainees are too dangerous to transfer but cannot be tried, characterizing them as war prisoners under the 2001 “Authorization for Use of Military Force Act.”

“It is fundamental to democracy that the public know the identities of the people our nation is depriving of liberty and why they are being detained,” said Dixon Osburn, the director of the Law and Security Program at the group Human Rights First.

“The United States has held some of the men at Guantanamo now for over a decade. Today’s revelation is welcome, though long overdue. The administration should use its authority under current law immediately to transfer the 86 detainees already cleared for transfer out of Guantanamo,"" Osburn said.

Of the 86 detainees cleared for transfer, 56 are from Yemen. Currently, a moratorium is in place on transferring prisoners back to Yemen, citing the country’s current security situation.

One of Obama’s initiatives in his new bid to close Guantanamo is lifting that ban.

One reason the NSA's PR offensive must be so vigorous is that its old PR strategy sounds a lot like lies. In a March 12 Senate hearing, Sen. Ron Wyden asked Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, ""Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?"" Clapper responded, ""No, sir... Not wittingly."" Since last week, it's become clear that Clapper's statement was not exactly true. Clapper's given a series of interviews to explain the comment, each time getting closer to admitting that what he said was not true. [...] Clapper wasn't the only official who was cute with facts. In February, NSA general counsel Rajesh De gave a speech to debunk ""false myths"" about the agency. Those were that the NSA ""is a vacuum that indiscriminately sweeps up and stores global communications""; that it ""is spying on Americans at home and abroad with questionable or no legal basis""; and that it ""operates in the shadows free from external scrutiny or any true accountability."" De's debunking has been debunked.

If ever tyranny overtakes this land of the sometimes free and home of the intermittently brave, it probably won’t, contrary to the fever dreams of gun rights extremists, involve jack-booted government thugs rappelling down from black helicopters. Rather, it will involve changes to words on paper many have forgotten or never knew, changes that chip away until they strip away, precious American freedoms. It will involve a trade of sorts, an inducement to give up the reality of freedom for the illusion of security. Indeed, the bargain has already been struck. [...] People think tyranny will be imposed at the point of a gun. Paranoids look up in search of black helicopters. Meanwhile, the architecture of totalitarianism is put into place all around them, surveillance apparatus so intrusive as to stagger the imagination of Orwell himself. The point is not that one has nothing to hide. The point is that whatever you have is none of the government’s business absent probable cause and a warrant. The point is that one should never repose unfettered power with the state. We should know this, yet we fall for the same seductive con every time: We are afraid, but the state says it can make us safe. And all it will take is the surrender of a few small freedoms.

The U.S. military's effort to prosecute, punish and curtail sexual assaults has failed miserably, despite a chest-thumping zero-tolerance policy and repeated assurances it would get the job done. A dramatically different approach is clearly necessary. [...] Gillibrand's fix would give military prosecutors the authority to decide which sexual misconduct cases go to trial. And it would end commanders' power to reverse convictions and sentences. That would ensure victims could trust they would no longer face retaliation or career-crippling marginalization for reporting assaults, and that their attackers would be prosecuted and punished. In announcing her intent to take the fight for these reforms to the Senate floor, Gillibrand is showing that the voices of the growing number of women in the chamber cannot be dismissed.

Cracking down on retaliation, though necessary, does not address the low prosecution rate or the sense among many victims that their claims, especially against someone higher in rank, will not be believed. It is distressing that two decades of scandals could not persuade Mr. Levin to budge from his decision to support the military brass. Ms. Gillibrand says she will try again to get her measure included when the full Senate takes up the defense spending bill. She has done a diligent job of building a bipartisan coalition pressing for more sweeping change, and further debate about the sexual assault problem and its solutions can help strengthen the result when the Senate negotiates a final bill with the House.

With the grace of Charlie Sheen and the subtlety of a sitcom, the manly men [of the House Judiciary Committee] voted down a Democratic effort to add enhanced protections for the life and health of the mother. They voted down a Democratic amendment that would allow exceptions for women with heart or lung disease or diabetes. They even voted down an amendment that would have made exceptions for victims of rape or incest. If that weren’t enough, the chief sponsor of the legislation, Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), had a Todd Akin moment as he attempted to argue that women aren’t likely to become pregnant from rape. Franks provided his variation of “legitimate rape” theory when he argued against the rape-and-incest exception because the amendment didn’t require women to report the crime.

http://uk.news.yahoo.com/boston-bombings-wrong-suspect-reveals-fears-102911067.html,,[],Boston Bombings: Wrong Suspect Reveals Fears,"A teenager says he fears for his safety after internet vigilantes wrongly identified him as a suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings and he was pictured on the front of the New York Post.

Boston student Salah Eddin Barhoum, 17, was pictured near the finish line with his friend Yassine Zaime wearing baseball caps and carrying bags.

The images were published on several websites which claimed their demeanour was suspicious and they could be responsible for the attacks.

The New York Post published one of the pictures on their front page under the headline ""Bag Men"" and claimed federal agents were hunting for them.

The front page set off a wave of speculation on Twitter as users began re-tweeting the pictures and a massive search began for the boys.

Salah said he suddenly began receiving messages from people who recognised him and began blaming him for the attacks.

One person from Oregon reportedly asked him: ""How could you do that? Did you even think about the consequences?""

He was so frightened by being wrongly implicated that he ran back to school on Thursday when he saw a man staring at him, he said.

The New York Post later admitted the men were not suspects. But Salah says the damage has been done and people will still blame him for the attack.

""I'm going to be scared going to school,"" he said. ""Workwise, my family, everything is going to be scary.""

His father moved his family to the US from Morocco five years ago. He says he is worried his son could be shot and fears for his wife and two young daughters.

""Right now, we are not secure,"" he said. ""When the news put something out they should be sure about the information.""

Salah - a track runner at Boston's Revere High School - said he was only identified as a suspect because he was carrying a shoulder bag and has dark skin.

He was at the marathon with Yassine as they hoped to run a portion of it behind the official field of runners. Salah said his bag contained his running gear and shoes.

The New York Post has said it stands by its story. The paper’s editor Col Allan, said: ""The image was emailed to law enforcement agencies yesterday afternoon seeking information about these men, as our story reported. We did not identify them as suspects."""

John Lewis (D-GA), who was beaten while marching for voting rights on the Edmund Pettus Bridge on “Bloody Sunday” in 1965, compared National Security Agency (NSA) leaker Edward Snowden to Gandhi and Martin Luther King.

In an interview with the UK Guardian that was published on Wednesday, Lewis said Snowden was following in the footsteps of others who engaged in non-violent civil disobedience.

“In keeping with the philosophy and the discipline of non-violence, in keeping with the teaching of Henry David Thoreau and people like Gandhi and others, if you believe something that is not right, something is unjust, and you are willing to defy customs, traditions, bad laws, then you have a conscience,” Lewis said. “You have a right to defy those laws and be willing to pay the price.”

Lewis noted that is what “we did” during the civil rights movement and mentioned he “got arrested 40 times during the sixties. Since I’ve been in Congress I’ve been arrested four times. Sometimes you have to act by the dictates of your conscience. You have to do it.”

Lewis also said the federal government similarly spied on and targeted Martin Luther King.

“We had that problem during the height of the civil rights movement,” Lewis said. “People spied on, and got information on Martin Luther King Junior, and tried to use it against him, on the movement, tried to plant people within different organizations–that probably led to the destruction of some of those groups.

As The Hill noted, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) also likened Snowden to Thoreau and Martin Luther King in June.

“On deciding when you decide to become a civil disobedient–we’ve had famous ones in our career, but some of them only had to serve, like [Henry David] Thoreau only had to serve one day in jail, Martin Luther King served 30 days in jail,” Paul said then."

USA TODAY

Revelations about NSA surveillance have spurred bipartisan concern

White House and congressional leaders opposed the amendment

Focus is on scaling back NSA authority to collect data on phone calls

WASHINGTON – The Obama administration and National Security Agency narrowly averted an embarrassing setback Wednesday as the House defeated an attempt to block the collection of massive volumes of telephone records on domestic calls.

By a 217-205 vote, the House defeated a proposal by Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., that would have limited the collection of so-called metadata by the NSA.

The proposal was among the first significant challenges to a program that has drawn scrutiny after a former NSA contract employee leaked details of it.

While unsuccessful, Amash drew together a diverse coalition of libertarian Republicans, law-and-order conservatives and liberals, who all said they were troubled by the NSA's collection of data on people who were not under criminal investigation.

The amendment, which was attached to a defense spending bill, would have required the government to show any collection of data is related to a specific individual.

Critics of the amendment said it would deal a death blow to a critical intelligence program that has helped disrupt planned terrorist attacks.

Disclosures by Edward Snowden, the NSA contract employee, have brought fresh scrutiny to the collection of so-called metadata. The data includes phone numbers and the duration of the calls, but not the substance of the calls.

Amash said his proposal would only stop the government from sweeping up data indiscriminately but would not interfere with the pursuit of legitimate terrorism investigations.

His proposal drew immediate criticism from the Obama administration and key lawmakers. ""This blunt approach is not the product of an informed, open, or deliberative process,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said in a statement.

""It ends the program,"" said Rep. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican and former paratrooper in Iraq. ""It blows it up.""

Sen. Dianne Feinstein,D-Calif., chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, opposed the amendment.

Will Adams, an aide to Amash, said the breadth of the opposition from political leaders is proof that the amendment would be effective in stopping the indiscriminate collection of data.

""People with a stake in the program have come out with guns blazing against it,"" he said.

Critics say the NSA programs violate privacy and go beyond what was intended by the Patriot Act, which was designed to expand the ability of the government to investigate and prosecute terrorism cases.

Gen. Keith Alexander, head of the NSA, has said the collection of data has helped disrupt dozens of terrorist plots. Investigators are not allowed to comb through the data, but can use it when they have identified a foreign suspect through other intelligence collection.

The data allows investigators to then detect networks the suspect may have been tied into, which could lead to other suspects and the uncovering of secret cells.

""The court restricts what we can do with that data,"" Alexander said in a recent speech. ""We have to show some reasonable, articulable suspicion that the phone number that we're going to look at is associated with al-Qaeda or another terrorist group."""

Graham said he “had contact” with survivors and described their accounts as “chilling.” “The bottom line is they feel that they can’t come forth, they’ve been told to be quiet.”

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney refuted that the administration is gagging survivors, telling Fox News last week, “I’m sure that the White House is not preventing anyone from speaking,”

Graham does not buy it and is threatening to hold up all business in the upper chamber if the White House does not release the names of the survivors to Congress. Graham is urging his colleagues in the House to move forward and issue subpoenas of Benghazi survivors if the administration fails to release any information on them.

“To our leadership in the House, you’re gonna have to up your game on Benghazi,” the South Carolina Republican said.

Breitbart News first reported in December that Congressman Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) was being stonewalled by the Obama administration from visiting the injured survivors of the Benghazi attack.

Since then, Senator Graham has demanded the FBI turn over the interviews with the survivors to no avail. Graham, Senators John McCain (R-AZ), and Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) all called for a joint select committee to investigate the Benghazi assault, while Congressman Frank Wolf (R-VA) re-issued a second resolution to form a House Select committee to do the same.

Wolf and Rep. Jim Gerlach (R-PA) demanded Sec. Kerry to hand over the contact information of all the State Department employees who worked at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi when the attack occurred. Wolf’s resolution currently boasts over 60 co-sponsors.

Congressman Mike Rogers (R-MI), chairman of the House Select Intelligence Committee, and Congressman Darrell Issa (R-CA), chairman of the House Government Oversight Committee, are looking forward to hear from Benghazi survivors as well.

“We’ll get our chance to talk to Benghazi survivors and get the reports from the FBI. That will happen. I’m confident of that,” Chairman Rogers told Breitbart News. “We want to make sure people have a chance to heal first and we’ll have an opportunity to talk these people before this is over. I’m fairly comfortable this will happen,” he said.

Chairman Issa noted that Secretary of State John Kerry’s visit to a Benghazi survivor opened the door for Congress to question anyone who was on the ground and survived the Benghazi attack. “We expected to speak with all the witnesses and the Benghazi survivors,” he told Breitbart News. “Now that Secretary Kerry has publicly, essentially a senator, in a post way, has chosen to visit with them, any claim that they’re not available at this point to Congress is unsupportable. And I look forward to oversight by all committees.”

Any Benghazi survivor who talks to his committee would be protected from prosecution or job termination from the Obama administration, Rogers said. “We’ll make sure of that. That is whistle bower standard protection. If they’re fired for talking to us, there’ll be some hell to pay.”

Issa agrees, saying, “Any kind of retaliation against any of the witnesses we’ve already had would not be tolerated.”

Four Americans were killed on site when the U.S. mission in Benghazi was attacked, including U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens. Questions remain, however, as to the physical health of those who were evacuated from the U.S. compound. Rogers cannot confirm if any evacuee later succumbed to their injuries while being treated at medical facilities.

The Michigan Republican explained, “Like I said, I don’t know. We’ll know before it’s over. My review is not over yet. We’re looking at all the information. We still have cables and emails that we still haven’t gone through one hundred percent yet. It’s voluminous.” He added, “Were going through it painstakingly. I’m just an old FBI guy, so I’m going through it painstakingly to find to find the truth. My goal is to find the truth. And wherever those facts and leads takes us.”"

FBI counter-terrorism agents began issuing the secret letters, which don't require a judge's approval, after Congress passed the USA Patriot Act in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

The letters are used to collect unlimited kinds of sensitive, private information, such as financial and phone records and have prompted complaints of government privacy violations in the name of national security. Many of Google's services, including its dominant search engine and the popular Gmail application, have become daily habits for millions of people.

In a ruling written May 20 and obtained Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Susan Illston ordered Google to comply with the FBI's demands.

But she put her ruling on hold until the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals could decide the matter. Until then, the Mountain View, Calif.-based company must comply with the letters unless it shows the FBI didn't follow proper procedures in making its demands for customer data in the 19 letters Google is challenging, she said.

After receiving sworn statements from two top-ranking FBI officials, Illston said she was satisfied that 17 of the 19 letters were issued properly. She wanted more information on two other letters.

It was unclear from the judge's ruling what type of information the government sought to obtain with the letters. It was also unclear who the government was targeting.

The decision from the San Francisco-based Illston comes several months after she ruled in a separate case brought by the Electronic Frontier Foundation over the letters. She ruled in March that the FBI's demand that recipients refrain from telling anyone — including customers — that they had received the letters was a violation of free speech rights.

Kurt Opsah, an attorney with the foundation, said it could be many more months before the appeals court rules on the constitutionality of the letters in the Google case.

""We are disappointed that the same judge who declared these letters unconstitutional is now requiring compliance with them,"" Opsah said on Friday.

Illston's May 20 order omits any mention of Google or that the proceedings have been closed to the public. But the judge said ""the petitioner"" was involved in a similar case filed on April 22 in New York federal court.

Public records show that on that same day, the federal government filed a ""petition to enforce National Security Letter"" against Google after the company declined to cooperate with government demands.

Google can still appeal Illston's decision. The company declined comment Friday.

In 2007, the Justice Department's inspector general found widespread violations in the FBI's use of the letters, including demands without proper authorization and information obtained in non-emergency circumstances. The FBI has tightened oversight of the system.

The FBI made 16,511 national security letter requests for information regarding 7,201 people in 2011, the latest data available."

(CNN) —

Leaked classified documents show the U.S. National Security Agency and its British counterpart are among the “worst offenders” of mass surveillance without oversight, according to an open letter purportedly written by Edward Snowden and published Sunday by the German magazine Der Spiegel.

The publication of the letter, titled “A Manifesto for the Truth,” comes as leaks by the former NSA contract analyst have roiled U.S.-European relations amid allegations that the NSA and the UK’s Government Communications Headquarters monitored the communication data of some world leaders.

“The world has learned a lot in a short amount of time about irresponsibly operated security agencies and, at times, criminal surveillance programs. Sometimes the agencies try to avoid controls,” Snowden wrote, according to the news magazine.

“While the NSA and GCHQ (the British national security agency) appear to be the worst offenders – at least according to the documents that are currently public – we cannot forget that mass surveillance is a global problem and needs a global solution.”

The letter, published in German by Der Spiegel, was written on Friday in Moscow and provided to Der Spiegel through a “locked channel,” the news magazine said. It was published in German and has been translated by CNN.

Snowden, 30, has admitted in interviews he was the source behind the leak of classified NSA documents, which revealed the existence of top-secret surveillance programs that collect records of domestic e-mails and telephone calls in the United States and monitor the cell phone and Internet activity of overseas residents. He is wanted in the United States on espionage charges.

A recent report by Der Spiegel, citing documents provided by Snowden, alleged the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone. Some reports also suggest the United States carried out surveillance on French and Spanish citizens.

The allegations have prompted some European countries to call for investigations. It also has prompted congressional hearings in the United States, where some are calling for more transparency and more oversight of American spy programs.

Opinion: Don’t underestimate risks of government spying

’Witch hunt’

The letter also accused governments of trying to squash debate about mass surveillance “with a never before seen witch hunt” that threatens journalists and criminalizes the publication of details about the programs.

In the letter, Snowden purportedly writes that his actions were bringing about change.

“The debate they wanted to avoid is now taking place in countries around the world,” the letter said.

“And instead of causing damage, the use of this new public knowledge is causing society to push for political reforms, oversight and new laws.”

Snowden has been in Moscow since June after fleeing from Hong Kong. In August, Russia granted him asylum for one year.

Snowden gets website job in Russia

The release of the open letter is the second in a matter of days from Snowden, who released a letter to German authorities through an intermediary.

Last week, Hans-Christian Stroebele, a member of Germany’s parliament, met with Snowden in Russia. Stroebele returned from the meeting with a letter from Snowden to German authorities, which was distributed to the media.

In it, Snowden said he is confident that with international support, the United States would abandon its efforts to “treat dissent as defection” and “criminalize political speech with felony charges.”

“I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved, I will be able to cooperate in the responsible finding of fact regarding reports in the media, particularly in regard to the truth and authenticity of documents, as appropriate and in accordance with the law,” he wrote.

Report: Snowden’s Russia asylum not breached by NSA spying reports

’Face justice’

The White House did not immediately respond to Snowden’s claims in the letter.

But earlier Sunday, White House Senior Adviser Dan Pfeiffer said on ABC’s “This Week” that there has been no discussion of granting Snowden clemency.

“Mr. Snowden violated U.S. law,” Pfeiffer said. “And our belief has always been that he should return to the U.S. and face justice.”

It was a sentiment echoed by the heads of the House and Senate intelligence committees.

“He had an opportunity – if what he was, was a whistle-blower – to pick up the phone and call the House Intelligence Committee, the Senate Intelligence Committee, and say, ‘I have some information,’” Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Sunday on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, said Snowden has to “own up with what he’s done.”

“If he wants to come back and open up to the responsibility of the fact that he took and stole information, he violated his oath, he disclosed classified information – that by the way has allowed three different terrorist organizations, affiliates of al Qaeda to change the way they communicate – I’d be happy to have that discussion with him,” Rogers said on “Face the Nation.”

On the good doctor’s side, President Obama has important accomplishments in protecting the rights of whistleblowers. Yet whistleblower advocates are fuming at the administration’s actions against federal employees whom it considers to be leakers of national security information.

“There’s a schizophrenia within the administration,” said Tom Devine, legal director of the nonprofit Government Accountability Project. “It’s been Obama versus Obama on whistleblower policy. Until recently, there was a virtual free-speech advocacy for whistleblower job rights that’s unprecedented, more than any other president in history.

“At the same time,” Devine added, “he has willingly allowed the Justice Department to prosecute whistleblowers on tenuous grounds.”

That last point — the Mr. Hyde side — is the focus of the new film “War on Whistleblowers: Free Press and the National Security State.” (Disclosure: The documentary features comments by Dana Priest, a Washington Post colleague.) It is a project of the Brave New Foundation, a social justice advocacy organization. The film is being shown in theaters in New York City and Los Angeles, but the main distribution channels will be iTunes, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and cable systems.

The Justice Department rejects the notion that it is overzealous in its prosecution of those the government calls national security leakers.

“Unauthorized disclosures of classified information cause damage to our national security and we take the investigation and prosecution of such matters very seriously,” Dean Boyd, a Justice Department spokesman, said via e-mail. “In these and all other cases, Justice Department investigators and prosecutors follow the facts and the law to determine whether charges are appropriate.”

The Justice Department does not target whistleblowers, he added: “However, we cannot condone the knowing and willful disclosure of classified information to the media or others not entitled to such information. An individual in authorized possession of classified information has no authority or right to unilaterally determine that it should be made public or otherwise disclose it.”

The film recognizes the president’s good side, with a quick nod by Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight. The “good news,” she said, is passage of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act, which Obama supported, and his directive providing protection for national security whistleblowers. That mention, however, is not until 59 minutes into the 66-minute film.

Balanced? No. But the stories about the government’s aggressive moves against federal employees who worked to uphold the finest traditions of public service are chilling and deserve the notice and outrage the film hopes to generate.

Franz Gayl’s is the first case presented. The Defense Department civilian employee was punished for his efforts to save the lives of U.S. troops at war.

“Hundreds of Marines were tragically lost and probably thousands maimed unnecessarily, so I said, let’s replace the Humvees with what are called MRAPs, Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles,” he says in the film.

After taking his concerns to Pentagon officials with no luck, he went to the news media. Then the blowback hit. He was stripped of his security clearance, the lifeline for national security workers, and suspended.

“They were using all these personnel actions against me,” he said. “I’m the substandard employee, bottom 3 percent, unreliable, untrustworthy, et cetera, et cetera. After investigations and after all these personnel actions and reprisals, I was placed on administrative leave.

“I was fearful. If I have to leave the government now and I don’t have security clearances, we’re gonna have to move away. I can’t get a job around here. You can’t do anything without a security clearance around [the] D.C. area. I knew that life was gonna go ‘foof,’ fall off a cliff.”

Gayl was fortunate to have whistleblower advocates who cushioned his fall. And in November 2011, after intervention by an Office of Special Counsel that was re-energized by Obama, the military’s threat to suspend Gayl indefinitely was lifted and his security clearance was reinstated.

There’s a lot left out of his story in this space, and similar stories of other whistleblowers can’t be mentioned at all. Gayl’s is a distressing tale of Uncle Sam playing the bully, making life hell for a federal employee who fought to better protect American troops.

“I’m now working back at the Pentagon in the office from which I was removed,” Gayl says at the end of the film. “I feel very lucky, because I received a lot of support from a lot of outsiders that I don’t think every person in my situation gets.”

The film makes you wonder how many more trampled, and largely unknown, federal whistleblowers like Gayl are out there.

According to the speakers, a significant amount of the opposition to immigration reform is being led by liberals, environmentalists and pro-abortion and eugenics activists worried about population growth.

“[T]he primary leaders and funders of the anti-immigration movement were drawn to it because they were also active organizers and supporters of, and contributors to, the population-control movement in the United States,” Mario Lopez, a speaker on the call, recently wrote. Lopez is President of the Hispanic Leadership Fund. Lopez was joined on the call by Josh Culling, with Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform.

This ad hominem argument is both inane and irrelevant. People come into issues from all kinds of vantage points. I have no doubt that there active immigration reform opponents who are liberals or have overblown worries about population growth. Those views, however, don’t discredit what they may say on a different issue. Nor do those views discredit what people without those views believe on an issue.

Friday’s call was a leftist tactic to discount what millions of Americans feel about an issue because some other people hold views with which they would disagree. It was reminiscent of the media’s attempt to smear the entire Tea Party movement because a handful of people said or did something stupid.

Even if one were to cede the premise that an entire infrastructure to oppose immigration reform were built by population control activists, the fact is immaterial to the concerns many have about the legislation before the Senate. Even if you support expansive legal immigration, it is a bad bill. Its fatal flaw is that it doesn’t secure the border or increase enforcement in any meaningful way. One doesn’t have to be a population control zealot to see the fundamental problem with that approach.

Surely, the speakers would hopefully acknowledge, there are many opposed to the Senate bill who don’t believe in population control. I would wager the overwhelming majority of Americans who have concerns about the bill are not advocates of abortion or eugenics to control the population. So, why are the views of a decided minority relevant to an issue with national implications?

The richest irony of the call was that the speakers are allies of groups like SEIU and La Raza in supporting the specific Senate proposal. One could just as easily have a convened a press call to discuss the “history” behind these groups and why conservatives should be cautious about working with them. The speakers on the call, for example, acknowledged doing at least some work with the National Immigration Forum, which has received considerable funding from George Soros’ Open Society Institute. Is that the proper alliance for a conservative?

No one should schedule such a call, however. Issues should be decided on merits, not ad hominem aspersions about someone else’s motives. The call was an attempt to smear all opposition to the Senate bill as arising out of the questionable beliefs of a few people. It was an attempt to quash, rather than foster, debate on the underlying merits of the proposal.

The call also perpetuated a dangerously false choice. Conservatives should either accept legislation largely written by Sen. Chuck Schumer or be labeled as against reform. That our allies are forcing this choice is unconscionable."

Putin says Snowden can stay if he stops leaking intel

Snowden letter thanks Ecuador for help getting to Russia

There are unconfirmed reports the NSA bugged EU offices

MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier Monday that Snowden would have to stop leaking U.S. secrets if he wanted to be granted asylum in Russia, where Snowden has been hiding out for eight days.

Putin insisted that Russia is not going to extradite Snowden to the USA, refusing a demand from President Obama that he be handed over to the USA to face charges of espionage.

""There is one condition if he wants to remain here: He must stop his work aimed at damaging our American partners. As odd as it may sound coming from me,"" Putin told a news conference in Moscow.

""Russia has never extradited anyone and is not going to do so,"" Putin said, adding that Snowden, ""should choose his final destination and go there.""

Snowden released a statement Monday through the web site WikiLeaks critical of Obama for asking Russia to send him back after he said the president vowed not to engage in ""wheeling and dealing"" over his return.

""This kind of deception from a world leader is not justice, and neither is the extralegal penalty of exile,"" stated Snowden, who U.S. passport has been revoked. ""These are the old, bad tools of political aggression. Their purpose is to frighten, not me, but those who would come after me.""

Obama said last week that he would not offer special inducements to other nations over a routine matter of law enforcement that should be honored as part of international law. He has said the NSA secret surveillance programs that Snowden made public are legal and proper, aimed only at disrupting terrorist plots.

Snowden insisted Monday that he is a whistle-blower who should be allowed to go where he pleases and compared himself to Army Pvt. Bradley Manning, who is being court-martialed for sending secret diplomatic communications on Iraq and Afghanistan to WikiLeaks.

The 30-year-old Snowden still appears to be holed up in Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, where he landed after fleeing Hong Kong. Interfax news agency quoted consular desk official Kim Shevchenko as saying that British citizen Sarah Harrison -- an aide to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange -- asked the Russian Foreign Ministry on Monday to grant Snowden political asylum.

The reported request comes after Ecuador hedged on whether it would grant Snowden protection as it has Assange, who is hiding out in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden on rape charges. The Los Angeles Times reported Monday that Snowden had given Russian diplomats a list of 15 countries to which he would like to apply for political asylum.

Meanwhile, the office of Germany's federal prosecutor said it is launching a preliminary inquiry into allegations from Snowden that U.S. intelligence agencies tapped European communication channels.

German news weekly Der Spiegel set off a diplomatic row when it reported that the NSA had bugged EU offices in Washington, New York and Brussels. The report cited secret U.S. documents allegedly obtained by the Snowden before he fled the United States.

Germany said it planned to call in the U.S. ambassador for an explanation over the ""breach in trust.""

""We're no longer in the Cold War,"" government spokesman Steffen Seibert told USA TODAY. ""Eavesdropping on friends is unacceptable.""

Seibert said the government will assess the facts to determine whether there had been a breach of national security. Secretary of State John Kerry said he did know all the particulars about allegations that the U.S. bugged EU offices. But he says many nations engaged in international affairs undertake lots of different kinds of activities to protect their national interests.

""The (German) foreign ministry must be shocked and horrified that it was put in with that company,"" said Ben Tonra, a professor at the University College Dublin who specializes on European security issues.

Tonra said European leaders are well aware that all governments including their own spy on each other, but the revelations if accurate could force European governments to react publicly in ways that harm relations.

Other European officials reacted angrily to Der Spiegel reports that the NSA was spying on the European Union including the Justus Lipsius building in Brussels -- home to the European Council.

""We still need more information, but If it's true, it's a huge scandal,"" said Martin Schulz, head of the European Parliament. ""It means a huge strain on relations between the EU and the U.S. and we now demand a comprehensive explanation.""

Snowden indicated he may reveal more about the NSA programs that he gained access to while working for a private contractor that provided analytical services to the NSA.

""I remain free and able to publish information that serves the public interest,"" Snowden said in an undated Spanish-language letter sent to President Rafael Correa of Ecuador, seen by Reuters.

While he was adamant that the American people do not hold these heinous acts against “entire groups of people,” he did not mention radical Islam at all.

In a stoic Friday evening address that was in contrast to the jubilant atmosphere on Boston’s streets, Obama spoke of the “resolve and determination” of those in Boston, sent his condolences to the family of the MIT police officer who was murdered on Friday by the suspects, and praised Boston’s police officers.

He vowed to “determine what happened” and find “any associations these terrorists may have had.” Obama also said, “we’ve seen the character of this country” during this “tough week” and that the people of Boston refused to be intimidated and Americans “refuse to be terrorized.”

He became most animated, though, when speaking about how Americans should not “latch on to any bit of information sometimes to jump to conclusions” before facts are “relentlessly” gathered.

“That’s why we take care not to rush to judgement, not about the motivations of these individuals and certainly not about entire groups of people,” Obama said.

Contrary to what Obama and the mainstream media may think, Americans do not “rush to judgment” without any evidence. In this case, there has already been plenty of pieces of evidence to suggest radical Islam may have influenced the suspected bombers, especially older brother Tamerlan.

In an interview with Russia Today, the mother of the suspects said the FBI “were scared of my oldest son” because “they always told me he’s a leader,” and they were “afraid of him because, you know, he is a leader, he talks about Islam a lot.”

She said her eldest son got involved in “religious politics” five years ago, and the FBI was scared of him because of the information he was getting from “extremist” websites.

But the mother, perhaps like Obama, seemed to be in denial by claiming her sons could not be involved in Jihad and were “set up” by the FBI. The mother claimed the sons would have told her of the terrorist attacks if they really, in her mind, had intended to bomb the Boston Marathon.

On Monday evening, in his first address to the nation after the Boston Marathon bombings, Obama did not refer to the bombings as terrorism. Immediately after he spoke, the White House had to issue a statement that they considered the bombings an “act of terror.”

Obama had to clean up the mess on Tuesday and do damage control in what seemed like a press conference that was called just so Obama could say the words “act of terror” on camera.

Robert Baer, a former CIA official, said on Friday that that there is a “cultural fight” between radical Islam and the West, and the older brother may have “identified with Jihadism” when “he found religion and wanted to defend Islam” because “it gave him meaning.” Even Piers Morgan, Even Piers Morgan, who is largely sympathetic to Obama and his agenda, discussed the suspected bomber’s potential ties to radical Islam on Friday evening.

But the Obama administration consistently seems to be either oblivious to or dismissive of the threat of global Jihad. And while Obama has rightfully warned Americans not to make judgments without evidence, Obama has too often ignored evidence of radical Islam’s influence.

For instance, the Obama administration refused to call the Fort Hood massacre an act of terror, instead referring to it as “workplace violence.” He also took three days to address the nation after the attempted Christmas Day airplane bombing in 2009."

The recent revelations about the National Security Agency's vast powers of surveillance have served to reaffirm, if any such thing was needed, the value of leaks and whistleblowers to both journalism and to democracy.

On Wednesday morning, Americans knew next to nothing about the extent to which their government was collecting data about them. By Friday morning, the country's director of national intelligence had confirmed the existence of a program that, in the words of the Washington Post, involved the NSA ""tapping directly into the central servers of nine leading U.S. Internet companies, extracting audio and video chats, photographs, e-mails, documents, and connection logs that enable analysts to track foreign targets.""

Americans learned about these things because there were people inside the government who were willing to leak them, and journalists who were willing to report on them. At a time when the Justice Department's surveillance of journalists has aroused deep anger, the flood of new information about the NSA's activities is a reminder of the vital need for those journalists to be able to do their jobs without fear.

The Guardian's explosive piece on Wednesday about the NSA's continual tracking of Verizon customers was a classic leak story. Glenn Greenwald, the blogger who broke the news for the paper, told the Times that his source was ""a reader of mine"" who ""knew the views that I had and had an expectation of how I would display them.""

That leak then inspired more reporting, as leaks often do. People could watch media outlets trying to outgun each other on Thursday as they sought to round out the story of the surveillance programs.

They could read the Wall Street Journal's report that AT&T and Sprint were also involved in the data-mining program, or watch an NBC News segment which said that ""a secret surveillance program is collecting the telephone records of every single one of us.""

They could learn that two senators had been sending cryptic warnings to them for years about how horrified they might be if they learned about the extent of the surveillance.

They could hear people they had voted into office admit that the program had been ongoing for seven years.

On Thursday, the Post and the Guardian upped the stakes when they reported about the so-called ""PRISM"" program that accessed the Internet companies (including AOL, HuffPost's parent company). Again, it was a classic whistleblowing case, as the Post vividly reported.

The paper identified its source as a ""career intelligence officer"" who had been horrified about what he was seeing:

Firsthand experience with these systems, and horror at their capabilities, is what drove a career intelligence officer to provide PowerPoint slides about PRISM and supporting materials to The Washington Post in order to expose what he believes to be a gross intrusion on privacy. “They quite literally can watch your ideas form as you type,” the officer said.

It appears likely, if reports are to be believed, that that officer will be hunted down by the government whose secrets he has just exposed.

All of this information was completely secret on Wednesday morning. Two days later, the entire federal government apparatus had been forced to acknowledge its existence, and hundreds of millions people were much more aware of the huge size of the American surveillance state. As the Associated Press's Matt Apuzzo tweeted, ""THIS is why America needs 'leakers.'"""
http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2013/06/01/judge-orders-google-to-give-customer-data-to-fbi/,2013-06-01 00:00:00,[],Judge orders Google to turn over customer data to FBI,"A federal judge has ruled that Google Inc. must comply with the FBI's warrantless demands for customer data, rejecting the company's argument that the government's practice of issuing so-called national security letters to telecommunication companies, Internet service providers, banks and others was unconstitutional and unnecessary.

FBI counter-terrorism agents began issuing the secret letters, which don't require a judge's approval, after Congress passed the USA Patriot Act in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

The letters are used to collect unlimited kinds of sensitive, private information, such as financial and phone records and have prompted complaints of government privacy violations in the name of national security. Many of Google's services, including its dominant search engine and the popular Gmail application, have become daily habits for millions of people.

In a ruling written May 20 and obtained Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Susan Illston ordered Google to comply with the FBI's demands.

But she put her ruling on hold until the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals could decide the matter. Until then, the Mountain View, Calif.-based company must comply with the letters unless it shows the FBI didn't follow proper procedures in making its demands for customer data in the 19 letters Google is challenging, she said.

After receiving sworn statements from two top-ranking FBI officials, Illston said she was satisfied that 17 of the 19 letters were issued properly. She wanted more information on two other letters.

It was unclear from the judge's ruling what type of information the government sought to obtain with the letters. It was also unclear who the government was targeting.

The decision from the San Francisco-based Illston comes several months after she ruled in a separate case brought by the Electronic Frontier Foundation over the letters. She ruled in March that the FBI's demand that recipients refrain from telling anyone — including customers — that they had received the letters was a violation of free speech rights.

Kurt Opsah, an attorney with the foundation, said it could be many more months before the appeals court rules on the constitutionality of the letters in the Google case.

""We are disappointed that the same judge who declared these letters unconstitutional is now requiring compliance with them,"" Opsah said on Friday.

Illston's May 20 order omits any mention of Google or that the proceedings have been closed to the public. But the judge said ""the petitioner"" was involved in a similar case filed on April 22 in New York federal court.

Public records show that on that same day, the federal government filed a ""petition to enforce National Security Letter"" against Google after the company declined to cooperate with government demands.

Google can still appeal Illston's decision. The company declined comment Friday.

In 2007, the Justice Department's inspector general found widespread violations in the FBI's use of the letters, including demands without proper authorization and information obtained in non-emergency circumstances. The FBI has tightened oversight of the system.

The FBI made 16,511 national security letter requests for information regarding 7,201 people in 2011, the latest data available."

Under sweeping subpoenas, Justice Department obtained AP phone records in leak investigation

By Sari Horwitz,

In a sweeping and unusual move, the Justice Department secretly obtained two months’ worth of telephone records of journalists working for the Associated Press as part of a year-long investigation into the disclosure of classified information about a failed al-Qaeda plot last year.

The AP’s president said Monday that federal authorities obtained cellular, office and home telephone records of individual reporters and an editor; AP general office numbers in Washington, New York and Hartford, Conn.; and the main number for AP reporters covering Congress. He called the Justice Department’s actions a “massive and unprecedented intrusion” into newsgathering activities.

The aggressive investigation into the possible disclosure of classified information to the AP is part of a pattern in which the Obama administration has pursued current and former government officials suspected of releasing secret material. Six officials have been prosecuted, more than under all previous administrations combined.

In a letter to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., the AP’s president and chief executive, Gary B. Pruitt, said that the Justice Department sought information beyond what could be justified by any specific probe and demanded that the government return the phone records and destroy all copies.

“There can be no possible justification for such an overbroad collection of the telephone communications of The Associated Press and its reporters,” Pruitt wrote to Holder. “These records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources across all of the newsgathering activities undertaken by the AP during a two-month period, provide a road map to AP’s newsgathering operations, and disclose information about AP’s activities and operations that the government has no conceivable right to know.”

The inquiry is one of two leak investigations ordered last June by Holder. The second involves a New York Times report about the Stuxnet computer worm, which was developed jointly by the United States and Israel to damage nuclear centrifuges at Iran’s main uranium-enrichment plant.

The two leak inquiries were started after Republicans in Congress accused the Obama administration of orchestrating news stories intended to demonstrate the president’s toughness on terrorism and improve his chance for reelection. The Republicans sought a special prosecutor, but Holder instead named two veteran prosecutors to handle the inquiries.

In the AP case, the news organization and its reporters and editors are not the likely targets of the investigation. Rather, the inquiry is probably aimed at current or former government officials who divulged classified information.

But experts said the scope of the records secretly seized from the AP and its reporters goes beyond the known scale of previous leak probes.

“This investigation is broader and less focused on an individual source or reporter than any of the others we’ve seen,” said Steven Aftergood, a government secrecy expert at the Federation of American Scientists. “They have swept up an entire collection of press communications. It’s an astonishing assault on core values of our society.”

The office of the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia on Monday released a statement saying it is not required to notify a media organization in advance of issuing such subpoenas if doing so “would pose a substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation.”

“We take seriously our obligations to follow all applicable laws, federal regulations, and Department of Justice policies when issuing subpoenas for phone records of media organizations,” said a statement from Bill Miller, spokesman for the office. “Those regulations require us to make every reasonable effort to obtain information through alternative means before even considering a subpoena for the phone records of a member of the media.”

Justice Department guidelines require that subpoenas of records from news organizations must be approved personally by the attorney general. Holder’s office did not reply to repeated requests for comment.

Lucy A. Dalglish, dean of the journalism school at the University of Maryland, said she thought the scope of the seizure was unprecedented. “Unfortunately, the Justice Department does this now and again,” said Dalglish, former executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. “What’s very unusual is the scope of the subpoenas.”

Republicans also quickly condemned the targeting of journalists and sought to portray the Justice Department’s actions as part of a pattern of Obama administration overreach, noting that the Internal Revenue Service was already enmeshed in a scandal over the reported targeting of conservative groups.

“Coming within a week of revelations that the White House lied to the American people about the Benghazi attacks and the IRS targeted conservative Americans for their political beliefs, Americans should take notice that top Obama administration officials increasingly see themselves as above the law and emboldened by the belief that they don’t have to answer to anyone,” said Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) said in a statement that he is “very troubled by these allegations” and wants to hear the government’s explanation. “The burden is always on the government when they go after private information — especially information regarding the press or its confidential sources,” Leahy said. “I want to know more about this case, but on the face of it, I am concerned that the government may not have met that burden.”

In the AP investigation, Pruitt said, the Justice Department obtained the records without notifying his news organization or narrowing the scope of its subpoenas to specific matters relevant to an ongoing investigation.

The story at issue included details of a CIA operation in Yemen that foiled an al-Qaeda plot in the spring of 2012 to set off a bomb on an airplane headed to the United States. The April and May 2012 phone records of the reporters and editor of the story were among the material seized by the Justice Department.

Pruitt said that on Friday, the AP’s general counsel, Laura Malone, received a letter from Ronald C. Machen Jr., the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, who was appointed by Holder to lead the AP inquiry. He said that last year, the Justice Department obtained telephone records for more than 20 separate phone lines assigned to the AP and its journalists.

A grand jury based in Washington’s federal court has been investigating the possible leak of classified information to the AP for several months, according to a government official familiar with the probe who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing case.

In most cases when investigators seek information about a media organization’s source, the news organization moves to quash any subpoena for its records. But in this case, the AP was not aware that the records had been obtained.

Law enforcement officials say leak cases are difficult because hundreds of people often have access to the classified information. In the AP case, knowledge of the details of the al-Qaeda plot would have been highly compartmentalized, which would limit the number of people with access to it. A former government investigator said telephone records could be valuable in narrowing the pool of suspected leakers.

Numerous senior government officials have been interviewed in connection with the investigation into the AP story. Among those questioned was John O. Brennan, who served as Obama’s counterterrorism adviser before becoming CIA director this year.

In his confirmation hearing in February, Brennan said he had cooperated voluntarily with the Justice Department and had been interviewed. He acknowledged speaking to former U.S. government officials who work as commentators on television news, but he denied sharing any classified information.

That responsibility lies with the members of Congress who voted for the PATRIOT Act, as well as extensions of it and the provisions related to collecting those records. Over 100 people currently serving in the House and Senate voted for the original Act in 2001. Last year, over 300 voted to extend a key provision.

We looked at seven Congressional actions generally and five in particular to assess how the government's power to collect data has evolved. From October 2001 to last December, Congress continually voted to expand or continue the government's power to collect private data, ostensibly to bolster efforts to stop terrorist activity. In addition to the PATRIOT Act, Congress has also renewed provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA — the law that established the court which issued the Verizon order.

There have been attempts to revise or curtail the rules, from their inception. In 2011, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky tried to amend the PATRIOT Act to limit its power. Last year, senators attempted to halt FISA data collection. In neither case did the rules pass.

Lonnie Snowden was ""reasonably confident"" his son, who faces espionage charges in the United States for alleged leaking of secret surveillance information, would return if certain conditions were met, the June 27 letter said. It was written by a lawyer on Snowden's behalf, and was obtained by Reuters.

The younger Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency, should not be detained or imprisoned before trial, should not be subject to a gag order, and should be tried in a venue of his choosing, the letter said.

Edward Snowden, a U.S. citizen, fled the United States to Hong Kong in May, a few weeks before publication in the Guardian and the Washington Post of details he said he provided about U.S. government surveillance of Internet and phone traffic.

He has not been seen since he arrived in Moscow on Sunday, but Russian officials said he was in a transit area at Sheremetyevo airport. He has requested political asylum in Ecuador.

Representatives for the Justice Department could not be reached immediately for comment on the letter.

Lonnie Snowden said he was concerned that his son was being manipulated by others, including people from the anti-government secrecy group WikiLeaks, he said in an interview on NBC television earlier on Friday.

""I am concerned about those who surround him,"" he told NBC. ""Wikileaks - if you look at past history - their focus isn't necessarily the Constitution of the United States. It's simply to release as much information as possible. So that alone is a concern for me.""

Snowden's father said he has not had contact with his son since April, NBC reported.

""I love him. I would like to have the opportunity to communicate with him. I don't want to put him in peril,"" he said in the interview.

Snowden said he did not think his son had committed treason, even though he said Edward Snowden broke U.S. laws in releasing details about the federal monitoring programs.

""He has betrayed his government, but I don't believe that he's betrayed the people of the United States,"" he said.

Six Republican amendments approved%3B five Democratic

%22We%u2019re off to a good start%2C%22 Sen. Charles Schumer says

Sen. Chuck Grassley stills says legalization first is a problem

WASHINGTON — Senators who back a sweeping immigration law said Thursday they were heartened by the first big test of the proposal in which members of both parties were allowed to make changes to the bill.

The Democratic-led Senate Judiciary Committee adopted eight amendments offered by Republicans and 13 from Democrats. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said some of the Republican amendments have helped strengthen the bill and should encourage more GOP members of Congress to consider voting for it.

""We all know this is going to be a long, hard road but we're off to a good start,"" Schumer said. ""I think our arguments are holding firm.""

But Republican critics said the bill still ignores important demands on border security that will make it difficult to pass the Senate and especially the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, saw the committee vote down one of his amendments that would have tripled the size of the Border Patrol and quadrupled the number of drones and sensors used to patrol the southwest border with Mexico.

""The American people want Congress to be serious about border security,"" Cruz said. ""That is true among Republicans and Democrats. It is true in red states and blue states. And it is with regret that the committee has consistently rejected any attempts to put real teeth in this bill to secure the border.""

Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and the ranking member on the committee, echoed the concerns of many Republicans worried that the bill allows the nation's estimted 11 million unauthorized immigrants to get legal status before the nation's borders are secured.

""No one can dispute that this bill is legalization first and security second,"" Grassley said.

Cruz's measure was one of seven GOP amendments that was voted down, compared to Democrats who did not have any of their amendments struck down.

That prompted Dan Stein, president of the Federation of American Immigration Reform, a group that opposes the bill, to call the hearing ""a complete sham of a process."" Marielena Hincapié, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, a group that supports the bill, said the senators fought off any ""poison pills"" that could doom the prospects of the bill.

The committee was focusing on the border security sections of the 867-bill during Thursday's hearing – the first of several hearings when senators are expected to vote on more than 300 amendments that have been filed.

One of the biggest changes to the bill was an amendment filed by Grassley that ensures that the Department of Homeland Security focus on securing the entire southwestern border. According to the bill, Homeland Security must monitor 100% of the border, and intercept 90% of people crossing, only in sectors deemed ""high risk."" That's defined as sectors where 30,000 people were apprehended in the previous year, and in 2012 would have included three of the nine border sectors.

Grassley's amendment requires the department to reach those goals in all border sectors.

The committee voted down a separate Grassley amendment that would have required that Homeland Security certify the entire border as secured before the nation's unauthorized immigrants can be granted temporary legal status.

The bill as written only requires that Homeland Security create and submit a plan to secure the entire border before those immigrants can apply to become ""Registered Provisional Immigrants,"" which would allow them to legally reside and work in the country.

The committee is now finished with the border security portion of the bill. They must still vote on portions that deal with legalizing the nation's 11 million unauthorized immigrants, enforcing immigration at work-sites and revamping the legal immigration system. The next hearing is scheduled for Tuesday, and there are still several ways in which any momentum on the bill may be disrupted:

The committee is set to resume hearing amendments after the lunch break and will continue throughout the day, and there still exists several ways in which any momentum on the bill may be disrupted:

Same-Sex Immigration Rights

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., filed amendments to extend immigration rights and benefits to the spouses and families of LGBT couples who are in a ""long-term committed relationship."" Immigration activists lobbied the Gang of Eight to include such provisions in their bill, but members held off. And while the idea has support from Democrats on the Judiciary committee, Republicans have warned that including the topic on an already-controversial bill could ruin any chances it has at clearing both chambers. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has said simply that adding LGBT immigration rights would ""kill the bill.""

Border Security Enhancements

Many Republicans say the bill doesn't do enough to fully secure the country's border. The last time Congress passed a comprehensive immigration bill in 1986, up to 3 million unauthorized immigrants were allowed to apply to become U.S. citizens. But the promise of border security didn't happen, leading to another wave of illegal immigration and more than 11 million unauthorized immigrants living in the country today. Republican senators, including Rep. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, have filed several amendments to require the border be certified as secure before people can get green cards and U.S. citizenship. Democrats believe the 13-year path to citizenship is already long enough and worry about putting many more barriers in front of them.

Easier Path to Citizenship

Most of the nation's 11 million unauthorized immigrants who arrived in the U.S. before Dec. 31, 2011, would be able to apply for a green card within 10 years, and U.S. citizenship within 13 years, after they have passed criminal background checks, paid taxes, learned English and civics and paid at least $2,000 in fees. But immigration activist groups, and some Democrats, feel that's too difficult a process. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., filed an amendment to move that cutoff date back to April 17, 2013, so recent arrivals aren't left out, and another one to allow young unauthorized immigrants to get a faster path. Adoption of those amendments could rankle Republicans and undermine the bill.

Who Can Benefit

The current Senate bill allows most of the nation's 11 million unauthorized immigrants to apply for temporary legal status and, eventually, full U.S. citizenship. But some Republicans, including Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., are trying to amend the bill to place some limits. Sessions, for example, has filed an amendment to bar anybody who could qualify for Medicare, Obamacare and other welfare programs from qualifying to get their green card. If the amendments prevent too many people from getting legal status, the bill could quickly lose the support of activist groups, Democrats in Congress and the Obama administration.

Workers vs. Relatives

Many of the lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have filed amendments to change the focus of the nation's future legal immigration system. Some lawmakers, such as Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, want to make it easier for companies to hire foreign, high-skilled workers. The bill already increases the number of visas and green cards granted to people with advanced degrees, but Hatch and others believe it places too many barriers in front of U.S. businesses. Adding such provisions could upset some Republicans who are worried the bill already puts U.S. workers in jeopardy. The shift away from a family-based immigration system also worries some in Congress. Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, filed an amendment to allow U.S. citizens the ability to petition for their siblings – a part of U.S. immigration law that is repealed by the Gang of Eight bill.

The strong 68-to-32 vote in the often polarized Senate tossed the issue into the House, where the Republican leadership has said that it will not take up the Senate measure and is instead focused on much narrower legislation that would not provide a path to citizenship for the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the country. Party leaders hope that the Senate action will put pressure on the House.

Leading up to the final votes, which the senators cast at their desks to mark the import of the moment, members of the bipartisan “Gang of Eight,” who drafted the framework of the legislation, took to the Senate floor to make a final argument for the measure. Among them was Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, who is one of his party’s leading Hispanic voices. When Mr. Rubio finished, the other senators in the group surrounded him on the floor, patting him on the back and offering words of encouragement. “Good job,” one said. “I’m proud of you,” another offered.

The future will show whether voters in Republican presidential primaries share that pride.

After Mitt Romney’s loss in November, top Republicans immediately began formulating a way to improve the party’s standing with Hispanics, who have flocked to Democrats. A group of top Republican political and business officials who support an immigration overhaul met at the downtown Washington office of the anti-tax leader Grover Norquist on Jan. 17 with memories of Mr. Romney’s poor showing in their minds."

As hundreds of commuters emerged from Amtrak and commuter trains at Union Station on a recent morning, an armed squad of men and women dressed in bulletproof vests made their way through the crowds. The squad was not with the Washington police department or Amtrak’s police force, but was one of the Transportation Security Administration’s Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response squads—VIPR teams for short—assigned to perform random security sweeps to prevent terrorist attacks at transportation hubs across the United States.

The Transportation Security Administration has quietly expanded itsreach beyond airports:Included in those ""transportation hubs"" are highway weigh stations, train terminals, sporting events, music festivals and ... rodeos. Next they'll presumably be making everybody take off their boots and spurs before going through metal detectors and full-body scanners set up to check out everybody's junk at the entrance of 4-H Jamborees.

More searches without probable cause because, you know, terrorism. So they'll be patting down the crowd at marathons from now on?



The VIPR teams were initiated in 2005 and the program now has a $100 million budget and 37 teams. These comprise federal marshals, bomb experts and bomb-sniffing dogs. Ron Nixon at The New York Times reports that VIPR conducted 8,800 unannounced operations outside of airports in 2012, including at the Indianapolis 500, the Democratic and Republican National Conventions.

Compiles,"At the Homeland Security Department, officials have repeatedly sought to use the security agency’s Internet and telephone databases and other resources to trace cyberattacks on American targets that are believed to have stemmed from China, Russia and Eastern Europe, according to officials. They have often been rebuffed.

Officials at the other agencies, speaking only on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the tensions, say the National Security Agency’s reluctance to allow access to data has been particularly frustrating because of post-Sept. 11 measures that were intended to encourage information-sharing among federal agencies.

In fact, a change made in 2008 in the executive order governing intelligence was intended to make it easier for the security agency to share surveillance information with other agencies if it was considered “relevant” to their own investigations. It has often been left to the national intelligence director’s office to referee the frequent disputes over how and when the security agency’s spy tools can be used. The director’s office declined to comment for this article.

Typically, the agencies request that the N.S.A. target individuals or groups for surveillance, search its databases for information about them, or share raw intelligence, rather than edited summaries, with them. If those under scrutiny are Americans, approval from the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is required.

The security agency, whose mission is to spy overseas, and the F.B.I., its main partner in surveillance operations, dominate the process as the Justice Department’s main “customers” in seeking warrants from the intelligence court, with nearly 1,800 approved by the court last year.

In a statement, the security agency said that it “works closely with all intelligence community partners, and embeds liaison officers and other personnel at those agencies for the express purpose of ensuring N.S.A. is meeting their requirements and providing support to their missions.”

The security agency’s spy tools are attractive to other agencies for many reasons. Unlike traditional, narrowly tailored search warrants, those granted by the intelligence court often allow searches through records and data that are vast in scope. The standard of evidence needed to acquire them may be lower than in other courts, and the government may not be required to disclose for years, if ever, that someone was the focus of secret surveillance operations."

Snowden used his first significant direct media contacts since arriving in Russia in June to portray his disclosure of secret intelligence gathering programs as a public service alerting Americans and people around the world to the risks those operations pose to individual privacy.

Since he fled his National Security Agency job in Hawaii and began leaking highly classified information, Snowden has been charged in the U.S. with felony espionage and theft of government property. But he is hailed as a hero by those who share his concerns that the massive NSA data sweeps in the name of counterterrorism unjustly intrude on the communications of innocent people.

Snowden said he realized he was “going in blind” when he sought to take public his complaints of excessive government monitoring, unsure whether the global audience would share his views.

“For me, in terms of personal satisfaction, the mission’s already accomplished,” he told the Post. “I already won. As soon as the journalists were able to work, everything that I had been trying to do was validated. Because, remember, I didn’t want to change society. I wanted to give society a chance to determine if it should change itself.”

The 30-year-old former NSA contractor insisted in two days of conversation with the Post’s Barton Gellman in Moscow that neither China nor Russia -- the two countries to which he fled after leaking details of NSA surveillance -- could have obtained his cache of stolen intelligence.

Snowden declined to discuss the whereabouts of the purloined files, the Post said, “but he said that he is confident he did not expose them to Chinese intelligence in Hong Kong. And he said he did not bring them to Russia.”

Snowden also denied having “loyalties to Russia or China or any country other than the United States.” He said he has “no relationship with the Russian government,” which has given him asylum on condition he cease leaking information that is damaging to the Kremlin’s “American partners.”

“If I defected at all,” Snowden is quoted as saying by the Post, “I defected from the government to the public.”

Gellman said Snowden seldom veered into his personal life during their 14 hours of discussion other than to say he mostly stays in his apartment surfing the Internet and communicating with friends. The fugitive said he survives mostly on ramen noodles and chips, and described himself as “an indoor cat.”

In the Christmas Day message he recorded for Britain’s Channel 4, an alternative to the BBC’s televised holiday address by Queen Elizabeth II, Snowden expanded on his intentions in leaking classified NSA information, Britain’s Guardian newspaper reported.

“A child born today will grow up with no conception of privacy at all. They’ll never know what it means to have a private moment to themselves, an unrecorded, unanalyzed thought,” Snowden says in the address taped in Moscow to be broadcast at 4:15 p.m. London time on Christmas Day.

“The conversation occurring today will determine the amount of trust we can place both in the technology that surrounds us and the government that regulates it,” Snowden says in a segment of the address released to the Guardian on Tuesday. “Together we can find a better balance, end mass surveillance and remind the government that if it really wants to know how we feel, asking is always cheaper than spying.”

The Guardian said Snowden’s address was filmed in Russia by American documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras. The Guardian’s Glenn Greenwald, the Post’s Gellman and Poitras have been conduits for Snowden’s NSA disclosures.

Channel 4 has been broadcasting an “alternative” to the queen’s Christmas Day address for the past 20 years, often giving a platform for a quirky or controversial figure. Then-Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad gave the address in 2008, and Marge, the fictional mother on “The Simpsons,” appeared in 2004.

Snowden refers in his turn in the television spotlight to George Orwell, the early-20th century British author of the classic dystopian novel “1984"" about government surveillance and control run amok.

“The types of collection in the book -- microphones and video cameras, TVs that watch us -- are nothing compared to what we have available today,” Snowden says of the NSA’s spying techniques. “We have sensors in our pockets that track us everywhere we go. Think about what this means for the privacy of the average person.”

Police officers guard the entrance to Franklin street during an active crime scene search for the suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings, Friday, April 19, 2013, in Watertown, Mass. (AP)

A former U.S. Department of Justice prosecutor says the federal government made a mistake in not immediately reading captured Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev his Miranda rights and instead invoking a public safety exception.

Justice Department officials confirmed to multiple news outlets Friday night that Tsarnaev did not receive a Miranda warning and instead will be questioned by a special interrogation team in the hope that he could give up more information, such as whether he and his brother acted alone or if they received training or direction from anyone abroad.

But Aitan Goelman, who served as a Justice Department attorney for nine years and prosecuted the Oklahoma City bombing case, said Saturday that he thinks the government is taking a risk in invoking the exception that says police do not need to give Tsarnaev the well-known warning and can still introduce any statements he makes in court -- because it might not hold up.

""The government is taking a chance in interviewing the suspect without reading his Miranda rights,"" Goelman said on Fox News.

The public safety exception originated in a 1980 New York case where a police officer was arresting an individual matching a suspect description from a woman who said she had just been raped. When the officer frisked the man, he found he was wearing an empty shoulder holster, and after handcuffing him, asked where the gun was. The man gestured and said, ""The gun is over there,"" at which point the officer discovered a loaded handgun. The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately ruled that the immediate need to protect the police or public from danger permitted the officer to question the man right away -- and made his pre-Mirandized statements admissible in court.

""In that case the danger to the public was immediate,"" Goelman said on Fox News. ""Here I think we're talking about potentially interviewing this guy when he wakes up in a hospital after the police have been satisfied that the immediate danger is gone. I think it's a risk...there is a chance that any statement he makes after giving an un-Mirandized statement might be suppressed [in court].""

Story continues

Goelman noted that suppressing any statements from Tsarnaev -- who became a naturalized U.S. citizen on Sept. 11, 2012 -- might not be completely detrimental to the case because the government appears to have a lot of other evidence against him already.

The public safety exception is not permanent, and is meant to run out once the questions are no longer about stopping an immediate danger to the public. Additionally, it's still unclear when Tsarnaev will be questioned -- he is said to be hospitalized in serious condition following injuries sustained in a shootout with police Thursday night, and possibly during his capture on Friday.

""There is a public safety exception in cases of national security and potential charges involving acts of terrorism, and so the government has that opportunity. Right now, though, I believe that the suspect has been taken to a hospital,"" U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz told reporters Friday night.

In the hours after Tsarnaev's capture, Glenn Beck on his Twitter account said he should absolutely be given a Miranda warning.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who had said the government should hold Tsarnaev as an ""enemy combatant"" and not read him his Miranda rights, released a joint statement late Friday with Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) reiterating that point.

""Now that the suspect is in custody, the last thing we should want is for him to remain silent. It is absolutely vital the suspect be questioned for intelligence gathering purposes. We need to know about any possible future attacks which could take additional American lives. The least of our worries is a criminal trial which will likely be held years from now,"" Graham and McCain said. ""Under the Law of War we can hold this suspect as a potential enemy combatant not entitled to Miranda warnings or the appointment of counsel. Our goal at this critical juncture should be to gather intelligence and protect our nation from further attacks.""

County officials worried about costs of immigration overhaul,"WASHINGTON — Few regions will absorb the impact of future immigration reforms more than Los Angeles County, home to an estimated 1.1 million people in the country illegally, one-tenth of the nation’s total.

As the Senate Judiciary Committee began debating the bipartisan immigration bill last week, county officials voiced concerns that local taxpayers will be “left holding the bag” to pay for the brunt of healthcare and other services for multitudes of immigrants who apply for citizenship.

Local and state officials believe the overhaul bill will encourage those in the country illegally to come out of the shadows and turn to local services during the proposed 13-year-long pathway to citizenship.

“The one thing that’s really clear as day is that the federal government is going to be protecting itself against costs, and we’re going to be left holding the bag,” said Mark Tajima, an analyst with the county’s chief administrative office.

In Washington last week for the start of the debate, county officials, including Supervisors Don Knabe and Zev Yaroslavsky, warned of a “major cost shift” to state and local governments from the proposed legislation and pressed Congress to provide federal aid to help cover future costs.

Officials could not, however, provide a figure on the potential tab. Instead, as they made the rounds on Capitol Hill, they pointed to the $800 million the county received in the last big immigration overhaul signed by President Reagan in 1986.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), after meeting with county officials, brought up the county’s concerns at the Judiciary Committee meeting and directed her staff to look into the possibility of creating a “state impact assistance” fund, similar to the $4 billion provided to local and state governments in the 1986 bill.

Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a leading critic of the bill, has cited the potential costs to taxpayers in assailing the measure.

In its current form, the bill would bar most immigrants seeking legal status from receiving federal benefits, such as food stamps and Medicaid, during the years it would take to become legal residents or U.S. citizens.

The bill requires the federal government to have a plan to gain almost total control of the border, authorizing money for drones, customs officers and prosecution of illegal entries. People now in the country without legal status would be eligible for provisional status if they paid fees, fines and taxes. They could gain legal residency 10 years after the border was declared secure. After 13 years, they would be eligible for citizenship.

The National Conference of State Legislatures is urging Congress to allocate to local and state governments some of the fees paid by applicants for legalization. The legislation, however, calls for that money to be used to secure the border, a key element for Republican support.

The proposed bill also would bar most of those applicants from receiving subsidies to buy health insurance for 10 years. These subsidies, which are part of President Obama’s 2010 health law, will be available next year to millions of low- and moderate-income Americans and legal immigrants who do not get health benefits at work.

Many of the applicants for legalization also would be ineligible for other federal benefits for more than a decade. In contrast, legal immigrants are eligible for many federal benefits after five years in the country.

Immigrant rights advocates said that because applicants for legal status will pay taxes, they should be entitled to a safety net.

“If you give them lawful status, the hope is that they will have more opportunities to provide for themselves and their families without relying on benefits,” said Sonal Ambegaokar, health policy attorney with the National Immigration Law Center in Los Angeles. “Even hard-working Americans can’t afford basic necessities these days.”

A memo to the Board of Supervisors from a top county government affairs officer said some of the provisions of the bills “would be especially unfair because newly legalized individuals would be paying taxes, fines and fees to the federal government, but state and local governments, such as the county, would have to bear most of the cost of services provided to them.”

Although the county provides emergency care to all, regardless of legal status, county officials say the legislation could significantly increase its costs for non-emergency care. They point to an estimate that up to 446,000 of such immigrants in the county have no health insurance.

Los Angeles County spends roughly $600 million a year on healthcare for immigrants in the country illegally, officials said.

States are also concerned about how they will pay for services, including English proficiency classes sought by applicants for legal status at a time when funding for such adult school programs has been cut. Community colleges and other institutions will be flooded with demand.

“For states like California and New York, there is the potential of a lot of people coming to the state and local government for assistance,” said Sheri Steisel, senior federal affairs counsel for the National Conference of State Legislatures. “Just because the federal government has decided not to provide access to federal benefit programs does not mean that the need goes away.”

County officials want Congress to create a fund similar to the $4-billion allocation in 1986 or make applicants for legal status eligible for federal benefits sooner. Some 720,000 of the 2.7 million immigrants granted amnesty nationwide as a result of the 1986 overhaul lived in Los Angeles County.

But with Washington awash in red ink and conservative lawmakers attacking the bill’s potential costs, securing such increased spending would appear a long shot.

But Steisel is hopeful, noting: “This is now a 50-state issue…. Everybody has a stake in this.”

Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, followed up the confirmation hearing with a list of questions for the nominee. (The complete questionnaire is posted below.)

In his answers to Grassley’s question about profiling for terrorism among foreign nationals, Medine wrote, “In general, profiling of foreign nationals based solely on their point of departure to the United States is inappropriate.”

The Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on February 28 of this year, approving the nomination of Medine. A vote will be held in the Senate next week. The other four nominees to the board have already been confirmed. They were asked to respond to the same questionnaire.

The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) was created in 2004 after the 9/11 Commission recommended the creation of a board to safeguard civil liberties and oversee the new authorities granted to the security agencies. The PCLOB was slow to develop, holding its first meeting in 2006. The original chair of the board, Lanny Davis, resigned citing disagreements with the White House. In 2007, legislation updated the board’s statute and established the board as an independent agency within the executive branch. Subsequent nominees were stalled for months, until 2010 when Obama nominated two members and then three additional members in 2011.

Medine’s opinion that constitutional protections against racial profiling should be extended to foreign nationals should raise serious red flags. “There may be intelligence regarding a plot being developed or partially implemented in a particular foreign country that could, under some circumstances, justify heightened scrutiny of visitors from that country linked to other information about the plot” answered Medine.

It is important to point out, that eight out of ten fugitives on the FBI’s most wanted terrorists list are foreign-born.

Medine did not answer questions about his views on Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the PATRIOT Act. He is currently an attorney fellow at the SEC and prior that, he worked at the law firm Wilmer Hale.

She was an NPR reporter from 1997-2001 and special assistant to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2010-2011.

“Are you kidding me?”

I was always stunned to hear reporters ask me — as they did half a dozen times when I worked at the Pentagon — to show them some classified document or other. They’d just pop the question blithely, unfazed, without an apparent thought for the implications. My incredulous retort would usually reap an only half-sheepish answer: “Well, I had to ask.”

Countless national security officials have had some version of this conversation – including the State Department security adviser that Fox News correspondent James Rosen allegedly plumbed for information on North Korea. Rosen wrote in an e-mail that he’d “love to see some internal State Department analyses.”

I’ve served on both sides of the line, as an NPR reporter and a Defense Department official, and it’s from that split perspective that I’ve been observing the furor over the seizure of journalists’ telephone and e-mail records in Justice Department investigations of national security leaks. Especially troubling to some reporters and pundits is a search warrant application suggesting that Rosen was “an aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator” with his source. Commentators have decried the Justice Department for criminalizing journalism itself.

The value to democracy of a courageous and unfettered press poking into back corners that agencies would rather keep hidden is incontrovertible. But I find myself wondering why journalists shouldn’t shoulder some responsibility for transgressions they often goad their sources to commit.

Every government employee who obtains a security clearance receives a briefing on the rules about accessing and using classified information, and, as part of his or her terms of employment, must sign a piece of paper acknowledging the potential consequences of violating the law. Many officials, including me, have been subjected to a polygraph exam — an exceedingly unpleasant experience for anyone with a conscience or a literal mind. National security staffers’ careers can be wrecked over how they handle documents stamped SECRET.

Reporters, on the other hand, have little to lose when trawling for leaks. No American journalist has been prosecuted for publishing classified information. And the media could gain even greater protections under a shield law or new procedures now being hammered out with the Justice Department.

I’ve heard from reporters and senior government figures alike that the Obama administration’s leak investigations are having a chilling effect on officials who normally interact with journalists. That’s unfortunate, because regular conversations about the business of government, as well as the injection of alternative perspectives by way of the questions reporters ask, or their reflections on what they hear, are critical to a healthy state.

But the stakes might be clearer if sources knew that reporters had skin in the game, too: if they understood that journalists weren’t asking questions idly — in hopes of a passing scoop, or even happy to be made use of in some messaging campaign — but because the information is so critical to the public interest that they are willing to risk repercussions for finding and airing it.

Comparatively unfettered though the press may be in the United States, its courage is frequently lacking. Washington relationships cemented by orchestrated leaks and background innuendo can verge on the sycophantic. Then again, government disingenuousness has also been on display in the current imbroglio.

Far too much information is protected by unwarranted classification. It’s hard to take a system seriously that places so many gigabytes of material that are not critical to national security under the same umbrella as the few nuggets that are. I’ve seen a New Yorker article included among prep documents for a National Security Council meeting stamped SECRET//NOFORN (meaning that only cleared U.S. citizens were allowed to read it). I’ve had a colleague contradict a sunny e-mail he sent me on the unclassified system with a SECRET snarl. Such misuse makes a mockery of rules that the leak investigations seek to enforce.

At least as troubling is the double standard that has seemed to apply in the recent investigations. The six criminal prosecutions under the Obama administration have all targeted working-level government employees. Meanwhile, senior officials leak — or authorize leaks — with impunity.

In September 2010, a flurry of coverage in major U.S. newspapers reported a supposed government decision on how corruption in Afghanistan would be handled. Perusing the articles with growing wonder, I looked down at a memo on my desk. Not only were passages quoted from it classified, the document was also watermarked DRAFT. No decision had been made yet because debate on the draft had not even reached the level of Cabinet secretaries. It was a classic Washington case of offensive leaking. For months, I was convinced that the perpetrator was the late Richard Holbrooke, then special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan. But I kept asking reporters. Finally I traced the leak to a senior White House official, whose career has progressed untroubled.

Last year, Washington Post columnist David Ignatius was given an exclusive preview of 17 redacted documents that had been retrieved from Osama bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Ignatius wrote that the documents had been declassified but had not yet been made available to the public. More than six weeks later, those 17 documents — and only those 17, out of some 1.5 million scooped up at Abbottabad — were released. How does such selectivity square with a coherent declassification policy?

Perhaps the most remarkable example of disclosure of classified information in plain sight was the detail offered up to the media in the wake of the raid that killed bin Laden — capped off by briefings from then-White House chief counterterrorism adviser John Brennan. The superfluous specificity left a number of officials who had helped plan the raid aghast, including a longtime Washington insider, then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates.

The law, including regulations protecting national security secrets, should be taken seriously, and decisions to break it for reasons of conscience should not be taken lightly. But by the same token, the law should not be stretched for purposes far beyond its original, legitimate intent. And most important, it should be applied equally to all who vow to uphold it.

UPDATE: Saturday, June 1, 2013. Sarah Chayes writes: Thanks to all who have contributed great comments. This is just the type of debate such a fraught issue should generate. One thing I regret in this piece is not taking my argument about over-classification beyond criticism. Could any of you -- particularly with government experience -- suggest practical recommendations for how to reduce the amount of material that gets classified, and how to change the incentives for over-classification? Who should issue what directives? What type of implementation and follow-up mechanisms would have to be designed? Let’s use the comments forum to start hammering out a solution to this long-festering problem.

For years the disturbing answer from the Obama administration and hard-line states like Arizona has been: absolutely. Each has tried in its own way to expand the role of local law enforcement in catching unauthorized immigrants and feeding the deportation pipeline.

But states and cities are rejecting the blurring of a once-bright line that separated local cops and federal immigration agents. They recognize that a broken immigration system has stranded many people outside the law, but know that many have lived here for years, with clean records and citizen children, and would be on track to become Americans if the legislation now stalled in Congress ever passes. Deporting millions of harmless people — current taxpayers, future citizens — is a misguided mission for the nation. For the local police, it’s a costly and dangerous diversion from their main job: preventing crime and catching criminals.

California and New Orleans are two places tackling this question, with encouraging results. New Orleans has just settled a lengthy court battle to rein in a sheriff who had turned his jail cells into long-term holding pens for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A bill now moving through the California Legislature would strictly limit the role of local law enforcement in feeding inmates to ICE. Serious criminals would still be turned over for deportation, but others in jail for minor offenses would not be held on ICE’s behalf.

The New Orleans case involves a civil rights lawsuit brought by two immigrant workers who served short sentences for minor crimes, then languished in prison for months waiting for ICE to pick them up. The sheriff of Orleans Parish, Marlin Gusman, complied with an ICE request to hold the men, Mario Cacho and Antonio Ocampo, over possible immigration violations. Such requests, called detainers, are supposed to have a time limit: ICE has 48 hours to take an inmate into custody. But Mr. Cacho was held for more than 160 days; Mr. Ocampo more than 90. There were no federal charges against either of them."

(CNN) —

A federal civil complaint in Texas claims the defendants may have falsified prescriptions, lied to pharmacies and perhaps even broken the law, but they’re not drug runners.

They’re officials from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, responsible for executing death row inmates.

The complaint, filed in October, is one example of the lengths death-penalty states are willing to go to acquire drugs for lethal injections.

Texas, which declined to comment on the pending case, is among 32 death-penalty states scrambling to find new drug protocols after European-based manufacturers banned U.S. prisons from using their drugs in executions – among them, Danish-based Lundbeck, which manufactures pentobarbital.

“The states are scrambling to find the drugs,” says Richard Dieter, executive director of the Washington-based Death Penalty Information Center. “They want to carry out these executions that they have scheduled, but they don’t have the drugs and they’re changing and trying new procedures never used before in the history of executions.”

States have been forced to try new drug combinations or go to loosely regulated compounding pharmacies that manufacturer variations of the drugs banned by the larger companies. The suit against Texas alleges the state corrections department falsified a prescription for pentobarbital, including the patient name as “James Jones,” the warden of the Huntsville Unit “where executions take place,” according to court documents. Additionally, the drugs were to be sent to “Huntsville Unit Hospital,” which, the documents say, “has not existed since 1983.”

The suit said the pharmacy was unaware of the purpose for the order and when it found out it canceled the order before it was filled.

In a letter obtained by CNN, dated October 4 of this year, Woodlands Compounding Pharmacy, which was requested to provide drugs to Texas officials says it believed its “information would be kept on the ‘down low’” by the TDCJ.”

The plaintiffs also allege the state did not produce a purchase order, instead using an individual employee’s credit card to make the purchase.

The pharmacy is asking the TDCJ to return the drugs it sold the state. It is unclear whether they have.

Maurie Levin, one of the attorneys representing the inmates, said, “We believe that TDCJ’s purchase of compounded pentobarbital from Woodlands Pharmacy violates numerous state laws. The vast majority of compounded drugs can only be mixed or sold pursuant to a doctor’s prescription. TDCJ did not get a prescription for its purchase of compounded drugs. There are exceptions to the requirement, but TDCJ’s purchase does not qualify for any of them.”

In September, Texas even turned to another state, Virginia, for a supply of Nembutal, according to documents provided to CNN by Berkeley Law staff attorney Jen Moreno.

Death row inmates say using untested drugs is “cruel and unusual punishment,” and several have filed federal lawsuits to delay executions until drug protocols have been reviewed.

Ohio was set to execute Ron Phillips on Thursday using a two-drug cocktail never before used in an execution. Ohio’s Department of Rehabilitation and Correction said it “was unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of pentobarbital.” Instead it was set to use the sedative midazolam and pain-killer hydromorphone in a lethal dosage.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich stayed Phillips’ execution this week pending a review of possible organ donation to his family members.

Missouri was set to use propofol, the infamous drug from the Michael Jackson case, in an execution last month, but the governor halted it after he was warned the European Union might halt shipments of the drug, leading to shortages for medical purposes.

Deborah Denno, a law professor at Fordham University, said a new combination of drugs used in the execution of Florida inmate William Happ last month took 14 minutes to kill him instead of the usual seven.

“There is absolute chaos among the states,” Denno said. “So, every few months it seems we see a different state using a different type of drug, or types of drugs.”

Jim Petro, the Republican former attorney general of Ohio, presided over 19 executions but no longer supports the death penalty. “An attorney general is bound to follow the statute,” he said. “Duty is duty.”

Dieter said using untested drugs amounts to experimentation on human beings: “They’re guilty people who did these crimes, but that doesn’t ameliorate our ethical obligations.”"

According to journalist Todd Miller, author of “Border Patrol Nation: Dispatches From the Front Lines of Homeland Security,” the U.S. spent $90 billion on border enforcement in the decade after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In 2012, the immigration and border enforcement budget was $18 billion. The immigration bill now being debated in Congress would spend an additional $40 billion and would raise the number of Border Patrol agents to 40,000. That is 10 times the number of agents in service in the early 1990s.

The rush to beef up security after 9/11 was driven by the new fear that terrorists would creep into the country and by the longtime concern about thousands of undocumented immigrants sneaking up from Latin America. Arguably, the dramatically increased surveillance and interdiction has contributed to a sharp drop in illegal immigration and, so far, no terrorists have been discovered trying to cross from Mexico or Canada.

But the new, massive round of spending being proposed may have less to do with terrorists or Mexicans -- those concerns seem to have been met -- than with defense contractors who see America’s wars winding down. Border security is a new cash cow for them, and the more security they can sell, the more profit they will make, even if that security is unnecessary and redundant.

Effectively, both our southern and northern borders are already militarized. If even more manpower and equipment are added, we may have a lot of guys with guns without enough to keep them busy. Miller reports that, already, regular citizens in border areas are feeling as if they live in a war zone where random searches are increasingly common and border agents turn up on private property challenging the right of residents to be on their own land.

In 2008, Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy was stopped at a checkpoint 125 miles from the Canadian border, ordered out of his car and asked to prove his citizenship. Leahy said he asked the federal agent who initiated the stop by what authority he was acting. According to the senator, the agent pointed to his gun and said, “That’s all the authority I need.”

This year, Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, added a provision to the immigration bill that would disallow checkpoint searches beyond a 25-mile distance from the border. “The wide latitude in current law for setting up checkpoints far from our borders has led to maximum hassles of law-abiding local residents, with minimal value to border enforcement,” Leahy said in a statement.

Leahy’s provision, by the way, only applies to the northern border. Law-abiding residents of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas will get no such relief -- unless, of course, one of their senators gets pulled over for no good reason by any of the thousands of new Border Patrol agents looking for something to do."

Edward Snowden comes forward as source of NSA leaks

By Barton Gellman, Aaron Blake and Greg Miller,

A 29-year-old man who says he is a former undercover CIA employee said Sunday that he was the principal source of recent disclosures about ­top-secret National Security Agency programs, exposing himself to possible prosecution in an acknowledgment that had little if any precedent in the long history of U.S. intelligence leaks.

Edward Snowden, a tech specialist who has contracted for the NSA and works for the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, unmasked himself as a source after a string of stories in The Washington Post and the Guardian that detailed previously unknown U.S. surveillance programs. He said he disclosed secret documents in response to what he described as the systematic surveillance of innocent citizens.

In an interview Sunday, Snowden said he is willing to face the consequences of exposure.

“I’m not going to hide,” Snowden told The Post from Hong Kong, where he has been staying. “Allowing the U.S. government to intimidate its people with threats of retaliation for revealing wrongdoing is contrary to the public interest.”

Asked whether he believes that his disclosures will change anything, he said: “I think they already have. Everyone everywhere now understands how bad things have gotten — and they’re talking about it. They have the power to decide for themselves whether they are willing to sacrifice their privacy to the surveillance state.”

Snowden said nobody had been aware of his actions, including those closest to him. He said there was no single event that spurred his decision to leak the information, but he said President Obama has failed to live up to his pledges of transparency.

“My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them,” he said in a note that accompanied the first document he leaked to The Post.

The Guardian was the first to publicly identify Snowden, at his request.

The White House said late Sunday that it would not have any comment on the matter.

In a brief statement, a spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the intelligence community is “reviewing the damage” the leaks have done. “Any person who has a security clearance knows that he or she has an obligation to protect classified information and abide by the law,” said the spokesman, Shawn Turner.

Snowden said he is seeking “asylum from any countries that believe in free speech and oppose the victimization of global privacy,” but the law appears to provide for his extradition from Hong Kong, a semiautonomous territory of China, to the United States.

Although any extradition proceeding could take months or even years, experts said Snowden has not put himself in a favorable position.

“The fact that he outed himself and basically said, from what I understand he has said, ‘I feel very comfortable with what I have done’ . . . that’s not going to help him in his extradition contest,” said Douglas McNabb, a lawyer and extradition expert.

The Justice Department said it is in the “initial stages of an investigation” into the unauthorized disclosure of classified information but declined to comment further.



A stunning revelation

Current and former U.S. intelligence officials said the revelation of Snowden’s role in the leaks will lead to a sweeping reexamination of security measures at the CIA and the NSA, and they described his decision to come forward as a stunning conclusion to a week of disclosures that rattled the intelligence community.

“This is significant on a number of fronts: the scope, the range. It’s major, it’s major,” said John Rizzo, a former general counsel of the CIA who worked at the agency for decades. “And then to have him out himself . . . I can’t think of any previous leak case involving a CIA officer where the officer raised his hand and said, ‘I’m the guy.’ ”

A half-dozen former intelligence officials, including one who now works at Booz Allen Hamilton, said they did not know Snowden or anything about his background. Several former officials said he easily could have been part of a surge in computer experts and technical hires brought in by the CIA in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks as its budget and mission swelled.

“Like a lot of things after 9/11, they just went on a hiring binge, and in the technical arena young, smart nerds were in high demand,” a former U.S. intelligence official said. “There were battalions of them.”

Officials said the CIA and other spy agencies did not relax their screening measures as the workforce expanded. Still, several officials said the CIA will now undoubtedly begin reviewing the process by which Snowden may have been hired, seeking to determine whether there were any missed signs that he might one day betray national secrets.

More broadly, the CIA and the NSA may be forced to reexamine their relationships with contractors, who were employed in roles ranging from technical support to paramilitary operations before concerns about the outsourcing of such sensitive assignments prompted a backlash in Congress and pledges from the agencies to begin thinning their contracting ranks.

Some former CIA officials said they were troubled by aspects of Snowden’s background, at least as he described it to The Post and the Guardian.

For instance, Snowden said he did not have a high school diploma. One former CIA official said that it was extremely unusual for the agency to have hired someone with such thin academic credentials, particularly for a technical job, and that the terms Snowden used to describe his agency positions did not match internal job descriptions.

Snowden’s claim to have been placed under diplomatic cover for a position in Switzerland after an apparently brief stint at the CIA as a systems administrator also raised suspicion. “I just have never heard of anyone being hired with so little academic credentials,” the former CIA official said. The agency does employ technical specialists in overseas stations, the former official said, “but their breadth of experience is huge, and they tend not to start out as systems administrators.”

A former senior U.S. intelligence official cited other puzzling aspects of Snowden’s account, questioning why a contractor for Booz Allen at an NSA facility in Hawaii would have access to something as sensitive as a court order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

“I don’t know why he would have had access to those . . . orders out in Hawaii,” the former official said.

The Guardian initially reported the existence of a program that collects data on all phone calls made on the Verizon network. Later in the week, the Guardian and The Post reported the existence of a separate program, code-named PRISM, that collects the Internet data of foreigners from major Internet companies.

Snowden expressed hope that the NSA surveillance programs will now be open to legal challenge for the first time. This year, in Amnesty International v. Clapper, the Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit against the mass collection of phone records because the plaintiffs could not prove exactly what the program did or that they were personally subject to surveillance.

“The government can’t reasonably assert the state-secrets privilege for a program it has acknowledged,” Snowden said.

Journalists criticized

Snowden’s name surfaced as top intelligence officials in the Obama administration and Congress pushed back against the journalists responsible for revealing the existence of sensitive surveillance programs and called for an investigation into the leaks.

Clapper, in an interview with NBC that aired Saturday night, condemned the leaker’s actions but also sought to spotlight the journalists who first reported the programs, calling their disclosures irresponsible and full of “hyperbole.” Earlier Saturday, he issued a statement accusing the media of a “rush to publish.”

“For me, it is literally — not figuratively — literally gut-wrenching to see this happen because of the huge, grave damage it does to our intelligence capabilities,” Clapper said.

On Sunday morning, before Snowden’s unmasking, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) had harsh words for the leaker and for the journalist who first reported the NSA’s collection of phone records, the Guardian’s Glenn Greenwald.

Greenwald “doesn’t have a clue how this thing works; neither did the person who released just enough information to literally be dangerous,” Rogers said on ABC’s “This Week,” adding: “I absolutely think [the leaker] should be prosecuted.”

Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) agreed that whoever leaked the information should be prosecuted, and she sought to beat back media reports suggesting that the Obama administration overplayed the impact of the programs.

After opponents of the programs questioned their value last week, anonymous administration officials pointed to the thwarting of a bomb plot targeting the New York City subway system in 2009. Soon after, though, reporters noted that public documents suggested that regular police work was responsible for thwarting the attack, rather than a secret government intelligence program.

Feinstein said the programs were valuable in both the New York case and in another involving an American plotting to bomb a hotel in India in 2008. She noted that she could talk about those two cases because they have been declassified, but she suggested that the surveillance programs also assisted in other terrorism-related cases.

A chief critic of the efforts, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), said he is considering filing a lawsuit against the government and called on 10 million Americans to join in.

“I’m going to be asking all the Internet providers and all of the phone companies, ask your customers to join me in a class-action lawsuit,” Paul said on “Fox News Sunday.”

Story highlights Two documents describe scope of NSA data collection programs Their release is part of pledge by Obama adminstration to be transparent Critics have argued that the data collection violates privacy rights

(CNN) —

The Obama administration released two documents on Friday describing the scope of National Security Agency data collection programs, a bid to quiet criticism they violate privacy rights.

An NSA memorandum describes the beginnings of the agency’s collection of so-called telephone metadata of nearly every American under a provision of the Patriot Act, and the agency’s monitoring of foreign Internet traffic.

The agency says in the memo that its systems monitor 1.6% of the world’s Internet traffic, and its analysts review .00004% of global traffic.

Published accounts drawn from leaked documents provided by admitted NSA leaker Edward Snowden have portrayed a much broader eavesdropping system under section 702 of the Patriot Act.

Another document from the Justice Department describes the legal basis for collecting the telephone metadata, such as the numbers dialed, the length and time of the calls. The government says the NSA phone data collection operated under court supervision, and that the database is only accessed for specific searches in counterterrorism investigations.

The document also explains why government lawyers say the program carried out under section 215 of the Patriot Act respects constitutional First and Fourth Amendment freedoms, which protect free speech rights and prohibit the government from unreasonable search and seizure.

The release of the documents came as President Barack Obama held a news conference where he addressed the Snowden leaks, and promised greater transparency about the government’s surveillance programs.

See NSA document (PDF)

He defended the NSA programs which he said have been incorrectly portrayed as an invasion of privacy and said they were key to protecting national security.

Still, the president promised to consider changes to help reassure the public that the Patriot Act wasn’t leading to abuses.

The NSA memo describes how the agency was monitoring conversations between one of the hijackers that carried out the September 11, 2001, terror attacks and people in an al Qaeda safe house in Yemen.

The agency says it didn’t have the ability to find out that the hijacker was already in the United States living in San Diego, and therefore couldn’t tell the FBI. According to the memo, the data collection programs were begun to address those shortcomings.

The NSA memo also for the first time explains some of the confusion over various agency codenames for its collection programs.

According to the NSA, the agency uses different code names for data collected from each communications company.

“Some that have been revealed in the press recently include FAIRVIEW, BLARNEY, OAKSTAR, and LITHIUM. While some have tried to characterize the involvement of such providers as separate programs, that is not accurate,” the memo says.

The Justice white paper released Friday argues that “The vast majority of the telephony metadata is never seen by any person because it is not responsive to the limited queries that are authorized. But the information that is generated in response to these limited queries could be especially significant in helping the government identify and disrupt terrorist plots.”

The document also says that the phone data doesn’t “involve tracking locations from which telephone calls are made.”

The government’s three branches, including the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and Congress, help oversee the programs, the Justice memo argues.

Critics have argued that the data collection violates privacy rights, and that the government should require warrants to collect such information.

The Supreme Court last year restricted the government’s use of GPS trackers on cars of suspects under investigation, making it necessary to seek warrants.

The Justice Department says the phone metadata is different and that “Supreme Court precedent makes clear that participants in telephone calls lack a reasonable expectation of privacy for purposes of the Fourth Amendment in the telephone numbers used to make and receive their calls.”

In any case, the Justice memo says “any arguable privacy intrusion arising from the collection of telephony metadata would be outweighed by the public interest in identifying suspected terrorist operatives and thwarting terrorist plots.”

The Justice memo also argues that the government’s rules “expressly prohibits the collection of records for an investigation that is being conducted solely on the basis of protected First Amendment activity, if the investigation is of a U.S. person.”"

Pat Quinn.

The 65-46 vote came after a lengthy debate in which backers and foes laid out their cases.

Rep. Dennis Reboletti, R-Elmhurst, cited numerous concerns about public safety. Opponents questioned why fingerprinting isn't part of the legislation. Republican Rep. Randy Ramey of DuPage County said too many issues are left unanswered.

“There are going to be far too many people who will get these cards,” Ramey said. “There’ll be fraud, abuse.”

House Republican leader Tom Cross, however, supported the measure saying Illinois should be a place welcoming to immigrants ""who want to work, who want to be part of our communities. We should work with them, not fight with them.""

The bill, backed by Quinn, who said he would sign it, and Mayor Rahm Emanuel, would let an estimated 250,000 illegal immigrants get three-year renewable licenses.

To become eligible for a license, a person would have to live in Illinois for at least a year, a provision that would require applicants to provide a copy of a lease, utility bills and the like. Under current law, people without a Social Security number or proper documentation to be in the country cannot get a driver's license and often have trouble getting car insurance.

The licenses could not be used for other identification purposes, such as for boarding a plane, buying a gun or voting.

Supporters said they expected the vote to be close in the House, where a committee advanced the bill Monday. The Senate already had approved the measure.

During Monday's hearing, opponents questioned why there was no fingerprinting involved with the temporary licenses to ensure that those who apply are not lying about their identity.

""Without these basic public safety and Illinois security safeguards, this bill's unsafe,"" Hanover Park police Chief David Webb said.

""This is a two-prong issue: It's not only about highway safety, but it's also homeland security issues.""

Acevedo said fingerprinting would add ""phenomenal"" cost to the program.

Fred Tsao, policy director with the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, said fingerprinting might scare off eligible applicants.

The House transportation panel sent the proposal to the full House on a 6-3 vote. That led supporters to chant, ""Si se puede,"" which roughly translates to ""Yes, we can."""

David Goodman'],U.S. Offers Conditional Support for Police Monitor in Stop-and-Frisk Case,"The Justice Department on Wednesday waded into a federal trial over the New York Police Department’s stop-and-frisk practices, strongly endorsing a monitor to oversee changes if a judge were to find the practices to be unconstitutional.

But the so-called statement of interest, which the department filed late Wednesday in Federal District Court in Manhattan, stopped short of offering the Justice Department itself as a monitor for the Police Department.

The Justice Department lamented that the court had decided to address questions of fact — whether the department systematically violated New Yorkers’ rights — and the question of remedies at the same time, saying it would have preferred to weigh in only after the former had been decided.

In its carefully worded 21-page statement, the Justice Department took no position on matters of fact in the case. But should the court find against the city, the Justice Department said, it would endorse the use of a court-appointed monitor. “The experience of the United States in enforcing police reform injunctions teaches that the appointment of an independent monitor is a critically important asset,” the department said."

He Previously Wrote About The Russia Investigation.']",Calderon family’s ties to Central Basin water board probed by FBI,"This post has been updated. See below for details.

SACRAMENTO — A day after FBI agents raided the Capitol office of Sen. Ron Calderon (D-Montebello), local officials from Southern California said they have been interviewed by federal agents about the senator’s connection to a local water board.

While the U.S. Attorney’s office on Wednesday remained mum about the focus of the investigation, the Central Basin Municipal Water District has been at the center of a number of controversies for years. Some of those controversies have focused on the Calderon family’s relationship with the district.

FOR THE RECORD:

Calderon investigation: An article in the June 6 Section A about an FBI investigation into Sen. Ron Calderon (D-Montebello) said that the senator’s brother, former Assemblyman Tom Calderon, received $140,000 per year from the company Water2Save, which was chosen for a project by the Central Basin Municipal Water District. Tom Calderon’s $140,000-per-year contract was with Central Basin. He had a separate consulting contract with Water2Save.



Among those who have raised public concerns about the district is Congresswoman Grace Napolitano (D-Norwalk). In an interview Wednesday, she said she has heard complaints from cities she represents dating back more than a decade about the Central Basin Water District’s lack of transparency and questionable spending of public funds.

IN DEPTH: Calderon targeted by FBI

In particular, Napolitano questioned how the district spent $5.6 million in federal funds she helped secure to build infrastructure for a regional system to recycle water.

The district received a subsequent research grant from the Department of Energy in conjunction with HydroEarth, a Lake Forest-based water management firm. But instead of moving forward with the original research proposal, Central Basin amended the project and opened it up for competitive bidding. Staffers subsequently chose to partner with a different company, Water2Save, a firm that paid Ron Calderon’s brother, former Assemblyman Tom Calderon, $140,000 per year.

[UPDATED: 3:22 p.m. June 5: Tom Calderon also received more than $10,000 per month as a consultant for the district.]

Questions emerged from cities in the area about increased water rates and how the district was spending that money. Napolitano said she was never able to get answers about what was happening.

“It was just ridiculous,” she said. “This is ratepayer money. It’s not the Central Basin’s money.”

In 2009, she pushed for state auditors to step in and examine the board’s proposed rate hike, its spending of federal stimulus dollars, and review its spending on lobbying and political consultants.

Napolitano blames Ron Calderon for thwarting her audit request. “I was concerned there was state money, too, that was being misused,” she said.

She said Calderon assured state officials he would convene meetings of local stakeholders to work through their concerns. Those meetings never happened, according to Napolitano.

Concerns extend to cities that are members of the Central Basin Water District.

“There’s been a lot of seemingly dubious things in regards to their contracts, the costs of certain projects, and how they spend their money,” said Thaddeus McCormack, city manager for Santa Fe Springs. “We’ve had questions for a long time. Now, we may finally get some answers to those questions.”

One of McCormack’s concerns involved the Calderons. “Tom is a paid consultant to the district. We believe the senator is an advocate for them. That connection never seemed comfortable,” he said. “It’s raised eyebrows for years.”

In 2011, Ron Calderon introduced a bill that would have given the Central Basin control over groundwater in the area, part of an ongoing rivalry between Central Basin and a neighboring water district.

The bill died in the Senate without ever having a hearing.

Another city official in Los Angeles County, who declined to be identified speaking about the investigation, said he spoke with the FBI about the water district.

The conversation focused on consulting contracts held by Tom Calderon and legislation authored by Ron Calderon, the official said.

“That was 100% of what they were asking about,” the official added.

Note: An earlier version of this post said that Tom Calderon is a paid consultant for the water district. That contract was terminated earlier this year, according to James Roybal, president of the Central Basin Municipal Water District’s board of directors

(CNN) - As Congress prepared to return to immigration reform next week, the debate over the issue continued Sunday, with the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee saying the Senate bill just throws ""a bunch of candy"" at the border ""to gain votes.""

""What the Senate just passed was, again, a bunch of candy thrown down there - a bunch of assets thrown down there to gain votes, but without a methodical, smart border approach. We want a smart border; we also want a smart immigration plan - something that makes sense,"" Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, said on CBS's ""Face the Nation.""



The Senate passed a bipartisan immigration reform bill last month, 68-32. House Republicans will meet behind closed doors on Wednesday to discuss their next steps on the issue, but Republican leaders in the House say the bill is a nonstarter in their chamber, considering it includes a pathway to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants.

Meanwhile, a bipartisan group in the House is working on a separate immigration proposal, requiring border security be improved before citizenship provisions kick in. House Speaker John Boehner has said that lawmakers will craft their own bill or series of bills, separate from the Senate legislation.

The Senate bill included a last-minute, bipartisan amendment calling for tighter border security, to make the overall legislation more acceptable to Republicans.

McCaul called the amendment ""not a responsible plan.""

""I believe it was hatched at the last minute to get votes to pass in the Senate,"" he said.

Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, also took issue with the amendment allowing the administration to ""determine when the border is secure."" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has already said the border is secure, he pointed out.

""I think immigration reform is necessary,"" he said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""My concern with the Senate bill is that they put the legalization of 11 million people ahead of security. The legalization happens first, and then the security happens second. And I think the American people are not going to stand for that.""

Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said he hopes Republicans take up the Senate bill and insisted that Senate Republicans are not trying to ""dictate"" how House Republicans act on the legislation.

""We hope and pray that our Republican colleagues will take up the issue, and we can join together, Republicans and Democrats,"" he said, also appearing on ""Face the Nation."" ""I believe that if they can come up with a bill we would be more than eager to negotiate with them. A failure to act is de facto amnesty for 11 million people living in the shadows.""

But if Republicans fail to pass the Senate bill, will it hurt the party on the national front?

Asked if Senate Democrats are setting House Republicans up to fail, McCaul said, ""My concern is that the political backdrop could be to see this fail in the House, so that they can blame the House of Representatives for that and then try to take back the House of Representatives.""

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/20/us/carwash-managers-held-in-immigration-raids.html,2013-08-20 00:00:00,['Fernanda Santos'],Carwash Managers Held in Immigration Raids,"PHOENIX — Federal agents arrested 11 managers and supervisors of a local car-washing chain on immigration fraud and other charges in weekend raids that brought in more than 200 people, setting off fear among immigrants already on edge by years of relentless enforcement in a state at the core of the debate over illegal immigration.

The scene on Saturday resembled the workplace raids by Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County and operations by federal authorities here and elsewhere: heavily armed agents in bulletproof vests and ski masks surrounded the businesses, and then escorted workers outside single file with hands bound behind their backs.

In all, the agents rounded up 223 people, most of them in the United States illegally. Of those, 179 were released after questioning, under a policy that gives priority to the deportation of people with criminal records or a repeated history of immigration violations. Thirty immigrants fit this profile and were placed on a path to deportation, according to federal officials.

But officials said workers on the carwash floor were never the investigators’ target. From the investigation’s start two years ago, they said, they had their eyes trained on the people in charge, whom they accused of running a scheme that also included identity theft and financial improprieties, in part for evading taxes on wages paid to the unauthorized workers."

However, the 82-15 vote to start the intense congressional battle, which is expected to continue through the month in the Senate, does not necessarily predict the final outcome in that chamber. At the same time, momentum from the Senate could motivate reluctant House Republicans to act -- or they could remain on the sidelines.

Border security remains a sticking point for Republicans, as it was during the last attempt at immigration overhaul six years ago, an effort that failed.

Republicans in both chambers want to tighten control of the border with Mexico before an estimated 11 million people in the country illegally can finish a proposed 10-year route to legal status.

The Senate’s No. 2 Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, said he wants to require secure borders before green cards are issued for those who entered the country illegally or overstayed visas; Democrats argue that idea is a “poison pill” that will keep immigrants in limbo beyond what is already a decade-long wait.

U.S. immigration law: Decades of debate

“You got to give people a sense of certainty that they go through all these sacrifices, do all this, that there’s at the end of the horizon, the opportunity -- not the guarantee, but the opportunity -- to be part of this American family,” Obama said. “And by the way, a majority of Americans support this idea.”

Deciding how to secure the border and determining when it can be considered guarded has long been a subjective pursuit that has vexed lawmakers and law enforcement.

The legislation provides $4.5 billion for more drones, manpower and double-layer fencing on the U.S.-Mexico border during its first five years in effect, and some sectors of the border are already close to achieving the bill’s goal of turning back 90% of illegal crossings. Other regions, though, are less secure, and an additional $2 billion would be available in subsequent years, if needed.

Under the bill, immigrants would be allowed to transition to provisional status within six months of the bill becoming law if a new plan for border security and fencing is in place. After 10 years, if the border plan is “operational,” most immigrants in good standing would be able to transition to green cards. After 13 years, they could become citizens.

“If we don’t guarantee results on border security, if we don’t guarantee to the American people that we actually are going to get serious about stopping the flow of people illegally crossing our Northwestern or Southwestern border, that is the real poison pill,” Cornyn said Tuesday.

Trying to bridge the divide in the GOP is Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, perhaps the most crucial member of a group of four Democratic and four Republican senators crafting the overhaul. He has been working on his own border security measure.

“I understand many in the Democratic Party and the advocate community for immigrants are asking for certainty in the green-card process, but I also think we need to have certainty on the border process,” Rubio said Tuesday. “And so we need to do both.”

The bill is the most ambitious attempt by Congress to overhaul the immigration laws in a generation, and has gained momentum in a political environment where Republicans and Democrats both want to court the growing Latino vote.

The legislation is expected to be the subject of a robust debate in the weeks ahead, with a final vote seen by the end of the month. New television ads in support of the bill were launched Tuesday by a powerful labor union, the SEIU, while the conservative Heritage Foundation urged senators to vote against it, warning immigrants who gain legal status would be a drain on the government.

Along with increased border security and the path to citizenship, the bill attempts to stem the future flow of illegal crossings by creating guest-worker programs for low- and high-skilled labor, and requiring all businesses to verify the legal status of new employees.

Under the measure, once immigrants who are already here undergo background checks and pay fines and fees, they can gain provisional status that allows them work permits.

“This is no cake walk,” Obama said Tuesday from the East Room, surrounded by law enforcement personnel -- including former Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton -- business leaders and union officials who back the effort.

Even if the border security provisions can be resolved, other possible amendments remain, including those to require immigrants to pay back taxes on under-the-table jobs and to bar green-card holders from receiving certain tax credits, such as those available to low-income Americans under the new healthcare law.

Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, speaks at a news conference at the House Triangle on an energy tax reform initiative and the unveiling of the Energy Freedom and Economic Prosperity Act. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)

Rep. Raúl Labrador (R-Idaho) told Univision this week that immigration reform is growing increasingly less likely to pass this year -- or next -- as Congress turns its focus to Syria, the debt ceiling and other issues.

""I think that if we don’t do it now, in 2013, it’s not going to be -- it’s not going to happen in 2014,"" he told ""Al Punto"" host Jorge Ramos, according to a transcript of an interview that will air on Sunday. ""And that means that we’re going to have to wait until 2015. So now, that time is -- it’s becoming a lot shorter. We don't know exactly when we’re going to be able to have this debate.""

""A lot of us thought that the debate was going to be in October, but now, with the problems that we’re having internationally and also here in this country, I don’t see how we’re going to be able to have this debate until -- until November,"" he continued. ""And I really don’t know if it will be possible to do it in November.""

Labrador was considered by many to be a potential leader on immigration reform, and even though he is not in leadership, advocates were hopeful he would push to bring Republicans on board. He said he is still working on a bill that would address legal immigration.

But Labrador dropped out of a bipartisan group working on legislation and does not support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, a criterion Democrats say is absolutely necessary to win their votes. He would support undocumented immigrants gaining legal status, but not a new way for them to move beyond it, he said -- a policy that would prevent many from becoming citizens because of narrow application windows under current law.

The congressman said that if the House voted on legalization for undocumented immigrants within the next month, he doesn't think there would be enough support for the reform to pass.

""Immigration reform is something about which we have to have a good debate,"" he said. ""We have to convince people that it’s a good thing. ... So I think it’s a debate that we have to have, and at this time I don’t think the votes are there in the House of Representatives."""

House Judiciary chairman says immigration bill must win %27sizable majority%27 of GOP votes

He predicts a %27considerably different bill%27 from the one being debated in the Senate

The chairman bristles at criticism of the GOP%27s all-male membership on his panel

WASHINGTON — House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte has a message for advocates who calculate that rolling up a big margin of victory in the Senate will provide momentum to push an immigration overhaul through the House.

Not so fast.

In an interview with USA TODAY Friday, Goodlatte said any House bill would have to win a ""sizable majority"" of Republican votes — not rely on solid Democratic support with just enough GOP backers to pass it.

""That would be a very bad idea,"" the Virginia Republican said on ""Capital Download,"" a weekly video newsmaker series. ""I'm very much a believer in following regular order and in following the principle that the majority party should have a sizable majority of its members supporting major legislative initiatives going through the Congress, and immigration is the most major legislative initiative we've had in several years.""

That ""majority of the majority"" isn't a legal requirement and doesn't have a long legislative history. It was pioneered by Republicans when the GOP won control of the House in the mid-1990s. Though it may sound like parliamentary jargon, it significantly increases the degree of difficulty in crafting a bill that can both pass the House and survive in the Senate.

""That will, in my opinion, create a considerably different bill than the Senate bill — a bill that I think will fix many of the problems with the Senate bill,"" Goodlatte said. Among them: He opposes granting any legal status to immigrants in the USA illegally until enforcement measures are in place to tighten security along the border and get control of legal visitors who overstay their visas.

He endorsed a proposal to deputize police to enforce immigration laws. ""We want to make sure that ... we have the opportunity to use state and local law enforcement,"" he said.

Goodlatte repeated his commitment to passing several piecemeal measures on immigration rather than the Senate's comprehensive package.

House Speaker John Boehner has scheduled a special House Republican conference July 10 to discuss immigration. Top Republicans, among them former governors Haley Barbour of Mississippi and Jeb Bush of Florida, have warned that making up lost ground with Hispanic voters, including passage of an immigration bill, is critical for the future of the GOP.

Goodlatte bristled at criticism from Democrats and others after Republicans on the Judiciary Committee — all of whom are male — passed a ban this week on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. ""It would be wonderful to have Republican women on the committee, and I am an advocate for seeing that happen,"" he said. ""But it does not matter whether you're a man or a woman to care about the rights of unborn children and the rights of women.""

Russia parliament member encourages Snowden to accept Venezuela%27s offer

Russian officials say Snowden stuck in transit area of Moscow airport

Venezuela is now waiting for answer

MOSCOW (AP) — An influential Russian parliament member who often speaks for the Kremlin encouraged NSA leaker Edward Snowden on Sunday to accept Venezuela's offer of asylum.

Alexei Pushkov, who heads the international affairs committee in Russia's parliament, posted a message on Twitter saying: ""Venezuela is waiting for an answer from Snowden. This, perhaps, is his last chance to receive political asylum.""

Venezuelan Foreign Minister Elias Jaua said Saturday his country hasn't yet been in contact with Snowden, who Russian officials say has been stuck in the transit area of Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport since arriving on a flight from Hong Kong two weeks ago. He has been unable to travel further because the U.S. annulled his passport.

Jaua said he expects to consult with Russian officials on Monday about Snowden's situation.

Pushkov's comments appeared to indicate that the Kremlin is now anxious to be rid of the former National Security Agency systems analyst, whom the U.S. wants returned to face espionage charges.

There has been no response from the Kremlin or Russian Foreign Ministry to the asylum offer made by Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro in the early hours of Saturday, Moscow time.

For Snowden to leave for South America, he would need for Venezuela to issue him travel documents and he would need to find a way to get there. The only direct commercial flight from Moscow goes to Havana, Cuba, and Snowden had booked a seat on this flight the day after arriving from Hong Kong, but failed to show up.

The Moscow-Havana flight goes over Europe and the U.S., which could cause complications. Some European countries refused to allow Bolivian President Evo Morales to fly through their airspace on his way home from Moscow last week because of suspicions that Snowden was onboard his plane.

Pushkov joked that if Snowden doesn't find shelter in Venezuela, ""he will have to stay and marry Anna Chapman,"" the redheaded Russian spy who was among 10 sleeper agents deported from the U.S. in 2010. The 31-year-old Chapman proposed to Snowden, who just turned 30, on Twitter last week.

The presidents of Bolivia and Nicaragua also said over the weekend that Snowden was welcome in their countries. Bolivia's foreign minister, David Choquehuanca, said Sunday on state television that his country hasn't yet received a formal petition for asylum from Snowden. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said his country's embassy in Moscow has received Snowden's application and is studying the request.

Snowden has applied for asylum in more than two dozen countries, including Bolivia, Nicaragua and Venezuela, according to WikiLeaks, the secret-spilling website that has been advising him.

U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he wasn't surprised that those three Latin American nations were offering asylum.

""They like sticking it to the United States,"" Menendez told NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

He also mentioned re-examining U.S. trade policies and foreign aid to any country that might take in Snowden."

USA TODAY

A federal judge ruled on Friday that the National Security Agency's bulk collection of millions of Americans' telephone and Internet records is legal and a critical component of the country's effort to combat the threat of terrorism.

The decision by U.S. District Judge William Pauley contrasts with a ruling earlier this month by U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon and increases the likelihood that the issue will go before the U.S. Supreme Court.

Leon had granted a preliminary injunction against the collecting of phone records, saying the program likely violates the U.S. Constitution's ban on unreasonable search.

The NSA-run programs pick up millions of telephone and Internet records that are routed through American networks each day.

In the 54-page opinion issued in New York, Pauley said the sweeping program ""represents the government's counter-punch"" to eliminate al-Qaeda's terror network by connecting fragmented and fleeting communications.

""There is no evidence that the Government has used any of the bulk telephony metadata it collected for any purpose other than investigating and disrupting terrorist attacks,"" he wrote.



The judge further maintained that the program, which sucks up vast amounts of data, is subject to executive and congressional oversight as well as monitoring by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.



""We are pleased with the decision,"" Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr said.



In issuing the ruling, Pauley dismissed a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, which had sued after former NSA analyst Edward Snowden leaked details of the secret programs that critics say violate privacy rights.

""We are extremely disappointed with this decision, which misinterprets the relevant statutes, understates the privacy implications of the government's surveillance and misapplies a narrow and outdated precedent to read away core constitutional protections,"" Jameel Jaffer, ACLU deputy legal director said in a statement.

In hearings last month in New York, an ACLU lawyer had argued that the government's interpretation of its authority under the Patriot Act was so broad that it could justify the mass collection of financial, health and even library records of innocent Americans without their knowledge. A government lawyer had countered that counterterrorism investigators wouldn't find most personal information useful.

The judge acknowledged that the data collection system is far-reaching, and ""vacuums up information about virtually every telephone call, to, from or within the United States.

""This blunt tool only works because it collects everything,"" the judge wrote. ""Such a program if unchecked, imperils the civil liberties of the every citizen.""



While acknowledging this ""natural tension"" between protecting the nation and preserving civil liberty, Pauley said the system sweeps up huge quantities of data ""by design"" and could have helped investigators connect the dots before the Sept. 11 terrorists attacks

""The government learned from its mistake and adapted to confront a new enemy: a terror network capable of orchestrating attacks across the world. It launched a number of counter-measures, including a bulk telephony metadata collection program — a wide net that could find and isolate gossamer contacts among suspected terrorists in an ocean of seemingly disconnected data,"" he said.

He also found that the right to be free from search and seizures ""is fundamental, but not absolute.""

""Every day, people voluntarily surrender personal and seemingly-private information to transnational corporations, which exploit that data for profit,"" Pauley wrote in . Few think twice about it, even though it is far more intrusive than bulk telephony metadata collection.

Cheney suspects Edward Snowden might be a spy

Former VP helped oversee response to the 9/11 attacks

Obama said he doesn%27t believe that the collection of phone records violates privacy

WASHINGTON — Former vice president Dick Cheney on Sunday called the contractor who disclosed information about top-secret U.S. surveillance programs a criminal and a traitor.

He said he also suspects Edward Snowden might be a spy.

In an interview on Fox News Sunday, Cheney accused the 29-year-old contract worker for the National Security Agency of damaging the nation's intelligence capabilities by leaking documents about programs that track telephone and Internet communications. Snowden also said the U.S. has hacked into the systems of China and other countries.

""I think it's one of the worst occasions in my memory of somebody with access to classified information doing enormous damage to the national security interests of the United States,"" said Cheney, a former Defense secretary who as vice president helped oversee the nation's response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001.

Asked whether he thinks Snowden is a Chinese spy, Cheney replied: ""I'm deeply suspicious, obviously, because he went to China. That's not a place where you would ordinarily want to go if you are interested in freedom, liberty and so forth."" Snowden said he went to Hong Kong because of its history of free speech.

On CBS' Face the Nation, White House chief of staff Denis McDonough said it was too soon to know how much damage Snowden's leaks had done, but he said that sort of disclosure ""in effect gives the playbook to those who would like to get around our techniques and our practices, and obviously that's not in our interest in the long haul.""

President Obama said he doesn't believe that the NSA's sweeping collection of telephone records violates Americans' privacy, McDonough said. He said Obama, now on a three-day trip to Europe, would discuss the issue publicly ""in the days ahead.""

James Clapper, the director of National Intelligence, sent Congress a letter over the weekend that said the surveillance programs had helped thwart ""dozens"" of terrorist plots in the United States and elsewhere. He said phone records for fewer than 300 Americans had been scrutinized last year."

(CNN) —

The National Security Agency spent Friday on the defensive, after details got out about an internal audit that found the agency had broken privacy rules “thousands of times each year” since 2008.

The audit was first reported by the Washington Post on Thursday, setting off another round of heated discussion – and criticism – in Washington over how the NSA had wrongly impinged on Americans’ privacy.

“I … will continue to demand honest and forthright answers from the intelligence community,” said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, noting the Senate Judiciary Committee he chairs will hold a hearing on the Post’s revelations. “I remain concerned that we are still not getting straightforward answers from the NSA.”

In a call with reporters Friday, John DeLong – the NSA’s director of compliance – acknowledged “mistakes occur,” even as he insisted only a “tiny” amount of such problems were intentional.

“No one at NSA thinks a mistake is OK,” DeLong said several times in the call, which a spokesman said was conducted to “address inaccuracies.”

Material was provided to the newspaper this summer by National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden.

The audit found 2,776 incidents of “unauthorized collection, storage, access to or distribution of legally protected communications,” the Post reported in its story.

“Most were unintended. Many involved failures of due diligence or violations of standard operating procedure. The most serious incidents included a violation of a court order and unauthorized use of data about more than 3,000 Americans and green-card holders,” it said.

Leahy was not the only lawmaker, nor the only member of President Barack Obama’s Democratic party, to call for more oversight and hearings.

“Press reports that the National Security Agency broke privacy rules thousands of times per year and reportedly sought to shield required disclosure of privacy violations are extremely disturbing,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.

Pelosi called for “rigorous oversight” by Congress on the “incidents of non-compliance.”

Another Democrat from California, Senate Intelligence Committee chairwoman Sen. Dianne Feinstein, told the Post in a statement late Thursday night that her committee “can and should do more to independently verify that NSA’s operations are appropriate, and its reports of compliance incidents are accurate.”

The paper said most incidents involved unauthorized surveillance of Americans or foreign intelligence targets in the country.

In 2008, a “large number” of calls placed from Washington were intercepted due to a programming error that confused the capitol’s 202 area code for 20, the international dialing code for Egypt. The information came from a “quality assurance” review that wasn’t distributed to the NSA overnight staff, according to the Post.

Separately, an NSA new collection method went undiscovered by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for months. The court, which has authority over some of the agency’s operations, ruled it unconstitutional.

The NSA responded to the Post’s story, saying “a variety of factors can cause the numbers of incidents to trend up or down from one quarter to the next.”

Factors can include implementation of new procedures, technology or software changes and expanded access.

“The one constant across all of the quarters is a persistent, dedicated effort to identify incidents or risks of incidents at the earliest possible moment, implement mitigation measures wherever possible, and drive the numbers down,” the agency said.

The agency released a statement Thursday night defending its programs.

“NSA’s foreign intelligence collection activities are continually audited and overseen internally and externally,” it said. “When NSA makes a mistake in carrying out its foreign intelligence mission, the agency reports the issue internally and to federal overseers – and aggressively gets to the bottom of it.”

On Friday, DeLong said his agency “detects and corrects mistakes” as these occur and are identified, which stops them from being “propagated.”

“The NSA has zero tolerance for misconduct,” he said, noting that those who make repeated mistakes lose access to key databases.

Overall, DeLong insisted, the NSA carefully adheres to privacy protections.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest offered a similar statement Friday, saying the NSA compliance office’s review reflects its commitment to abiding by the law and protecting people’s privacy.

“The documents demonstrate that the NSA is monitoring, detecting, addressing and reporting compliance incidents,” Earnest said.

Snowden stepped forward publicly in June to claim responsibility for leaking to the media that the NSA had secretly collected and stored millions of phone records from accounts in the United States. The agency also collected information from U.S. companies on the Internet activity of overseas residents, he said.

He fled first to Hong Kong and then to Russia before Moscow granted him temporary asylum despite pressure from the Obama administration to return him to the United States to face charges.

He has been charged with three felony counts, including violations of the U.S. Espionage Act, for the leaks.

NSA: We read .00004% of Web traffic

Although polling shows Americans harbor skepticism of the domestic surveillance programs Snowden revealed, a majority of Americans don’t approve of the actions he took and they think he, as an American citizen, should be brought to justice.

A CNN/ORC International survey released last month indicated that 52% of the public disapproved of Snowden’s actions, while 44% said they approved of the leaks. Fifty-four percent of those questioned in the poll said the government should attempt to bring Snowden back to the United States and prosecute him for his leaks.

As for the program Snowden revealed, there is a noticeable generational divide on the surveillance tactics, with younger Americans more likely to support Snowden than older Americans.

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-chooses-lawyer-guantanamo-closure-envoy-200145023.html,,[],Obama chooses lawyer as Guantanamo closure envoy,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama has chosen a high-powered Washington lawyer with extensive experience in all three branches of the government to be the State Department's special envoy for closing down the military-run prison at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba.

Clifford Sloan is the pick to reopen the State Department's Office of Guantanamo Closure, shuttered since January and folded into the department's legal adviser's office when the administration, in the face of congressional obstacles, effectively gave up its attempt to close the prison.

A formal announcement of Sloan's appointment was expected Monday, according to officials briefed on the matter. They spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the appointment publicly before the formal announcement.

Sloan has served in senior government positions in both Democratic and Republican administrations and is now a partner in the Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP law firm. For the past several years, he has been an informal adviser to Secretary of State John Kerry, who recommended him for the post, the officials said.

""I appreciate his willingness to take on this challenge,"" Kerry said in a statement. ""Cliff and I share the president's conviction that Guantanamo's continued operation isn't in our security interests.""

The move fulfills part of Obama's pledge last month to renew efforts to close the military-run detention center at Guantanamo. That was a major promise in his 2008 presidential campaign, but it ran aground due to opposition from congressional Republicans.

In late May, Obama lifted a self-imposed ban on transferring Guantanamo detainees to Yemen, in what was a step toward closing a prison that he said ""has become a symbol around the world for an America that flouts the rule of law."" He said he would name envoys at both the State Department and Pentagon to try to unblock the closure process. The Pentagon envoy position has yet to be filled.

Story continues

Word of the Sloan's appointment comes follows the House's overwhelming passage Friday of a $638 billion defense bill that would block Obama from closing the detention facility. The House acted despite a White House veto threat.

The administration cited Guantanamo's prohibitive costs and role as a recruiting tool for extremists. A hunger strike by more than 100 of the 166 prisoners protesting their conditions and indefinite confinement has prompted the fresh calls for closure. Obama is pushing to transfer 86 approved detainees to their home countries. Fifty-six of the 86 are from Yemen.

Officials said Sloan, whose diverse government experience includes clerking for liberal Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens and conservative prosecutor Kenneth Starr, would focus primarily on navigating between the administration and Congress to overcome the deep, largely partisan divide over closing Guantanamo.

""It will not be easy, but if anyone can effectively navigate the space between agencies and branches of government, it's Cliff,"" Kerry said. ""He's someone respected by people as ideologically different as Kenneth Starr and Justice Stevens, and that's the kind of bridge-builder we need to finish this job."""

(CNN) —

Frightening government overreach or valuable law enforcement tool?

That’s the question politicians in Washington, and millions of citizens around the United States, asked Thursday thanks to a jolting report suggesting the government has been collecting millions of Americans’ phone records.

FBI Direct Robert Mueller will be asked about the matter – revealed after a British newspaper, the Guardian, published a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court order that applied to phone data from Verizon – when he appears next week before the House Judiciary Committee. The panel’s chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, issued a statement Thursday saying he was “very concerned that the Department of Justice may have abused the intent of the law, and we will investigate.”

Reports: U.S. spy agencies mined Internet data

The report will also be the subject of an upcoming classified briefing by Attorney General Eric Holder to the Senate Appropriations Committee. Its chairman, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, is calling for a similar closed-door briefing for the entire U.S. Senate.

When she read the news Thursday morning, the Maryland Democrat said, “It was like, ‘Oh, God, not one more thing … where we’re trying to protect America and then it looks like we’re spying.’”

What does the Verizon order mean for me?

An author of the Patriot Act – the legislation used to justify the program – added he is “extremely disturbed by what appears to be an overbroad interpretation of the act.”

“These reports are deeply concerning and raise questions about whether our constitutional rights are secure,” Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin, wrote in a letter to Holder.

But not everyone in the nation’s capital is outraged or even concerned. Some say the real travesty would be if the program, which they describe as valuable, is halted.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the Guardian story refers to a “three-month renewal of what has been the case for the past seven years” – so that while the uproar may be new, the program is not. In that time, it’s helped to disrupt “terrorist plots” on U.S. soil, she said.

“It is lawful,” the California Democrat insisted. “It has been briefed by Congress.”

Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Michigan) and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Maryland), two key members of the House Intelligence Committee, both stressed that “this important collection tool does not allow the government to eavesdrop” and that it is routinely reviewed by Congress.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest also made those points, adding President Barack Obama “put in place a stronger regime of oversight” when he took office. He further stressed the importance of ensuring “we have the tools we need to confront the threat posted by terrorists (and to) protect the homeland.”

“That is his top priority,” Earnest said of domestic security. “But … we need to balance that priority with the need to protect civil liberties and constitutional rights of American people. And that is the subject of a worthy debate.”

What’s been happening, and for how long?

In 2006, it was reported the National Security Agency was secretly collecting telephone records in an effort to root out terror plots.

“Verizon’s wireless and wireline companies did not provide to NSA customer records or call data, local or otherwise,” the company said at the time.

Like the FBI and the NSA, Verizon declined comment to the media Thursday on the Guardian report. But company Vice President Randy Milch, in a note to employees, did say the newspaper’s story may spur the company to respond in defiance of a promise of secrecy.

The newspaper published the four-page, top-secret government order requiring “originating and terminating” phone numbers plus the location, time and duration of calls from the communications giant. It lets the FBI and NSA to obtain the records from April 25 to July 19.

7 things to know

The order applies to Verizon Business Network Services, an operation not described on the company’s website. Its scope was not immediately clear, though the Guardian claimed “millions of U.S. customers of Verizon” were affected by the collection of information “regardless of whether they are suspected of wrongdoing.”

In his letter to Verizon employees, Milch said that his company would not provide the contents of any communications “or the name, address or financial information of a subscriber or customer.”

An Obama administration official said any such order would relate “exclusively to metadata, such as a telephone number or the length of a call.”

This kind of information “allows counterterrorism personnel to discover whether known or suspected terrorists have been in contact with other persons who may be engaged in terrorist activities,” the unnamed official said in a statement to media.

Controversy over the Guardian report comes as the White House fends off privacy complaints on other fronts as well. The administration is under fire following revelations the Justice Department seized two months of phone records from Associated Press reporters and editors – something done as part of an investigation into leaks of classified information.

Plus, the Washington Post and the Guardian reported that U.S. intelligence has a broad secret data mining program that allows access to central servers of nine leading U.S. Internet companies – among them Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook and Apple – to extract e-mail, photos and other private consumer communications.

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper challenged the Post and Guardian reports in a statement Thursday night, saying “they contain numerous inaccuracies.” Specifically, he emphasized the section of the law tied to that reported program “cannot be used to intentionally target any U.S. citizen, any other U.S. person or anyone located within the United States.”

In statements on that and reports about collecting phone data, Clapper also called out those behind the apparent leaks – saying it “will have an impact on the behavior of our adversaries and make it more difficult for us to understand their intentions.”

Speaking specifically about collecting personal phone records, privacy advocates called the practice perilous and claimed it gives authorities access to information of many Americans who aren’t terrorists. In fact, they might not necessarily be Verizon customers, and similar orders might also apply to other telecommunications companies.

“There is no indication that this order to Verizon was unique or novel,” said the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which fights to protect privacy.

“It is very likely that business records orders like this exist for every major American telecommunication company, meaning that, if you make calls in the United States, the NSA has those records. And this has been going on for at least seven years, and probably longer.”

Opinion: NSA’s phone snooping a different kind of creepy

Al Gore: ‘Secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous’

This group is hardly alone.

The American Civil Liberties Union called it “beyond Orwellian (in allowing) basic democratic rights (to be) surrendered in secret to the demands of unaccountable intelligence agencies.”

The Center for Constitutional Rights blasted it as “the broadest surveillance order to ever had been issued: It requires no level of suspicion.”

Many in President Barack Obama’s own party spoke forcefully against it as well.

Three Democratic representatives – John Conyers of Michigan, Jerrold Nadler of New York and Robert Scott of Virginia – said the program is “highly problematic and reveals serious flaws in the scope and application of the” Patriot Act.

“(The revelations) confirm our fears – that the law would be distorted to allow for ongoing, indiscriminate collection of data,” they wrote.

Sen. Mark Udall, who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee, described the program as “the kind of government overreach I’ve said Americans would find shocking.”

One of them: former Vice President Al Gore.

“Is it just me, or is secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous?” the 2000 Democratic presidential nominee wrote on Twitter.

Senator says ending program would be ‘catastrophic’

Opinions were also strong on the other side of the debate.

“Terrorists will come after us if they can, and the only thing that we have to deter this is good intelligence to understand that a plot has been hatched and to get there before they get to us,” said Feinstein.

Her intelligence committee’s ranking Republican, Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, concurred in stating the program has let authorities gather “significant information on bad guys and only on bad guys over the years.”

Former FBI Assistant Director Tom Fuentes, a CNN contributor, said that if a phone number comes up that’s linked to someone suspicious, they can go back and get information tied to that number.

“It’s not that someone or some group of analysts can sit there and monitor 50 million phone calls going through the computers,” Fuentes explained on CNN’s “Starting Point.” “But it would create the ability to go back and see if you could connect phone calls.”

Rep. Lindsey Graham said that, as a Verizon customer, “it doesn’t bother me one bit for the National Security Administration to have my phone number.” The South Carolina Republican said he’s confident the government won’t monitor his and other innocent Americans phone calls just because their “number pops up on some terrorist’s phone.”

“The consequences of taking these tools away from the American people through their government would be catastrophic,” he said.

USA TODAY

Surveillance procedures now controversial will %27poll damn well after the next attack%27

He argues that proposed operational changes would reverse changes put in place after 9/11

He endorses idea of splitting NSA from Cyber Command%2C an idea Obama has rejected

WASHINGTON — Retired general Michael Hayden, former director of the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency, called on President Obama Monday to show ""some political courage"" and reject many of the recommendations of the commission he appointed to rein in NSA surveillance operations.

""President Obama now has the burden of simply doing the right thing,"" Hayden told USA TODAY's Capital Download. ""And I think some of the right things with regard to the commission's recommendations are not the popular things. They may not poll real well right now. They'll poll damn well after the next attack, all right?""

Obama, who received the report from the five-member advisory committee just before he left to vacation in Hawaii, has promised to make ""a pretty definitive statement"" in January about its 46 recommendations. He appointed the panel in the wake of a firestorm over disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden about surveillance of all Americans' telephone calls and spying on German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other friendly foreign leaders.

The commission, led by former acting CIA director Michael Morell, said the recommendations were designed to increase transparency, accountability and oversight at the NSA.

Hayden, who headed the super-secret agency from 1999 to 2005, oversaw the launch of some of the controversial programs after the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington in 2001. He defended them as effective and properly overseen by congressional intelligence committees and a special court.

""Right now, since there have been no abuses and almost all the court decisions on this program have held that it's constitutional, I really don't know what problem we're trying to solve by changing how we do this,"" he said, saying the debate was sparked after ""somebody stirred up the crowd."" That's a reference to Snowden, who was granted asylum in Russia.

Snowden's revelations have fueled objections by civil liberties advocates that the NSA goes too far in collecting information about Americans not suspected of any wrongdoing. This month, a federal judge in Washington called the program ""almost Orwellian,"" although a few days later, another federal judge in New York said it was legal.

Hayden's blunt warnings about the risks he sees in accepting the commission's recommendations underscore the difficult balancing act Obama faces between ensuring the nation's security and respecting citizens' privacy. No decision he makes is likely to avoid criticism.

""Here I think it's going to require some political courage,"" said Hayden, 68, a retired Air Force general whose service in the nation's top intelligence posts gives him particular standing. ""Frankly, the president is going to have to use some of his personal and political capital to keep doing these things.""

In the interview with USA TODAY's weekly video newsmaker series, Hayden:

•Said the vast data on Americans' phone records are ""far safer and privacy is far more secured with NSA holding the data than some third party."" The commission recommended that the phone companies or a third party take over responsibility for storing the data.

•Protested that requiring the NSA to seek individual court orders when it wants to search the data would reverse changes put in place after the 9/11 attacks.

•Ridiculed a proposal to increase protections for personal data about non-citizens abroad. ""The Fourth Amendment to our Constitution is not an international treaty,"" he said. For those who aren't covered by its protections, he said, ""if your communications contain information that make Americans more safe and more free, game on.""

•Said the idea of requiring the president and his advisers, not the intelligence community, to approve any spying operation on foreign leaders would be ""a little cumbersome"" but not a significant change from the way things effectively work already. ""If you don't think the national command authority had a broad understanding of what we're doing, I've got a bridge I want to interest you in,"" he said.

•Endorsed the recommendation to split leadership of the NSA from the Cyber Command, the military's cyber-warfare unit. The two positions were combined in 2009. Obama has rejected the proposal. ""That might be an OK idea, not because Keith Alexander, the general who now holds both positions ... has too much power but because Keith has too much work. I just can't understand how one man can do both jobs.""

Hayden opposed the idea of granting Snowden amnesty, in part to learn more about what he did and how he did it and to prevent him from leaking additional information. ""It's kind of like negotiating with terrorists,"" he said. ""All that does is tell the next Edward Snowden out there, if you're going to do this, make sure you steal enough."""

In phone calls and a White House session, President Obama and Republican lawmakers worked to hash out a plan to restore government funding and lift the debt ceiling, and also initiate a new round of budget and deficit-reduction talks.

But the task of sealing a deal was complicated by division between Senate and House Republicans, who were conducting separate negotiations. The White House also said it had concerns over the outline of the House GOP proposal. That plan for a short-term suspension of the debt limit, officials warned, seemed guaranteed to set up a renewed confrontation next month.

Still, for the first time in the 11-day shutdown, lawmakers expressed optimism that a deal could be reached in the next several days. Meanwhile, the calendar crept closer to Oct. 17, when the Treasury Department has said the government will no longer be able to borrow money to cover expenses and could risk a default.

“I just have a sense over the weekend some significant jelling is going to take place,” Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said, speculating that a plan could be in place “potentially as early as midweek.”

The qualified hopefulness was a striking shift after days of deadlock in Washington. The two parties have traded barbs and charges of extortion, while many government services remained closed. Federal workers in some agencies received partial paychecks Friday, reflecting the first week of furloughs.

Under pressure to avoid a default and watching the standoff take a toll on their public approval numbers, Republicans on Thursday offered to extend the debt limit for six weeks, dropping their refusal to lift it before the president committed to negotiations over the budget. Late Thursday, after more discussions with the White House, Republicans added a proposal to reopen the government — at least temporarily.

The House GOP proposal would launch a two-track negotiation over at least the next six weeks, officials said.

On one track, in return for temporarily lifting the debt ceiling, Republicans want a series of talks focused on tax reform, as well as cuts to Medicare and other entitlement programs.

On the second track, House Republicans would reopen the government if the White House agreed to talks on spending levels for the current fiscal year, which started Oct. 1.

Both parties would like to make changes to the next round of across-the-board cuts, the so-called sequester, that are scheduled to kick in Jan. 1.

But House Republicans were still insisting on an upfront concession from the president before they moved to reopen the government. Late Friday, House Republicans were still debating what that might be, but it could include slight changes to the healthcare law. Senate Republicans, meanwhile, proposed their own endgame.

Congressional Democrats seemed content to sit back and allow Republicans to argue among themselves, betting that, with the GOP increasingly anxious to end the standoff, Democrats’ leverage will only increase as the debt-limit deadline draws closer.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) was expected to move forward with a proposal for a one-year extension of the debt limit with no strings attached. A key test vote in the Senate was set for Saturday.

Friday, however, saw no legislative progress, only deliberations behind closed doors.

Senate Republicans boarded buses for a midday meeting at the White House. During the 100-minute session, Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, outlined a proposal to fund the government for six months and raise the debt limit for a short term, repeal the tax on medical-device makers, and give

federal agencies the flexibility to manage the sequester budget cuts imposed by Congress early this year.

Collins said Obama liked some of her proposal but was noncommittal. “He described it as constructive and having elements of it that could be worked on, but I don’t want to give the impression that he endorsed it and said, ‘What a great plan,’” she said.

House Republicans opposed Collins’ plan, arguing that it cedes too much control over the budget to the president. That split has left Obama in a negotiation triangle with Republicans in the two chambers. It was not immediately clear whether the White House would embrace either Republican proposal.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney on Friday did not shoot down the possibility of delaying the medical-device tax, a change to the healthcare law that could draw bipartisan support. He would not commit to other elements of the proposal.

Obama has said he would sign a short-term debt ceiling extension, but Carney stressed that such a deal would keep the president from achieving his key objective: ending the cycle of repeated budget crises.

“We cannot have a situation where the debt ceiling is extended as part of a budget negotiation process for only six weeks, which would put us right back in the same position that we’re in now,” Carney said.

On that front, there was some bipartisan agreement.

A six-week debt limit extension “doesn’t make a lot of sense,” said Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.). “Because all we would be doing is putting the same problem off for six weeks, and then you have the Thanksgiving cliff. This is the Halloween cliff. So we might as well stop having so many cliffs — which is why everybody started talking.

“I think there is a majority of the House and Senate that realizes it is time to get the government back open,” he said.

Isakson, who helped organize dinners at the White House to discuss the country’s debt burden, said Friday’s meeting was a “good exchange of ideas.” Obama was “very engaged” and “candid,” he said.

After weeks of trading tortured metaphors and allegations of hostage-taking, the rhetoric on both sides softened. That was perhaps the clearest sign of progress.

“It was the kind of meeting you’d expect when you are starting to get down to business,” Isakson said, adding that there was “no showboating.”

At the White House, Carney called the talks constructive. “There needs to be continuing discussions,” he said, “and we’ll see where we get.”

In an article on its website Sunday, the newspaper said Edward Snowden, 29, had asked the paper to reveal his identity and that he never planned to remain anonymous. The article said he was staying in a luxury hotel in Hong Kong, and said he had lined the door of his hotel room with pillows to prevent eavesdropping.

“I have no intention of hiding who I am because I know I have done nothing wrong,” he was quoted as saying. He said he expected U.S. authorities to “demonize” him.

The development was the latest in a dizzying week that saw unauthorized publication of a “top secret” order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court authorizing the collection of telephone records; internal documents on a National Security Agency program that obtains data on foreigners from U.S. Internet companies; a directive from President Obama ordering preparation of a secret target list for cyber warfare; and a digital map that shows where the NSA spies the most.

The Guardian said Snowden was working at an NSA facility in Hawaii three weeks ago when he decided to release the documents. It said he copied the documents and then told a supervisor that he needed to go away for several weeks for medical treatment. He left for Hong Kong on May 20.

The Obama administration has prosecuted six people for illegal disclosures of classified information under the espionage act, more than all other administrations combined. Given the political furor over the leaks of some of the nation’s most closely held secrets, U.S. authorities are likely to swiftly seek Snowden’s arrest and extradition from Hong Kong, which is part of China.

Indeed, earlier Sunday, the chairs of both congressional intelligence committees had called on the Justice Department to prosecute whoever was responsible for the leaks about the telephone and Internet data surveillance programs and other national security secrets to the media in recent days.

Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), who heads the House intelligence panel, said the unauthorized disclosures served to aid America’s enemies by revealing secret surveillance methods.

“If you tell our adversaries and enemies in the counterterrorism fight exactly how we conduct business, they are not going to do business the same ever again,” he said.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who heads the Senate intelligence committee, said the government needs to plug the leaks immediately. Both lawmakers appeared on ABC’s “This Week.”

Feinstein said the surveillance programs have proved their value in terrorism investigations, but most cases remained classified so officials can’t “give the public an actual idea of people that have been saved, attacks that have been prevented, that kind of thing,” she said.

But Sen. Mark Udall, (D-Colo.), a member of the Senate panel, called for lawmakers to reconsider the Patriot Act, the law that authorizes expanded surveillance by the NSA on Americans, and for a public hearing on whether the government should be allowed to collect so much data on Americans.

He said he supports an NSA program code-named PRISM, which is used to obtain Internet data on foreign targets, but is troubled that the NSA has collected and archived records on virtually every domestic telephone call over the last six years for potential use in terrorism or espionage investigations.

“It’s the scale of this really concerns me and the fact that the American public doesn’t know about it,” he said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “The fact that every call I make to my friends, to my family, is noted, where I am, the length of it, the date, that concerns me.”

Udall also said he was not convinced that the operation had led to the detection or disruption of any terrorism plots. “It hasn’t been proven that it works,” he said.

Rep. Mike McCaul (R-Texas), who chairs the House homeland security committee, complained of what he called the “warehousing of all the phone records from all the major carriers” by the federal government. “That’s something I think we’ll look at in Congress,” he said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), told “Fox News Sunday” that secretly collecting data on every telephone call “sounds like an extraordinary invasion of privacy.” He said he would ask Internet providers and telephone companies to ask their customers to join him in a class-action lawsuit to challenge the legality of the surveillance.

But Michael Hayden, the retired Air Force general who formerly led the CIA and the National Security Agency, defended the programs and said the idea of “trolling through millions of records” was “simply not true.”

He said the database of telephone records can only be accessed with a court order and only in terrorism investigations.

“So you roll up something in Waziristan,” Hayden said. “You get a cellphone number. It’s the first time you’ve ever had that cellphone number. … Here’s how it works: You simply ask that database, ‘Hey, any of your phone numbers in there ever talked to this phone number in Waziristan?’ ”

(CNN) —

The U.S. Senate gave final approval Thursday to a roughly 1,200-page bill that promises to overhaul immigration laws for the first time since 1986, creating a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented residents while ratcheting up security along the Mexican border.

Senators passed the sweeping legislation – initially drafted by the four Democrats and four Republicans in the chamber’s so-called “Gang of Eight” – by a 68-32 vote.

Fourteen Republicans joined a united Democratic caucus in supporting the bill, which is backed by the White House and has the potential to become the crowning legislative achievement of President Barack Obama’s second term.

In a White House statement, Obama hailed the Senate vote as “a critical step” toward fixing what he called a broken immigration system. He labeled the measure that now goes to the Republican-controlled House a compromise, adding that “we just need Congress to finish the job.”

The Senate vote included a rare adherence to old-fashioned protocol. Vice President Joe Biden presided in his constitutional capacity as head of the Senate, and senators voted one-by-one from their desks, calling out “aye” or “no.”

Republican Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas broke the drama of the moment when he mistakenly voted “aye,” then quickly asked the clerk to make it “no” as the chamber erupted in laughter. Biden tapped his gavel and called for order.

Before announcing the result, Biden warned against outbursts from the public gallery, but chants of “Yes we can” and “Si se puede” broke out after he read the tally. Biden called for the sergeant at arms to restore order.

“Today is another historic day in the Senate,” said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont. “This legislation will reunite families. It will bring millions of people out of the shadows and into our legal system. It will spur job growth and reduce our deficit. And it will make us safer.”

“The time has come to act in the interest of all Americans,” declared Sen. Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey, a member of the Gang of Eight. “I hope that message will be heard loud and clear in the House (of Representatives).”

Historic ruling opens door for immigration for same-sex spouses

Most congressional conservatives, however, remain staunchly opposed to the measure, and have declared it dead on arrival in the House.

Obama warned in his statement that opponents of immigration reform will try even harder to derail it. Noting the broad support for the Senate bill from the business community, organized labor and others, he urged people to contact their House representatives and “tell them to do the right thing.”

Republicans are sharply divided over the politically sensitive issue. In the wake of the GOP’s crushing loss among Hispanics in the 2012 election, many top voices in the party have pushed for an endorsement of some form of a path to citizenship for the country’s roughly 11 million undocumented residents.

“No one should dispute (that) like every sovereign nation on this planet, we have a right to control who comes in. But unlike other countries, we are not afraid of people coming in here from other places,” said Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the most prominent Republican in the Gang of Eight and a potential 2016 presidential candidate. “I support this reform. Not just because I believe in immigrants, but because I believe in America even more.”

For many of the GOP’s strongest supporters, any path to citizenship for those who entered the country illegally is a form of unforgivable amnesty. They also don’t trust the Obama administration to fully enact the bill’s new border security measures, which are generally opposed by progressives.

“There’s just no way I can look my constituents in the eye and tell them that today’s assurances won’t become tomorrow’s disappointments,” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. “We’ll never resolve the immigration problem on a bipartisan basis either now or in the future until we can prove that the border is secure as a condition of legalization.”

Senate takes another step toward passing immigration reform

Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, called the vote on the measure “largely symbolic” and predicted the bill would ultimately be relegated to the “ash heap of history.”

If enacted, the measure would create a 13-year path to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants, while raising the cap on visas for high skilled workers and establishing a new visa program for low skilled workers on America’s farms.

A recently added border security amendment – introduced by GOP Sens. John Hoeven of North Dakota and Bob Corker of Tennessee – would require 20,000 more border agents, complete 700 miles of fence along the boundary with Mexico, and deploy $3.2 billion in technology upgrades similar to equipment used by U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The amendment also strengthens eligibility verification and border entry-exit controls.

Most undocumented immigrants would be eligible for permanent residency only after the five conditions have been met and verified by the Department of Homeland Security.

While Corker’s and Hoeven’s change appeared to sway some reticent Republicans in the Senate, top House Republicans remained opposed the overall blueprint.

“Apparently some haven’t gotten the message: the House is not going to take up and vote on whatever the Senate passes,” said Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. “We’re going to do our own bill … and move the legislation that reflects the will of our majority and the will of the American people.”

House Republicans have indicated their intention to tackle the issue with several smaller proposals instead of one larger bill.

Boehner repeated his pledge to block a vote on any immigration measure that doesn’t have the support of a majority of House Republicans. Democrats contend the Senate version would pass the House if brought to a vote, with a united Democratic caucus joined by some Republicans.

The speaker also refused to take a position on whether or not there should be some kind of path to citizenship for those who entered the country illegally.

Democrats have repeatedly warned they will not agree to a plan that lacks such a path.

Regardless, Boehner said he hopes the House will deal with immigration reform this year.

“I have made it clear since the day after the election that this political football should stop, and that the Congress should deal with this issue,” he said.

She Left The Post In October""]",- The Washington Post,"Facebook and Microsoft said they have been pressing the U.S. government for permission to talk more openly about the data requests since the media reported on a secret surveillance program that was aimed at tracking terrorist activities. (AFP/GETTY IMAGES)

Facebook and Microsoft for the first time on Friday said they had gotten data requests from the government under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, but they added that the U.S. government did not permit them to provide specific figures.

Instead, the government allowed the companies to release only broad numbers with no breakdowns. Over the last six months of 2012, Facebook said, it had received as many as 10,000 requests from local, state and federal agencies, which impacted as many as 19,000 accounts. Facebook has 1.1 billion accounts worldwide. Microsoft said that it received between 6,000 and 7,000 similar requests, affecting as many as 32,000 accounts.

The companies said some of the requests were for terrorism investigations. But others were from a local sheriff asking for data to locate a missing child or from federal marshals tracking fugitives. From these statements, it was impossible to ascertain the scale of the FISA requests made by the National Security Agency.

The companies said they have been pressing the U.S. government for permission to talk more openly about the data requests since The Washington Post and Guardian newspapers reported on a secret surveillance program code-named PRISM that was aimed at tracking terrorist activities. The reports cited an NSA PowerPoint presentation that said the agency connected directly to the servers of Facebook, Google, Microsoft and other tech-industry giants. Another NSA document described the program differently.

Facebook and other tech companies have vigorously denied giving the government direct access to their servers. But they said they comply with law enforcement requests approved by a court.

Beyond those statements, the firms have been unwilling to detail how they are cooperating with national security officials. Security experts have said the FISA orders likely prevented the companies from talking publicly about the data requests.

“In light of continued confusion and inaccurate reporting related to this issue, we’ve advocated for the ability to say even more,” Facebook general counsel Ted Ullyot wrote in a blog post late Friday.

As a result of recent negotiations with the government, Ullyot said, the company was permitted for the first time to give a range of how many U.S. local law enforcement and national security-related requests it has received. The government would not allow it to disclose specific numbers.

Facebook had been in “deep discussions with government officials throughout the week and released the information less than one minute” after gaining final government approval, a person familiar with the matter said.

That the company would rush to release a figure that gives the public little idea of the scale of the FISA requests is a sign of the pressure it has been under since the PRISM program was made public.

Google has released a range of the numbers of National Security Letters it got from the government every year since 2009. In each year, it was between zero and 999, except for 2010, when it was between 1,000 and 1,999. These figures do not include FISA requests.

A letter that Google sent to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III has prompted discussions with federal officials about whether Google can release more detailed information, said a person familiar with the talks.

In a statement late Friday, Google said: “We have always believed that it’s important to differentiate between different types of government requests. We already publish criminal requests separately from National Security Letters. Lumping the two categories together would be a step back for users. Our request to the government is clear: to be able to publish aggregate numbers of national security requests, including FISA disclosures, separately.”

The speaker's office announced Tuesday that it had hired Rebecca Tallent as a point person for immigration issues. Tallent previously was director of immigration policy for the Bipartisan Policy Center -- but before that, worked for Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and played a role in the drafting of the 2006 and 2007 immigration reform bills, which provided a pathway to legal status for some illegal immigrants.

The Federation for American Immigration Reform and other groups claimed the hiring was a sign that the House would consider an ""amnesty"" bill, despite pledges by Boehner that the House and Senate would not try to reconcile the differences between their bills through a process known as ""conference."" Foes of illegal immigration had been concerned that this process would allow a select group of negotiators to include a pathway to legal status for illegal immigrants even if the House previously opposed it.

""President Obama and Senate leaders have already said that they do not care what bill serves as the vehicle to get them to their desired objective of amnesty and massive immigration increases, just as long as they get there,"" FAIR said in an email blast Tuesday. ""It is clear, as a result of Tuesday's announcement by Boehner, that the legislative vehicle will be different, but the destination will be the same.""

Boehner spokesman Michael Steel defended the hire, telling The Washington Times that Tallent is a ""well-known expert in this field of public policy"" and a ""great addition to our team and that effort.""

He reiterated that Boehner wants ""step-by-step, common-sense immigration reforms.""

While the House has been sitting on the immigration issue for months, leadership is under heavy pressure by immigrant advocates to move legislation -- and to include a provision to address the millions of illegal immigrants currently in the United States.

In mid-November, Boehner ruled out negotiating with the Senate, saying “We have no intention of ever going to conference on the Senate bill.”

With just a few working days remaining before Congress adjourns for winter break, any House action would probably come next year. Some Republicans might want to wait until after the November elections to keep from having to take a tough vote on the issue before the midterms.

Any effort to push a bill perceived by conservatives as too light on border security and too lenient on legalization is sure to face stalwart opposition from some outspoken party members including Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions and Reps. Steve King, of Iowa, and Trey Gowdy, of South Carolina.

House Republicans have been under heavy pressure over the past several weeks to vote on a bill, with President Obama and big business leading the way.

On Friday, Obama visited a group of immigration activists staging a hunger strike at the base of Capitol Hill to push for a vote. And last week, the president restated his case in a speech in San Francisco’s Chinatown neighborhood.

The Democrat-controlled Senate passed its sweeping immigration bill earlier this year, led by New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, whom Republicans fear would get House negotiators to adopt his bill should the chambers go to conference."
http://www.breitbart.com/InstaBlog/2013/07/07/Sources-Secret-Court-Expands-NSA-Surveillance-Powers,2013-07-07 00:00:00,['Elizabeth Sheld'],Sources: Secret Court Expands NSA Surveillance Powers,"Officials say that more than a dozen classified rulings have created a secret body of law that gives the NSA the power to gather massive information collections on Americans. The data collection is not just restricted to terrorism suspects but “people possibly involved in nuclear proliferation, espionage and cyberattacks.”

According to officials who are familiar with these classified rulings, the court has expanded it’s role while assessing “broad constitutional questions” and establishing judicial precedents without any public scrutiny. Some rulings are over 100 pages long.

The role of the FISA court has changed over the years, originally approving case by case wiretaps. In 2007, with greater judicial oversight of intelligence operations and other legislation, the FISA court “has quietly become almost a parallel Supreme Court, serving as the ultimate arbiter on surveillance issues and delivering opinions that will most likely shape intelligence practices for years to come, the officials said.”

In particular the court has expanded the NSA’s surveillance authority under a legal principle called the “special needs” doctrine which allows, in cases of terrorism, “an exception to the Fourth Amendment’s requirement of a warrant for searches and seizures.” This doctrine was originally established by the Supreme Court in 1989 when it found that a minimal invasion of privacy is acceptable in order for the government to combat an “overriding” public danger. FISA judges have used this more broadly to allow collecting communications data to track terrorism suspects that “does not run afoul of the Fourth Amendment.”

William C. Banks, a national security law expert said “It seems like a legal stretch. It’s another way of tilting the scales toward the government in its access to all this data.”

In one instance, intelligence officials were allowed to access an email attachment that was sent within in the United States because there was suspicion that it contained the schematics of diagram that could have been connected to Iran’s nuclear program.

But this example of domestic surveillance is permissible because a 2008 law expanded the definition of “foreign intelligence” to include “weapons of mass destruction.” And other secret findings have “eased access to data on espionage, cyberattacks and other possible threats connected to foreign intelligence.”

“The definition of ‘foreign intelligence’ is very broad,” another former intelligence official said in an interview. “An espionage target, a nuclear proliferation target, that all falls within FISA, and the court has signed off on that.”

In an interview with the New York Times, “current and former national security officials, discussed the court’s rulings and the general trends they have established on the condition of anonymity because they are classified. Judges on the FISA court refused to comment on the scope and volume of their decisions.”

The FISA Court only hears one side of the cases that come before it (the government’s side) and findings are almost never made public. There is a “Court of Review” in case of appeal, but that has only happened “a handful of times in the court’s history, and no case has ever been taken to the Supreme Court.”

It may not even be possible for the communications companies who are turning over information to the government have a right to appear before the FISA court.

The FISA court was created by Congress in 1978 in order to serve as a check on wiretap abuses by the government. There are 11 judges who serve in 7 year shifts, ten were nominated by Chief Justice John Roberts. Last year the courts heard nearly 1800 cases and according to sources no requests were denied.

FISA judges have had to “intervene repeatedly” when “Internet and phone companies…have raised concerns that the government is overreaching in its demands for records or when the government itself reports that it has inadvertently collected more data than was authorized, the officials said.”

The court has ordered the the NSA to destroy communications records when information has been collected improperly. According to the New York Times’ sources,

The judges have concluded that the mere collection of enormous volumes of “metadata” — facts like the time of phone calls and the numbers dialed, but not the content of conversations — does not violate the Fourth Amendment, as long as the government establishes a valid reason under national security regulations before taking the next step of actually examining the contents of an American’s communications.

In 2008, Congress passed new procedures in the FISA Amendment acts where “the collection of metadata must be considered “relevant” to a terrorism investigation or other intelligence activities.” The courts hae indicated that while individual pieces of data may not appear relevant, “the total picture that the bits of data create may in fact be relevant.”

When pressed about informing the public about these issues, there has been push back. Reggie Walton, the FISA court’s presiding judge, said there could be a potential benefit but there are “serious obstacles.” General Alexander, the NSA director responded in a public Senate hearing in June “I don’t want to jeopardize the security of Americans by making a mistake in saying, ‘Yes, we’re going to do all that.’ ” Alexander pledged to try and make decisions more public."

The U.S. Navy entered the 22nd century on Saturday.

In Newport News, Virginia, the Navy christened its newest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford.

This nuclear-powered ship is the first of a new class of at least 10 carriers that the Navy expects will be steaming the seas, protecting the United States well into the next century.

The Ford itself is projected to stay in service until 2057.

This carrier is state-of-the-art in naval architecture, according to news releases from the Navy and the shipbuilder.



For example, the Ford will use electromagnetic force, similar to how modern roller coasters are propelled, to catapult planes off the deck instead of the pressurized steam used in today's fleet.

The arresting gear that grabs planes when they land will be software-controlled, with the goal being less wear and tear on the planes.

'Son of a Blackbird': Plan for new spy plane

The ship looks much like the current Nimitz-class carriers. It's roughly the same length, width and weight.

But the island - the superstructure that rises above the flight deck - is skinnier, taller and set farther aft on the ship, allowing for more flight-deck operations and plane maintenance. It's also part of the reason the Ford will be able to carry more warplanes and launch 25% more air missions per day than the current carriers in the fleet, according to the Navy.

Below the waterline its four 30-ton propellers will be driven by two newly-designed nuclear reactors.

The planes that will eventually be jumping off its deck in the decades ahead haven't even been designed yet. It remains to be seen if those planes have pilots or will be controlled by operators with computers who will ""fly"" the aircraft from the safety of a remote location.

This new class of carriers is designed with built-in flexibility to accommodate future Navy decisions about aircraft and missions.

And it's designed to do all this on the cheap. Most of the lights in the ship will use high-efficiency bulbs that will last twice as long between changes. And the ship is designed to require 30% less maintenance over its lifespan.

Bigger, lighter, deadlier! Navy launches new stealth destroyer

Finally and most importantly, because of designed efficiencies, it'll put to sea with 1,000 fewer sailors and Marines than a Nimitz-class carrier. Over the life of the Ford, the efficiency of the ship, the Navy said, will save $4 billion.

The ship is named after President Gerald R. Ford who served on the carrier USS Monterey during World War II and who later became President when Richard Nixon resigned in the wake of the Watergate scandal.

""It's very fitting that our next carrier, a ship that will calm the unknown crises of the future by its very presence offshore, will be named for President Gerald Ford,"" Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said at the ship's keel-laying.

The push to name the ship after Ford began years ago and then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld actually told Ford about the ship's name months before Ford's death in 2006, making the new carrier one of the few Navy ships named after a living person.

""How fitting it will be that the name Gerald R. Ford will patrol the high seas for decades to come, in the defense of the nation he loved so much,"" Rumsfeld said at Ford's funeral.

Ford's daughter, Susan Ford Bales, had the honor of breaking the traditional bottle of champagne on the ship's bow as it is launched.

Capt. John F. Meier has already been named as the ship's first commanding officer. He will be responsible for monitoring the final months of construction and likely be onboard when the Ford goes on its first sea trials.

""I'm thrilled to be here,"" Meier said in a Navy release last summer. ""I couldn't ask for a better assignment or a greater honor.""

But as the Navy launches its newest carrier, not all is well in the land of flattops.

Just last month, Adm. Jonathan Greenert, chief of naval operations, conceded that because of budget issues the Navy may have to reconsider how many aircraft carriers it will keep in the fleet

""You have to go where the money is, and carriers and air wings are quite expensive,"" Greenert said, according to a Virginia newspaper, the Daily Press. ""I'd hate to say it is inevitable, but we have to look very hard at it."""

As Eric Lichtblau reported in The Times on Sunday, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has for years been developing what is effectively a secret and unchallenged body of law on core Fourth Amendment issues, producing lengthy classified rulings based on the arguments of the federal government — the only party allowed in the courtroom. [...] As outrageous as the blanket secrecy of the surveillance court is, we are equally troubled by the complete absence of any adversarial process, the heart of our legal system. [...] Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, recently reintroduced a bill that would require declassification. It was defeated in December. In light of the national uproar over the most recent revelations, the leadership in Congress should push to pass it and begin to shine some light on this dark corner of the judicial system. We don’t know what we’ll find. The surveillance court may be strictly adhering to the limits of the Fourth Amendment as interpreted by the Supreme Court. Or not. And that’s the problem: This court has morphed into an odd hybrid that seems to exist outside the justice system, even as its power grows in ways that we can’t see.

Many people compare Edward Snowden to me unfavorably for leaving the country and seeking asylum, rather than facing trial as I did. I don’t agree. The country I stayed in was a different America, a long time ago.There is no chance that experience could be reproduced today, let alone that a trial could be terminated by the revelation of White House actions against a defendant that were clearly criminal in Richard Nixon’s era — and figured in his resignation in the face of impeachment — but are today all regarded as legal (including an attempt to “incapacitate me totally”). I hope Snowden’s revelations will spark a movement to rescue our democracy, but he could not be part of that movement had he stayed here. There is zero chance that he would be allowed out on bail if he returned now and close to no chance that, had he not left the country, he would have been granted bail. Instead, he would be in a prison cell like Bradley Manning, incommunicado.

Meanwhile, Daniel Ellsberg writes an op-ed in The Washington Post arguing leaker Edward Snowden was right to flee the country:Do you agree?

Greg Sargent thinks Democrats need to step it up when it comes to revising the nation's spying laws:



Progressives and Dems who continue to care about this issue can push Democratic leaders to vocally call for more transparency around these opinions and to get behind the proposal being pushed by a bipartisan group of Senators, including progressive Jeff Merkley and Tea Partyer Mike Lee — and a companion measure in the House — that would compel the Obama administration to declassify and release them.

Here’s the current state of play so far: Most Democratic leaders have yet to take a public position on this legislation, according to a quick survey of their offices I undertook today

http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/06/23/1218217/-Gregory-asks-why-Glenn-Greenwald-why-he-shouldn-t-be-Prosecuted,2013-06-23 00:00:00,"['This Content Is Not Subject To Review Daily Kos Staff Prior To Publication.', 'Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags']",Gregory asks Glenn Greenwald why he shouldn't be Prosecuted?,"Greenwald continues:



“If you want to embrace that theory it means that every investigative journalist in the United States who works with their sources, who receives classified information is a criminal,” he continued. “And it’s precisely those theories and precisely that climate that has become so menacing in the United States.”

He went on the name examples such as Daniel Ellsberg and others who have revealed classified information to journalist involving actions that were a betrayal of the American people. Historically many of those whistle-blowers have been validated and vindicated. Not so much recently.

But you could really tell that Greenwald hit a nerve when Gregory shot back with this.



“Well, the question of who’s a journalist may be up to debate with regard of what you are doing,” Gregory opined. “And of course, anybody who’s watching this understands I was asking a question, that question has been raised by lawmakers as well.”

Oh fuck dude, really? This is a story that has gone through a fully legitimate set of papers, the Washington Post and the Guardian - and you're going to excuse your accusing another journalist of being aby turning around and questioning whether hea Journalist?

And your justification is that your just asking a question that ""Lawmakers have asked""?

That doesn't make it a legitimate question, which it wasn't. It was an Attack pure and simple. It was an attempt to de-legitimize the messenger. It was an accusation, based on nothing, that Greenwald has been helping Snowden Flee and/or Evade Capture, when an arrest warrant hadn't even been issued for Snowden in Hong Kong yet. How exactly could Greenwald be prosecuted for being Snowden's ""Travel Agent"" through China and Russia? What makes anyone think Greenwald could help with that, particularly since it's already been reported that a set of Wikileaks Attorney's are traveling with him?

What are they accusing Greenwald of doing? Providing the in-flight meal? Paying for his Upgrade to First Class? What are we talking about here?

Basically as he pointed out, Greenwald is being smeared as a co-conspirator by other journalists with NO EVIDENCE what so ever. I just finished a diary which included Fox News attacking Eric Holder for authorizing a warrant on Reporter James Rosen as a ""co-conspirator"" in the CIA Leak, cuz Reporters are ""Heroes"" for leaking on the Obama Administration, unless they're Liberal Journalist like Glenn Greenwald, then they should possibly be prosecuted, exactly the way James Rosen hasn't been - yet. The irony ratio here is quite high. So is the crazy ratio.

And it wasn't just Gregory, later in the show Chuck Todd reiterated the charge in a attempt to rehabilitate the question and further discredit Greenwald.



Todd: ""He rejected the premise of the question, he didn't answer it"".

No, he didn't answer it because we've NEVER DONE THAT. We've never prosecuted journalists for reporting information that was given to them by insiders and leakers. It waswhether Judith Miller or Robert Novak

There was a point in time when the most radical on the right-wing thought New York Times Editor Bill Keller should have been tried for Treason when this story was first revealed back in 2006 - but nobody, nobody took that seriously. Well, nobody that should have been anybody.



For a meeting without historical precedent, the president of the United States had called the Times to the White House to personally try to prevent a state secret from appearing in print—an exposé of the National Security Agency’s efforts to monitor phone calls without court-approved warrants that the Times had held back on for over a year. Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. sat in a wing chair facing Bush, while Keller and Washington bureau chief Philip Taubman sat across from Bush’s lawyer, Harriet Miers, and national-security adviser Stephen Hadley. General Michael Hayden, the then-director of the National Security Agency, sat alongside Bush with a thick briefing book in his lap. After stiff pleasantries, Bush issued an emphatic warning: If they revealed the secret program to the public and there was another terrorist attack on American soil, the Paper of Record would be implicated. “The basic message,” recalls Keller, “was, ‘You’ll have blood on your hands.’ ”

The Times held the story, for awhile, then eventually published it. No charges were filed. Even in this White House meeting, that possibility wasn't evenbecause there

If you think there was a statute that could have allowed George Bush to Prosecute the New York Times way back then - don't you think he would have tried?

It was never seriously on the table because that National Security Statute applies to the person with the Security Clearance, not the people they talk to. It's doesn't apply to journalists. There's a reason we don't have a ""Sedition Act"".

The sad part is that this line of questioning was really a smoke-screen to make Greenwald the issue instead of the NSA. Greenwald, just prior to this, made a series of allegations based on documents leaked by Snowden that EVEN THE FISA COURT THOUGHT THE BREATH AND SCOPE OF NSA SURVEILLANCE WAS BEYOND THE PATRIOT ACT, BEYOND THE LAW AND CONSTITUTION.

He said he had in his position a Secret 80-page decision to that effect. As far as I know that document has not been released yet.

I admit the bread and circus act of personality conflict can grab our attention far more easily that the truly salient details, in fact I'm hoping that may occur with lede in the very diary, but if that helps more eyeballs get the center of what Greenwald said prior to his tit v tat with Gregory over ""Journalism"" - so be it.

Behold.



Gregory >> with regard to that specific fisa opinion, isn't the case based on people that i've talked to, that the fisa opinion based on the government's request is that they said, well, you can get this but you can't get that? that would actually go beyond the scope of what you're allowed to do, which means that the request was changed or denied, which is the whole point the government makes, which is that there is actual judicial review here and not abuse. isn't this the kind of review and opinion that you would want to keep these programs in line? Greenwald >> i don't know what government officials are whispering to you, david, but i know that the documents that i have in my possession and that i have read from the nsa tell a much different story, which is that there was an 80-page opinion from the fisa court that said that what the nsa is doing in spying on american citizens is a violation of both the fourth amendment and the bounds of the statute. and it specifically said that they are collecting bulk transmissions, multiple conversations from millions of americans, not just people that are believed to be involved in terrorist organizations or working for a foreign agent, and that this is illegal. and the nsa then planned to try and accommodate that ruling. but i think the real issue as journalists and as citizens is, why should we have to this? how can we have a democracy in which a secret court rule that what the government is doing in spying on us is a violation of the constitution and the law and yet we sit here and don't know what that ruling is because it's all been concealed and all been secret? i think we need to have transparency and disclosure, and that's why mr. snowden stepped forward so, that we could have that. >> there are reports he's ultimately headed to venezuela. is that your understanding? >> i don't -- i'm not going to talk about where he's headed or what his plans are. i think it's up in the air. i'm not sure where he's headed. he's my source for these stories. i'm not going to talk about where he's going.

Yeah, that's some realstuff right there David. I myself, would like to see those documents where even the FISA Court said what the NSA was doing was illegal, and I'd like to see exactly how thein a way that allowed them to continue the program to the satisfaction of the court.

This is the crux of this issue, do we have any meaningful ""oversight"" or are these NSA people running amok in defiance of the Court and the Law?

We're spending far more time debating the Hero/Traitor on the Run questions regarding Eddie Snowden the Celebrity than we are the content of what he's actually released. For example what are the NSA guidelines that limit collection and retention of U.S. Data?



The top secret documents published today detail the circumstances in which data collected on US persons under the foreign intelligence authority must be destroyed, extensive steps analysts must take to try to check targets are outside the US, and reveals how US call records are used to help remove US citizens and residents from data collection. However, alongside those provisions, the Fisa court-approved policies allow the NSA to: • Keep data that could potentially contain details of US persons for up to five years; • Retain and make use of ""inadvertently acquired"" domestic communications if they contain usable intelligence, information on criminal activity, threat of harm to people or property, are encrypted, or are believed to contain any information relevant to cybersecurity; • Preserve ""foreign intelligence information"" contained within attorney-client communications; • Access the content of communications gathered from ""U.S. based machine[s]"" or phone numbers in order to establish if targets are located in the US, for the purposes of ceasing further surveillance.

Is it reasonable to keep this information for up to five years, even if it includes private information on U.S. Citizens? Even if it contains information protected by attorney-client privilege? Even if it the data doesn't have national security, but merely ""criminal"" implications?

We have this now, are we talking about it? Are the ""Journalists""? Nope. Is Snowden headed to Paraguay? Squirrel!!!!

Pathetic.

REUTERS/Tim Wimborne

Leaks to the press, like hillside rain tugged seaward by gravity, gather momentum only if the flow is steadily replenished.

After a major leak to the Guardian‘s Glenn Greenwald resulted in a scoop Wednesday about the National Security Agency’s harvesting of phone records, reporters instantly mined their back pages for leads and rang up their sources to amplify and extend his story, and went looking for leakers of their own. In other words, the press pack prayed for rain.

But before that scoop had run its course, Greenwald (and Ewen MacAskill) went to press with another revelation about the NSA’s Prism program, which collects email, chat, VOIP conversations, file transfers, photos, videos and more from Web users. A similar Washington Post piece by Barton Gellman and documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras beat the Guardian duo by a few minutes, a downpour in a very short time. The Guardian-Post overlap was so pronounced that it’s likely the two publications were nurtured by the same source, identified in the Post as “a career intelligence officer.”

Friday afternoon, Greenwald and MacAskill dropped another bombshell about Obama’s cyberattack plans in the Guardian. These aren’t leaks. This is a flood.

Faster than you can say evaporation-condensation-precipitation, I expect this week’s exposés to produce additional investigations that will produce more leaks and further scoops about our digital records. This will now fuel new cycles of reporting, leaks and scoops — and another, and another — as new sources are cultivated and reportorial scraps gathering mold in journalists’ notebooks gain new relevance and help break stories.

Greenwald’s storm will continue to rage because, I suspect, the story won’t be limited to just phone records or Web data. Ultimately, it will be about the government’s pursuit of all the digital breadcrumbs we produce as necessary byproducts of day-to-day life — and phone records and Web data are just a small part.

Bank records, credit history, travel records, credit card records, EZPass data, GPS phone data, license-plate reader databases, Social Security and Internal Revenue Service records, facial-recognition databases at the Department of Motor Vehicles and elsewhere, even 7-Eleven surveillance videos comprise information lodes that are of equal or greater value to the national security establishment than phone and Web files. It doesn’t sound paranoid to conclude that the government has reused, or will reuse, the interpretation of the Patriot Act it presented to the secret FISA court in its phone record and Prism data requests to grab these other data troves.

Lest I sound like a Fourth Amendment hysteric, I understand there’s nothing automatically sacrosanct about any of the digital trails we leave behind. Lawful subpoenas can liberate all sorts records about you, electronic or otherwise.

What’s breathtaking about these two government surveillance programs that the Guardian and the Washington Post have revealed is that they’re vast collections of data about hundreds of millions of people suspected of no wrongdoing and not part of any civil action. Defending the phone-record cull, National Intelligence Director James R. Clapper explained this week that smaller sets of information aren’t very useful in screening for and identifying “terrorism-related communications,” hence all must collected.

Besides, as the government and its supporters insist, phone-record metadata does not include the names of individuals or organizations connected to the phone numbers (and government eavesdropping isn’t part of the operation).

I won’t belabor the point made better in scores of venues this week about how massive phone-record sets can be manipulated to produce revelatory information about individuals. Not even a saint could resist the siren call to combine data sets and use them in impermissible ways for “the good of the people.”

Even before governments start to combine data, it knows too much about you. Once it gets started, it can know practically everything worth knowing. A former NSA employee captured the grand scheme succinctly last year when he told Wired magazine, “We are, like, that far from a turnkey totalitarian state.”

Daniel J. Solove, who has been beavering away at privacy issues for some time, addresses what he calls the “exclusion” problem posed by the government’s massing of personal data. He writes:

“Many government national-security measures involve maintaining a huge database of information that individuals cannot access. Indeed, because they involve national security, the very existence of these programs is often kept secret. This kind of information processing, which blocks subjects’ knowledge and involvement, is a kind of due-process problem. It is a structural problem, involving the way people are treated by government institutions and creating a power imbalance between people and the government. To what extent should government officials have such a significant power over citizens? This issue isn’t about what information people want to hide but about the power and the structure of government.”

Journalists love nothing more than to learn and share secrets, which, with the Guardian and the Washington Post as our guides, appear to be in ample supply.

If anything, journalists are fully vested in maintaining their constitutional rights to ask questions, associate freely, and speak and write their minds. If journalists react strongly to government intrusions — even well-meaning intrusions intended to protect us from acts of terrorism — it’s because we’re too intimate with the misuse of power and regard most government secrets as measures designed to displace freedom in favor of security.

Or as a character in David Hare’s film Page Eight put it disparagingly, “We can’t be free because we have to be safe.”

The only thing that beats leakers is a long, hard freeze. In my experience, fire beats ice every time.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/06/17/exclusive-father-edward-snowden-urges-son-to-stop-leaking-come-home/,2013-06-17 00:00:00,[],"EXCLUSIVE: Father of Edward Snowden urges son not to commit 'treason,' to return home","The father of the former NSA contractor who leaked details of the government's massive Internet- and phone-tracking programs made an impassioned plea to his son to stop leaking, telling Fox News that ""I hope, I pray"" he does not do anything considered treasonous.

Lon Snowden spoke at length with Fox News about his son Edward's decision to leak sensitive security details about U.S. intelligence-gathering operations. While defending his son's integrity and criticizing the government, he pleaded with his son -- who is thought to be weathering the political storm from a location in Hong Kong -- to return home and not to leak more information.

""I hope, I pray and I ask that you will not release any secrets that could constitute treason,"" Snowden told Fox News, in a message meant for his son's ears. He added: ""I sense that you're under much stress [from] what I've read recently, and [ask] that you not succumb to that stress ... and make a bad decision.""

Further, Snowden said he would rather see his son return to the U.S. and face the U.S. justice system than stay abroad.

""I would like to see Ed come home and face this. I shared that with the government when I spoke with them. I love my son,"" he told Fox News' Eric Bolling.

Snowden claimed there are some people who want him to ""cross that line and do something that constitutes treason, or they would like to see him disappear."" But Snowden said he's sure ""that the moment he landed that there would be a line of attorneys waiting to defend him.""

Edward Snowden himself did not voice that level of confidence. During a live online chat hosted by Guardian.com on Monday, Snowden said he doesn't think he would receive a fair trial in the U.S.

""The U.S. Government, just as they did with other whistle-blowers, immediately and predictably destroyed any possibility of a fair trial at home, openly declaring me guilty of treason and that the disclosure of secret, criminal and even unconstitutional acts is an unforgivable crime. That's not justice, and it would be foolish to volunteer yourself to it if you can do more good outside of prison than in it,"" he said during the chat.

Snowden also claimed he did not reveal any U.S. operations against ""legitimate military targets,"" but rather NSA efforts against ""civilian infrastructure.""

Snowden has emerged at the center of one of the biggest security leaks in U.S. history. After The Guardian news organization and Washington Post reported on government programs that monitor massive troves of phone and Internet records, Snowden was revealed as the source of that information. According to The Guardian, Snowden continues to provide sensitive information -- The Guardian most recently reported on a British effort to hack into foreign diplomats' phones and emails during conferences, citing Snowden as the source.

Snowden could face serious charges if he returns to the U.S. Former Vice President Dick Cheney called Snowden a ""traitor"" on ""Fox News Sunday.""

But others have praised his decision to come forward, citing the civil liberties at stake.

Lon Snowden said he was ""saddened"" by his son's decision, but criticized the government for the surveillance efforts his son helped expose.

""Some people are suggesting that what's occurring is very similar to every morning the government walks up to your mailbox, or afternoon. They pull the envelopes out. They open them. They look at your mail. They copy it. They archive it in case they wanna look at it sometime in the future in case you do something wrong sometime in the future. They re-seal the envelopes, they put them back in your mailbox. And they do it every day over and over and over again.""

He continued: ""I don't want them reading my email. ... If we say, ""Oh my gosh, we're going to have to ... sacrifice our freedoms because of the threat of terrorism,' well, the terrorists have already won, because it's our freedoms that make us Americans.""

He said he's concerned his son is ""in peril,"" but voiced confidence that if he returns to the U.S., that would be best.

""I have faith in our justice system applied correctly, absolutely. You know, I would rather my son be a prisoner in the U.S. than a free man in a country that did not have ... the freedoms that are protected"" in the U.S., he said.

He complained there are a lot of misconceptions about his son, including speculation about why he chose to stay in Hong Kong. Snowden said his son was simply ""comfortable"" there and with Asian culture in general, since he used to live in Japan.

As for media reports that he's a high-school dropout, he explained that his son actually had an illness during his sophomore year -- likely mono. But after he dropped out, he said his son completed his high-school equivalency and went on to take college courses.

He said he last saw his son on April 4. ""We'd gone out to dinner,"" he said, adding that his son seemed to be carrying a ""burden.""

""We hugged as we always do. He said, 'I love you Dad.' I said, 'I love you, Ed.' And I expected to see him -- see him again,"" Snowden recalled.

Lawmakers Push to Hold Boston Suspect as Enemy Combatant,"Beyond the absence of known links between Mr. Tsarnaev and Al Qaeda, it is also unclear whether the Constitution permits the government to hold citizens arrested on domestic soil as enemy combatants. Though Mr. Graham believes that it would be lawful, other lawmakers disagree. Neither Congress nor the Supreme Court has resolved the question.

During the Bush administration, the Supreme Court upheld the indefinite military detention of Yaser Esam Hamdi, an American citizen who was captured carrying a weapon on the Afghanistan battlefield.

But the court never resolved the case of another American, Jose Padilla, whom the Bush administration held as an enemy combatant for several years after his arrest in Chicago. Two different federal appeals courts disagreed about whether it was lawful to hold someone like Mr. Padilla in indefinite detention without trial, and the Bush administration transferred him back to the civilian court system before the Supreme Court took up the case.

In the Hamdi ruling, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor wrote “there is no bar to this nation’s holding one of its own citizens as an enemy combatant.” But she also wrote the decision was limited to Mr. Hamdi’s “narrow circumstances.” She also said the purpose of wartime detention was to keep captured enemies from returning to fight, adding, “Certainly, we agree that indefinite detention for the purpose of interrogation is not authorized.”

Mr. Graham said the purpose of holding Mr. Tsarnaev as a military detainee would be to question him at length without any lawyer. Though the Obama administration has said it would use a public-safety exception to the Miranda rule to question him for a period without warning him of his rights to remain silent and have a lawyer, Mr. Graham said that would at best gain only a few days before a lawyer intervened.

Mr. Graham also acknowledged that ultimately Mr. Tsarnaev must be transferred back to the civilian criminal justice system for prosecution, because the statute authorizing military commissions — which he helped write — does not apply to United States citizens. Mr. Graham, one of the leading Republican voices opposing the torture of terrorism suspects, emphasized that interrogation as an enemy combatant would not mean inflicting suffering on Mr. Tsarnaev in order to make him talk, and that anything he said in military detention should not be used as courtroom evidence.

But Mr. Graham rejected the view that the Federal Bureau of Investigation might be equally or more effective than intelligence officials at persuading Mr. Tsarnaev to provide information, even with a defense lawyer at his side, since the law enforcement officials would have the leverage of being able to float more favorable treatment in exchange for cooperation as part of a potential plea bargain. He said interrogators needed to build a rapport with a prisoner, suggesting that any presence of a lawyer would disrupt that dynamic.

“That is, to me, the dumbest way to induce someone to talk,” he said of such tools and tactics of law enforcement officials. “I want intelligence officials trained in the intelligence process to have a chance to talk to him, without a lawyer.”"

Anti-illegal immigration groups and others accused the Obama administration of playing politics, while an immigrant rights group said the incident showed the administration had detained people they shouldn’t have in the first place.

John Hill, executive director of the Phoenix-based anti-illegal immigration group Stand With Arizona, said the Department of Homeland Security was using immigration security as a political weapon.

“The shocking, lawless actions of DHS in releasing thousands of illegal aliens from detention merely to score points on sequestration proves what we have said all along: The DHS is far too politicized to be trusted to implement either the Obama or the ‘Gang of 8' immigration reform plans,” Hill said in a statement.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said the release of “several hundred” detainees since last Thursday from deportation centers across the nation was in anticipation of spending cuts linked to the so-called budget sequestration, which mandates across-the-board cuts starting Friday unless Congress reaches a compromise.

“As fiscal uncertainty remains over the continuing resolution and possible sequestration, ICE has reviewed its detained population to ensure detention levels stay within ICE’s current budget,” ICE spokeswoman Amber Cargile said in a statement. “Over the last week, ICE has reviewed several hundred cases and placed these individuals on methods of supervision less costly than detention.”

Agency officials emphasized that those freed were on supervised release, with telephonic and electronic monitoring.

Cargile, based in Phoenix, said all of the released detainees remained in removal proceedings. She said priority for detention remained on serious criminal offenders and other individuals who are believed to pose a significant threat to public safety.

United We Dream, a youth-led network advocating for the legalization of 11 million people who are in the country illegally, said it took a “manufactured crisis to reunite families.”

“Every day I get calls from families being torn apart with a loved one about to be deported,” Carolina Canizales, coordinator of United We Dream’s End Our Pain Program, said in a statement. “Low-priority individuals — people who pose absolutely no risk or danger to society, but rather are upstanding members of their communities and families — should not have been locked up to begin with.”

Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said she was “appalled” by the mass release, adding that it had been done “under the guise of federal budget cuts.”

Immigration officials said they had released 303 detainees since last Thursday from four Arizona facilities: Florence Detention Center, Eloy Detention Center, Pinal County Jail and Central Arizona Detention Center. An estimated 2,280 immigration detainees remain in custody in those facilities.

Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu criticized the move, saying it was harming public safety.

“These are illegals that even President Obama wants to deport,” Babeu said in a statement on the sheriff’s department website. “This is insane that public safety is sacrificed when it should be the budget priority that’s safeguarded.”

He contended that ICE agents were paid overtime over the weekend to release 500 detainees from Pinal County Jail alone.

ICE officials contradicted him, saying they had released a total of 52 people from the Pinal County Jail, not 500.

A Republican congressman, I bet.

With the House dragging its feet on immigration, vexed by internal GOP infighting on how to proceed, supporters of reform want to force the House to act, and they've zeroed in on the discharge petition as the means to that end.

A discharge petition means that if a majority of the House demands a vote, the vote will take place. And since it's widely acknowledged that there are more than enough votes in the House to pass the Senate bill, all you'd have to do is get those pro-reform Republicans to join Democrats in signing the discharge petition to make it happen.

Some Democrats are afraid that pushing a discharge petition could upset delicate bipartisan negotiations currently underway in the House. Others note that it's the best way to publicly put recalcitrant members on the record on the issue of immigration. And it's true! Absent a vote clearly feared by the xenophobes, the discharge petition forces individual members to publicly state whether they are for or against reform. Let fast-growing immigrant communities know exactly where the obstruction is coming from.

But don't get your hopes up. Even if a full-throated discharge petition campaign were launched, few if any Republicans would likely sign on. In essence, any Republican signatories would be ceding control of the chamber to the minority party, and you better believe the Republican leadership would severely punish any member that signed on.

So as a tool to actually pass a bill, a discharge petition would be as effective as House Speaker John Boehner's leadership style. That is, not effective at all. But as a tool to further pressure and embarrass Republicans? It would certainly work, and it would provide yet another news hook for Spanish-language media to keep pounding on Republicans.

Because right now, that's the only tactic reform proponents have left—try and embarrass Republicans into taking an action they'd clearly rather avoid.

Sign our petition urging U.S. House members to bring comprehensive immigration reform to a floor vote, with or without Speaker Boehner.

The call-records program is not surveillance.

This program has played a role in stopping roughly a dozen terror plots.

The Senate Intelligence Committee will soon consider legislation to add public reporting requirements and more court review.

The NSA call-records program is legal and subject to extensive congressional and judicial oversight. Above all, the program has been effective in helping to prevent terrorist plots against the U.S. and our allies. Congress should adopt reforms to improve transparency and privacy protections, but I believe the program should continue.

The call-records program is not surveillance. It does not collect the content of any communication, nor do the records include names or locations. The NSA only collects the type of information found on a telephone bill: phone numbers of calls placed and received, the time of the calls and duration. The Supreme Court has held this ""metadata"" is not protected under the Fourth Amendment.

This program helps ""connect the dots"" — the main failure of our intelligence before 9/11. Former FBI director Robert Mueller and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified that if this program existed before 9/11, it likely would have identified the presence inside the U.S. of hijacker Khalid al-Mihdhar.

The NSA uses these records to identify connections between known and suspected terrorists (as well as terror conspirators and supporters). The overwhelming majority of records are never reviewed before being destroyed, but it is necessary for the NSA to obtain ""the haystack"" of records in order to find the terrorist ""needle.""

Only a strictly limited number of NSA analysts (among the thousands of professionals at the agency) may search the phone records database and only after articulating a specific reason that must be approved by a senior official. Those decisions are reviewed regularly by the Justice Department, Congress and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Court, which imposes strict privacy protections.

To be effective, the NSA must be able to conduct these queries quickly, without regard to which phone carrier a terrorist or conspirator uses. And the records must be available for a few years — longer than phone companies need them for billing purposes.

Since its inception, this program has played a role in stopping roughly a dozen terror plots and identifying terrorism supporters in the U.S. Given the threats we face from al-Qaeda and others, we need all legal tools at our disposal.

The Senate Intelligence Committee will soon consider legislation to add public reporting requirements and more court review, and to codify existing procedures into law. I hope this will restore public confidence to a program that continues to protect the homeland from terrorism.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., is chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee."

Protesters travel from Dupont Circle to the White House to show support for the leaker, who was found not guilty of aiding enemy but guilty of espionage. Army Pfc. Bradley Manning used his access to classified information to disclose more than 700,000 documents to the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks.

Two days before the Army opens the court-martial of Manning, accused of giving 700,000 classified government and military files to the anti-secrecy Web site WikiLeaks, protesters at Fort Meade in Maryland called for his release.

Two days before the Army opens the court-martial of Manning, accused of giving 700,000 classified government and military files to the anti-secrecy Web site WikiLeaks, protesters at Fort Meade in Maryland called for his release.

For more than three years, Army Pfc. Bradley E. Manning has been in detention awaiting court-martial for the largest leak of classified documents in U.S. history. When his trial finally opens Monday, it will be the latest and most high-profile in a series of leak prosecutions brought by the Obama administration.

Manning, a boyish-looking 25, is accused of passing more than 700,000 government and military files to the anti-secrecy Web site WikiLeaks. The material, which was widely disseminated, included videos of airstrikes that killed civilians, sensitive diplomatic cables and military reports from Iraq and Afghanistan.

He faces 22 charges, including a military charge of aiding the enemy, which could send him to prison for life without parole. He is also charged with violating the Espionage Act, a 1917 law created to try spies and traitors, which carries severe penalties.

There was a crowd of more than thirty Manning supporters protesting at the main gates of Fort Meade in Maryland in the rain to mark the start of the trial. Protesters held signs like “free Bradley Manning” and “Does America Have a Conscience.”

In pretrial proceedings, Manning admitted leaking the material, saying he intended to “spark a domestic debate over the role of the military and our foreign policy in general.” He has offered to plead guilty to 10 lesser charges relating to the misuse of classified information, which could send him to prison for 20 years.

The prosecution’s insistence on proceeding with the two most serious charges, with their harsh penalties, has led even some critics of Manning’s actions to question whether the government is going too far.

Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center for Justice’s Liberty and National Security Program, called Manning’s leaks “reckless” and “a data dump.” But she said that “he is not an enemy of the state” and that putting him behind bars for life “is overreaching.”

Michael Ratner, president emeritus of the Center for Constitutional Rights, said he was shocked the government proceeded after the plea offer. “It is like hitting Manning with a sledgehammer,” he said. “They have him for 20 years, and then they go for life. Twenty years is enough for a pound of Manning’s flesh.”

For its part, the prosecution said Manning must be held accountable. “Pfc. Manning was a U.S. analyst who we trained and trusted to use multiple intelligence systems . . . and he used that training to defy our trust,” Army Maj. Ashden Fein, a prosecutor, said in one pretrial hearing.

Manning, he said, “knowingly engaged in a six-month-long criminal enterprise of harvesting classified information” to send to WikiLeaks, “while knowing and understanding that enemies would have access to the information.” The enemies, Fein said, include al-Qaeda.

The differences of opinion over Manning, a former Army intelligence analyst, extend to the core of the case. Since his arrest in Iraq in May 2010, he has become a polarizing figure of international stature. Supporters see him as a heroic whistleblower; critics view him as a traitor who harmed the nation and put lives at risk. He is even a figure in a new documentary film that focuses on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to avoid questioning in Sweden about sex crimes that two women have accused him of committing.

The treatment of Manning at times over the past three years — his clothes were taken away, and he was held in isolation — has led to international protests. And the military’s decision to withhold judicial rulings from the public has led to lawsuits.

Manning’s supporters held a protest march and rally outside Maryland’s Fort Meade on Saturday. Protesters carried signs, some reading “Free Bradley” and “Bradley Manning: Jailed for exposing war crimes.”

Now, after months of pretrial hearings, motions and disputes over the use of classified information and public access to proceedings, the trial will begin in a spare courtroom behind Fort Meade’s guarded gates.

Barring a last-minute plea deal, the court-martial will be one of the biggest military trials since the cases stemming from the My Lai massacre in the Vietnam War. The process is expected to last at least 12 weeks, and the government plans to call 150 witnesses — 24 of them in partially closed sessions to prevent what the judge, Army Col. Denise Lind, called “spillage of classified information.”

Manning opted to be tried by a judge rather than a jury of military members. Lind, who has presided over the pretrial hearings, has granted Manning 112 days’ credit toward his sentence if he is convicted, to compensate for his treatment.

Analysts are divided on how tough a challenge prosecutors face to win convictions on the most serious charges. The Brennan Center’s Goitein said that under a ruling by Lind, prosecutors will have to prove only that Manning had “reason to believe” that the documents disclosed could be used to harm the United States or to aid a foreign power. They need not prove that he intended to harm the United States.

“I suspect that the government can meet this burden on at least some of the counts,” Goitein said.

But some former prosecutors said it could be difficult to prove intent to harm the United States.

“A lot of times, you think something is damaging,” said Baruch Weiss, a former federal prosecutor and an expert on the Espionage Act, “and the reality proves to be otherwise.”

Even some of Manning’s critics argue that his disclosures served the public interest in some instances. They cite his leak of a video showing an Apache helicopter assault in Baghdad that killed Iraqi civilians and two journalists, the disclosure of risk assessments for several dozen Guantanamo Bay detainees showing no record of why they were transferred to the military prison, and accounts of unreported civilian deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq.

On the other hand, they argue that some disclosures put foreign relations or even lives at risk with no obvious benefit to public debate. One example is the disclosure of the names of Afghan informants cooperating with allied forces, which put them in danger and forced steps to find and protect them.

The secrecy surrounding the court-martial, while not unusual in military cases, has frustrated observers. Lind has read lengthy rulings from the bench but not made them available. More than 30,000 pages of classified and unclassified motions have been produced in the case, but none of the unclassified material has been released.

Even documents that Manning has admitted providing to WikiLeaks, and which have been published worldwide, remain classified and cannot be mentioned in open court."
http://news.yahoo.com/report-nsa-contract-worker-surveillance-source-185911834.html,,[],Report: NSA contract worker is surveillance source,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A 29-year-old intelligence contractor who claims to have worked at the National Security Agency and the CIA allowed himself to be revealed Sunday as the source of disclosures about the U.S. government's secret surveillance programs, risking prosecution by the U.S. government.

The leaks have reopened the post-Sept. 11 debate about privacy concerns versus heightened measure to protect against terrorist attacks, and led the NSA to ask the Justice Department to conduct a criminal investigation into the leaks.

The Guardian, the first paper to disclose the documents, said it was publishing the identity of Edward Snowden, a former technical assistant for the CIA and current employee of defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, at his own request.

""My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them,"" Snowden told the newspaper.

Stories in The Guardian and The Washington Post published over the last week revealed two surveillance programs, and both published interviews with Snowden on Sunday.

One of them is a phone records monitoring program in which the NSA gathers hundreds of millions of U.S. phone records each day, creating a database through which it can learn whether terror suspects have been in contact with people in the U.S. The Obama administration says the NSA program does not listen to actual conversations.

Separately, an Internet scouring program, code-named PRISM, allows the NSA and FBI to tap directly into nine U.S. Internet companies to gather all Internet usage — audio, video, photographs, emails and searches. The effort is designed to detect suspicious behavior that begins overseas.

Snowden said claims the programs are secure are not true.

""Any analyst at any time can target anyone. Any selector. Anywhere. Where those communications will be picked up depends on the range of those sensor networks and the authority that that analyst is empowered with,"" Snowden said, in accompanying video on the Guardian's website. ""Not all analysts have the power to target anything. But I, sitting at my desk, had the authority to wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant to a federal judge to even the president if I had a personal email.""

Story continues

He told the Post that he would ""ask for asylum from any countries that believe in free speech and oppose the victimization of global privacy"" in an interview from Hong Kong, where he is staying.

""I'm not going to hide,"" Snowden told the Post. ""Allowing the U.S. government to intimidate its people with threats of retaliation for revealing wrongdoing is contrary to the public interest.""

The Post declined to elaborate on its reporting about Snowden.

The spokesman for the Director of National Intelligence, Shawn Turner, said intelligence officials are ""currently reviewing the damage that has been done by these recent disclosures,"" adding that ""Any person who has a security clearance knows that he or she has an obligation to protect classified information and abide by the law.""

He referred further comment to the Justice Department.

""The Department of Justice is in the initial stages of an investigation into the unauthorized disclosure of classified information by an individual with authorized access,"" said Nanda Chitre, Justice Department spokeswoman. ""Consistent with longstanding department policy and procedure and in order to protect the integrity of the investigation, we must decline further comment.""

In a statement, Booz Allen confirmed that Snowden ""has been an employee of our firm for less than 3 months, assigned to a team in Hawaii."" The statement said if the news reports of what he has leaked prove accurate, ""this action represents a grave violation of the code of conduct,"" and the company promised to work closely with authorities on the investigation.

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has decried the revelation of the intelligence-gathering programs as reckless and said it has done ""huge, grave damage."" In recent days, he took the rare step of declassifying some details about them to respond to media reports about counterterrorism techniques employed by the government.

Snowden told The Guardian that he lacked a high school diploma and enlisted in the U.S. Army until he was discharged because of an injury, and later worked as a security guard with the NSA.

He later went to work for the CIA as an information technology employee and by 2007 was stationed in Geneva, Switzerland, where he had access to classified documents.

During that time, he considered going public about the nation's secretive programs but told the newspaper he decided against it, because he did not want to put anyone in danger and he hoped Obama's election would curtail some of the clandestine programs.

He said he was disappointed that Obama did not rein in the surveillance programs.

""Much of what I saw in Geneva really disillusioned me about how my government functions and what its impact is in the world,"" he told The Guardian. ""I realized that I was part of something that was doing far more harm than good.""

Snowden left the CIA in 2009 to join a private contractor, and spent last four years at the NSA, as a contractor with consulting giant Booz Allen Hamilton and, before that, Dell.

The Guardian reported that Snowden was working in an NSA office in Hawaii when he copied the last of the documents he planned to disclose and told supervisors that he needed to be away for a few weeks to receive treatment for epilepsy.

Guardian reporter Glenn Greenwald, who filed the initial news reports on the programs, declined comment Sunday when contacted in a Hong Kong hotel lobby by The Associated Press.

""I'm not going to talk to you, and I don't have any information to give you,"" he said.

A sign advertising Century 21 realtor Kerri Jo Heim sits on the grass outside the blue-and-white house where Snowden and his girlfriend lived in a quiet neighborhood in Waipahu, West Oahu.

Heim says the couple moved out on May 1, leaving nothing behind. She said last Wednesday police came by asking where they went, but she didn't know.

Snowden left for Hong Kong on May 20 and has remained there since, according to the newspaper. Snowden is quoted as saying he chose that city because ""they have a spirited commitment to free speech and the right of political dissent"", and because he believed it was among the spots on the globe that could and would resist the dictates of the U.S. government.

""I feel satisfied that this was all worth it. I have no regrets,"" Snowden told The Guardian, which said he asked to be identified after several days of interviews.

Iceland's International Modern Media Institute, a free press group, said it had yet to hear from Snowden directly. But in a statement the institute said it would do what it could to help the former intelligence worker find asylum and was already working to set up a meeting with Iceland's newly appointed interior minister.

Snowden could face decades in a U.S. jail for revealing classified information if he is successfully extradited from Hong Kong, said Mark Zaid, a national security lawyer who represents whistleblowers. Hong Kong had an extradition treaty with the United States that took force in 1998, according to the U.S. State Department website.

""If it's a straight leak of classified information, the government could subject him to a 10 or 20 year penalty for each count,"" with each document leaked considered a separate charge, Zaid said.

Hong Kong, though part of China, is partly autonomous and has a Western-style legal system that is a legacy from the territory's past as a British colony. A U.S.-Hong Kong extradition treaty has worked smoothly in the past. Hong Kong extradited three al-Qaeda suspects to the U.S. in 2003, for example.

But the treaty comes with important exceptions. Key provisions allow a request to be rejected if it is deemed to be politically motivated or that the suspect would not receive a fair trial. Beijing may also block an extradition of Chinese nationals from Hong Kong for national security reasons.

Snowden told the newspaper he believes the government could try to charge him with treason under the Espionage Act, but Zaid said that would require the government to prove he had intent to betray the United States, whereas he publicly made it clear he did this to spur debate.

The government could also make an argument that the NSA leaks have aided the enemy — as military prosecutors have claimed against Army Pvt. Bradley Manning, who faces life in prison under military law if convicted for releasing a trove of classified documents through Wikileaks.

""They could say the revelation of the (NSA) programs could instruct people to change tactics,"" Zaid said. But even under the lesser charges of simply revealing classified information, ""you are talking potentially decades in jail, loss of his employment and his security clearance.""

Officials said the revelations were dangerous and irresponsible. House intelligence committee member Peter King, R-NY, called for Snowden to be ""extradited from Hong Kong immediately...and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" in an interview with The Associated Press Sunday.

""I believe the leaker has done extreme damage to the U.S. and to our intelligence operations,"" King said, by alerting al-Qaida to U.S. surveillance, and by spooking U.S. service providers who now might fight sharing data in future with the U.S. government, now that the system has been made public.

King added that intelligence and law enforcement professionals he'd spoken to since the news broke were also concerned that Snowden might be taken into custody by Chinese intelligence agents and questioned about CIA and NSA spies and policies.

""To be a whistleblower, there would have to be a pattern of him filing complaints through appropriate channels to his supervisors,"" said Ambassador John Negroponte, the first director of national intelligence, in an interview with the AP Sunday. ""For me, it's just an outright case of betrayal of confidences and a violation of his nondisclosure agreement.""

President Barack Obama, Clapper and others have said the programs are authorized by Congress and subject to strict supervision of a secret court.

""It's important to recognize that you can't have 100 percent security and also then have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience,"" Obama said. ""We're going to have to make some choices as a society.""

President Obama, reacting to the startling figures Tuesday, said he had “no tolerance” for sexual crimes in the ranks and pledged to crack down on commanders who ignored the problem. Obama said he had spoken to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and ordered that officers “up and down the food chain” get the message.

“I expect consequences,” Obama told reporters at the White House. “If we find out that somebody’s engaging in this stuff, they’ve got to be held accountable — prosecuted, stripped of their positions, court-martialed, fired, dishonorably discharged, period. It’s not acceptable.”

The worsening statistics are a blow to the Pentagon’s military and civilian leadership, who have announced repeated initiatives to combat rape and sexual assaults, only to see the problem grow.

The increase in both reported and suspected sex crimes — and evidence that many in the military still fear retaliation if they report an assault to a superior officer — comes as the military faces far-reaching social changes, including opening up combat jobs to women and lifting the ban on gays and lesbians serving openly.

It also comes two days after police in Arlington, Va., arrested the chief of the Air Force sexual assault prevention branch for allegedly groping a woman outside a bar near the Pentagon, the latest sexual scandal to hit the headlines. Officials said Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski was removed from his post after the arrest.

“This department may be nearing a stage where the frequency of this crime and the perception that there is tolerance of it could very well undermine our ability to effectively carry out” the military’s mission, Hagel said at a Pentagon news conference.

Hagel outlined steps he had ordered, including holding commanders accountable for preventing sexual assaults, expanding programs to help victims, and screening recruiters and training instructors. An investigation that began in 2011 at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas has turned up 59 cases of sexual assault of military recruits by drill instructors.

In testimony Tuesday before the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Air Force’s top commander, Gen. Mark A. Welsh III, appeared to blame broader society, noting that 20% of women report they had been sexually assaulted “before they came into the military.”

“So they come in from a society where this occurs,” he said. “Some of it is the hookup mentality of junior high even and high school students now, which my children can tell you about from watching their friends and being frustrated by it.”

Reported sexual assaults of both men and women in the military rose to 3,374 last year, up from 3,192 a year earlier, according to the Pentagon. About 1 in 4 of those who were assaulted and received medical care declined to press charges, however, an indicator of the victims’ fear of retribution, officials said.

But the annual Defense Department report says about 6% of women surveyed, as well as 1% of male soldiers, declared they had been sexually assaulted but did not report the incidents up the chain of command. Extrapolating those percentages across the military, the report estimates 26,000 sexual assaults occurred, up from 19,300 in 2010.

Lawmakers and experts say many victims are reluctant to come forward because they lack faith in the military justice system and fear their careers could suffer if they try to bring criminal charges, particularly against higher-ranking officers.

In two cases since early 2012, Air Force generals overturned convictions of male officers under their command who had been found guilty of sexual assault. The cases have prompted a push in Congress to overhaul the Uniform Code of Military Justice to make it more difficult for commanders to intervene in such cases.

Maj. Gen. Gary Patton, who heads the Pentagon’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, said the 5.7% increase in reported sexual assaults indicated that more people are willing to come forward. But he acknowledged that the 35% rise in unreported cases showed “it’s very clear we got some work to do.”

Advocates for victims criticized the Pentagon for doing too little to reverse the problem.

Kate Weber, a former Army soldier who now counsels military sexual assault victims in Sonoma County, Calif., said in a telephone interview that she was raped by a senior officer while stationed in Germany in 1993. She said her superiors rebuffed her attempt to lodge a complaint.

The authority to prosecute “needs to be taken out of the chain of command, so a victim can report rape to an independent, uninterested party,” she said.

Advertisement

Nancy Parrish, president of Protect Our Defenders, a victims group, said “the problems are so longstanding and pervasive that, at a minimum, it constitutes gross negligence on the part of the leadership and actually reflects … countenancing of a culture of violent abuse.”

Pentagon officials have talked publicly for years about holding officers accountable who tolerate or cover up for male subordinates accused of sex crimes. But when asked whether any officers had been disciplined for mishandling sexual assault cases, Patton offered no examples.

Advertisement

In April 2012, then-Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta ordered that only colonels or higher-ranking officers could decide whether to prosecute a sex crime. The reform was aimed at blocking lower-level officers from protecting colleagues.

But this year, Air Force Lt. Gen. Craig Franklin, commander at Aviano Air Base in Italy, overturned the sexual assault conviction of a lieutenant colonel, threw out his one-year prison sentence and reinstated him to duty. Franklin said he had doubts about the accuser’s credibility.

In response, Hagel announced last month that he would urge Congress to limit a commander’s ability to overturn court-martial verdicts. But several lawmakers say that was insufficient.

Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) plan to introduce legislation to amend the military code so that military prosecutors are put in control of all legal decisions on sexual assaults and other major crimes, eliminating the possibility that commanders can intervene.

Boxer called the increase in sexual assaults “horrifying” and vowed to change how the military “investigates and prosecutes these heinous crimes.”

Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) said Tuesday that she was blocking the nomination of Lt. Gen. Susan Helms, whom Obama had nominated to be vice commander of Air Force Space Command. McCaskill said she was opposing the promotion because Helms last year overturned the conviction of Capt. Matthew S. Herrera, who was found guilty of aggravated sexual assault of a female lieutenant at Vandenburg Air Force Base.

“That is the crux of the problem here, because if a victim does not believe that the system is capable of believing her, there’s no point to risking your entire career,” McCaskill said at a Senate hearing with Air Force officials.

In response, the Air Force released a memo written by Helms in which she expressed doubts about the victim’s testimony that she was asleep and did not consent to sex. Instead of sexual assault, Helms found Herrera guilty of committing “an indecent act,” a lesser offense. He was involuntarily discharged in December.

It is also devastating to our overall ability to thwart terrorist threats, because it discourages our allies from working and sharing intelligence with us and deters would-be sources from providing intelligence about our adversaries. Unless we can demonstrate the willingness and ability to stop this kind of leak, those critical intelligence resources may be lost to us.

At the time the article was published, there were strong bipartisan calls for the Justice Department to find the leaker. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. gave that assignment to Ronald C. Machen Jr., the United States attorney for the District of Columbia, who is known for his meticulous and dedicated work. Importantly, his assignment was to identify and prosecute the government official who leaked the sensitive information; it was not to conduct an inquiry into the news organization that published it.

His office, which has an experienced national security team, undertook a methodical and measured investigation. Did prosecutors immediately seek the reporters’ toll records? No. Did they subpoena the reporters to testify or compel them to turn over their notes? No. Rather, according to the Justice Department’s May 14 letter to The A.P., they first interviewed 550 people, presumably those who knew or might have known about the agent, and scoured the documentary record. But after eight months of intensive effort, it appears that they still could not identify the leaker.

It was only then — after pursuing “all reasonable alternative investigative steps,” as required by the department’s regulations — that investigators proposed obtaining telephone toll records (logs of calls made and received) for about 20 phone lines that the leaker might have used in conversations with A.P. journalists. They limited the request to the two months when the leak most likely occurred, and did not propose more intrusive investigative steps."

The event, first announced in January, is being organized by the American Muslim Political Action Committee (AMPAC), a fringe group led by M.D. Rabbi Alam, a professed 9/11 truther who has pushed controversial anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about the attacks. Last year, he made a failed bid for Missouri’s secretary of state, and his group has been doing little besides trying to attract national attention ever since.

AMPAC was finally successful on Thursday, when Breitbart News reported on the event, calling it ""tasteless"" and including an unrelated picture of hundreds of Muslims praying in front of the Capitol. Fox News later broke from their coverage of the violent military crackdown in Egypt, which has left nearly 600 dead and thousands injured, to give viewers an ""alert"" on the so-called ""Million Muslim March,"" and going so far as to note that the total supporters of the event could currently be counted on two hands. A Facebook page for the ""Million Muslim March"" -- which previously showed less than 10 people planning to attend -- had been taken down by the time of publish.

Organizers of the ""Million Muslim March"" have defended the timing of their event by noting that ""Muslim[s] and Non Muslim[s] alike were traumatized"" on Sept. 11, 2001. True, but beneath the group's insistence that the march will be about civil rights, indefinite detention, and ""slanderous"" statements about Islam, lies a toxic strain of trutherism. That fact led Corey Saylor, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, to tell U.S. News last month that CAIR would definitely not support the event.

Most groups and individuals have responded similarly, though the event did reportedly receive some backing last month from other truther groups and at least one Pennsylvania tea party organization.

At the time of the U.S. News report, AMPAC had even changed the title of the event to ""Million American March Against Fear,"" perhaps in an effort to get more mainstream support. The name apparently didn't catch on, however, so it looks they've since decided to revert back to the more controversial name."

http://news.yahoo.com/pelosis-defense-nsa-surveillance-draws-boos-183845402.html,,[],Pelosi's defense of NSA surveillance draws boos,"SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has disappointed some of her liberal base with her defense of the Obama administration's classified surveillance of U.S. residents' phone and Internet records.

Some of the activists attending the annual Netroots Nation political conference Saturday booed and interrupted the San Francisco Democrat when she commented on the surveillance programs carried out by the National Security Agency and revealed by a former contractor, Edward Snowden, The San Jose Mercury News reports (http://bit.ly/19fB6U4).

The boos came when Pelosi said that Snowden had violated the law and that the government needed to strike a balance between security and privacy.

As she was attempting to argue that Obama's approach to citizen surveillance was an improvement over the policies under President George W. Bush, an activist, identified by the Mercury News as Marc Perkel of Gilroy, stood up and tried loudly to question her, prompting security guards to escort him out of the convention hall.

""Leave him alone!"" audience members shouted. Others yelled ""Secrets and lies!,"" ''No secret courts!"" and ""Protect the First Amendment!,"" according to the Mercury News.

Perkel told the newspaper that he thinks Pelosi does not fully understand what the NSA is up to.

Several others in the audience walked out in support of Perkel.

""We're listening to our progressive leaders who are supposed to be on our side of the team saying it's OK for us to get targeted"" for online surveillance, said Jana Thrift of Eugene, Ore. ""It's crazy. I don't know who Nancy Pelosi really is.""

Netroots Nation is an organizing and training convention for progressive political leaders. Pelosi was Saturday's keynote speaker at the event, which opened Thursday at the San Jose Convention Center and was scheduled to conclude Sunday.

Her remarks criticizing the Republican majority in the House and encouraging powerful women brought applause, cheers and laughs."

Sen. Graham%2C R-S.C.%2C approved not reading Miranda rights to suspect

Civil libertarians said decision could endanger rights of all

Exception stems from a 1984 Supreme Court decision

The capture of a suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing opened new questions Saturday of how far the U.S. Justice Department can go in questioning terrorism suspects, and whether they should be brought to justice in civilian courts at all.

The Justice Department has said it is considering charges against bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was captured Friday night after a short standoff that capped an intense four-day manhunt that paralyzed greater Boston. But officials also said the agents interrogating him had not given him a standard Miranda warning first, relying on an ill-defined exception that lets them question suspects about threats to public safety.

That approach met with swift criticism Saturday.

""These are dangerous exceptions. If we don't protect the rights of the people who most threaten us, then we won't protect the rights of the rest of us,"" said Nancy Hollander, a past president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, who now represents two detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

Others applauded that decision. ""A decision to not read Miranda rights to the suspect was sound and in our national security interests,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Saturday in a tweet.

Graham and three other Republican lawmakers — Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.; Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H. and Rep. Pete King, R-N.Y. — urged the Obama administration to consider detaining Tsarnaev as an ""enemy combatant"" instead of prosecuting him in a civilian court so that the government could question him more aggressively. ""The accused perpetrators of these acts were not common criminals attempting to profit from a criminal enterprise, but terrorists trying to injure, maim and kill innocent Americans,"" they said in a joint statement.

President Obama has said that his administration would prefer to prosecute terrorism suspects in civilian courts, though he has also left open the option of detaining them under international laws of war. But Congress has largely rejected the administration's efforts to transfer terrorism suspects already held in Guantanamo Bay to regular federal courts in the United States.

""Every criminal defendant has a right to be brought before a judge and to have access to counsel. We must not waver from our tried-and-true justice system, even in the most difficult of times. Denial of rights is un-American and will only make it harder to obtain fair convictions,"" ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said Saturday.

STORY:With bombing suspect caught, question now is why?

Most of the criticism focused on the government's decision not to give Tsarnaev a Miranda warning before interrogating him. That increases the risk that anything he says to investigators will be inadmissible if he's charged with a crime.

""They have to consider what do you lose from a possible suppression motion versus what do you gain by learning about a threat to public safety,"" former Boston U.S. attorney Michael Sullivan said. ""The government will be sensitive to that. They'll try to maximize the benefit and minimize the risk.""

He said prosecutors almost certainly have enough evidence against Tsarnaev that the risk of not having his confession admitted in court is small.

Police usually read suspects a standard Miranda warning after they're arrested, advising them of their rights to remain silent and have a lawyer present during questioning. When they don't do that, they run the risk that they won't be able to use the suspect's statements – or other evidence they obtain as a result – in court.

But the U.S. Supreme Court said in 1984 that police can bypass that requirement if they need to interview a suspect about an imminent threat to public safety. Police in that case had questioned a suspect about a gun they believed he had hidden inside a supermarket without first giving him a Miranda warning. The court said his statements were admissible anyway.

The precise boundaries of that exception are far from clear. It clearly allows agents to ask questions about the location of guns and bombs that could endanger the public. But it's less clear whether they would also have leeway to ask Tsarnaev about motives or accomplices.

""There's not a lot of guidance out there,"" Sullivan said. ""The parameters aren't crystal clear.""

It remained unclear Saturday how long agents questioned Tsarnaev without giving him a Miranda warning, or even whether they had an opportunity to interrogate him at all. Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said Saturday that Tsarnaev likely can't communicate yet.

Even so, critics worried that the Justice Department is expanding the exception beyond its original purpose. ""Each time the administration use this exception, it stretches wider and longer,"" said Vincent Warren, executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights.

The FBI interviewed Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab for 50 minutes without reading him a Miranda warning after he tried to bring down an international flight with a bomb concealed in his underwear in December 2009. A judge later approved that questioning.

But in 2008, a federal appeals court in New York ruled that the Justice Department could not introduce statements that a suspect in the 1998 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya had made to FBI agents while he was locked up in Nairobi because he did not receive a Miranda warning. But the judges went out of their way to say if ""exigent circumstances compel an un-warned interrogation in order to protect the public, Miranda would not impair the government's ability to obtain that information.""

In 2010, the FBI instructed agents in terrorism cases to not immediately give suspects Miranda warnings. But that tactic has drawn sharp criticism from defense lawyers and civil rights groups, who say it unfairly erodes suspects' constitutional rights.

As of Saturday morning, Tsarnaev did not have a lawyer.

Alexander Bunin, the former top federal public defender in northern New York, said authorities ""are going to push their authority as far as they can."" He said prosecutors are acutely aware that dodging Miranda warnings means they could be ""in jeopardy of not being able to use the statement,"" but said they might have gathered enough other evidence that they're willing to take that chance.

The ""public safety"" exception to Miranda isn't limited to terrorism cases. Last year, a federal appeals court in Ohio said that police acted appropriately when they asked a suspect about the location of a shotgun before giving him a Miranda warning."

Time and again, the N.S.A. has pushed past the limits that lawmakers thought they had imposed to prevent it from invading basic privacy, as guaranteed by the Constitution.

It was bad enough in 2008 when Congress allowed the agency to spy without a warrant on e-mails and text messages between Americans and foreign targets of an investigation. That already strained the Fourth Amendment’s protections against illegal searches, but lawmakers decided it was justified as part of a terror investigation.

It turns out, as Charlie Savage revealed in The Times on Thursday, that the N.S.A. went far beyond those boundaries. Instead, it copies virtually all overseas messages that Americans send or receive, then scans them to see if they contain any references to people or subjects the agency thinks might have a link to terrorists.

That could very well include innocent communications between family members expressing fears of a terror attack. Or messages between an editor and a reporter who is covering international security issues. Or the privileged conversation between a lawyer and a client who is being investigated."
http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/bombing-suspects-immigration-status-emerges-reform-bill-talks-160951186--election.html,,[],Bombing suspects’ immigration status could stall reform,"The immigration status of the Boston bombings suspects may become a stumbling block for a new bill that seeks to legalize nearly 11 million immigrants and increase the number of legal immigrants to the United States.

Opponents of the bill—which was crafted by a bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" in the Senate—and even some supporters, say the process of reforming the country's immigration system should be stalled until all the facts about the suspects' interactions with the immigration system are known.

Both Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the two brothers accused of the Boston Marathon bombings, emigrated to the United States legally from Russia as refugees a decade ago when they were children. The Tsarnaev family, which is ethnically Chechen, was granted asylum because it feared persecution in its home country, according to media reports.

Tamerlan's application for citizenship was put on hold in 2012 by the government, because he had been questioned by the FBI at the request of the Russian government for possible ties to Chechen terrorism, the New York Times reported. Dzhokhar's citizenship application was approved, and he naturalized in 2012.

At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing over the bill on Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano defended immigration officials' handling of the Tsarnaevs, saying the process for granting asylum is rigorous.

""In the past four years we have increased both the number and the coverage of the vetting that goes on,"" Napolitano said. As things currently stand, she noted, those who seek asylum must go through multiple screening interviews and submit biometric data to be checked across government databases. If granted asylum and legal status, immigrants must go through two more interviews if they want to become citizens when they become eligible five years later.

(Asylum applicants must show that they face government-sanctioned persecution in their home country stemming from their race, religion, nationality, political views or membership in a particular social group.)

Story continues

Napolitano argued that the immigration reform bill would make the country safer because the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country would be brought ""out of the shadows"" and screened. The bill requires immigrants to pass a background check before they are eligible for temporary legal status. They must pay fines and back taxes and enroll in English classes to gain permanent legal status.

Opponents of the immigration bill have argued that the Tsarnaevs' alleged crime suggests that the current immigration system is unable to weed out potential terrorists, and that the process of crafting the bill should be slowed down to address that. If the bill is stalled until next fall, opponents hope it will be close enough to the next election that on-the-fence lawmakers will withdraw their support, effectively killing the bill. President Barack Obama has said he hopes the bill will pass this summer.

Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, one of the most prominent opponents of legalizing immigrants, said at Monday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that the legalization process in the bill could present a national security threat.

""The background checks in this bill are insufficient from preventing a terrorist from getting amnesty,"" Kobach said.

Supporters of the immigration reform bill say the argument is a specious excuse to delay the legislation.

""Unless we are able to design an immigration background check that can get into the minds of people and predict the future, then we won't be able to solve problems like this through immigration screening alone,"" said Lynn Tramonte of America's Voice, a pro-immigration advocacy group.

It's also unclear how the immigration system could have known what two children seeking asylum with their family would do 10 years later.

But even some lawmakers who have indicated their support for the bill have raised concern about the Boston suspects.

Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has been a vocal supporter of immigration reform, wrote in a letter to Majority Leader Harry Reid that the immigration reform process should stop until all the facts are known about the intersection between the immigration system and the Tsarnaev brothers.

""Why did the current system allow two individuals to immigrate to the United States from the Chechen Republic in Russia, an area known as a hotbed of Islamic extremism, who then committed acts of terrorism? Were there any safeguards? Could this have been prevented? Does the immigration reform before us address this?"" Paul asked.

He said Congress should debate whether immigrants from ""high-risk"" nations should face more ""scrutiny"" and whether student visas for people from certain ""high-risk"" countries altogether should be discontinued.

Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., said on ABC on Sunday that he hopes lawmakers will put the immigration debate ""on hold"" because of the bombing.

Roy Beck of NumbersUSA, a group that opposes illegal immigration and wants to dramatically lower rates of legal immigration, said he thinks it's significant that Paul and Coats have called for slowing down the bill.

""The Boston bombing gives them a little more of a public reason to try to get this to slow down,"" Beck said.

If the bill is delayed until the fall, Republicans and red-state Democrats might think it is too close to election season to support it, Beck predicts."

Shouldn’t Congress have been briefed, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) asked James R. Clapper, the director of national intelligence, about a spying operation that would embarrass the U.S. government if exposed?

“Well, sir, there are many things we do in intelligence that, if revealed, would have the potential for all kinds of blowback,” Clapper replied at a House Intelligence Committee hearing in October. “The conduct of intelligence is premised on the notion that we can do it secretly, and we don’t count on it being revealed in the newspaper.”

Not these days.

Clapper and his colleagues now operate in a spy world reshaped by Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who claims responsibility for what officials deem the largest and most damaging compromise of classified information in U.S. history. Among the casualties is the assumption that some of the nation’s most carefully guarded secrets will stay secret.

NSA officials say Snowden downloaded and removed about 1.7 million documents from computer networks at an NSA listening post in Hawaii where he worked until June. The haul included about 2,000 specific requests for NSA surveillance that officials say make up a digital road map of spying successes and gaps in such high-profile targets as Iran, Russia, North Korea and China.

The requests have not been made public. But other leaks from Snowden’s cache have been so illuminating that experts say the disclosures will mark a turning point in U.S. spying, much as revelations of CIA assassinations and NSA domestic spying led to creation of the congressional oversight committees and new laws in the 1970s.

At least some change appears inevitable. In just the last week, events produced “a seismic shift in the movement for real surveillance reform,” said Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a critic of NSA programs.

In Washington, U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon issued a sharp rebuke to the NSA on Monday when he ruled that a major program that Snowden exposed — the secret logging of virtually every American’s telephone calls — was “almost Orwellian” in scope and probably violated the Constitution.

Leon stayed his ruling pending an expected government appeal. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee and has been a staunch Capitol Hill ally for the embattled agency, announced that she would welcome a Supreme Court review to determine whether the bulk collection is legal.

The next day, the leaders of the nation’s largest technology companies sat down with President Obama and complained that the NSA was damaging their reputations and undermining Silicon Valley’s ability to sell computer hardware and cloud services, hurting the U.S. economy. (Privacy advocates have noted that they have been calling on leading technology companies to offer safeguards of their own against the use of personal information they gather.)

Several executives said some foreign customers had begun to reject American-made technology because Snowden’s leaks showed that the NSA had enlisted tech firms and secretly tapped their data-transfer hubs. Some companies are facing lawsuits from shareholders demanding disclosure of any cooperation with NSA data-mining programs.

And on Wednesday, a presidential task force called for sweeping changes in NSA operations at home and abroad, including an end to the NSA’s vast collection of U.S. telephone records. It said telephone companies or other groups, instead of the government, should keep the logs and allow the NSA access only if it obtains a court order.

Some critics say that’s not enough. Rep. Rush D. Holt (D-N.J.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee who has called for new curbs on NSA operations, said the panel’s proposals would leave intact what he called “the surveillance state in America.” Storing telephone data on the servers of a nongovernmental entity, he said, “would simply represent an outsourcing of bulk collection, not an end to it.”

The crosscurrents added pressure on Obama to act more forcefully. On Friday, he said at a news conference that he would make “a pretty definitive statement” in January to outline surveillance reforms, including support for at least some of the task force’s 46 recommendations.

“People are concerned about the prospect, the possibility of abuse,” he said. But he said he was confident that the NSA was “not engaging in domestic surveillance or snooping around” on Americans.

Intelligence officials say some of America’s adversaries, including members of Al Qaeda, have changed how they communicate to avoid the surveillance that Snowden disclosed.

Other costs are also now clear.

In nearly every meeting with foreign leaders or other officials, White House officials face angry complaints about the spying that was revealed in Snowden’s leaks and questions about what might come next, officials said. One official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the issue involves classified material, said senior White House aides spend far more time grappling with the issue than is publicly understood.

But the administration official said an NSA-led intelligence task force that is investigating the leaks may never determine precisely what information Snowden stole or whether it’s been copied, making it difficult to warn other governments or preempt his disclosures to mitigate the repercussions.

In Brazil, where Snowden leaks revealed that the NSA had monitored phones used by President Dilma Rousseff and her senior advisors, the government has responded by proposing to build fiber-optic lines to Europe so Brazil’s Internet traffic can bypass U.S. data hubs that the NSA was monitoring.

In Europe, Google, Microsoft, Facebook and other major technology and telecommunications companies have been tarnished by their apparent cooperation with the NSA, said Jay Cline, president of Minnesota Privacy Consultants, which advises corporations about privacy issues.

“The Europeans consider privacy as a human right,” he said. “The details of what is being surveilled has raised questions among Europeans whether any of their data can be trusted in the U.S.”

Snowden, who has been charged with espionage and is living in Russia, was hardly the first — and may not be the last — American with a high-level security clearance to leak a huge cache of U.S. secrets.

He has said he was inspired by Army Pvt. Chelsea Manning, formerly known as Pfc. Bradley Manning, who was sentenced to 35 years in prison in August after being convicted of leaking hundreds of thousands of classified military and diplomatic records, cables and videos to the antisecrecy group WikiLeaks in 2010.

Michael Hayden, who headed both the NSA and CIA, said the chance of exposure of an NSA surveillance program “is like zero” under normal circumstances. But the risk calculus changes dramatically when a trusted insider is involved, he said.

“What the Snowden thing has done,” he said, “is show that sometimes the greatest risk to discovery is the self-anointed leaker inside your organization.”

Among them: Do not remove your shoes, light jacket or belt.

“I planned my whole wardrobe around having to take off my shoes!” exclaimed Rudisill, an Oregon traveler who had been randomly selected for PreCheck.

The Transportation Security Administration program, which launched in October 2011, rewards so-called trusted travelers with relaxed procedures reminiscent of the pre-9/11 days. The agents flip the usual script: They remind passengers to keep on clothing items that they would shed at traditional security outposts and instruct them to leave laptops and compliant liquids in their carry-on bags. Travelers also walk through old-fashioned metal detectors, not the newfangled body-image scanners. Dust off the disco ball, because airport security is going retro.

“I was pleasantly surprised at how fast it was and that I didn’t have to dig through my bag for my 3-1-1 liquids,” said Nancy Strahl, an Oregon-bound traveler and first-timer in the special lane. “I have to recommend it to everyone.”

The TSA hopes that you will.

Since its introduction, more than 20 million passengers have used PreCheck nationwide, according to the TSA. At Washington Dulles, about 5,000 of the daily 25,000 passengers walk the line. The program is rapidly expanding, with more than 100 airports participating, up from 40 earlier this year, in 42 states and two territories (Puerto Rico and Guam). Nine U.S. airlines, including Southwest and JetBlue, two recent additions, are involved. (Currently, only JetBlue passengers with mobile app boarding passes are eligible; the airline plans to expand to include paper boarding passes by the start of next year.)

Earlier this year, TSA Administrator John Pistole set an end-of-2013 goal to funnel 25 percent of all travelers through speedier security arrangements, which includes PreCheck and gentler processing for those 75 and older and children 12 and younger (both populations can leave their shoes and light coats on). He hopes to goose the number to 50 percent by the close of 2014.

The program benefits both civilians and government officials. Streamlined measures can help alleviate the stress on normal lanes, unclogging bottlenecks and brightening passengers’ moods. For security purposes, preapproving travelers will hopefully help officials weed out non-threatening fliers and heap greater attention on riskier individuals.

To achieve Pistole’s goal, the agency recently announced a more direct route to PreCheckdom. Previously, passengers have qualified for the service if they’ve already enrolled in a trusted-traveler program, such as Customs and Border Protection’s Global Entry, or are active members of the military. (Men and women in the U.S. armed forces can currently take advantage of the PreCheck program at 10 airports; it will be available to them at all participating facilities starting Dec. 20.) Airlines can also opt-in their frequent fliers.

More serendipitously, TSA may grant individuals whom it deems low-risk a PreCheck stamp on their boarding pass. “If you show up clean, you can be randomly selected by TSA,” said a department spokeswoman. “The more information you give us about yourself, the more likely you will be selected.” She added that “25 percent of passengers will be selected one way or another” through the various channels.

To attract more participants, the TSA plans to set up an online application and establish two enrollment centers in the Washington area and the Indianapolis airport for fingerprinting and supplemental interviews. The cost: $85 for five years, $15 less than Global Entry. The target date: end of the year.

Denise Leschinski of Sarasota, Fla., had been through PreCheck twice in one day, first in Sarasota and now at Dulles. “I think it’s wonderful,” she said.

Would she pay for the privilege?

“Not if I can get it for free,” she joked, referring to her luck in getting randomly selected. Then she thought again. She might sign up. “We do travel a lot.”

As the program gains momentum, PreCheck converts need to remember who’s the boss (TSA) and how the boss behaves (unpredictably). The agency may, without warning, bump participants to the standard line, just as it may pull non-members into the special lane.

“We always have to have the random possibility,” a TSA representative said.

Matt Bradford of Pasadena, Calif., received the perk on his last four or five flights. “I’m not sure how I got it,” he said. “It’s been fantastic.” However, his winning streak went bust when Dulles bouncers turned him away at the cordoned area and sent him back to the commoners’ section.

The message: TSA wants you to embrace PreCheck, but don’t grow too cozy with it.

Security line race

So, can the much-ballyhooed PreCheck stand up to the test of two travelers? Ready, set, go . . . to your respective lines.

A little after 11 on a recent Tuesday morning at Dulles, Becky and Andrea split up and set off in different directions. Andrea heads for the black-and-yellow PreCheck sign; Becky descends the escalator that will take her to the normal security area. May the fastest lane win.

The queue for the regular lanes isn’t filling up the whole waiting area, but it’s not short either. Becky follows protocol, slipping off her fleece jacket and her sneakers and removing the hand sanitizer from her bag and placing all the items in a bin. She enters the full-body scanner and throws up her arms in a frozen-jumping-jack pose.

Upstairs, Andrea skates through the PreCheck line to the sound of “beep, beep, beep” as attendants scan the boarding passes of those behind her to determine whether they belong in the queue. (If rejected, a traveler can follow a parallel path that adheres to normal security procedures. Families with non-PreCheck members may also use this parallel line so that everyone can stay together.) About five people precede her, and she doesn’t have to decelerate until she reaches the lectern where the official checks her ID.

At the X-ray machine, Andrea places her carrier containing her computer on the belt (no people jam!). She walks through the metal detector in rubber boots and a black trench coat. An alarm sounds. She flashes her heavy brass bracelets at the agent, who nods and lets her through.

Total time for Becky: 13 minutes.

Total time for Andrea: four minutes.

PreCheck claims victory.

But could this be a fluke? To quash such doubts, the pair schedules a second run in the afternoon. This time, they switch positions. Becky achieves an impressive race time of 3.5 minutes and zero trays in the PreCheck line; Andrea clocks in at eight minutes and three bins. PreCheck does it again.

Jacket and shoe confusion

PreCheck reigns in speed and efficiency, but it stumbles, too, especially in the sartorial department. Take shoes, for example.

Agents inform passengers to keep their footwear on, but they don’t make distinctions, such as between sneakers, which remain silent through the metal detectors, and steel-toed boots, which can cause a ruckus.

“It’s usually pretty good, but this time I had to take them off,” said Alison Taylor of Washington, who had to remove her boots. “But the nice agent said it happens to good shoes.”

The culprit: a metal shank in the heel.

The instructions pertaining to overcoats are also open for interpretation. Travelers can wear “light” overcoats, but the adjective is somewhat vague. When asked for clarification, a high-ranking security official at Dulles said that a suit jacket is acceptable, but puffy, bulky or heavy wool coats are not. Certain hats are also allowed, such as baseball or knit caps. A man in a Stetson, however, didn’t care to test the rules, placing his topper in a bin.

Officials also remind passengers to empty their pockets of metal objects such as phones, keys and coins. Men coughed up enough items to fill a treasure chest.

“Place it in the dog bowl,” an official repeated in an endless loop.

Large belt buckles, chunky jewelry and medical devices can also agitate the metal detector. After several failures, a passenger may have to submit to a pat-down.

“I think educating the public is key to making this successful,” said Oregon-bound traveler Strahl, who doesn’t fly with her computer because of the usual hassle but added, “I would rethink that now.”

Some travelers were unfamiliar with the program until an agent rerouted them to the special area. “It’s brand-new for us,” said Mary Lou Werner of Willmar, Minn.,“but it’s wonderful.”

As awareness grows, passengers may notice more PreCheck signs popping up in terminals. Dulles is the rare facility with a stand-alone section featuring multiple lanes and bold signs overhead. At BWI Marshall and Reagan National, the special lanes are integrated into the main security areas. Small postings direct passengers to the designated lane.

“It’s inconsistent,” said a Virginia traveler who works with the military and has sampled the service around the country. “Dulles is in the lead. It’s the smoothest.”

Still in its infancy, PreCheck continues to outpace the standard lines. On a Tuesday afternoon, the wait for the regular checkpoints clocked in at 20 minutes, about twice as long as for the new kid. But as the program grows, the zippy hare lanes could turn into slow tortoise tracks. If that occurs, one traveler has already devised a backup plan.

“When more people take it this way,” he said, “we’ll go back to the other.”"

The U.S. admits about 1 million legal immigrants per year, more than any other country. That number could jump by more than 50% over the next decade under the terms of the immigration reform bill that a bipartisan group of senators expects to unveil as early as Tuesday. The impact would be felt nationwide, but areas that already have large immigrant communities would probably see much of the increase.

The immigration package includes at least four major provisions that would increase the number of legal immigrants, according to people familiar with it. Some of the parts could generate as much controversy as the provisions dealing with those who enter the country illegally or overstay their visas, according to those with long experience of the politics of immigration.

Supporters say that higher levels of legal immigration would meet the U.S. need for certain kinds of workers. Increased legal migration also would reduce most of the incentive for illegal border crossings, backers of the plan say, and would allow border agents to focus on smugglers and people with violent criminal records.

Opponents such as Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who has long opposed measures to increase immigration levels, say new workers would depress wages and crowd out Americans looking for work during a time of persistently high unemployment.

“The masters of the universe in glass towers and suites, they may not be impacted by this, but millions of struggling American families will,” Sessions said in an interview Friday. “We do need to be sure we aren’t exacerbating unemployment and wage erosion in America.”

The surge would come in several ways: The bill aims to eliminate the current backlog of roughly 4 million people waiting to be reunited with family members in the U.S. The 11 million now in the country without legal authorization would be eligible for citizenship only after that backlog was resolved. Reunification efforts would require boosting the number of visas issued each year. To keep the additional inflow under control, the bill would stop allowing adult siblings of immigrants to qualify, but children and parents would continue to be eligible.

U.S. immigration law: Decades of debate

In addition to family unification, which allows people into the country permanently, the bill also aims to increase temporary visas for both high-wage and low-wage workers. The number of visas for high-tech workers could nearly double to more than 120,000 per year. At the other end of the wage scale, a new visa system would allow businesses to bring in workers for jobs including janitors, housekeepers and meatpackers. The numbers would start small, but as the unemployment rate declined, it could reach 200,000 a year by the end of the decade. And growers could bring a total of about 330,000 new farmworkers into the country during the decade. At least some of those low-wage temporary workers eventually would be allowed to seek permanent residency.

The bill’s authors expect that legal immigration eventually would decline again, but only 10 years after the bill passed, once the backlog of residency applications shrank.

“The increased number in the years following the enactment of this bill reflects us having to clean up what has been a broken immigration system for many years,” said Angela Kelley, an immigration expert at the Center for American Progress, a liberal policy group in Washington.

“We had too few visas for too long,” Kelley said. “Congress hasn’t upgraded our immigration system in 23 years.”

The last time Congress overhauled the admissions process for immigrants was the Immigration Act of 1990. In the years after the bill’s passage, the total number of legal immigrants increased by 40%, from about 500,000 per year to more than 700,000.

But the new system didn’t allow enough flexibility as the U.S. continued to shift from a manufacturing-based economy to a knowledge-based economy, said Audrey Singer, immigration policy expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington.

“How do we get this right?” Singer asked. “The question is, can we come up with a mechanism that allows us to have a more adjustable system over time and have more flexibility?”

In theory, legal immigration has broad public support in both parties. In practice, changes to the immigration system can generate fierce political opposition.

Limiting the ability of immigrants to bring their adult siblings to the U.S. would be controversial, particularly with Asian American lawmakers and their constituents. Asian Americans use that category more heavily than other immigrant groups. The bill also would limit visas for married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens to people under the age of 30, which could generate opposition. On the other hand, the bill would allow lawful permanent residents to sponsor spouses and minor children for green cards. Currently, only U.S. citizens can do that. That change, likely to please immigrant groups, could bring in an additional 800,000 people over the next 10 years, Senate aides said.

House Republican leaders have been meeting with members to discuss immigration, and the future flow of legal immigrants has been among the top issues raised, according to officials familiar with the sessions. Because of the way many congressional district boundaries were redrawn after the 2010 census, few Republicans have large immigrant communities among their constituents, leaving many newer lawmakers unfamiliar with the issues.

“Everybody’s all over the map,” said Rep. James Lankford (R-Okla.), who has been helping coordinate the sessions for the GOP leadership. “There’s an economic benefit” to the changes being contemplated “if we have the right formula set up,” he said. “It’s people who are coming in for economic benefit rather than just family connection.”

Convincing reluctant Republicans of the economic benefits of legal immigration has become easier with the support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, some in the GOP said. Business owners have lobbied Republicans, recounting stories about their struggles to find workers for certain types of jobs.

Jonathan Johnson, president of the bargain site Overstock.com, based in Salt Lake City, said his firm had struggled to hire enough computer programmers and software developers to expand the business.

“We pay more, and they are still hard to fill,” he said.

“We need to be more free in letting people in,” Johnson said. “That helps us solve our border problem. No one goes through the window of a house if they can ring the doorbell and come in the front door.”

(CNN) —

A federal civil complaint in Texas claims the defendants may have falsified prescriptions, lied to pharmacies and perhaps even broken the law, but they’re not drug runners.

They’re officials from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, responsible for executing death row inmates.

The complaint, filed in October, is one example of the lengths death-penalty states are willing to go to acquire drugs for lethal injections.

Texas, which declined to comment on the pending case, is among 32 death-penalty states scrambling to find new drug protocols after European-based manufacturers banned U.S. prisons from using their drugs in executions – among them, Danish-based Lundbeck, which manufactures pentobarbital.

“The states are scrambling to find the drugs,” says Richard Dieter, executive director of the Washington-based Death Penalty Information Center. “They want to carry out these executions that they have scheduled, but they don’t have the drugs and they’re changing and trying new procedures never used before in the history of executions.”

States have been forced to try new drug combinations or go to loosely regulated compounding pharmacies that manufacturer variations of the drugs banned by the larger companies. The suit against Texas alleges the state corrections department falsified a prescription for pentobarbital, including the patient name as “James Jones,” the warden of the Huntsville Unit “where executions take place,” according to court documents. Additionally, the drugs were to be sent to “Huntsville Unit Hospital,” which, the documents say, “has not existed since 1983.”

The suit said the pharmacy was unaware of the purpose for the order and when it found out it canceled the order before it was filled.

In a letter obtained by CNN, dated October 4 of this year, Woodlands Compounding Pharmacy, which was requested to provide drugs to Texas officials says it believed its “information would be kept on the ‘down low’” by the TDCJ.”

The plaintiffs also allege the state did not produce a purchase order, instead using an individual employee’s credit card to make the purchase.

The pharmacy is asking the TDCJ to return the drugs it sold the state. It is unclear whether they have.

Maurie Levin, one of the attorneys representing the inmates, said, “We believe that TDCJ’s purchase of compounded pentobarbital from Woodlands Pharmacy violates numerous state laws. The vast majority of compounded drugs can only be mixed or sold pursuant to a doctor’s prescription. TDCJ did not get a prescription for its purchase of compounded drugs. There are exceptions to the requirement, but TDCJ’s purchase does not qualify for any of them.”

In September, Texas even turned to another state, Virginia, for a supply of Nembutal, according to documents provided to CNN by Berkeley Law staff attorney Jen Moreno.

Death row inmates say using untested drugs is “cruel and unusual punishment,” and several have filed federal lawsuits to delay executions until drug protocols have been reviewed.

Ohio was set to execute Ron Phillips on Thursday using a two-drug cocktail never before used in an execution. Ohio’s Department of Rehabilitation and Correction said it “was unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of pentobarbital.” Instead it was set to use the sedative midazolam and pain-killer hydromorphone in a lethal dosage.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich stayed Phillips’ execution this week pending a review of possible organ donation to his family members.

Missouri was set to use propofol, the infamous drug from the Michael Jackson case, in an execution last month, but the governor halted it after he was warned the European Union might halt shipments of the drug, leading to shortages for medical purposes.

Deborah Denno, a law professor at Fordham University, said a new combination of drugs used in the execution of Florida inmate William Happ last month took 14 minutes to kill him instead of the usual seven.

“There is absolute chaos among the states,” Denno said. “So, every few months it seems we see a different state using a different type of drug, or types of drugs.”

Jim Petro, the Republican former attorney general of Ohio, presided over 19 executions but no longer supports the death penalty. “An attorney general is bound to follow the statute,” he said. “Duty is duty.”

Dieter said using untested drugs amounts to experimentation on human beings: “They’re guilty people who did these crimes, but that doesn’t ameliorate our ethical obligations.”"

Oliver White, Sean Hannity Show, March 27, 2013

In general, most news outlets have provided awful coverage of the Supreme Court proceedings on same-sex marriage. Covering the proceedings like they cover a political campaign or a sporting event, most of the analysis and commentary has been about political “wins” for one side or the other and the ramifications of the pending decision on homosexuals in our society, rather than the wide-ranging ramifications for society itself.

Filling the void of thoughtful analysis has been talk radio. Unlike the vapid and two-dimensional conversations repeated every ten minutes on cable, talk radio has been able to explore larger questions entwined in the same-sex marriage debate and have been able to challenge the politically correct orthodoxy presented in other media outlets where it comes to the religious side of the issue.

Enter Sean Hannity whose Wednesday show featured a fascinating exchange with Terry Jeffrey, a news editor from CNS News Service, and Rev. Oliver White, a pro-same sex marriage pastor. Because Hannity is not constrained by the limitations of a TV news schedule and the need to change subjects every 5 minutes, as is so often the case on cable news, he was able to allow the on-air debate over the scriptural basis for marriage to naturally unfold to the point where the lack of scriptural foundation for same-sex marriage was laughingly evident.

This exchange in particular was the most glaringly infuriating as White, a proponent of same-sex marriage who angered his own congregation recently because of his adamant belief that Christianity supports such a practice, went so far as to agree that Jesus Christ was wrong about His position on marriage being defined as one man and one woman, and if Jesus were alive today he would, in fact, support gay marriage.

In this segment, the good minister is quizzed further on his unique and ever-morphing interpretation of scripture by Hannity and it’s revealed for the audience that his understanding of sin and morality is quite pliable and able to bend to meet any modern need:

Finally, Rev. White is able to admit that he does draw moral lines with regard to sexuality, but those lines are rooted less in God’s law but in the current popular practices of the times we live in:

This is the kind of exchange, full of thoughtful and challenging questions that force the guests and the listener to re-examine what they believe and what they espouse can only happen in a medium like talk radio and new media where hosts are able to take positions and not pretend to be objective. We know there is no real objectivity when Don Lemon or Anderson Cooper are conducting an interview on this topic. Cooper would probably never have Rev. White on in the first place, because he would make the pro-same sex marriage side look bad. And, if he did have a minister on to discuss the biblical basis for same-sex unions, there is no chance that Don Lemon would be able to pose questions for their guest in the way that Hannity and Jeffry did.

In general cable and network news have not served the public interest in exploring these complicated and important issues because, in many cases, the hosts and anchors assigned to the topic are just not equipped or are completely unwilling to have both sides of the issue get a fair and through hearing.

Congratulations to Sean Hannity for taking advantage of his medium and shedding light on an angle of this story that’s been neglected by his TV counterparts."

“Please use your executive order!” shouted the heckler, who was standing behind Obama on stage, close enough to be in the television camera shot, during an event in San Francisco’s Chinatown as the president began a two-day visit to California. Urging Obama to give immediate relief to those separated from their families at Thanksgiving, the man yelled, “You have the power to stop deportations!”

“Actually, I don’t,” Obama responded, signaling security personnel not to remove the heckler or other protesters who joined in the shouting. “These guys don’t need to go,” Obama said. “He can stay there.… I respect the passion of these young people.”

But the solution to the problem “won’t be as easy as just shouting,” Obama said to the young man. “If you’re serious about making that happen, then I’m willing to work with you.

“The easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws. What I’m proposing is the harder path” of trying to get the law changed.

It was a dramatic beginning to a California trip otherwise dominated by Democratic fundraising events, mostly closed to the public. After the immigration event and two fundraisers in San Francisco, the president flew south for two events in Beverly Hills: a reception at the home of entrepreneur and former basketball star Magic Johnson and a dinner hosted by Hollywood mogul Haim Saban.

At Johnson’s home, Obama leaned on sports analogies to criticize politics as practiced in Washington.

“Nobody played a team game better than he did,” Obama said about Johnson, “and that’s what we need in this country more than anything.”

He blamed partisanship for holding up action on issues like immigration.

“What’s stopping us is a failure of our politics and a lack of ambition,” Obama said. “Our politics all too often encourages people to think selfishly or short-term.”

The nation needs “that sense that we’re in this together,” he said.

Before the twin fundraisers, White House officials said, Obama met with the family of Gerardo Hernandez, a Transportation Security Administration officer killed in a violent attack at LAX on Nov. 1. He also met with Tony Grigsby and James Speer, two TSA officers wounded by gunfire that day.

In San Francisco, Obama used his speech to make a new appeal to Republicans to pass immigration measures before the end of the year.

As the prospects for immigration legislation in Congress have faded, activists have been increasing pressure on Obama to take executive action to reduce the record number of deportations during his administration.

Last year, Obama approved a step to shield one group of people from deportation, the so-called Dream Act youth, who were brought to the country illegally as young children. The administration justified that action as an exercise in prosecutorial discretion, the legal basis being that the executive branch has authority to say that some cases for deportation are less urgent than others.

That principle can’t be extended to cover everyone, administration lawyers have said. Immigration advocacy groups say, however, that some additional groups could be covered if Obama was willing to act.

Obama urged House Republicans to act on immigration even if that required passing several separate measures rather than one comprehensive package like the one approved by the Senate this year.

“It’s Thanksgiving. We can carve that bird into multiple pieces,” Obama said. “As long as all the pieces get done, and we actually deliver on the core values we’ve been talking about for so long, I think everybody’s fine with it.”

Obama had suggested a piece-by-piece approach before but not in such vivid terms.

Some House Republicans may be interested in that approach if they can finesse the intraparty politics. House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said recently that his caucus was committed to considering immigration legislation, but he did not lay out a time frame.

The issue splits Republicans, and GOP lawmakers are particularly divided over the idea of providing a pathway to citizenship for more than 11 million immigrants in the country who have overstayed their visas or entered illegally. Obama has insisted that any immigration overhaul must include a pathway to citizenship.

“The speaker is sincere in wanting to get something done,” Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said after the president spoke, “and we’re pleased the president said he can accept the step-by-step approach we’re taking in the House.”

The two Monday night fundraisers benefited the joint House and Senate campaign committee for Democratic candidates. Tickets for the event at the home of Johnson and his wife, Cookie, ranged from $2,500 to $15,000 per person. The dinner hosted by Saban and his wife, Cheryl, cost $16,200 per person.

Obama was scheduled to appear at another fundraiser, on behalf of the Democratic National Committee, on Tuesday morning before heading to Glendale for an appearance with entertainment industry officials at Dreamworks Animation. The company’s chief executive, Jeffrey Katzenberg, has been a leading fundraiser for Obama.

USA TODAY

Samuel L. Jackson is the Playboy interview for October and he has a lot to say. He talks about going to rehab in 1990, about having a sneaker ""fetish"" — he has ""hundreds"" of pairs — about golf as the perfect sport, about movies, good grammar, about wife LaTanya Richardson (to whom he's been married for ""40 (effing) years"") and more, including the six movies he has completed in 2013.

If we missed any of his expletives, forgive us. Jackson, 64, uses them freely and frequently.

Some highlights from the lengthy chat:

On never settling for mediocrity: ""On Twitter someone will write, 'Your an idiot,' and I'll go, 'No, you're an idiot,' and all my Twitterphiles will go, 'Hey, Sam Jackson, he's the grammar police.' I'll take that. Somebody needs to be. I mean, we have newscasters who don't even know how to conjugate verbs, something Walter Cronkite and Edward R. Murrow never had problems with. How the ... did we become a society where mediocrity is acceptable.""

On President Obama consciously dropping gs off the ends of words to sound like Joe Average: ""First of all, we know it ain't because of his blackness, so I say stop trying to 'relate.' Be a leader. Be (effing) presidential. Look, I grew up in a society where I could say 'It ain't' or 'What it be' to my friends. But when I'm out presenting myself to the world as me, who graduated from college, who had family what cared about me, who has a well-read background, I (effing) conjugate.""

On defending Quentin Tarantino's controversial use of the ""N"" word in Django Unchained: ""These 20-somethings can't turn around and tell me the word (n-word) is (effed)-up in Django yet still listen to Jay Z or whoever else say '(n-word, n-word, n-word)' throughout the music they listen to. You can't have it one way and not the other ...""

On whether only black directors can tell black stories: ""There is this whole thing of 'Nobody can tell our story but us,' but that's apparently not true, because the Jackie Robinson movie finally got made as 42. Spike (Lee) didn't make it, but people still went to see it.""

On the double standard that exists when telling black stories: ""These stories must be told. If Spike (Lee), the Hughes brothers or Carl Franklin had done it, it would have been right? Look, Quentin has this master storytelling ability, and a lot of criticism from a lot of people is straight (b.s.) jealousy because they can't do it themselves.""

On the one thing he won't do onscreen, even for Quentin Tarantino: ""Probably dress up as a woman and kiss another guy. I don't think people want to see me do that. He hasn't asked me, but you know what? If it's done right and the story is good, I might.""

On working with Josh Brolin (in upcoming Oldboy) and Julianne Moore: ""Josh is good, and he understands the fun aspect of the job. When they say 'Action,' you get serious. 'Cut,' boom. There are a few actors who are like that who are really great, like Julianne Moore. When we were doing Freedomland, Julianne was standing there saying, 'Sam, do you watch American Idol? Oh, it's so great.' They call 'Action!' and she's crying her eyes out; they call 'Cut!' and she comes right back over: 'As I was saying, this American Idol thing ... .' She's amazing.""

On bringing back his Mace Windu character in Star Wars: Episode VII: ""They should figure out a way to bring my (rear) back from wherever I went when I fell out that window, because you know a Jedi can fall from incredible heights and not die. I'd just come back with a fake hand like Darth Vader and my purple lightsaber.""

On the impression he hopes to leave after he's gone: ""That I was a hard worker and I generally gave people their money's worth. That's all you want from a movie star. I mean, I'm not trying to change the world. I'm just trying to entertain people."""

Perez as Labor Secretary,"Liberals and labor leaders hailed Mr. Perez, calling him a champion for workers and those who have faced discrimination. “At a time when our politics tilts so heavily toward corporations and the very wealthy, our country needs leaders like Tom Perez to champion the cause of ordinary working people,” said Richard L. Trumka, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.

James P. Hoffa, general president of the Teamsters, called Mr. Perez “the right choice” because of his history of advocacy. “In these difficult economic times,” Mr. Hoffa said, “workers need a fighter at the Labor Department who will stand up for them, and they are getting just that with Thomas Perez.”

While at the Justice Department, Mr. Perez has pursued a record number of discrimination or brutality claims against local police and sheriff’s departments, including that of Joe Arpaio, the outspoken sheriff in Maricopa County, Ariz., who was accused of “a pattern of unlawful discrimination” against Latinos.

Mr. Perez also challenged voter identification requirements imposed by South Carolina and Texas, and his division reached the three largest residential fair lending settlements in the history of the Fair Housing Act. Under him, the voting section participated in the most new litigation in the last fiscal year than in any previous year.

He has spent a career fighting discrimination cases as a federal prosecutor, then, under President Bill Clinton, as deputy chief of the Civil Rights Division, and finally as head of civil rights enforcement at the Health and Human Services Department. Mr. Perez also served as an elected council member in Montgomery County, Md., and as the state’s secretary of labor, licensing and regulation.

Though his father died when he was 12, his family pressed the value of education so much that all four of his siblings became doctors. Mr. Perez, 51, graduated from Brown University and Harvard Law School.

“My parents taught my four siblings and me to work hard, to give back to our community and to make sure that the ladder of opportunity was there for those coming after us,” Mr. Perez said at the White House on Monday as he addressed the crowd in both English and Spanish. “Over my career, I’ve learned that true progress is possible if you keep an open mind, listen to all sides and focus on results.”"

We are the change we seek,” candidate Barack Obama said in 2008. At the time, his comments came in for criticism: They were narcissistic; they were tautological; they didn’t make a whole lot of sense.

But in the aftermath of Obama’s 2012 reelection and his second inaugural address, his 2008 remarks seem less a statement of self-absorption than one of prophecy. There is an Obama majority in American politics, symbolized by Monday’s throng on the Mall, whose existence is both the consequence of profound changes to our nation’s composition and values and the cause of changes yet to come.

That majority, as the president made clear in his remarks, would not exist but for Americans’ struggles to expand our foundational belief in the equality of all men. The drive to expand equality, he said in his speech’s most historically resonant line, “is the star that guides us still, just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall.”

Our history, Obama argued, is one of adapting our ideals to a changing world. His speech (like recent books by Michael Lind and my Post colleague E.J. Dionne Jr.) reclaimed U.S. history from the misrepresentations of both constitutional originalists and libertarian fantasists. “Fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges,” the president said. “Preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action. For the American people can no more meet the demands of today’s world by acting alone than American soldiers could have met the forces of fascism or communism with muskets and militias.”

Having established that the moral and practical arc of U.S. history bends toward equality, Obama vowed to push his demands for equality still further — to ending the systemic underpayment of female workers; the voter suppression that compels some Americans, usually minorities, to wait hours to cast their votes; the deportations of immigrants who would otherwise help build the economy; and the laws that forbid gay Americans to marry.

As the president acknowledged, however, social equality is rising even as the relative economic equality that once defined American life has sharply and broadly receded. “Our country cannot succeed,” he said, “when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it.” For this, Obama prescribed revamping our taxes and reforming our schools, but these are by no means sufficient to transform our nation into one that, as the president put it, “rewards the effort and determination of every single American.” The waning of the middle class is, with climate change, the most vexing item on the president’s agenda and requires far-reaching solutions beyond any he laid out. U.S. workers must regain the power they once had to bargain for their wages, but that only begins the list of economic reforms that are as difficult to achieve as they are necessary to re-create an financially vibrant nation.

The president closed his speech by asking his supporters to join him to help “shape the debates of our time.” The biggest mistake Obama made when he took office was to effectively disband the organization of the millions of Americans who had worked for his election — for fear, in part, that it might upset members of Congress whose votes he would need for his policies. He wants no such unilateral political disarmament now; his operatives hope to keep his 2012 campaign’s volunteer army in the field for the legislative battles ahead. Obama’s legions have proven that they can win elections, and this matters a great deal more, the president has learned, than whatever trace elements of goodwill he may win by deferring to Congress.

The Obama Majority — its existence and mobilization — is what enabled the president to deliver so ideological an address. No such inaugural speech has been delivered since Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, demanding the curtailment of government programs and secure in the knowledge that much of the white working class had shifted its allegiance away from the Democrats and supported his attack on the public sector and minority rights. On Monday, Obama, secure in the knowledge that the nation’s minorities had joined with other liberal constituencies to form a new governing coalition, voiced their demands to ensure equality and to preserve and expand the government’s efforts to meet the nation’s challenges. As he left the stage, he stopped and turned to marvel at the crowd, at the new American majority they represented. They were the ones he, and we, were waiting for.

Bratton to return as the city’s police commissioner Thursday, selecting the former LAPD police chief to head a department praised for overseeing a drop in crime but criticized for its use of racially charged stop-and-frisk tactics.

Bratton had been expected to get the job, which has been held since 2002 by Raymond Kelly. De Blasio, who will take office in January at the end of Michael Bloomberg’s third and final term, was a harsh critic of Kelly and vowed to replace him if elected.

In a statement issued prior to a news conference announcing the appointment Thursday, De Blasio called Bratton a “proven crime-fighter.”

“He knows what it takes to keep the city safe,” the mayor-elect said.

For his part, Bratton said in a statement that “De Blasio’s priorities are my priorities.”

People familiar with the decision had already begun reacting to it before the news briefing.

The Rev. Al Sharpton, an activist in the African American community, said he spoke with De Blasio on Tuesday about his selection of Bratton, who also served under New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in the 1990s.

Sharpton said he had a “very distant and adversarial relationship” with Bratton when he served in New York, but that their relations improved as Bratton served in Los Angeles and the two worked together on gang violence and police misconduct issues.

“Mr. Bratton knows my concerns and the concerns of others about racial profiling in stop and frisk policing, but at the same time is aware of our desire to continue the decrease of violence and crime in our community,” Sharpton said in a statement.

Bratton’s time as NYPD’s top cop made him an international figure, so by the time he came to Los Angeles in 2002, he was already a law enforcement superstar who had appeared on the cover of Time magazine in the ‘90s for his success in New York. He served as LAPD chief until 2009.

Imagine standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, looking out toward the Washington Monument. A huge crowd has gathered — more than 200,000 people — from all across the nation. They fan out around the Reflecting Pool, to the base of the monument and beyond.

It’s August 1963, and people have come to Washington to demand change. In some parts of the country, black people are not treated the same as white people. The marchers want that to end. They want fair and equal treatment for everyone, no matter the color of their skin. They are part of a growing force called the civil rights movement.

By bus, train and plane, they have come to Washington. Some arrive by car, and one even roller-skates into town. Now they are all on the Mall. For more than five hours they have been marching, singing, praying and listening to speeches.

You are the last speaker on this tiring but exciting day. How will you stir the crowd? As recently as last night, you told a friend you still didn’t know exactly what you would say. But now, here you are. Everyone’s eyes are on you. If you are nervous — who wouldn’t be? — you don’t show it.

You are the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., and you are about to give one of the most famous speeches in American history. It will be known as the “I Have a Dream” speech. [See Page 3.]

For many, it will be the high point of the entire civil rights movement.

A nation still divided

The year 1963 marked the 100th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, in which President Abraham Lincoln declared that all slaves in the South were freed. But in some ways, life in the 20th century wasn’t much better for black people (then often called “Negroes” or “colored people”).

“White Only” signs hung over drinking fountains and doorways in several states. Many hotels would not rent rooms to black people. The best jobs went to whites. In some places, black people were not allowed to vote.

Keeping the races separated is called segregation. Schools, churches, buses and trains, movie theaters and even professional sports teams all were segregated at some point in U.S. history.

The 1950s and ’60s featured a big push for equality. King, the son of a Baptist minister and a minister himself, was a leader in this fight for civil rights. He preached the power of love over hate. He urged people to challenge unfair laws and actions, but to do so peacefully. King said black people should work with white people to gain equality.

Not everyone agreed with King, but there was no doubt that his was a powerful voice.

Steps toward equality

Several civil rights milestones happened in the decade before the 1963 rally in Washington. Among them:

The U.S. Supreme Court said “separate but equal” schools for white and black children were illegal. Then Rosa Parks, who was black, refused to give up her bus seat to a white rider in Montgomery, Alabama. Her case and others led to a court ruling that segregation on buses was illegal.

Across the South, rallies were held to protest other forms of segregation, including keeping black people from voting. There were “sit-in” protests at segregated lunch counters, libraries, parks and other public places. In Birmingham, Alabama, police dogs and water cannons were turned on protesters; more than 1,000 people, including King, were arrested.

The nation was moving slowly — but not always willingly — toward treating the races equally, a process called integration. In June 1963, President John F. Kennedy called on Congress to pass a major civil rights bill giving all Americans access to public places and protecting the right to vote.

‘Freedom now’

Civil rights leaders and others got busy planning a big rally. They called it the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. When the big day, August 28, arrived, thousands of marchers headed for the Mall. Many carried signs: “We Demand Equal Rights Now!” . . . “With Liberty and Justice for All!” . . . “Freedom Now.”

It was the largest civil rights march in history. Millions watched on television.

Several people spoke before King. Some were civil rights leaders; others were leaders of religious groups or groups of workers. Rosa Parks was introduced. Singers Marian Anderson, Mahalia Jackson and Bob Dylan performed.

The youngest speaker was 23-year-old John Lewis, who led a student activist group. Lewis, now a congressman from Georgia, was angry about the slow pace of change in the country, and he wrote a speech that said so. That upset some people, so Lewis agreed to delete the harsh wording. That, in turn, upset other people. Because of this dispute, Lewis’s speech is the only one besides King’s that is still talked about.

Right after the march, King and others met with President Kennedy at the White House. The following July, they returned to watch the new president, Lyndon Johnson, sign the Civil Rights Act of 1964. And in August 1965, two years after they marched on Washington, the group came back. This time they stood under the Capitol dome as the president signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, calling it “a triumph for freedom.”

The March on Washington had indeed changed history.

However, the Obama administration's Department of Justice has moved to request that such Bush-era officials, and the former President, be shielded with immunity.

Per Inder Comar:



In court papers filed today, the United States Department of Justice requested that George W. Bush, Richard Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice and Paul Wolfowitz be granted procedural immunity in a case alleging that they planned and waged the Iraq War in violation of international law. Plaintiff Sundus Shaker Saleh, an Iraqi single mother and refugee now living in Jordan, filed a complaint in March 2013 in San Francisco federal court alleging that the planning and waging of the war constituted a “crime of aggression” against Iraq, a legal theory that was used by the Nuremberg Tribunal to convict Nazi war criminals after World War II.

Saleh's suit alleges that President Bush and his administration falsified pretenses for the war, failed to get international approval, and began planning for the possibility of an invasion before 2000.

However, the Obama administration would like to shield the ex-President and his officials from such prosecution, arguing that everything done was performed within the scope of their various governmental roles.

Meanwhile, Bradley Manning – now Chelsea Manning – will be spending 35 years in prison for exposing U.S. war crimes.

Crimes Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and their ilk helped choreograph.

USA TODAY

Brace yourselves, Washington, D.C., drivers. Angry truckers are coming to town Friday as part of a three-day protest to ""shut down America"" and ""restore our Constitutional Republic.""

Enraged by low wages, fuel prices, regulations, the government shutdown, the debt ceiling, President Obama and ""the corruption that is destroying America,"" the ""Truckers Ride for the Constitution"" aims to tie up three lanes of Interstate 495 circling the nation's capital, with big rigs traveling 55 mph, an organizer toldU.S. News & World Report.

Last week, one of the promoters said 3,000 truckers had said they planned to participate in the holiday-weekend rally. Two convoys reportedly will leave from the Doswell Truck Stop in Doswell, Va.

The ""general strike"" seeks to enlist sympathetic motorists — and will let them pass if they display the group's calling card: T2SDA, which stands for ""Truckers to Shut Down America,"" the original name.

The group behind the rally, ""Ride for the Constitution,"" said in a news release that the ""stage is now set for what we now consider the last peaceful defensive stand in a war that has been declared by Wall Street, Washington, and the Whitehouse upon the American people.""

But a Georgia trucker handling logistics, Earl Conlon, told U.S. News & World Report that he and other truckers would block the highway if police intervened and that they also would try to arrest members of Congress for disregarding the Constitution.

""We want these people arrested, and we're coming in with the grand jury to do it,"" he said. ""We are going to ask the law enforcement to uphold their constitutional oath and make these arrests. If they refuse to do it, by the power of the people of the United States and the people's grand jury, they don't want to do it, we will. ... We the people will find a way.""

In a statement posted to its Facebook page Monday evening, the Truckers Ride said Conlon did not speak for the group.

Folks, here's the entire scoop on US News & World Report attempting to get a sensational title from someone not authorized to speak on behalf of all peaceful protesters. As we approach the event, this is what we can expect from the MSM and potential saboteurs --- but NOTHING will stop us!

Monday, Twitter suspended the T2SDA account, but #T2SDA remained active."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/10/us/politics/immigration-bill-debate-nears-in-senate.html,2013-06-10 00:00:00,"['Michael D. Shear', 'Ashley Parker']",Immigration Bill Debate Nears in Senate,"The legislation, which would be the first major immigration overhaul since President Ronald Reagan backed amnesty for illegal immigrants in 1986, was drafted over the last several months by the so-called Gang of Eight, a bipartisan group of senators. It is largely in step with the president’s goals of offering a path to citizenship for the millions of illegal immigrants already in the country while tightening border security and expanding legal entry into the country for families and workers.

But no one expects the bill to pass the Senate without some modifications. Mr. Obama’s Republican allies on the issue — in particular Senators Marco Rubio of Florida, a member of the bipartisan group, and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma — warned last week that the president could lose their support without stronger efforts to secure the border, as well as other changes.

“I’m trying to get to where I can say yes,” Mr. Coburn said as senators prepared to clear the way for what could be weeks of debate in the full chamber. “But the only way you can say yes and sell it to the American people is to know that the border is secure, and this bill doesn’t do it.”

Mr. Obama will try to set the tone for the legislative fight with a speech at the White House on Tuesday. But the battle will quickly shift to the Capitol, where the biggest struggle may be over how far to go in securing America’s border with Mexico against illegal crossings.

White House officials say they expect Democrats will have to make compromises on border security by accepting some amendments that tighten enforcement. But they said Democrats would resist any amendments that significantly undermine the core of the bill — a certain path to citizenship for those already in the country.

“We are willing to toughen up border — many of our colleagues feel that’s important — but without forsaking our principles,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and a member of the bipartisan group. He said border security demands must be reasonable “so that if, God forbid, there’s a president in 2017 who hates immigration reform, it will still go forward.”

Mr. Obama has stayed clear of personally directing the legislative process from the West Wing, on the theory that his participation would make it more difficult for Republicans to support it. But administration officials are working behind the scenes with allies from both parties in the Senate to provide technical support as they draft friendly amendments to the legislation. They are also helping lawmakers develop talking points and prepare side-by-side comparisons to help defeat efforts intended to undermine the bill."

U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman, who has invited the clown who wore the mask to perform in Texas, said the request for probes into the incident by the Justice Department and Secret Service are “silly” and should be ignored.

“A rodeo clown is really a nominal thing and it hurt no one,” Stockman told FoxNews.com. “They didn’t speak out when George Bush was being portrayed as a murderer. To become relevant again, they need to become more of an honest broker and not have contrived anger.”

Stockman said the NAACP would better serve its constituents by focusing on ways to decrease unemployment among the black community. He also noted that the national civil rights group was silent after a July incident on a Florida bus where three black teens beat a fellow white student. Though Gulfport Police Chief Robert Vincent told Fox News the attack did not appear to be racially motivated, former Florida Rep. Allen West, who is black, chided Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, noting they condemned Florida's laws in the wake of the Trayvon Martin shooting yet remained mum on the bus attack.

“It’s really patently false that they’re angry at this, but not angry at other issues,” Stockman continued. “There has to be some consistency.”

Stockman said he thinks it’s unlikely federal officials will investigate the matter.

“We can’t get the Justice Department to look at Benghazi, so it would be ironic that the Justice Department would investigate a clown,” he said. “They should focus on their member’s needs rather than theatrics.”

Still, the rodeo clown has been widely condemned for his off-color act.

On Wednesday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the rodeo clown incident was “not one of the finer moments” for The Show-Me State.

“I haven’t heard about the president’s reaction or if he had one,” Earnest told reporters. “I can tell you as a native Missourian, it was certainly not one of the finer moments for our state and not the way I like to see our state depicted in the news.”

Stockman said widespread reports of Saturday’s bull riding event at the Missouri State Fair in Sedalia was an example of what he calls “pop news,” distractions from serious issues facing the country.

The performer, meanwhile, has been permanently banned from future state fair events and subsequent performers must undergo sensitivity training.

Messages seeking comment from Justice Department and NAACP officials were not immediately returned Thursday.

Jehmu Greene, a Fox News contributor and Democratic strategist, said she agreed with Stockman’s take that the call for a federal probe was unwarranted. It’s far from the first time a sitting commander-in-chief has been mocked, she said.

“Absolutely it is misguided,” she said during an appearance on Fox News. “The NAACP has jumped the shark on this one.”"

I discussed the truth about the McDonald's Coffee Case last year. Click on that link and read about it and then come back, or take a look at it later.

Consider, if there were an onslaught of frivolous lawsuits crowding our dockets, wouldn't you expect judges to be aware of the problem and even active in demanding a solution to the problem? Who better to know what a case is really about and whether it is frivolous or notl?

In fact, there is a study that asked judges about this issue conducted by the Federal Judicial Center. Never heard of the Federal Judicial Center? Well, here is a description:

The Federal Judicial Center is the research and education agency of the federal judicial system. It was established by Congress in 1967 (28 U.S.C. §§ 620-629), on the recommendation of the Judicial Conference of the United States. The many specific statutory duties of the Center and its Board fall into a few broad categories: o conducting and promoting orientation and continuing education and training for federal judges, court employees, and others;

o developing recommendations about the operation and study of the federal courts;

o conducting and promoting research on federal judicial procedures, court operations, and history. By statute, the Chief Justice of the United States chairs the Center's Board, which also includes the director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts and seven judges elected by the Judicial Conference.

Hardly folks who could be called wild-eyed radicals.

In 2005, they issued a report on sanctionable behavior, and that includes the filing of frivolous lawsuits: Report of a Survey of United States District Judges' Experiences and Views Concerning Rule 11, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by David Rauma & Thomas E. Willging

The study - a survey of most of the federal judges - was performed, because many were claiming that frivolous lawsuits were common and that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure R. 11 needed to be beefed up. Rule 11 provides for sanctions for litigants, lawyers, and lawfirms who file suits where they have not done reasonable investigation into the facts and law and where there is not factual and legal support for their filings. Or as the study describes Rule 11.

As currently written, Rule 11 expressly authorizes judges to impose sanctions on lawyers and parties who present to a district court a pleading, written motion, or other paper without reasonable support in fact or law or for an improper purpose, such as to cause unnecessary cost or delay. Rule 11 provides that sanctions for violations are within the judge's discretion; that a party should have a period of time, a ""safe harbor,"" within which to withdraw or correct a filing alleged to violate Rule 11; and that Rule 11's primary purpose is to deter future violations and not necessarily to compensate the opposing party for losses, including attorney fees.

Here is the study abstract:

A report of the results of a survey completed by 278 of 400 (70%) federal district judges in the winter of 2004-05. The Center conducted the study at the request of the Judicial Conference's Advisory Committee on Civil Rules. A questionnaire elicited the judges' experiences and opinions about the merits of past and current versions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 and about a legislative proposal to modify Rule 11. The judges expressed a strong preference for Rule 11 in its current form.

The study asked judges whether frivolous lawsuits were a problem. The overwhelming majority said no.

The views of judges who responded to the survey are likely to be related to their estimation of the amount of groundless civil litigation they see in their own docket, especially when focusing on cases where the plaintiff is represented by counsel. Approximately 85% of the district judges view groundless litigation in such cases as no more than a small problem and another 12% see such litigation as a moderate problem. About 3% view groundless litigation brought by plaintiffs who are represented by counsel as a large or very large problem. For 54% of the judges who responded, the amount of groundless litigation has remained relatively constant during their tenure on the federal bench. Only 7% indicated that the problem is now larger. For 19%, the amount of groundless civil litigation has decreased during their tenure on the federal bench, and for 12% there has never been a problem.

What is most interesting is that judges appointed more recently feel that way most strongly.

The overwhelming result was that Rule 11 sanctions should not be amended to be made harsher. Here are the more detailed results:

More than 80% of the 278 district judges indicated that ""Rule 11 is needed and it is just right as it now stands."" In evaluating the alternatives, 87% of the respondents preferred the current Rule 11, 5% preferred the version in effect between 1983 and 1993, and 4% preferred the version proposed in H.R. 4571. Judges' opinions about specific provisions in Rule 11 and the proposed legislation followed a similar pattern. The results indicated that relatively large majorities of the judges who responded to our survey have the following views about Rule 11: * 85% strongly or moderately support Rule 11's safe harbor provision; * 91% oppose the proposed requirement that sanctions be imposed for every Rule 11 violation; * 84% disagree with the proposition that an award of attorney fees should be mandatory for every Rule 11 violation.

Unfortunately, I cannot provide a link that gets you directly to the study. You can find it by going here and doing a search for sanctions."

Valentine’s Day is also a day when people with crazy ex-boyfriends or -girlfriends are reminded of how thankful they are for anti-stalking laws.

Every state has made stalking a crime. These laws help protect people who might otherwise live in fear. Yet labor unions have successfully, and disconcertingly, lobbied to be exempt from anti-stalking laws in at least four states – California, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Nevada.

“The most glaring examples of union favoritism under state laws,” notes a 2012 U.S. Chamber of Commerce report, “tend to occur in criminal statutes and allow individuals who engage in truly objectionable behavior to avoid prosecution solely because they are participating in some form of labor activity.”

Pennsylvania unions now enjoy a loophole that the state’s anti-stalking law “shall not apply to conduct by a party to a labor dispute.” In Illinois, anti-stalking laws exempt “any controversy concerning wages, salaries, hours, working conditions or benefits … the making of collective bargaining agreements.”

These exemptions prove that organizing tactics used by unions can have something in common with those of stalkers – and can perhaps inflict similar emotional distress.

While a number of states have exemptions that have allowed union members to intimidate and harass, California is by far the worst actor. As in other states, it is a crime in California to interfere with a lawful business through physical obstruction or intimidation of workers or customers.

Yet California has exempted unions from this law. The negative effects were clear in 2008, when United Food and Commercial Workers Union members picketed a new Ralph’s grocery store in Fresno. They went beyond traditional picketing, harassing customers and instigating confrontations with employees on store property. When store workers finally called the police, authorities refused to come and put a stop to the union’s disruptive behavior.

With the nation’s highest income and sales tax rates, in addition to many costly regulations, California is already one of the most difficult places to do business. Its exemptions permitting such behavior on the part of unions – which would be considered criminal for you or me – makes the state an even more inhospitable place to do business.

California also has a host of exemptions that allow union members to violate the property rights of private citizens. The 2008 Researcher Protection Act makes entering the residences of academic researchers to interfere with their work a crime. Sounds reasonable. Yet this doesn’t apply to union members. They can invade a professor’s home in California and it’s not a crime – so long as the invader is “engaged in labor union activities.”

You might wonder why unions have lobbied to be exempt from laws against trespassing. The fact is that they have a long history of targeting private residences. In 2010 roughly 500 protesters from the Service Employees International Union showed up outside the home of a Bank of America deputy general counsel to protest the company’s policies. That bank official wasn’t home, but his teenage son was – and felt forced to barricade himself in a bathroom as union demonstrators surrounded his house and even came onto the front porch.

Unions can also invade your personal space if you’re riding public transit in California. The California Penal Code states “willfully blocking the free movement of another person” in a public transit system is a crime subject to up to 90 days in jail and a $400 fine. However, California legislators have passed a provision exempting unions. This means that union protesters can block the movement of people on public transit so long as it is related to collective bargaining efforts – something to keep in mind before getting on BART during your next visit to San Francisco.

Labor bosses have even deemed it necessary to get legislators to grant unions exemptions from laws against sabotage. Wisconsin’s state law against sabotage exempts unions, so as to not curtail their organizing activities. The fact that anti-sabotage laws might be construed as an impediment to union organizing says more about union organizing efforts than anything else.

Yet, in 2011, union members were alleged to have sabotaged equipment belonging to supporters of Governor Scott Walker’s labor reforms. In New York and New Jersey, during a labor dispute between Verizon and the Communications Workers of America, the telephone company contacted the FBI to investigate allegations of sabotage. The company reported equipment being stolen, fiber-optic lines cut and an office heating system tampered with.

During a union organizing effort in Ohio, the owner of one non-union electrical services company had his tires slashed and rocks thrown at his windows. One of his employees was assaulted. The owner was himself shot in the arm while confronting a person who was vandalizing his car on his property. Other owners of non-union shops experienced similar harassment and intimidation. When the Associated Builders and Contractors called on unions to halt such odious behavior, the unions responded that their actions were perfectly legal.

State lawmakers should oppose efforts to exempt unions from anti-stalking and anti-trespassing laws. Where such laws are already on the books, they should be repealed. For union bosses can be like those scary exes who insist they aren’t letting you break up with them.

Workers and employers deserve the freedom to tell unions, “I’m just not that into you.”

The videos are the first taken of Snowden since he was granted asylum in Russia.

""If we can't understand the policies and programs of our government, we can't grant our consent in regulating them,"" Snowden said in one of the videos posted Friday night.

Watch a video of Snowden receiving the award above, and see more videos from the event here.

Below, more from the AP on Snowden's award:

MOSCOW (AP) — The former National Security Agency systems analyst, Edward Snowden, said that the mass surveillance programs used by the United States to tap into phone and internet connections around the world are making people less safe.

In short video clips posted by the WikiLeaks website on Friday, Snowden said that the NSA's mass surveillance, which he disclosed before fleeing to Russia, ""puts us at risk of coming into conflict with our own government.""

A U.S. court has charged Snowden with violating the Espionage Act for disclosing those programs.

Snowden described them as a ""dragnet mass surveillance that puts entire populations under sort of an eye that sees everything even when it's not needed.""

""They hurt our economy. They hurt our country. They limit our ability to speak and think and live and be creative, to have relationships and to associate freely,"" Snowden said.

The videos are the first of Snowden speaking since July 12, when the former NSA analyst was shown at a Moscow airport pleading with Russian authorities to grant him asylum, which they did on Aug. 1. That decision has strained the relations between the U.S. and Russia, and President Barack Obama called off a meeting with President Putin at a summit hosted by Russia in September.

Snowden said the U.S. government was ""unwilling to prosecute high officials who lied to Congress and the country on camera, but they'll stop at nothing to persecute someone who told them the truth.""

In a note accompanying the videos, WikiLeaks said Snowden spoke on Wednesday in Moscow as he accepted the Sam Adams Award, named for a CIA analyst during the Vietnam War who accused the U.S. military of deliberately underestimating the enemy's strength for political purposes, and given annually by a group of retired U.S. national security officers. Four former U.S. government officials who were at the ceremony told The Associated Press on Thursday that Snowden is adjusting to life in Russia and said they saw no evidence that he was under the control of local security services. They refused to say where they met with Snowden or where he is living.

Twenty young immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children are taking part in a “DREAMer Hackathon” on Wednesday at LinkedIn’s Mountain View, Calif., headquarters.

The young coders will break into small groups to build technology during the marathon programming session to push Congress to pass immigration reform. Technology veterans including Zuckerberg, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Dropbox co-founder Drew Houston will be on hand to advise them, and Fwd.us, Zuckerberg’s lobbying group, has pledged to get the projects up and running.

Zuckerberg organized his first hackathon in his Harvard dorm room, and Facebook employees routinely pull all-nighters to build new products and features. Now Fwd.us is borrowing the concept to press for a comprehensive overhaul of the nation’s immigration policies.

Among the young immigrants who will code for 24 hours straight is 24-year-old Justino Mora from Los Angeles.

Mora’s group plans to build a mobile app that will tell people who their representatives are in Washington, where those representatives stand on immigration reform and ways in which people can take action, either by signing a petition or sending a message to their representatives.

Mora said he is excited to meet Zuckerberg and the other technology leaders.

“They have an amazing record in the tech sector. They know what works,” he said. “We have a different type of experience. We come from communities that are dealing with a broken immigration system. The combination will come up with very powerful tools that are going to change the discussion on immigration.”

The hackathon comes as Fwd.us tries to refocus attention on the issue of immigration reform, which has stalled in Washington. Zuckerberg’s group wants to change U.S. immigration policy and loosen restrictions on visas for skilled workers such as engineers and scientists.

“We hope that momentum coming from our hackathon — and the technology it creates — can help move immigration reform forward,” Fwd.us President Joe Green said in a blog post announcing the hackathon.

Zuckerberg visited Capitol Hill in September to press members of Congress in private meetings to support an immigration overhaul. The legislation has bogged down in the GOP-led House of Representatives months after the Senate passed a bill that eventually would grant citizenship to millions of undocumented immigrants.

Zuckerberg wrote in an op-ed piece in the Washington Post in April that he was inspired to launch Fwd.us after teaching a class on entrepreneurship in an after-school program.

“These students are smart and hardworking, and they should be part of our future,” Zuckerberg wrote.

Mora crossed the U.S. border illegally from Mexico with his mother, brother and sister when he was 11, fleeing poverty and physical abuse from his father.

He worked his way through high school and graduated with nearly a 3.9 grade-point average. He was a captain of the cross-country and track-and-field teams and a youth group leader with his local Catholic church.

Mora said he was thrilled to get acceptance letters from his “dream” colleges, only to realize that because he was undocumented he was not eligible for financial aid. He attended community college instead.

He became involved as a political activist for immigrant rights, including the California Dream Act, which gives undocumented students state-funded scholarships.

Last year he received authorization to live and work in the United States as part of the reprieves granted by the Obama administration to young people who were brought to the U.S. by their parents. Mora went to the White House along with eight other immigrants in May to tell his story in person to President Obama and Vice President Biden.

Mora said he had never seen a computer before he came to the U.S. In community college, he took his first computer science class.

Now he builds websites and he is pursuing a double major in computer science and political science at UCLA. He says one day he wants to open his own business that would put technology in the hands of advocacy organizations.

“What motivated me was what my mom taught us: that education is the key to success and to a better life, and that education allows people not only to improve their own skills but also stand up for one’s rights and to advocate for the rights of the community,” Mora said.

USA TODAY

President Obama's staff has unmasked and fired a national security official who tweeted critical comments under a pseudonym.

Jofi Joseph, tweeting under the handle @natsecwonk, once wrote: ""I'm a fan of Obama, but his continuing reliance and dependence upon a vacuous cipher like Valerie Jarrett concerns me.""

A federal law enforcement official, who was not authorized to commeny on the matter, told USA TODAY that Joseph is not under investigation, as has been reported

Other Obama staff members and officials — including Secretary of State John Kerry and former National Security adviser Tom Donilon — had also been targeted by @natsecwonk, which was shut down last week.

The secret Twitter feed also raised questions about the administration's handling of the 2012 attack on a U.S. facility in Benghazi, Libya.

The Daily Beast, which broke the story, reported that Joseph, who is well known in national security circles, ""has also worked at the State Department and on Capitol Hill for Senators Bob Casey (D-Pa.) and (Vice President) Joe Biden. Until recently, he was part of the administration's team working on negotiations with Iran.""

Of course, Joseph also insulted Republicans on his mystery Twitter feed: ""So when will someone do us the favor of getting rid of Sarah Palin and the rest of her white trash family? What utter useless garbage .... ""

Politico reported on the investigation into Joseph's Twitter activities:

""After a probe that included an investigation into Joseph's travel and shopping patterns — parsed from over 2,000 tweets — lawyers from the White House counsel's office confronted Joseph and ordered him to leave the executive complex, according to two sources familiar with the situation. Joseph had been scheduled to rotate out of White House duty to a senior job in the Pentagon, an administration official told Politico.""

A federal law enforcement official, who was not authorized to comment on the matter, told USA TODAY that Joseph is not under investigation."

How can conservatives adjust their strategy to appeal more strongly to the single female society? Well, one obvious approach would be restricting the vote to people who are married.

Now I'm not quite sure how that's supposed to appeal to single women. It seems to me that if you just go ahead and disenfranchise single women (or blacks, or Latinos, or poor people, or people who don't drive for whatever reason), well then, that solves your problem right there. No need to have policies or platforms that appeal to people who can't vote, right? So it's kind of illogical on its face. But it's also just mind-bogglingly bizarro as well.

A couple of quotes from the comments:



The goal of the GOP should be to resist urbanization, not just because of the voting trends, but because urban life leads to a lower standard of living.

Speaking as someone with a paid off mortgage I still oppose the idea of property owners being the cut point. Taxpayer is a perfectly good one. Best would be to first seize the vocabulary, change out 'entitlement' for 'public charity.' Then anyone who declares themselves destitute and in need of public charity would be a lot easier to drop from the voter rolls. They would have declared themselves incapable of maintaining themselves; why do they get to tell the rest of us how to run the country if they can't take care of themselves?

So people who live in cities shouldn't vote either I guess?I knew about only allowing property owners to vote...

Now my little diary doesn't explore the author's myriad reasons why single women are the problem, but here's his opening generalization:



The single female demographic doesn’t get hung up on details. Another of the new liberal icons, Wendy Davis of Texas, couldn’t answer basic questions about the abortion legislation she opposed with a purportedly heroic filibuster. Now she’s claiming she is actually kinda sorta “pro life” when you think about it. This is true of all the emotional appeals directed at single female society – lack of knowledge is not only overshadowed by passionate conviction, it can be a point of pride.

I was mainly just impressed by how much Red State conservatives don't want people to vote, to the point where disenfranchisement is a Serious Discussion.

I can only conclude that it's because what Kos always says about our base, if our people vote WE WIN.

Thanks for listening. I was partly practicing block quotes and links. If I have overstepped the rules for linking to Mr Hayward's diary I stand properly chastised.

[Update] Wow, Rec List. Thanks everyone!"

Much of the scene was familiar: the yellow flags, the banners protesting tyranny and socialism, the demands to impeach President Obama and to repeal Obamacare. But there was a new target of the conservatives’ ire: Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and his “amnesty” plan for illegal immigrants. The loathing of this onetime darling of the movement — Rubio rode the tea party wave to office in 2010 — could be seen in the homemade signs on the East Lawn of the Capitol proclaiming, “Rubio RINO” (Republican In Name Only) and “Rubio Lies, Americans Die.” Rubio antagonism became a main theme of the event, held by Republican Reps. Steve King (Iowa), Louie Gohmert (Tex.), Michele Bachmann (Minn.) and other opponents of the bipartisan Senate immigration legislation that Rubio negotiated.

The lawmakers called to the microphone the Heritage Foundation’s Robert Rector, who delivered a sustained rebuke of the turncoat. “Marco Rubio,” he charged, “has not read his own bill.”

A chorus of boos rose from the crowd of several hundred.

Rector mocked the claim that the legislation wouldn’t cost taxpayers money.

“Liars! Liars!” the crowd replied.

“Senator Rubio says that [illegal immigrants] are going to have to pay a penalty, ’cause this bill is tough,” Rector said, derisively.

“Boo! Liar! Liar!”

“The thing I find most offensive of all is Senator Rubio’s staff saying that we need to have more low-skill immigrants because American workers can’t cut it,” Rector went on.

“That’s a lie! Lies! Boo!”

Rector asked rhetorically how many undocumented immigrants would receive government benefits. “How about seven, Senator Rubio, 7 million illegal immigrants?”

“Primary Rubio!” somebody in the crowd shouted.

The speed with which the tea party turned on Rubio is stunning, beginning earlier this year with complaints from conservative commentators and now open mockery at a Capitol Hill rally. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) declared this week that the House won’t take up an immigration bill that doesn’t have majority support in the Republican caucus, which means the “Gang of Eight” Senate bill that Rubio sponsored wouldn’t get a vote.

The immigration event was essentially a bid by the lawmakers to hijack the crowd of about 1,000 (respectable, if a faint echo of the 2009 and 2010 crowds) that was already assembling at the Capitol on Wednesday for a tea party rally against the IRS on the other side of the building. Calling their event a rally might have been too obvious a theft, so the lawmakers staged an all-day “press conference” (which had the benefit of less-stringent permitting requirements).

This was a news conference unlike any other. It ran from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (with a two-hour break to minimize overlap with the other rally), began with a prayer, included chants of “USA! USA!” and featured politicians holding babies onstage. In the audience, a sea of homemade signs announced “Legalized = Invasion” and “The Melting Pot Floweth Over” and “Exporting Illegals = Importing Jobs for Americans” and “God Will Take Care of Them There: Close the Borders.”

The few reporters who did pose questions during the extravaganza were cheered or booed based on their employers: an extended ovation for a reporter from the conservative Breitbart News Web site, jeers for Lisa Desjardins of CNN and cascading boos for a Huffington Post reporter.

The gimmick was a big draw, luring so many from the IRS protest that Capitol Police complained of a crowding problem for the supposed news conference. Gohmert rallied opposition to Boehner, saying the speaker’s assurances to conservatives on immigration leave room for “a betrayal.”

“Get rid of him!” people shouted from the crowd.

Bachmann further stirred up the activists by telling them that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) is accelerating a vote on the legislation because of “falling support for the Gang of Eight immigration reform bill.”

But the press-conference format, and the shortage of reporters willing to play along, created an open-mike situation. A man claiming to be from the Pittsburgh tea party asked about “the illegal people” and whether the government could find out “who they’re calling back in their home countries and to whom they’re sending money, American money.”

Heritage’s Rector fielded that question. “I regard my vote as something like a property right,” he said, “and when you give it out willy-nilly and freely to people whose claim on that property right is that they broke our laws, I feel deeply insulted. And I say, ‘You stole from me!’ ”

The cheers that followed could be heard clearly on the Senate side of the Capitol.

He Sketches The Foolish', 'The Fallacious', 'The Felonious In Politics.']",Dana Milbank: Rep. Steve King’s rotten tomatoes,"Now the immigration debate is really getting juicy.

Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican, has always been a bit of a melon head, but he outdid himself in an interview that came to light this week in which he described “DREAMers” — people brought to this country illegally as children — as misshapen drug mules. “For every one who’s a valedictorian, there’s another 100 out there that — they weigh 130 pounds and they’ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert,” the honorable gentleman said.

Cantaloupe calves? This was a rotten tomato tossed at Latinos, who were already suspicious of Republicans before the insult was added to the injury of House conservatives such as King blocking action on bipartisan immigration legislation.

“Hateful,” said House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio).

“Inexcusable,” said Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.).

1 of 171 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Republicans View Photos A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Caption A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Tom Toles Wait 1 second to continue.

King kept on throwing. “It’s not something that I’m making up,” he told Radio Iowa on Tuesday evening, hours after a Democrat who had discovered the recent interview with Newsmax read the offending comments aloud at a congressional hearing. “We have people that are mules, that are drug mules, that are hauling drugs across the border and you can tell by their physical characteristics what they’ve been doing for months, going through the desert with 75 pounds of drugs on their back. And if those who advocate for the DREAM Act, if they choose to characterize this about valedictorians, I gave them a different image.”

King certainly gave his colleagues a different image: that of a Republican Party driven into extinction in coming decades because it antagonized what is becoming the most important voting bloc. Even his usual conservative partners moved to isolate him.

“Irresponsible and reprehensible,” Rep. Raul Labrador (Idaho) said at a luncheon gathering with reporters called Conversations with Conservatives. “I think what he said was out of touch with the [GOP] conference.”

In lieu of a defense of King, Labrador scolded the assembled journalists for their reporting on King’s out-of-his-gourd remark but not the favorable things other Republicans say about immigrants. “Shame on you. Shame on the media,” he lectured. “Make sure that your article talks about what every Republican said,” Labrador proposed, “not what one outlier said.”

This is similar to scolding the media for focusing on the one plane that crashes and not giving equal attention to all the planes that land safely. More to the point, it’s not at all clear that King is such an outlier.

Certainly, his zany remarks are low-hanging fruit for journalists. Just last week, he got into a heated exchange with a Univision host who asked about a speech in which King likened immigrants to a litter of puppies. “You want a good bird dog?” he asked. “Pick the one that’s the friskiest. . . . You get the pick of the litter and you got yourself a pretty good bird dog. Well, we’ve got the pick of every donor civilization on the planet.”

But if Republicans think King is a fruitcake, they don’t show it on the House floor, where last month they approved, along party lines, an amendment King offered that would force the Obama administration to resume deportation of the DREAMers who immigrated as children. “If this position holds, no amnesty will reach the president’s desk,” the congressman said in a celebratory statement after the vote.

1 of 171 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Republicans View Photos A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Caption A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Tom Toles Wait 1 second to continue.

And King’s position is holding. Boehner, responding to House conservatives, is refusing to take up the Senate legislation. Because he has chosen a strategy of passing legislation through the House without Democratic votes, the speaker can’t afford to lose more than a handful of Republicans. This empowers “outliers” such as King.

“The reason we’re in a bottleneck here in Congress is because of a few like him,” Rep. Rubén Hinojosa (D-Tex.), chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, told me Wednesday afternoon at a caucus event outside the Capitol. “Evidently there’s enough to be able to force the speaker of the House to stall and not be able to do this immigration reform.”

Republicans say their objections to the immigration bill have nothing to do with racial or ethnic discrimination, and that’s surely the case for most of them. But King makes it easy for Democrats to tar the Republicans with sinister motives. Rep. Ben Luján (D-N.M.), one of several speakers denouncing King on the House floor Wednesday, said his slur shows why “the American people continue to see House Republicans as out of touch.”

That’s not quite fair. But when one of their own is talking about cantaloupe calves, Republicans aren’t in a strong position to complain about cherry-picking.

http://news.yahoo.com/ted-cruz-filibuster-obamacare-194126361.html,,[],Why Ted Cruz will spend the rest of the day speaking on the Senate floor about Obamacare,"In a Capitol Hill hallway leading to the Senate floor on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had just finished telling reporters that no Republican would delay a vote to fund the government. But then Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, carrying a stack of papers under his arm, strolled past him toward the door of the chamber.



Cruz turned his head toward the gaggle of reporters around Reid and walked through the doors onto the floor, where he stopped at his desk on the far-right corner of the room.

“I intend to speak about defunding Obamacare until I am unable to stand,” he declared.

With his colleague Utah Sen. Mike Lee on his left and an aide on his right, Cruz began what is expected to be an hourslong speech that could last late into the night about the importance of gutting the federal health care law that President Barack Obama signed in 2010.

Cruz’s move has all the looks of an old-fashioned filibuster, but it’s technically just a very long speech that will draw attention and focus to his cause. In this case, he will be delaying a vote on a bill to fund the government that, when the Democrat-controlled Senate is finished with it, will include funding for the health care law, but he won't derail it. According to Reid's spokesman Adam Jentleson, Cruz ""negotiated the terms"" of his speech with the Democratic majority leader before taking the floor.



Congress must approve a bill that sets federal spending rates by Oct. 1, or the government will shut down. For months, Cruz and a small group of conservative Republicans have called on their party to refuse to fund the government unless spending on the president's signature domestic policy win is stripped, even if it means shutting down the government.



Among Republicans in the upper chamber, there aren't many takers.

At about the same time that Cruz began his speech, Senate Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who doesn’t support the Texas lawmaker's filibuster-esque strategy, voiced clear disapproval with the delay tactic. Without Cruz’s objection, Senate Republicans could have given up their time to debate the funding bill, which would have sped up the voting process.

Story continues

Because Cruz chose to use up most of that time, the Senate won’t be able to return its version of the funding bill back to the House until Sunday night — just a day before the shutdown deadline — eliminating the leverage House Republicans might have had in the debate.

“It would be to the advantage to our colleagues in the House who are in the majority to shorten the process, and if the majority leader were to ask us to shorten the process, I would not object,” McConnell told reporters in the first moments of Cruz’s speech. “I don’t know who else in the conference may feel differently. But I do know that if the House doesn’t get what we send over until Monday, they’re in a pretty tough spot.”

When House lawmakers return to Capitol Hill that day, they will be asked to vote on what the Senate has sent them: a government spending bill that includes funding for Obamacare. They will have a choice to whether pass the bill as is, or change it and send it back to the Senate and risk a shutdown.

If the bar for success is actually defunding Obamacare, Cruz's effort is almost sure to fail. Senate Democrats and the president have made clear they will not approve any legislation that defunds the law, even if it means bringing the nation to the brink of a shutdown.

But that’s really not the point.

By making himself into a stalwart on the issue who is at odds with members of his own party on the approach, Cruz is setting himself up to be a hero of the party’s conservative base who want lawmakers to eliminate the health care law at all costs.

To that end, Cruz’s exercise will be a success."

(CNN) —

In a recent interview on Ketchikan Public Radio in Alaska, Rep. Don Young, the state’s only congressman, offered this unhelpful tidbit:

“My father had a ranch; we used to have 50-60 wet—- to pick tomatoes. It takes two people to pick the same tomatoes now. It’s all done by machine.”

There it is – the equivalent of what Groucho Marx used to call “the secret word.” It’s a word that is so offensive that I won’t say or write it in the long form – although many people do so freely, which is a problem.

Just as Americans have been conditioned to refer to the “n-word” as a sanitized alternative to the filthy and hurtful long-form version, so we too should start referring to the “w-word” when describing that ethnic slur used to describe Mexican immigrants who came here, shall we say, without proper documents.

I started this crusade in April 2007 with a column for CNN.com. In it, I pointed out that the w-word is used with reckless abandon by right-wing cable talk show hosts but also left-wing journalists and celebrities. I couldn’t imagine these folks using the long form of the n-word even if they were merely repeating what someone else had said. Yet they did not hesitate to use the w-word.

This tells us at least two things.

One, for many Americans, the w-word isn’t as ugly or offensive as the n-word.

And two, in the minds of the uninformed, Mexicans and Mexican-Americans in the Southwest don’t have the same legacy of racism, discrimination and mistreatment that affected African-Americans.

The experiences aren’t identical, of course. But given that Mexicans in states such as California, Arizona and Texas endured Jim Crow-style segregation, job discrimination, inferior public schools, lynchings and hate crimes and repression by racist law enforcement organizations, there are similarities.

Liberals couldn’t wait to pounce on Young’s remarks, spreading the word (literally) and making sure the media knew that – gasp! – a Republican congressman had referred to Mexican immigrants using the w-word. For Democrats, who are used to getting Hispanic votes without having to earn them and want to keep it that way by pointing out how bad Republicans are, it was like Christmas in springtime.

It didn’t help the GOP that Young was clueless about what he done wrong. After the first round of criticism, the lawmaker tried to brush off the controversy by saying only that he had “used a term that was commonly used during my days growing up on a farm in Central California” and that he “meant no disrespect.”

That’s funny. I grew up around farms in Central California. And, I can tell you, that term is all about disrespect.

After fellow Republicans blasted Young for his comments and demanded that he apologize, the congressman swallowed his pride. In a statement, Young wrote: “I apologize for the insensitive term I used during an interview in Ketchikan, Alaska. There was no malice in my heart or intent to offend; it was a poor choice of words. That word, and the negative attitudes that come with it, should be left in the 20th century, and I’m sorry that this has shifted our focus away from comprehensive immigration reform.”

If Young’s comments did shift the focus, it wasn’t for long.

Over the weekend, business groups and organized labor signaled a major breakthrough on the road to comprehensive immigration reform when they announced they had finally struck a deal on guest worker visas, a major obstacle. All that remains now is for the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” to unveil their bipartisan legislation by their April 8 deadline.

I’m glad to see Republicans jumped on Young for his comments. But where is this outrage when other GOP lawmakers flirt with ethnic demagoguery?

And what about Democrats? They were in such a hurry to condemn Young for using the w-word that they missed the fact that they were repeating the word over and over again, which suggests either that they’re tone deaf or that they weren’t as offended as they pretended to be.

What we learn is that while leadership on matters of race and ethnicity is hard to find in either party, political opportunism is alive and well.

Let’s face it. Americans are not good when it comes to condemning the loaded language of race and ethnicity. We’re not careful. We’re not consistent. And we’re not sincere. It’s part of an overall breakdown in civility in our society and how dismissive we have become of anyone who raises concern. We’re too mean, too childish, too petty and too personal.

Just look at the shameful way that MSNBC commentator Toure Neblett recently lit into Dr. Ben Carson, a pediatric neurosurgeon and black conservative who has been critical of President Barack Obama. Toure all but called Carson an Uncle Tom, insisting that this accomplished individual who spoke his mind was Republicans’ token “black friend” because he helps white people “assuage their guilt.”

It’s never a good idea for one person of color to assess the authenticity of another – especially if it’s just for ratings.

Carson likewise stepped in it when he offered his opinion on gay marriage by drawing comparisons that were harsh and inappropriate.

During a recent interview on Fox News Channel, he said this: “Well, my thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman. It’s a well-established, fundamental pillar of society and no group, be they gays, be they NAMBLA, be they people who believe in bestiality. It doesn’t matter what they are. They don’t get to change the definition.”

Insisting that marriage be defined in a certain way is fine. Equating same-sex marriage with behavior that society has declared deviant and criminal is not.

It turns out that elected officials aren’t the only ones who sometimes cross the line with their words and should apologize for it.

Nearly 700 people have been arrested in the “Moral Monday” demonstrations, as they are known. But the bad news keeps on coming from the Legislature, and pretty soon a single day of the week may not be enough to contain the outrage.

In January, after the election of Pat McCrory as governor, Republicans took control of both the executive and legislative branches for the first time since Reconstruction. Since then, state government has become a demolition derby, tearing down years of progress in public education, tax policy, racial equality in the courtroom and access to the ballot.

The cruelest decision by lawmakers went into effect last week: ending federal unemployment benefits for 70,000 residents. Another 100,000 will lose their checks in a few months. Those still receiving benefits will find that they have been cut by a third, to a maximum of $350 weekly from $535, and the length of time they can receive benefits has been slashed from 26 weeks to as few as 12 weeks.

The state has the fifth-highest unemployment rate in the country, and many Republicans insulted workers by blaming their joblessness on generous benefits. In fact, though, North Carolina is the only state that has lost long-term federal benefits, because it did not want to pay back $2.5 billion it owed to Washington for the program. The State Chamber of Commerce argued that cutting weekly benefits would be better than forcing businesses to pay more in taxes to pay off the debt, and lawmakers blindly went along, dropping out of the federal program."

Headlines like, ""House freshman calls NAACP chief 'racist' in email"", ""Extremist Hate Group NAACP wants Robert E. Lee’s picture taken down in Florida"" (I'm not linking to the hate site that houses this gem) abound, and whoever the current head of both the national (currently Benjamin Jealous, whose dad is white) or local NAACP groups is at the time, they are the target of warped Teapublican poutrages.

Other newer organizations, like the Southern Poverty Law Center, garner their fair share of sewage from both racists and anti-semites alike, since they were founded by Morris Dees (who is not Jewish but is attacked as if he is), and Joseph J. Levin, Jr.

I'm a card-carrying member of the NAACP and have always been fascinated by its history.



The Birth of the NAACP The Race Riot of 1908 in Abraham Lincoln's hometown of Springfield, Illinois had highlighted the urgent need for an effective civil rights organization in the U.S. This event is often cited as the catalyst for the formation of the NAACP. Mary White Ovington, journalist William English Walling and Henry Moskowitz met in New York City in January 1909 and the NAACP was born. Solicitations for support went out to more than 60 prominent Americans, and a meeting date was set for February 12, 1909. This was intended to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the birth of President Abraham Lincoln, who emancipated enslaved African Americans. While the meeting did not take place until three months later, this date is often cited as the founding date of the organization. The NAACP was founded on February 12, 1909 by a diverse group composed of W. E. B. Du Bois, Ida B. Wells, Archibald Grimké, Henry Moskowitz, Mary White Ovington, Oswald Garrison Villard, William English Walling (the last son of a former slave-holding family),Florence Kelley, a social reformer and friend of Du Bois, and Charles Edward Russell, a renowned muckraker and close friend of Walling who helped plan the NAACP and served as acting chairman of the National Negro Committee (1909), a forerunner to the NAACP. On May 30, 1909, the Niagara Movement conference took place at New York City's Henry Street Settlement House, from which an organization of more than 40 individuals emerged, calling itself the National Negro Committee. Du Bois played a key role in organizing the event and presided over the proceedings. Also in attendance was African-American journalist and anti-lynching crusader Ida B. Wells-Barnett. At its second conference on May 30, 1910, members chose as the organization's name the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and elected its first officers, who were: National President, Moorfield Storey, Boston

Chairman of the Executive Committee, William English Walling

Treasurer, John E. Milholland (a Lincoln Republican and Presbyterian from New York)

Disbursing Treasurer, Oswald Garrison Villard

Executive Secretary, Frances Blascoer

Director of Publicity and Research, Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois.



Much to the surprise of many not familiar with this history, many of these founders were white. Though I spent years studying black history with W.E.B. Dubois and Ida Wells-Barnett as two of my favorite subjects, it wasn't until later in my studies that I focused on any of the white founders. I'll feature two of them here today.

NAACP founding member Mary White Ovington

Mary White Ovington was born April 11, 1865 in Brooklyn, New York. Her parents, members of the Unitarian Church were supporters of women's rights and had been involved in anti-slavery movement. Educated at Packer Collegiate Institute and Radcliffe College, Ovington became involved in the campaign for civil rights in 1890 after hearing Frederick Douglass speak in a Brooklyn church. In 1895 she helped found the Greenpoint Settlement in Brooklyn. Appointed head of the project the following year, Ovington remained until 1904 when she was appointed fellow of the Greenwich House Committee on Social Investigations. Over the next five years she studied employment and housing problems in black Manhattan. During her investigations she met W.E.B. Du Bois and was introduced to the founding members of the Niagara Movement. ...On September 3, 1908 she read an article written by Republican William English Walling, also a Liberal, entitled ""Race War in the North"" in The Independent. Walling described a massive race riot directed at black residents in the hometown of Abraham Lincoln, Springfield, Illinois that led to seven deaths, the destruction of 40 homes and 24 businesses, and 107 indictments against rioters. Walling ended the article by calling for a powerful body of citizens to come to the aid of blacks. Ovington responded to the article by writing Walling and meeting at his apartment in New York City along with social worker Dr. Henry Moskowitz. The group decided to launch a campaign by issuing a call for a national conference on the civil and political rights of African-Americans on the centennial of Lincoln’s birthday, February 12, 1909... After the war, Ovington served the NAACP as board member, executive secretary and chairman. The NAACP fought a long legal battle against segregation and racial discrimination in housing, education, employment, voting and transportation. They appealed to the Supreme Court to rule that several laws passed by southern states were unconstitutional and won three important judgments between 1915-1923 concerning voting rights and housing...Ovington retired as a board member of the NAACP in 1947, ending 38 years of service with the organization. She died on July 15, 1951.

William English Walling, Chairman of NAACP Executive Committee (1910–1911)

William English Walling (1877–1936) (known as ""English"" to friends and family) was an American labor reformer and Socialist Republican born in Louisville, Kentucky. He was the grandson of William Hayden English, the Democratic candidate for vice president in 1880, and was born into wealth. He was educated at the University of Chicago and at Harvard Law School. He was a co-founder of the NAACP, and founded the National Women's Trade Union League in 1903. In 1906, following a trip to Russia to report on the abortive Russian Revolution of 1905 he married Anna Strunsky, a Jewish immigrant and an aspiring novelist from San Francisco. In 1908 he published Russia's Message, a book inspired by the social unrest he and his wife had observed in Russia. In 1908 Walling and his wife went to Springfield, Illinois to investigate a race riot. As a result of their investigations, Walling wrote an article The Race War in the North for the September 3 issue of The Independent, in which he stated, “the spirit of the abolitionists, of Lincoln and Lovejoy, must be revived and we must come to treat the negro on a plane of absolute political and capitalist equality.” He also appealed for a “large and powerful body of citizens to come to their aid.” The article directly led to the founding of the NAACP.

So here we have two staunch anti-racists who helped found an anti-racist organization 104 years ago. Clearly not anti-white. But let's fast forward to today. Though the NAACP does not keep racial demographics for its membership, and yes, a majority are black Americans, NAACP membership is open to all. The current head of the Aiken County, South Carolina Branch of the NAACP, Phillip Howell , is white. There are also local chapter heads who are Latino.

I always find it odd that no one on the right has ever accused me of being ""anti-black"" because of my membership to a whole range of mainly ""white"" organizations over the years, from the ACLU to the AARP. In fact, no one ever calls them ""white"" groups at all, they are just ""groups,"" because white is the norm that needs no descriptor in our society, one must add an adjective to describe anything else.

I've voted for white presidents and white senators, attended mostly white colleges and universities, with the exception of Howard University in Washington, D.C. Howard, due to its history and founding purpose, is ""a historically black college"" (HBCU), which of course obfuscates the fact it has over the years graduated white students, especially from the medical school during a time when Ivy League med schools had a Jewish quota. Howard was founded by a white man—Oliver O. Howard, for whom it is named. I remember having a conversation with Harris Wofford during the time he was the president of SUNY Old Westbury, before he became a senator from Pennsylvania. He mentioned having attended Howard Law school.

The history of the civil rights movement in this country is one that has been forged out of the activism of people of all backgrounds. I'm always surprised when people question me about my former membership in the Black Panther Party, assuming it was anti-white, simply because of it having ""black"" in the name, and its militancy. Yet anyone familiar with the history of the Rainbow Coalition forged by Fred Hampton knows that to be a lie as well.

So next time you encounter someone, online or in real life, spreading faux propaganda about the NAACP or any anti-racist group, hit them with the facts.

Better still, if you are white, why not join me in becoming a card-carrying NAACP member. Then you can show them your ""card"" for real."

Cepeda: With Hispanics, Mitt Romney hasn’t learned his lesson","CHICAGO — Mitt Romney is back — and so is his foot.

As reported in The Wall Street Journal, Romney is planning on re-emerging in ways that will “help shape national priorities,” such as assisting the Republican Party as it tries to regain its footing with the non-white voters who ignored the GOP standard-bearer at the polls in 2012.

Yes, the man known for favoring the term “self-deportation” and offending scores of Hispanics by using the word “illegals” over and over again during prime-time presidential debates wants to give Republicans advice on reaching out to minorities.

Romney told the Journal that in addition to wishing his campaign had poured more money into ads targeting Hispanic voters, the GOP needs “to translate our message in a way that minorities understand.”

Honestly, of all the slips Romney committed during last year’s campaign — from letting his staffers tell Spanish-language media that he was struggling with Latinos because they were simply not well-informed to never calling out his fellow Republicans for using degrading language when speaking about immigrants or Hispanics — this latest is probably the most insulting.

1 of 171 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Republicans View Photos A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Caption A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Tom Toles Wait 1 second to continue.

Some Latino advocates spent the year leading up to the election painting him as a racist for not compromising on his views toward illegal immigration. But I always thought his biggest failure as a candidate was his inability to connect with people who aren’t rich and privileged. His terrible tone-deafness for non-whites was a close second.

Let’s unpack his recent comment starting with the tricky, loaded word “translate.” My first impression was that Romney used the word because he, like so many others, still believes that most Hispanics can’t speak English.

Can someone please get this man on the Pew Hispanic Center’s email list? Almost two-thirds of Hispanics report speaking only English, or speaking it very well, according to the nonpartisan research organization.

That sounds touchy, you say? Well, what else could he have meant? The GOP’s 2012 platform said the party wanted to “rebuild the economy and create jobs, reform government to serve the people and build healthy families, great schools and safe neighborhoods.” These concepts don’t need to be broken down into some simplified code so minorities can make sense of them.

And this is the second hot button Romney’s statement pushes. Did he not hear about how a leading Republican think tank, the Heritage Foundation, ticked off Latinos when it became known that an anti-immigration reform study was co-authored by a researcher who had authored a Harvard Ph.D. dissertation contending Hispanics have particularly low IQs?

A mere month after that deeply offensive controversy is not the time to imply that minorities have a hard time comprehending the basic tenets of an organization’s values and need special help to understand.

Actually, it’s Republicans such as Phyllis Schlafly and Pat Buchanan — who have suggested that what the GOP really needs is to double-down on white voters and lamented that “white folks are losing interest in politics and voting” — who need someone to translate for them.

Ann Telnaes animation: Ann Romney reflects on her husband’s election defeat. (Ann Telnaes/The Washington Post)

Schlafly, Buchanan and others who find it silly that some Republicans think immigration reform will send Latino voters into the arms of the GOP aren’t wrong to be skeptical about such a proposition. It’s a long shot at best and Republicans are better off banking on the fact that Latinos care more about education, the economy, health care and the federal budget deficit than immigration.

But Hispanics, as with all minority voters, do care greatly about being treated with respect, which is exactly the top concern that the Republican National Committee outlined in their December 2012 treatise, “The Growth and Opportunity Project.”

In plain English, it calls on the Republican Party to “stop talking to itself,” change the “perception that the GOP does not care about people” and begin to “engage [ethnic minority voters] and show our sincerity.”

As the RNC points out, America now looks different and the GOP simply needs to deal with it in a civil manner. The report quotes tea party leader Dick Armey on the topic of tone: “You can’t call someone ugly and expect them to go to the prom with you.”

See? That’s great advice. And here’s some for Romney: If you want to help the Republicans with their Hispanic and minority outreach, just write some checks and stay out of earshot.

Negroponte, a former diplomat and director of national intelligence under George W. Bush. “Maybe if there are more prosecutions, it will.”

But critics argue that the Cartwright case, and now the appeals court ruling, show how the antileak campaign has gone too far, producing a chilling effect on news gathering without deterring leakers. Mr. Snowden has said he was inspired by the deeds of Pfc. Bradley Manning, who is facing a court-martial after divulging the diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks.

“I think it has gotten away from them,” said Morton H. Halperin, who served in national security or diplomatic positions in three previous administrations. “If the president doesn’t fix this, I think his claim that he understands the importance of balancing the First Amendment against claims of national security will lack any credibility.”

Implicitly at least, Mr. Holder seemed to acknowledge some of the criticism this month when he restored and bolstered longstanding Justice Department restraints on seeking evidence from journalists. He said those restrictions “will help ensure the proper balance is struck when pursuing investigations into unauthorized disclosures.”

Mr. Holder’s move came in response to a torrent of criticism after the revelations this spring that prosecutors had secretly subpoenaed the phone logs for more than 20 phone lines of The Associated Press in one leak inquiry and two days of phone logs of a Fox News reporter, James Rosen, in another investigation aimed at a State Department adviser, Stephen Jin-Woo Kim. Prosecutors also obtained a court-ordered search warrant for Mr. Rosen’s e-mails by identifying him as a criminal co-conspirator of Mr. Kim’s.

But Mr. Holder’s conciliatory message was seemingly undermined by the Justice Department’s success in overturning a lower court’s ruling that a reporter for The New York Times, James Risen, had a First Amendment right to refuse to reveal his sources in the trial of a former C.I.A. analyst, Jeffrey Sterling. Mr. Sterling was charged in 2010 with disclosing classified information to Mr. Risen about a covert operation to deceive Iranian scientists described in Mr. Risen’s 2006 book, “State of War.”"

USA TODAY

President Obama did something relatively unusual Thursday -- he issued 13 pardons.

That brings Obama's total to 52 pardons during his presidency, still far behind recent successors George W. Bush (189), Bill Clinton (396), Ronald Reagan (393), Jimmy Carter (534), Gerald Ford (382), and Richard Nixon (863), according to statistics compiled by Mark Knoller of CBS News.

Obama could catch President George H.W. Bush, who issued 74 pardons, though he served only one term.

The current president also announced eight commutations on Thursday, all involving a dispute over past sentencing disparities between cases involving crack cocaine and powder cocaine.

The pardon list:

“You know, sometimes stuff doesn’t work when you want it to. We’ve certainly had plenty of mistakes and things that haven’t worked the way that we want to,” Zuckerberg said of Facebook’s website when asked by ABC News about Obamacare’s website failure. “The right thing here is just to keep on focusing on building the service that you think is right in the long term.”

In the interview, Zuckerberg attempted to frame granting amnesty to America’s at least 11 million illegal aliens as a “civil rights issue”–a talking point used by Attorney General Eric Holder earlier this year.

“When you meet these children who are really talented, and they’ve grown up in America and they really don’t know any other country besides that, but they don’t have the opportunities that… we all enjoy, it’s really heartbreaking–right? That seems like it’s one of the biggest civil rights issues of our time,” Zuckerberg said. “There are a lot of misconceptions about that… and a lot of them came here because they just want to work. They want to help out their families and they want to contribute.”

Zuckerberg alluded in the interview that his goal in pushing for amnesty is to get tech workers from abroad for his company, rather than hiring Americans for jobs at Facebook.

“The future of our economy is a knowledge economy,” Zuckerberg said. “And that means that getting the most talented people into this country is the most important thing that we can do to make sure that the companies of tomorrow are founded here.”

Zuckerberg’s interview came as he and a group of illegal aliens last week conducted a “hackathon” to push for amnesty.

“One of the things that the ‘dreamers’ here today show is that even if, you know, you’re a child of someone who came here who wouldn’t be considered one of the higher-skilled workers… you can be one of the entrepreneurs of tomorrow,” Zuckerberg said of the hackathon. “That’s the American dream.”

Zuckerberg was asked, too, about how thus far amnesty efforts have been stalled in Congress, despite all the money he has spent through FWD.us and other lobbyists have spent through their respective outfits pushing to create support in Washington for comprehensive immigration reform. He said he still thinks there is a possibility an amnesty could be passed into law.

“I’m fundamentally an optimistic person, as an entrepreneur,” he said. “The vast majority of Americans want this to happen.”

Zuckerberg has relaunched advertising efforts to push for an immigration bill out of the House this Congress."

Follow Her On Twitter']",Hollywood supporters turn on Obama administration over NSA data mining allegations,"Revelations that the National Security Agency (NSA) has been secretly logging the phone and Internet activity of millions of Americans has caused a rift between President Obama and several of his Hollywood supporters.

Actor and liberal activist John Cusack tweaked the administration, tweeting “Prism the name for electronic prison – all have to wear lojacks,” in reference to the PRISM data mining program revealed in leaks by former NSA employee Edward Snowden last week.

Cusack also re-tweeted “Obama is becoming the next Nixon.”

Prominent writer/director Judd Apatow of “Knocked Up” fame also took to Twitter to blast the administration: “What is this, North Korea? We are so inundated with so much info and so many problems – we have given up caring.""

Apatow also drew attention to reports on the scandal, calling it ""an outrageous breach of the privacy and rights of American citizens.”

Liberal filmmaker Michael Moore also hopped on the bandwagon, tweeting “the administration has now lost all credibility” while spotlighting a 2007 Obama quote: “that means no more illegal wiretapping of American citizens. No more (spying) on citizens... No more tracking citizens...""

Some media critics called the celebrities' about face a welcome change.

“I am encouraged to see the Hollywood left is starting to dish out some bipartisan criticism. Now, the NSA scandal under the Obama administration has many feeling betrayed by a Democrat who promised more transparency and less intrusion,” political blogger and author Thomas Moyer told FOX411 Pop Tarts column. “Further, it hits a lot closer to home when you find out that your personal phone records are being monitored, something that scares a lot of people.”

But some left-leaners in Hollywood had no problem with the administration's reported actions. Liberal comedian and HBO host Bill Maher praised both the tapping, and Obama’s handling of the growing scandal, during his program Friday night.

“I’m okay with it now that Obama is in office. I’m kind of trusting of him,” he said. “We live in a world of nuclear weapons. And there are religious fanatics who would love to get one and set if off here… The fact that a city can be demolished in one second kinda tips the scale for me. I’m not saying to look into your emails is the right thing, I’m just saying, I’m not gonna pretend it’s ‘cause I’m brave, it’s ‘cause I’m scared.”

And Chrissy Teigen, best known for posing in swimsuits for Sports Illustrated and being engaged to singer John Legend, also dismissed the issue on Monday.

“On NSA: I’m most shocked you’re shocked,” she wrote. “Although I understand why you’re upset, I personally could not care less.”

The Guardian broke the story late Wednesday that the federal government was collecting phone call records from Verizon customers.

The Guardian and the Washington Post followed with a series of reports about the calls being taken from other telecommunications companies and that the NSA and FBI have a Internet scouring program, code-named PRISM, that records Internet activities, all part of a post-9/11 effort to thwart terrorism."

There is no question that rank-and-file gay couples of all political stripes are sincere in their desire to enjoy the benefits and status that come with marriage. There is no sinister agenda at work in the issue of same-sex marriage among the masses. But the same cannot be said of the organized left who have always intended to use the issue of gay marriage as a vehicle to destroy the Christian Church and marginalize Christians.

Faithfulness to the Bible and the Christian faith will very soon be declared bigotry by the media and a de facto civil rights violation by the State.

What is currently happening to the Boy Scouts of America at the hands of the organized left is nothing more than a trial run for what is surely coming next against the Church. The small ball has already begun: lawsuits, harassment, and media campaigns against those who preach what the Bible says. The Big Leagues, however, don’t launch until the State lights the torchfor the witch hunt, and that has already happened in the state of Washington.

Although America’s most protected right is freedom of religion, that didn’t stop the state attorney general from filing a suit against Baronelle Stutzman, a florist who said it was a “violation of conscience” to service a same-sex wedding.

JD Bristol, attorney for Arlene’s, said his client has many customers and employees who are gay and the claim that she is “discriminating on the basis on sexual orientation is nonsense.”

“This is about gay marriage, it’s not about a person being gay,” Bristol said. “She has a conscientious objection to homosexual marriage, not homosexuality. It violates her conscience.”

According to the florist, in response to standing by her Christian beliefs, she has received hate mail and threats to burn down her business.

This is not an isolated incident, either. Back in February a baker who wouldn’t provide a cake for a lesbian wedding not only faced protesters but is (or was) under investigation by the Oregon Attorney General. Back in 2006, a Catholic adoption service in Boston had to shut down after the government demanded the religious entity service same-sex couples.

For those skeptical of the organized left’s desire to destroy the Church; one question: is it really a leap to believe that the same government currently attempting to force the Church and other religious business-owners to pay for the abortion pill will soon use the same arguments and precedents to force same sex marriage on these institutions?

I will not tolerate it.” (The Washington Post)

In a press conference Monday, President Obama addressed the Internal Revenue Service’s targeting of groups critical of government, and said, “I’ve got no patience with it. I will not tolerate it.” (The Washington Post)

Internal Revenue Service officials in Washington and at least two other offices were involved with investigating conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status, making clear that the effort reached well beyond the branch in Cincinnati that was initially blamed, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post.

IRS officials at the agency’s Washington headquarters sent queries to conservative groups asking about their donors and other aspects of their operations, while officials in the El Monte and Laguna Niguel offices in California sent similar questionnaires to tea-party-affiliated groups, the documents show.

IRS employees in Cincinnati told conservatives seeking the status of “social welfare” groups that a task force in Washington was overseeing their applications, according to interviews with the activists.

Lois G. Lerner, who oversees tax-exempt groups for the IRS, told reporters Friday that the “absolutely inappropriate” actions were undertaken by “front-line people” working in Cincinnati to target groups with “tea party,” “patriot” or “9/12” in their names.

In one instance, however, Ron Bell, an IRS employee, informed a lawyer representing a conservative group focused on voter fraud that the application was under review in Washington. On several other occasions, IRS officials in Washington and California sent conservative groups detailed questionnaires about their voter outreach and other activities, according to the documents.

View Graphic A report due this week says the IRS targeted groups with names containing “tea party” and “patriot.”

“For the IRS to say it was some low-level group in Cincinnati is simply false,” said Cleta Mitchell, a partner in the law firm Foley & Lardner who sought to communicate with IRS headquarters about the delay in granting tax-exempt status to True the Vote.

Moreover, details of the IRS’s efforts to target conservative groups reached the highest levels of the agency in May 2012, far earlier than has been disclosed, according to Republican congressional aides briefed by the IRS and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration ­(TIGTA) on the details of their reviews.

Then-Commissioner Douglas Shulman, a George W. Bush appointee who stepped down in November, received a briefing from the TIGTA about what was happening in the Cincinnati office in May 2012, the aides said. His deputy and the agency’s current acting commissioner, Steven T. Miller, also learned about the matter that month, the aides said.

The officials did not share details with Republican lawmakers who had been demanding to know whether the IRS was targeting conservative groups, Republicans said.

“I wrote to the IRS three times last year after hearing concerns that conservative groups were being targeted,” Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (Utah), the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement Monday. “In response to the first letter I sent with some of my colleagues, Steven Miller, the current Acting IRS Commissioner, responded that these groups weren’t being targeted.”

“Knowing what we know now,” he added, “the IRS was at best being far from forth coming, or at worst, being deliberately dishonest with Congress.”

As new details emerged Monday, Democrats and Republicans alike decried the agency’s actions as an unacceptable abuse of power.

In a news conference Monday, President Obama said he learned of the investigating in media reports on Friday and has “no patience with it.”

“If in fact IRS personnel engaged in the kind of practices that have been reported on, and were intentionally targeting conservative groups, then that’s outrageous,” Obama said. “And there’s no place for it. And they have to be held fully accountable.”

White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Monday that the White House counsel’s office learned of an upcoming IRS inspector general’s report on April 22 as part of a routine notification but had not received access to the report.

On Capitol Hill, two Senate panels — the Finance Committee and the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations — announced Monday that they will investigate. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and the Ways and Means Committee have been looking into reports of IRS attempts to single out organizations on the right for heightened scrutiny. Ways and Means has called IRS officials to testify Friday.

“These actions by the IRS are an outrageous abuse of power and a breach of the public’s trust,” said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.). “The IRS will now be the ones put under additional scrutiny.”

Separately, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio) introduced companion bills Monday that would require the IRS to fire any employee found “willfully” violating “the constitutional rights of a taxpayer,” according to statements by both lawmakers. The bills also would make them criminally liable for their actions.

Even as Obama vowed that his administration “will make sure that we find out exactly what happened on this,” however, the IRS offered no new information on how it selected which groups to single out for scrutiny.

The White House is legally barred from contacting the IRS about a tax matter, under a prohibition adopted after the Watergate scandal. And although it can contact the Treasury Department about tax issues, neither Treasury nor the IRS can disclose specific taxpayer information. The IRS can release information about a petition for tax-

exempt status only after it has been approved.

Obama is not in a position to remove Lerner, a career official who can be terminated for cause only under normal civil service proceedings. The IRS has two political appointees: the commissioner, who serves a five-year term, and the chief counsel.

As the IRS came under broader political attack Monday, more details surfaced on how the exempt-organizations division struggled to determine which nonprofits should receive “social welfare” status after the 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling. That decision, which allowed corporations and unions to raise and spend un­limited amounts of money on elections, opened the door for groups to accept undisclosed contributions as long as their “primary purpose” was not politics.

In a Jan. 9, 2012, letter to the Richmond Tea Party, IRS specialist Stephen Seok asked questions including “the names of the donors, contributors and grantors,” as well as the size of the contributions and grants, and when they were given.



Richmond Tea Party President Larry Nordvig, whose group applied for tax-exempt status in December 2009 and received it in July 2012, said the extended inquiry had “a very chilling effect” on how much money the group could raise because its donors preferred anonymity.

The Wetumpka Tea Party of Alabama experienced a two-year delay after submitting its initial application.

Becky Gerritson, a 44-year-old stay-at-home mother and the group’s president, said the IRS sent a questionnaire asking for the names of all volunteers, donor identification and contribution amounts, the names of any legislators its members had communicated with directly or indirectly, and the contents of all speeches its members had made, among a long list of other details.

“I was outraged,” Gerritson said. “Being an election year, I felt like it was intimidation.”

The group did not provide the information. Approval came only after the group sought help from the American Center for Law and Justice, which threatened a lawsuit against the IRS, Gerritson said.

Although some of the groups were explicitly labeled “tea party” or “patriot,” others that came under intense scrutiny were focused on challenging the Affordable Care Act — known by many as Obamacare — or the integrity of federal elections.

In a June 3, 2011, letter to the IRS, Mitchell questioned the agency’s motivations for delaying recognition of one of her clients who had filed nearly two years earlier, writing, “Is the [group’s] opposition to Obamacare and the takeover of America’s healthcare system by the government the reason that this application has been held up and not approved?”

Catherine Engelbrecht, president of the Houston-based True the Vote, first filed for tax-exempt status in July 2010. At one point, Engelbrecht — who is still awaiting a determination from the IRS regarding her voting rights organization and a separate tea party group, King Street Patriots — said an IRS employee informed her: “I’m just doing what Washington is telling me to do. I’m just asking what they want me to ask.”

The IRS did not respond to requests for comment Monday.

Welcome to Trayvongate, where the President of the United States used both the bully pulpit, the Department of Justice and sly media manipulation to gin up charges of racism in the George Zimmerman/Trayvon Martin shooting. Now that the trial is almost finished and the only act of racism mentioned so far came from the victim–Martin called Zimmerman ‘a creepy ass cracker’ according to testimony–the cynical and repeated use of the race card by the White house is even more abhorrent.

Judicial Watch revealed documents today that proved what Breitbart News reported in April, 2012: that Eric Holder’s Department of Justice took an active role in racially charged rallies in Sanford, Florida and that the Community Relations Service helped force the temporary resignation of Sheriff Bill Lee. That resignation made it appear that Sanford authorities were suspect and possibly complicit in covering up something.

Some of my reporting at the time was based on interviews with numerous public officials in Sanford who wanted to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution from the Obama administration. They described a situation where the CRS team took over and forced decisions while clearing a path for protests and rallies that heightened the appearence of racial tensions.

The CRS is a small unit within the Department of Justice and ostensibly it serves a legitimate purpose; attempting to cool down tense situation. As its website says:

The Community Relations Service is the Department’s “peacemaker” for community conflicts and tensions arising from differences of race, color, and national origin. Created by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, CRS is the only Federal agency dedicated to assist State and local units of government, private and public organizations, and community groups with preventing and resolving racial and ethnic tensions, incidents, and civil disorders, and in restoring racial stability and harmony.

However, under the highly politicized Holder Department of Justice, the CRS has acted as ‘spies and muscle’ according to a source familiar with the unit. In the Zimmerman case, they ended up as doing nothing to facilitate ‘racial stability and harmony ‘, instead acting a heavy thumb on the scales of justice and helping to force events that gave the nation an impression that Martin’s death was racially motivated.

Not just George Zimmerman, but the police and the entire town were targeted in rallies that saw people being bused-in for protests. We now have proof via the Judicial Watch release that these rallies were facilitated by the Obama administration. They were also highly racially charged. Close Obama ally Al Sharpton, along with Jesse Jackson, led the charge. As CBS Miami reported:

“We live in the middle of an American paradox,” Rev. Sharpton told the crowd. “We can put a black man in the White House but we cannot walk a black child through a gated neighborhood. We are not selling out, bowing out or backing down until there is justice for Trayvon.” “This is not about a hoodie, it’s about racial profiling,” Jackson said. “We will use our marching feet, civil disobedience and every weapon in our non-violent arsenal until justice is served.”

However, much of the rhetoric surrounding the Zimmerman story was violent. Many will remember that the New Black Panther party actually offered a $10,000 bounty for the ‘capture’ of George Zimmerman. As the Orlando Sentinal reported:

New Black Panther leader Mikhail Muhammad announced the reward during a protest in Sanford Saturday. And when asked whether he was inciting violence, Muhammad replied defiantly: “An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.” The bounty announcement came moments after members of the group called for the mobilization of 10,000 black men to capture Zimmerman, who shot Trayvon in a gated Sanford community on Feb. 26. Muhammad said members of his group would search for Zimmerman themselves in Maitland — where the 28-year old worked before the shooting, employees there told the Orlando Sentinel. He declined to say when the group would begin their search.

J. Christian Adams knows the New Black Panther Party well; he resigned his position at the DOJ over the refusal to prosecute the Panthers for the now infamous Philadephia voter intimidation actions during the 2008 election. Adams outlined the crimes committed by the NBPP in Sanford:

Let’s start with solicitation to kidnap. In announcing a reward for the seizure of Zimmerman, the New Black Panthers may have violated Florida Code 787.01. It makes it a felony to “by threat, confining or abducting, or imprisoning another person against his . . . will without lawful authority with intent to . . . terrorize.” Merely soliciting someone else to do this is also a felony in Florida under Florida Code 777.04. “A person who solicits another to commit an offense prohibited by law and in the course of such solicitation commands, encourages, hires, or requests another person to engage in specific conduct which would constitute such offense or an attempt to commit such offense commits the offense of criminal solicitation.”

That’s only part of the list. The New Black Panther’s outrageous, illegal call for vigilante justice happened on March 24th. According the records obtained by Judicial Watch, the Department of Justice deployed to Sanford the next day: March 25th, 2012. However, the DOJ did not go to Sanford to make arrests against the New Black Panthers. Instead, according the the written record, obtained by Judicial Watch, they “deployed to Sanford, FL, to work marches, demonstrations, and rallies related to the shooting and death of an African-American teen by a neighborhood watch captain.”

Once again, the Holder Department of Justice failed to prosecute the New Black Panther Party. They actually helped facilitate mass rallies against Zimmerman and the City of Sanford.

These actions are made even more scandalous by the direct insertion of the President of the United States into the story. President Obama made his famous “If I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon” remark at the White House, but what got considerably less press was the fact that Obama had a prior relationship with Martin’s attorney Benjamin Crump. Obama worked with him on another racially charged case when he was a Senator.

Breitbart News reported on the Obama connection to the 2006 story of Martin Lee Anderson. Attorney Crump said publicly that he was following the same media ‘playbook’ as the Anderson case. Tactics included using a photo of Anderson as a child, the same way the media used the Crump-supplied photo of Trayvon Martin as child. This story from 2006 shows the involvement of Senator Obama (who did not end up appearing at the rally), Sharpton and Jackson as well as other usual suspects from the far left.

A rally will be taking place in Tallahassee Friday, April 21 regarding the ongoing investigation into the death of 14-year-old Martin Lee Anderson. Anderson died Jan. 6 at a Panhandle boot camp after being kneed and punched by Bay County Sheriff’s boot camp guards. Students from Florida State University, Tallahassee Community College and Florida A&M University have been involved in the planning and organization of the event at which Rev. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton will be making appearances. Charlie and Martin Sheen, who donated $10,000 to the cause, are also reportedly planning to attend Friday, along with former TLC member Tionne “T-Boz” Watkins and Afeni Shakur, mother of the murdered rapper Tupac Shakur. According Samantha Greer, an FSU student and volunteer for the Coalition for Justice for Martin Lee Anderson, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois may also make an appearance. Greer stressed that the Coalition is still looking for volunteers and that anyone is welcome to join the cause.

What we saw in 2012 was the Obama administration using taxpayer resources to ratchet up racial tensions in a local crime case and literally creating key story points in the narrative, such as forcing the sheriff to temporarily resign. At the same time, the President himself made an emotional statement about the victim with direct reference to his race, without revealing that he had worked with the victim’s attorney a few years earlier in a similar case. At the same time, Obama media ally (and Sharpton employer) NBC outrageously edited the Zimmerman audio to make Zimmerman appear racist. All these manipulative and deceptive uses of the race card–pushed along by the Holder DOJ at taxpayer expense–happened just months before the 2012 presidential election.

The only reason this isn’t a major scandal already is the media hasn’t ever done its job and declared it one."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/07/06/IRS-Official-Lois-Lerner-Wants-Immunity-to-Testify-Before-Congress,2013-07-06 00:00:00,['Michael Patrick Leahy'],IRS Official Lois Lerner Wants Immunity to Testify Before Congress,"On Tuesday, William W. Taylor III, attorney for Lois Lerner, the IRS official at the center of the Tea Party targeting scandal who invoked her Fifth amendment rights before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on May 22, set forward his client’s hard line conditions to return and testify openly before the committee.

“They can obtain her testimony tomorrow by doing it the easy way … immunity. That’s the way to resolve all of this,” he told Politico.

Congressman Jim Jordan (R-OH), a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee was unimpressed. “We hope she comes in and gives us the truth and answers questions. If that doesn’t happen, then you cross the next bridge. … If she says, ‘No, I’m going to come in and assert my Fifth Amendment rights again and not going to speak,’ then you think about what the other options are.”

Legal experts have debated whether Ms. Lerner waived her fifth amendment rights when she delivered an opening statement declaring her innocence prior to invoking those rights. On June 28 in a 22-17 party line vote, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee ruled that she did waive her Fifth amendment rights with that opening statement.

Should Ms. Lerner continue to insist that she will not testify without full immunity, the next step in this battle of wills and legal tactics could be a vote by the full House of Representatives to determine if Ms. Lerner is in contempt of Congress. If the full House determines she is in contempt, a criminal rather than civil charge, Ms. Lerner could face jail time.

Ms. Lerner’s attorney appears unphased by the possibility his client could face contempt charges. “[N]obody likes to be held in contempt of Congress, of course, but the real question is one that we’re fairly confident about, and I don’t think any district judge in the country would hold that she waived.”

Should the House hold Ms. Lerner in contempt, it would be the responsibility of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, an employee of the Department of Justice, to prosecute the case. Since Attorney General Eric Holder, who runs the Department of Justice, has already experienced his own difficulties surrounding his testimony before the House of Representatives, it is unlikely, though not impossible, that the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia would pursue prosecution of any contempt charges coming out of the House.

The penalty for contempt of Congress is a fine of $1,000 and up to one year in jail."
http://news.yahoo.com/house-committee-grill-ousted-irs-chief-073050747.html,,[],House committee to grill ousted IRS chief,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Internal Revenue Service has refused to provide documents over the past two years to a congressional panel exploring whether the agency gave tougher scrutiny to tea party and other conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status, a leading Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee said Friday.

Rep. Charles Boustany Jr., R-La., spoke minutes before the committee was holding Congress' first hearing on the IRS's targeting of conservatives.

""We've asked for documents for two years now, and all we've gotten is stonewalling from the IRS,"" Boustany, who heads the Ways and Means oversight subcommittee, said on C-SPAN television.

""We need specific information about who made these decisions, why were these decisions made, why wasn't there proper oversight, what was the chain of command and who knew what,"" Boustany said, previewing questions lawmakers planned to pursue.

With the scandal joining a parade of political troubles buffeting President Barack Obama, the committee planned to question the agency's ousted chief, Steven Miller, on Friday.

Miller, acting director until he resigned Wednesday, seems sure to get a hostile reception. Members of both parties have spent the past week bitterly chastising the agency for abandoning its charge of making nonpolitical decisions about which groups should qualify for tax-exempt status, which makes it easier for them to collect contributions from donors.

Lawmakers have said that even though they asked the IRS repeatedly about complaints from conservative groups that their applications were being treated unfairly, the agency — including Miller — never told them the groups were being targeted. They said this continued even after May 2012, when the agency says Miller was briefed on the practice. Miller was previously a deputy commissioner whose portfolio included the unit that made decisions about tax-exempt status.

Also to testify Friday was J. Russell George, the Treasury Department's inspector general for tax administration.

Story continues

A report George issued this week concluded that the IRS office in Cincinnati, which screened applications for the tax exemptions, improperly singled out tea party and other conservative groups for tougher treatment. The report says the practice began in March 2010 and lasted more than 18 months.

Republicans have spent the past few days trying to link the IRS' improper scrutiny of conservatives to Obama. The president has said he didn't know about the targeting until last Friday, when Lois Lerner, who heads the IRS division that oversees tax-exempt groups, acknowledged at a legal conference that conservative groups had been singled out. She said it was wrong and apologized.

""I promise you this, that the minute I found out about it, then my main focus was making sure that we get the thing fixed,"" Obama said Thursday.

Even so, less than four months into his second term, the president has been on the defensive for the IRS controversy, along with questions about last September's attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans, and the government's seizure of The Associated Press' telephone records as part of a leaks investigation.

In one of the latest GOP attacks, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, wrote Obama on Thursday asking whether the White House or Treasury Department pressured the IRS on the treatment of conservative groups. In the letter, Portman accused the administration of ""policies that threaten to chill disfavored political speech.""

The inspector general's report said all IRS officials questioned said their actions ""were not influenced by any individual or organization outside the IRS.""

The report blamed ""ineffective management"" for letting IRS officials craft ""inappropriate criteria"" to review applications from tea party and other conservative groups, based on their names or political views. It found that the IRS took no action on many of the conservative groups' applications for tax-exempt status for long periods of time, hindering their fundraising for the 2010 and 2012 elections.

Many of the groups were applying for tax-exempt status as social welfare organizations, which are allowed to participate in campaign activity if that is not their primary activity. The IRS judges whether that imprecise standard is met.

Friday's hearing was just the start of Congress' probe of the IRS' actions, with the Senate Finance and House Oversight committees planning hearings next week.

In addition, Attorney General Eric Holder has said the FBI was investigating whether the IRS may have violated applicants' civil rights.

Obama has rejected the idea of naming a special prosecutor to investigate the episode, saying Thursday that the probes by Congress and the Justice Department would get to the bottom of who was responsible.

Obama has named Daniel Werfel, a top White House budget officer, to replace Miller.

Also Thursday, Joseph Grant, one of Miller's top deputies, announced plans to retire June 3, according to an internal IRS memo. Grant is commissioner of the agency's tax exempt and government entities division, which includes the agents that targeted tea party groups for additional scrutiny.

Grant joined the IRS in 2005 and took over as acting commissioner of the tax exempt and government entities division in December 2010. He was just named the permanent commissioner May 8.

When asked whether Grant was pressured to leave, IRS spokeswoman Michelle Eldridge said Grant had more than 31 years of federal service and it was his personal decision to leave.

Before he joined the IRS, Grant was a top official at the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.

Grant's predecessor at the IRS was Sarah Hall Ingram, who is now director of the agency's Affordable Care Act Office. Ingram was in charge of the tax exempt division when IRS agents first started targeting conservative groups.

The IRS said Ingram was assigned to help the agency implement the health care law in December 2010, about six months before the Treasury inspector general's report said her subordinate, the director of exempt organizations, learned about the targeting."

But he seems to be proud of how little he knows.

Why didn’t his Justice Department inform the Associated Press, as the law requires, before pawing through reporters’ phone records?

“I do not know,” the attorney general told the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday afternoon, “why that was or was not done. I simply don’t have a factual basis to answer that question.”

Why didn’t the DOJ seek the AP’s cooperation, as the law also requires, before issuing subpoenas?

“I don’t know what happened there,” Holder replied. “I was recused from the case.”

Why, asked the committee’s chairman, Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), was the whole matter handled in a manner that appears “contrary to the law and standard procedure”?

“I don’t have a factual basis to answer the questions that you have asked, because I was recused,” the attorney general said.

On and on Holder went: “I don’t know. I don’t know. . . . I would not want to reveal what I know. . . . I don’t know why that didn’t happen. . . . I know nothing, so I’m not in a position really to answer.”

Holder seemed to regard this ignorance as a shield protecting him and the Justice Department from all criticism of the Obama administration’s assault on press freedoms. But his claim that his “recusal” from the case exempted him from all discussion of the matter didn’t fly with Republicans or Democrats on the committee, who justifiably saw his recusal as more of an abdication.

“There doesn’t seem to be any acceptance of responsibility in the Justice Department for things that have gone wrong,” said Rep. James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), after Holder placed the AP matter in the lap of his deputy. “We don’t know where the buck stops.”

The best Holder could do was offer an “after-action analysis” of the matter and pledge the administration’s renewed support for a media shield law (the same proposed law the Obama administration undermined three years ago). But that does nothing to reverse the damage the administration has already done with its wholesale snooping into reporters’ phone records and its unprecedented number of leak prosecutions.

“I realize there are exceptions and that you have recused yourself, but it seems to me clear that the actions of the department have, in fact, impaired the First Amendment,” Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) told Holder. “Reporters who might have previously believed that a confidential source would speak to them would no longer have that level of confidence, because those confidential sources are now going to be chilled in their relationship with the press.”

In a sense, the two topics that dogged Holder most on Wednesday — the AP phone records and the IRS’s targeting of conservative groups — were one and the same. In both cases, Americans are being punished and intimidated for exercising their right of free expression — by the taxing authorities, in the conservatives’ case, and by federal prosecutors, in the reporters’ case.

But Holder cared so little about those two issues that he said not a peep about either the IRS or the AP in his opening statement. When he was questioned about the AP case, his first response was to suggest the criticism of him was political. “I mean, there’s been a lot of criticism,” Holder said. “In fact, the head of the RNC called for my resignation, in spite of the fact that I was not the person involved in that decision.”

Republicans on the House committee had voted previously to hold Holder in contempt of Congress, and Holder made clear the feeling was mutual; he informed Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) that his line of questioning was “too consistent with the way in which you conduct yourself as a member of Congress. It’s unacceptable, and it’s shameful.” Some of the Republicans provided Holder justification for his disdain. Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.), defying the chairman’s gavel, shouted a stream of exotic accusations at Holder, closing with the complaint that Holder was casting “aspersions on my asparagus.”

But there would be more sympathy, and support, for Holder if he took seriously the lawmakers’ legitimate questions about his department’s abuse of power in the AP case. He may have recused himself from the leak probe that led to the searches of reporters’ phone records (a decision he took so lightly that he didn’t put it in writing), but he isn’t recused from defending the First Amendment.

Didn’t the deputy attorney general who approved the subpoenas have the same potential conflict of interest that Holder claimed?

“I don’t know.”

When did Holder recuse himself?

“I’m not sure.”

How much time was spent exploring alternatives to the subpoenas?

“I don’t know, because, as I said, I recused myself.”

But when the Justice Department undermines the Constitution, recusal is no excuse.

Career attorneys lashed out in e-mails%2C Internet postings

Review describes a dysfunctional culture in Justice Department%27s Civil Rights Division

Investigators find insufficient evidence that key decisions were based on race or politics

WASHINGTON — An internal Justice Department review of its voting rights section found career attorneys engaged in political and ideological warfare featuring racially charged Internet postings, e-mails and personal attacks.

The 258-page review by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, spanning the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, described a highly dysfunctional culture within the agency's Civil Rights Division that ""contributed to the appearance of politicization"" involving the division's enforcement decisions.

However, investigators determined that there was ""insufficient evidence to conclude"" that key decisions involving voting cases were based on race or partisan considerations.

More than two years in the making, the report comes as Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez, chief of the agency's Civil Rights Division, is a likely nominee for Labor secretary.

Perez's conduct was not seriously faulted. His confirmation in 2009 came after key decisions were made about the handling of a voter intimidation case against members of the New Black Panther Party (NBPP) in Philadelphia.

That case focused on the actions of two black men, one of whom carried a nightstick outside a polling place on Election Day 2008. The bulk of the case, which included the New Black Panther Party chairman and the party organization, was dismissed during the Obama administration, prompting Republican lawmakers to call for the review.

""Critics of the decisions made in the NBPP case have alleged that the decision to dismiss … reflected hostility in the current administration to enforcing the voting rights laws on behalf of white victims or against black defendants,"" Horowitz said in the report. ""We did not find sufficient evidence to conclude that (Justice officials) who approved the decision were so motivated.""

The report did document a ""disappointing lack of professionalism by some department employees over an extended period of time."" Investigators found a series of Internet postings by employees using pseudonyms that ""contained heated political and even racist commentary.""

""One used the expression 'po' Niggrahs' in describing a manager's attitude toward blacks,"" according to the report, which did not identify the employee. In another posting, an unidentified employee described the likely neighborhood of a conservative career attorney colleague as a place where ""everyone wears a white sheet, the darkies say 'yes'm' and equal rights for all are the real land of make believe.""

In a written response, Perez said steps have been taken to improve the ""atmosphere and professional culture within the voting rights section during the past several years.""

""The voting section is a far different place in 2013 than it was in 2005 or 2007,"" Perez said. ""Nonetheless, we acknowledge … that voting rights enforcement is a particularly important area in which to assure professionalism and integrity.""

Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., one of the lawmakers who called for the review, said he was ""deeply troubled"" by the report's findings.

""The report makes clear that the division has become a rat's nest of unacceptable and unprofessional actions,"" Wolf said."

On Wednesday, the New York Times became one of the more influential voices to say what many others have been saying: that the administration's methods are an attack on press freedom.

In a scathing editorial, the Times wrote that, ""With the decision to label a Fox News television reporter a possible 'co-conspirator' in a criminal investigation of a news leak, the Obama administration has moved beyond protecting government secrets to threatening fundamental freedoms of the press to gather news.""

The Times editorial described the Obama administration as going ""overboard"" with its investigations into leaks and threatening press freedom. The board added:

Obama administration officials often talk about the balance between protecting secrets and protecting the constitutional rights of a free press. Accusing a reporter of being a 'co-conspirator,' on top of other zealous and secretive investigations, shows a heavy tilt toward secrecy and insufficient concern about a free press.

The Times editorial was just one in a chorus of hard-hitting attacks on Obama's media policy that have surfaced in the wake of the Justice Department investigations. Journalists were outraged by the inquiries into the AP and Fox News reporter James Rosen. In particular, members of the media took issue with the Justice Department labeling Rosen a possible ""co-conspirator"" in a leak case for the crime of trying to get a source to give up information.

The New Yorker reported on Tuesday that the investigation into Rosen was even broader than previously suspected, as the DOJ seized records from at least five different numbers used by Fox News and two different White House lines.

That followed the Associated Press' revelation that the DOJ had secretly obtained months of phone records for at least seven individual journalists across 20 phone lines while searching for the government official responsible for leaking information about a CIA-thwarted terror plot.

Obama's hyper-aggressive leak policy—and his administration's potential equation of routine journalistic interaction with criminality—is nothing new. But the fury in the pages and on the websites of elite outlets about these positions certainly is.

The Times' criticism echoed that of many other journalists and press freedom groups.

On Tuesday, the board of the Committee to Protect Journalists sent an outraged letter to Attorney General Eric Holder, in which it warned that the DOJ's secret subpoenas for over 20 AP phone lines ""represent a damaging setback for press freedom in the United States."" This came on the heels of a letter signed by over 50 media outlets which made similar arguments.

Wednesday also saw Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank lash out at Obama:

The Rosen affair is as flagrant an assault on civil liberties as anything done by George W. Bush’s administration, and it uses technology to silence critics in a way Richard Nixon could only have dreamed of. To treat a reporter as a criminal for doing his job — seeking out information the government doesn’t want made public — deprives Americans of the First Amendment freedom on which all other constitutional rights are based. Guns? Privacy? Due process? Equal protection? If you can’t speak out, you can’t defend those rights, either."

The apology that launched the IRS scandal into the news came in response to a planted question

IRS disclosed the Tea Party targeting to lawyers group after denying it to Congress

Members of Congress criticize the strategy as a %22scheme%22 and %22manipulation%22

WASHINGTON — It was an unusual way to deliver bad news, even in a town known for its selective leaks, Friday-night news dumps and wag-the-dog distractions.

The Internal Revenue Service, apparently determined to get out ahead of an inspector general report critical of its handling of tax exemptions for Tea Party groups, came up with a plan: Lois Lerner, the official responsible for the tax-exempt division, would publicly apologize in response to a question at the American Bar Association conference in Washington.

Details of the now-infamous planted question emerged Friday after acting IRS commissioner Steven Miller admitted the gambit under questioning from members of the House Ways and Means Committee.

It was the day after Lerner had testified to Congress last week, failing once again to disclose the extent of the Tea Party targeting even under direct questioning. The damning inspector general report would come out any day, and Lerner and Miller wanted to figure out a way to disclose the news publicly.

Miller testified about the thought process behind the release strategy Friday. ""Now that the (inspector general) report was finalized, now that we knew all the facts, now that we had responded in writing and everything was done, did it make sense for us to start talking about this in public,"" he said.

The plan, he said, was to simultaneously notify Congress, but that never happened.

After talking to Miller, Lerner called Celia Roady, a Washington tax lawyer whose office is immediately across Pennsylvania Avenue from the IRS headquarters. She also serves on the IRS Advisory Committee on Tax-Exempt and Government Entities.

Roady released this written statement late Friday explaining her role:

""On May 9, I received a call from Lois Lerner, who told me that she wanted to address an issue after her prepared remarks at the ABA Tax Section's Exempt Organizations Committee Meeting, and asked if I would pose a question to her after her remarks. I agreed to do so, and she then gave me the question that I asked at the meeting the next day. We had no discussion thereafter on the topic of the question, nor had we spoken about any of this before I received her call. She did not tell me, and I did not know, how she would answer the question.""

And so that's how it happened. Within minutes, the Associated Press reported her remarks with a one-line news alert: ""WASHINGTON (AP) — IRS apologizes for inappropriately targeting conservative political groups in 2012 election.""

In a conference call with reporters later that day, Lerner emphasized that her apology came in response to a question.

""I was asked a question at the ABA meeting to give a status update of things that have been in the press"" about the agency's treatment of Tea Party groups, she said. Asked why the IRS chose to make an apology that day, she said, ""Someone asked me a question today, so I answered it.""

Members of Congress in both parties criticized what they called a ""scheme"" and a ""manipulation.""

""I find it incredibly ironic. You know, on the one hand, you're arguing today that the IRS is not corrupt. But the subtext of that is you're saying, 'Look, we're just incompetent,' "" said an exasperated Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill., after one line of questioning on Roady's involvement.

Communications professionals said it was a puzzling move that backfired and alienated members of Congress.

""It violates the golden rule of political crisis management — disclosing critical facts early,"" said Nu Wexler, a former Democratic Hill staffer and vice president of Rasky Baerlein Strategic Communications.

Lerner ""had an opportunity to explain the full story in the May 8th hearing, and she passed. Members of Congress don't like being misled, and that's why two key House Democrats are now calling for her resignation,"" Wexler said.

In the released email, the names of the sender as well as the recipient have been redacted, but both are described as “career DHS officials.” The text of the email also refers to a person called “D1,” which Senator Grassley’s office believes is US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) director Alejandro Mayorkas. President Obama nominated Mayorkas to become Deputy Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security on June 27.

Mr. Mayorkas testified before a Senate committee holding hearings on his nomination on July 25. The hearings were attended by only Democrats. Republicans did not participate because Mr. Mayorkas is the subject of an investigation by the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General’s Office.

The email, dated April 12, 2013, is from a “Senior USCIS Career Official” and is sent to “USCIS Career Officials.” It reads as follows:

We absolutely gave special treatment to GreenTech at the directive of D1. D1 was working directly with the RC’s [EB-5 Regional Center] atty, [name redacted]. Additionally, I would call a wholesale rewrite of the AAO’s [Administrative Appeals Office] decision by the front office special treatment. Look at the first draft in the attached email and the final version, attached.

Senator Grassley asked Mr. Mayorkas about an apparent inconsistency between this email and his earlier testimony in a letter he sent to Mr. Mayorkas on Thursday. Grassley wrote to Mayorkas that “you testified [on July 25]: ‘I have never ever in my career exercised undue influence to influence the outcome of a case.'” Grassley noted in his letter to Mayorkas that “D1 [mentioned in the April 12, 2013 email] is an apparent reference to you.”

Grassley then cited Mayorkas’ testimony to the Senate committee on July 25:

Several documents call into question some of the statements you made regarding preferential treatment in your testimony at last Thursday’s hearing. For example, you were asked in the hearing about communications with Terry McAuliffe with respect to Gulf Coast Funds Management. You testified: “I was asked to attend a meeting with Mr. McAuliffe so that I could hear in person his complaints… two years ago… I heard those complaints, and that was the extent of the interaction… I moved on with my work.” (Emphasis included in Grassley letter)

But, Grassley wrote, “Contrary to the impression left by your answer, documents indicate that both before and after that meeting, you actually engaged in nearly a dozen contacts with Gulf Coast Funds Management between 2010 and 2013, including direct communications with Gulf Coast’s attorneys.” Grassley concluded, “That one meeting with Mr. McAuliffe was clearly not the extent of your interaction on that matter.”

The EB-5 foreign national investor program has come under intense scrutiny over the past several years. Under the program, enacted into law in 1990, foreign nationals may obtain temporary and permanent green card resident visas in return for investing a minimum of $500,000 in an American company.

The possibility that foreign nationals who have invested in GreenTech Automotive have been granted temporary green card visas due to the political influence of the principals involved is a key issue currently under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General’s Office.

Terry McAuliffe, who was chairman of GreenTech Automotive during the period when political influence may have played a role in the granting of visas, is a friend and chief fundraiser for former President Bill Clinton. Anthony Rodham, brother of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, is the President and CEO of Gulf Coast Funds Management, which the Department of Homeland Security designated the EB-5 Regional Center that works exclusively with GreenTech Automotive to help secure green card visas for its EB-5 investors.

Grassley’s letter to Mayorkas was one of two stories about GreenTech Automotive that made headlines on Friday. In a related story, GreenTech Automotive confirmed to Breitbart News on Friday that it has received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission to produce company documents. According to the Washington Post, those documents were subpoenaed as evidence in the SEC’s investigation into claims made by GreenTech Automotive to its investors."

USA TODAY

Obama acknowledges he may not be best person to lead a dialogue on race

President was criticized for remarks in a prior race-related case

Suggests Americans give deeper thought to racial bias

WASHINGTON — When it comes to dealing with the sticky issue of race in America, President Obama has found that leading from behind might not be such a bad idea.

He was pilloried by critics on the right early in his presidency when he said a Cambridge, Mass., police officer ""acted stupidly"" when he arrested the black Harvard University scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. as he struggled to open the door of his home in a predominantly white neighborhood.

And Obama raised eyebrows, when he remarked after Trayvon Martin's death last year that ""if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.""

So, it's no surprise that he took a cautious approach as he weighed in for the first time since a Florida jury found George Zimmerman not guilty in the death of Trayvon.

In a surprise appearance before reporters six days after the verdict, Obama spoke eloquently about Trayvon's family showing grace in the aftermath of the verdict, and he reiterated his understanding of the pain the African-American community feels over the outcome of the trial and the larger problem of racial profiling.

And Obama again connected himself directly to the teenager when he observed that he could have been Trayvon 35 years ago.

But the president, despite the historic nature of his presidency, also made clear that he's not the best person to be leading a difficult conversation about race.

Instead, he argued that the larger discussion of race belongs not with lawmakers in Washington but in living rooms, houses of worship and workplaces.

In such settings, Obama posited, ""There's the possibility that people are a little bit more honest, and at least you ask yourself your own questions about, am I wringing as much bias out of myself as I can?""

The president rightfully noted that as a nation we've made progress in our dialogue on race. But, as he also made clear, we're hardly in a post-racial era.

Obama, who has long contended with a portion of America's views about his ""other-ness,"" seems to have realized that a president – even an African-American one – can sometimes serve the public dialogue on race best by merely participating in the conversation rather than directing it."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/06/05/Obama-Verizon-phone,2013-06-05 00:00:00,['Ben Shapiro'],Obama Admin Grabs Millions of Verizon Phone Records,"According to a breaking report from the UK Guardian, Barack Obama’s National Security Agency has been collecting phone records of millions of domestic customers of Verizon under a court order obtained in April. The order requires Verizon to turn over phone records on an “ongoing, daily basis” to the NSA, both within the US and between the US and international sources.

The Guardian reports: “The document shows for the first time that under the Obama administration the communication records of millions of US citizens are being collected indiscriminately and in bulk – regardless of whether they are suspected of any wrongdoing.” The secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) handed over the order to the FBI on April 25, and gave them a three month blanket surveillance clearance. That means that numbers of both parties, location data, call duration, and time of all calls are subject to government surveillance. That makes the Obama administration’s oversight essentially unlimited.

The NSA, White House and Department of Justice all declined comment. The court order says that Verizon is forbidden to let customers know about the surveillance. Verizon also declined comment.

The order forces Verizon to turn over electronic versions of “all call detail records or ‘telephony metadata’ created by Verizon for communications between the United States and abroad” … or, more ominously, “wholly within the United States, including local telephone calls.” Every single day, Verizon must turn over that information.

The Guardian says that Verizon may not be the only cell-phone provider targeted with the order, and adds that “previous reporting has suggested the NSA has collected cell records from all major mobile networks.”

The law legalizing this sort of surveillance is 50 USC 1861, a provision of the Patriot Act allowing requests of business records.

This sort of controversy arose in 2006 under President Bush under the auspices of the war on terror. President Obama essentially declared the war on terror over in April, at about the same point the administration received its blanket surveillance go-ahead from the FISA court.

In 2011, the secretary of health and human services, Kathleen Sebelius, overruled the Food and Drug Administration, which had decided, based on scientific evidence, that the pills would be safe and appropriate “for all females of child-bearing potential.” Ms. Sebelius arbitrarily determined that only women 17 and older should have access to the drug.

Then, last month, citing the political nature of Ms. Sebelius’s intervention and finding no “coherent justification” for it, Judge Edward Korman of United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York ordered the F.D.A. to make emergency contraceptives available over the counter to all women, with no age restrictions."

(CNN) —

The National Security Agency notched a much-needed win in court Friday after a series of setbacks over the legality and even the usefulness of its massive data collection program.

A federal judge in New York ruled the NSA’s bulk collection of data on nearly every phone call made in the United States was legal.

The ruling contrasts with another ruling last week by a federal judge in Washington, who called the same program “almost Orwellian” and likely unconstitutional.

In his ruling Friday, U.S. District Judge William Pauley said the NSA’s bulk collection of phone records under Section 215 of the Patriot Act was legal. The program was revealed in classified leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

“But the question of whether that program should be conducted is for the other two coordinate branches of government to decide,” said the ruling by Pauley, an appointee of President Bill Clinton.

The American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the case, said it would appeal Pauley’s ruling.

“We are extremely disappointed with this decision, which misinterprets the relevant statutes, understates the privacy implications of the government’s surveillance and misapplies a narrow and outdated precedent to read away core constitutional protections,” said Jameel Jaffer, the ACLU’s deputy legal director.

Review: NSA snooping program should stay in place

President Barack Obama is examining a review of the surveillance efforts that recommended changes in how the NSA program was conducted. Obama said last week he would decide what to do about it in January.

Last week, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon said the NSA’s bulk collection of metadata – phone records of the time and numbers called without any disclosure of content – apparently violates privacy rights.

His preliminary ruling favored five plaintiffs challenging the practice, but Leon limited the decision only to their cases.

“I cannot imagine a more ‘indiscriminate’ and ‘arbitrary invasion’ than this systematic and high-tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every citizen for purposes of querying and analyzing it without prior judicial approval,” said Leon, an appointee of President George W. Bush. “Surely, such a program infringes on ‘that degree of privacy’ that the Founders enshrined in the Fourth Amendment.”

Leon’s ruling said the “plaintiffs in this case have also shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits of a Fourth Amendment claim,” adding “as such, they too have adequately demonstrated irreparable injury.”

He rejected the government’s argument that a 1979 Maryland case provided precedent for the constitutionality of collecting phone metadata, noting that public use of telephones had increased dramatically in three decades.

Leon also noted the government “does not cite a single instance in which analysis of the NSA’s bulk metadata collection actually stopped an imminent attack, or otherwise aided the government in achieving any objective that was time-sensitive in nature.”

However, he put off enforcing his order barring the government from collecting the information, pending an appeal by the government.

A Justice Department spokesman said in response to Leon’s ruling that “we believe the program is constitutional as previous judges have found.”

Explosive revelations this year by Snowden triggered new debate about national security and privacy interests in the aftermath of the September 2001 terrorist attacks.

Snowden’s disclosures led to more public disclosure about the secretive legal process that sets in motion the government surveillance.

The NSA has admitted it received secret court approval to collect vast amounts of metadata from telecom giant Verizon and leading Internet companies, including Microsoft, Apple, Google, Yahoo and Facebook.

The case before Leon involved approval for surveillance in April by a judge at a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that handles individual requests for electronic surveillance for “foreign intelligence purposes.”

Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of the 1970s, the secret courts were set up to grant certain types of government requests – wiretapping, data analysis and other monitoring of possible terrorists and spies operating in the United States.

The Patriot Act that Congress passed after the 9/11 attacks broadened the government’s ability to conduct anti-terrorism surveillance in the United States and abroad, eventually including the metadata collection.

In order to collect the information, the government has to demonstrate it is “relevant” to an international terrorism investigation.

However, the 1978 FISA law lays out exactly what the special court must decide: “A judge considering a petition to modify or set aside a nondisclosure order may grant such petition only if the judge finds that there is no reason to believe that disclosure may endanger the national security of the United States, interfere with a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation, interfere with diplomatic relations, or endanger the life or physical safety of any person.”

In defending the program, Gen. Keith Alexander, the NSA’s director, told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that “15 separate judges of the FISA Court have held on 35 occasions that Section 215 (of the Patriot Act) authorizes the collection of telephony metadata in bulk in support of counterterrorism investigations.”

Initially, telecommunications companies such as Verizon were the targets of legal action against Patriot Act provisions. Congress later gave retroactive immunity to those private businesses.

The New York ruling makes it more likely that the U.S. Supreme Court will have to tackle the issue of privacy and settle the dispute over the the NSA program.

For years, the courts have relied on a 1979 Supreme Court precedent that found privacy rights didn’t extend to personal information people give to third-parties such as the phone companies, which store basic data on calls made. The secret court that oversees the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has relied on that ruling to periodically reauthorize the NSA phone data program.

But technology has come a long way since then; modern cell phones are in constant communication with phone towers and tell a lot more information about phone customers than old land line phones. And at least some justices may be ready to take on the issue again.

Ruling last year in an unrelated case, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that the 1979 standard may be “ill suited to the digital age” because people reveal a lot more information in seemingly mundane tasks.

“It may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties,” she wrote.

Emails demonstrate that the targeting of Tea Party groups was orchestrated from the top.

The IRS shared information with the FEC%2C raising questions about how politicized both agencies were.

A poll shows that fewer Americans than ever trust the federal government.

With all the excitement over Syria last week -- we went from ""Assad is Hitler"" to ""we have achieved peace in our time"" almost overnight! -- you may have missed another big story. The IRS scandal, which has slumbered over the summer as Congress has been in recess, seems to be waking up.

It has now been over four months since the IRS admitted it was targeting conservative groups in the run-up to the 2012 election. The chief IRS official in charge of Exempt Organizations, Lois Lerner, has ""taken the Fifth"" -- invoking her right against self-incrimination in order to avoid testifying before Congress on what went on. Nonetheless, President Obama -- who himself ""joked"" about auditing his enemies -- has lumped the IRS misconduct in with what he calls ""phony scandals.""

But new emails have come out that make the IRS scandal look anything but phony. Emails recovered by the House Ways and Means Committee demonstrate that the targeting of Tea Party groups -- and of voter-integrity groups -- was orchestrated from the top of the agency. Rather than being conducted by a few rogue employees in the Cincinnati office of the IRS, the Tea Party targeting was regarded by Lerner as something ""very dangerous"" politically, and she observed that ""Cincy should probably NOT have these cases.""

The emails also reveal Lerner's concerns that the Democrats might lose their Senate majority, and her hopes that the Federal Election Commission might ""save the day"" by interfering with right-leaning grassroots activity. The IRS also shared information with the FEC, something not permitted by statute, raising questions about just how politicized both agencies were.

An editorial in Investor's Business Dailyobserves:

""Like the Internet video the Benghazi terrorist attack was blamed on, the only thing phony about the IRS scandal is the administration's cover story that a couple of rogue agents in the Cincinnati office concocted and executed this most blatant abuse of power by the most powerful and feared agency of government. Lerner's email further blows out of the water that discredited fiction. It also confirms a suspected reason for the planned intimidation and hamstringing of conservative opposition to the Obama administration's policies, saying that those Tea Party group applications for tax-exempt status could end up being the 'vehicle to go to court' to get more clarity on the 2010 Supreme Court ruling on campaign finance rules.""

That's right, and that's just another reason why we need to get to the bottom of the IRS scandal, which isn't the least bit ""phony."" It seems to me that there are two possible problems here. One is that this came from the Obama White House. The other is that the -- overwhelmingly Democratic -- career civil service at the IRS didn't need White House instructions to go after Tea Party groups it saw as enemies.

The first possibility is bad enough, but is presumably remediable with stricter rules. The second possibility, however, calls into question the possibility of a nonpartisan career civil service, and certainly the possibility of fair administration for something as complex, and involving as many discretionary decisions, as the Internal Revenue Code. Worse yet, given that overwhelming partisan identification with Democrats pervades the civil service as a whole, it calls into question the very possibility of a nonpartisan and politically neutral civil service.

I'm not ready to call for a return to the ""spoils system,"" but the fully politicized federal bureaucracy of our nation's first century or so did have two advantages: First, presidents couldn't hide behind the bureaucracy, as they were presumed responsible for the actions of government bureaus staffed with their supporters; and second, politicians were less inclined to trust the bureaucracy with enormous and discretionary power when they knew that it would sometimes be staffed by their political adversaries.

At any rate, it all boils down to trust. One reason for the resonance of not only the IRS scandals but also the NSA scandal, the Benghazi scandal, Fast and Furious, and so on is that fewer Americans than ever trust the federal government. It's a mess that needs to be cleaned up, and denying that the mess exists only exacerbates the lack of trust.

It's doubtful that Eric Holder's Justice Department -- which is even more partisan and politicized than the IRS -- will clean this mess up. Nor is Holder likely to appoint a special prosecutor. So it's up to congressional investigators to get to the bottom of it. Stay tuned.

Rand Paul is blasting Attorney General Eric Holder's assertion that the government could conceivably use drones against its own citizens in the U.S. as ""frightening,"" saying such an action would violate the Constitution.

Paul, R-Ky., was responding to comments by Holder released Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee approved the nomination of John Brennan, President Obama's pick to be his next CIA director.

Paul said in a statement obtained by Fox News that Holder sent him two letters regarding the constitutionality of the use of legal force, such as drones against Americans and on U.S. soil, after Paul petitioned Brennan to speak on the matter.

In the letter, Holder says the U.S. has never carried out a drone strike against one of its citizens on American soil, and calls a situation where such a strike may occur ""entirely hypothetical"" and ""unlikely to occur.""

However, Holder does not entirely rule out that such a scenario may occur in the future, and indicates that such a strike would be legal under the Constitution.

More On This...

“It is possible, I suppose, to imagine an extraordinary circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate under the Constitution and applicable laws of the United States for the president to authorize the military to use lethal force within the territory of the United States,"" Holder said.

Holder said ""catastrophic"" attacks such as the Sept. 11 attacks or the attack on Pearl Harbor are examples of circumstances where the president could conceivably feel such an action is necessary.

Paul says he is not satisfied with the attorney general's response.

“The U.S. Attorney General’s refusal to rule out the possibility of drone strikes on American citizens and on American soil is more than frightening, it is an affront on the constitutional due process rights of all Americans,” Paul said.

Paul says he also received a statement from Brennan, who stated that the CIA does not have authority to order such operations be carried out.

Brennan vigorously defended the use of drone strikes during his confirmation hearing. He declined to say whether he believes waterboarding, which simulates drowning, amounted to torture. But he called the practice ""reprehensible"" and said it should never be done again. Obama ordered waterboarding banned shortly after taking office.

Drone strikes are employed only as a ""last resort,"" Brennan told the committee. But he also said he had no qualms about going after U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki in September 2011.

A drone strike in Yemen killed al-Awlaki and Samir Khan, both U.S. citizens. A drone strike two weeks later killed al-Awlaki's 16-year-old son, a Denver native.

How many of them apologize or correct the record for the misinformation and lies? How often do they research and correct the political points they were forced to air from politicians and political operatives?

Currently the mainstream media are scolding the Obama administration for lack of access and for using other types of media (social media and local media) to get their information out directly. They insinuate the behavior is tantamount to state run media.

Maybe if the mainstream media behaved as Jon Stewart in the video below, the administration would be less reticent. It is refreshing to watch Stewart who realizes that inasmuch as he is a satirist, he should apologize and correct the record when he wrongly maligns someone.

Last week he did a skit on Mississippi taking 148 years to ratify the 13th amendment, the amendment that abolished slavery. He implied that the former Mississippi secretary of state Dick Molpus, who presided over a 1995 attempt to ratify the 13th amendment, may have been a casual bigot. It turned out

Dick Molpus had a long and distinguished record for speaking out for Civil Rights.

He led charge on voting rights reform.

In 1989 he spoke at the 25th year anniversary of the three kids killed in Mississippi during the Civil Right conflicts for which he received death threats.

What is telling is no one called the Jon Stewart show to ask him to correct the record. He did it out of duty. One can only hope that in the long run the mainstream media will be forced to act accordingly. They have yet to apologize for all the misinformation that they have put out from the buildup to the war in Iraq to the misinformation about the Affordable Care Act. They could learn a bit from Stewart.

Human Rights Campaign published a confidential tax return of the National Organization for Marriage.

There is no question that someone at the IRS leaked the document that was published by the HRC.

It is imperative that Congressional investigators get to the bottom of the issue.

The world is learning about the corruption of the IRS in targeting conservative groups, including various Tea Party organizations, for heightened scrutiny. But the corruption goes much deeper than harassing groups seeking first time non-profit designations, into actively sabotaging existing non-profit groups by releasing confidential information.

In March of 2012 the Human Rights Campaign published a confidential tax return of the National Organization for Marriage, which was immediately republished byThe Huffington Post and other liberal news media outlets. The HRC and NOM are the leading national groups on opposing sides of the fight over gay marriage. HRC wants to redefine marriage to make it genderless, while NOM wishes to preserve marriage as the union of one man and one woman.

NOM a target

My organization was not the only conservative-linked political group or business that appears to have faced shady actions from IRS employees. ProPublica reported this week that the IRS handed over to them confidential documents of nine conservative organizations whose applications for non-profit status were still pending. Among them: Crossroads GPS, a key group backing Mitt Romney's presidential campaign.

Our case was particularly egregious because the IRS leak of confidential information fed directly into an ongoing political battle. For months before March 2012, the pro-gay marriage HRC had been demanding that my group, NOM, publicly identify its major donors, something that NOM and many other non-profits refuse to do. The reason is simple. In the past, gay marriage advocates have used such information to launch campaigns of intimidation against traditional marriage supporters.

Just as gay marriage proponents were demanding the information, the IRS appears to have illegally given them exactly what they were looking for. The tax return released by the HRC contained the names and addresses of dozens of major donors to NOM. And there's little doubt where the documents came from. The tax returns contained internal coding added by the IRS after the returns were originally submitted.

For the IRS to leak any organization's tax return to its political opponents is an outrageous breach of ethics and, if proven, constitutes a felony. Every organization — liberal and conservative — should shudder at the idea of the IRS playing politics with its confidential tax return information. But the situation here is even more egregious because the head of the HRC was at the time serving as a national co-chair of President Obama's re-election campaign.

The release of NOM's confidential tax return to the Human Rights Campaign is the canary in the coal mine of IRS corruption. Contrary to assertions that the targeting of Tea Party groups was an error in judgment by low-level IRS bureaucrats, the release of NOM's confidential data to a group headed by an Obama campaign co-chair suggests the possibility of complicity at the highest levels of politics and government. This wasn't a low-level error in judgment; it was a conscious act to reward a prominent Obama supporter while punishing an opponent.

That's the reason the IRS has not been very interested in getting to the bottom of what happened. Federal investigators have interviewed NOM officials about the matter, but our efforts to find out what has become of the investigation have been stonewalled at every turn.

Not about marriage

The tendency of some is to set this serious issue aside because it is seemingly part of the war on traditional marriage, an issue that divides the country in half and bedevils many. But given the broader issues being raised about the IRS, that's not right.

At this stage, nobody is accusing the White House or the Obama re-election campaign of illegal activity. But there is a serious question about whether there was communication or possible collusion between the IRS and the HRC, and if there was, whether anyone at the White House or the Obama re-election campaign was involved.

It is imperative that congressional investigators get to the bottom of the issue. If the IRS can get away with leaking NOM's confidential tax return to its chief political opponent, then no taxpayer is safe from political retribution by the federal government.

The statement, released to Fox News, follows a Breitbart News report on Obama administration Pentagon appointees meeting with anti-Christian extremist Mikey Weinstein to develop court-martial procedures to punish Christians in the military who express or share their faith.

(From our earlier report: Weinstein is the head of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, and says Christians–including chaplains–sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ in the military are guilty of “treason,” and of committing an act of “spiritual rape” as serious a crime as “sexual assault.” He also asserted that Christians sharing their faith in the military are “enemies of the Constitution.”)

Being convicted in a court martial means that a soldier has committed a crime under federal military law. Punishment for a court martial can include imprisonment and being dishonorably discharged from the military.

So President Barack Obama’s civilian appointees who lead the Pentagon are confirming that the military will make it a crime–possibly resulting in imprisonment–for those in uniform to share their faith. This would include chaplains–military officers who are ordained clergymen of their faith (mostly Christian pastors or priests, or Jewish rabbis)–whose duty since the founding of the U.S. military under George Washington is to teach their faith and minister to the spiritual needs of troops who come to them for counsel, instruction, or comfort.

This regulation would severely limit expressions of faith in the military, even on a one-to-one basis between close friends. It could also effectively abolish the position of chaplain in the military, as it would not allow chaplains (or any service members, for that matter), to say anything about their faith that others say led them to think they were being encouraged to make faith part of their life. It’s difficult to imagine how a member of the clergy could give spiritual counseling without saying anything that might be perceived in that fashion.

In response to the Pentagon’s plans, retired Lt. Gen. Jerry Boykin, who is now executive vice president of the Family Research Council (FRC), said on Fox & Friends Wednesday morning:

It’s a matter of what do they mean by “proselytizing.” …I think they’ve got their defintions a little confused. If you’re talking about coercion that’s one thing, but if you’re talking about the free exercise of our faith as individual soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines, especially for the chaplains, they I think the worst thing we can do is stop the ability for a soldier to be able to exercise his faith.”

FRC has launched a petition here which has already collected over 60,000 signatures, calling on Secretary Hagel is stop working with Weinstein and his anti-Christian organization to develop military policy regarding religious faith.

**UPDATE**

The FRC petition has now exceeded more than 40,000 signatures at the time of this update.

“One of the things that I don’t do well is this,” she said to applause from most of the guests, according to a White House transcript. “Do you understand?”

A pool report from a reporter in the room said Obama “left the lectern and moved over to the protester.” The pool report quoted Obama as saying: “Listen to me or you can take the mic, but I'm leaving. You all decide. You have one choice.""

Obama’s suggestion that she would leave was not included in the official White House transcript.

The audience responded by asking Obama to remain, according to the pool report, which quoted a woman nearby telling Sturtz, “You need to go.”

Sturtz was escorted out of the room. She said in an interview later she was stunned by Obama’s response.

“She came right down in my face,” Sturtz said. “I was taken aback.”

Sturtz said she told Obama she was happy to take the microphone to plead her case, which, Sturtz said, appeared to fluster the first lady.

“I said I want your husband to sign the executive order,” Sturtz said. “Her husband could sign this order tonight and protect 22 percent of the work force in this country.”

Sturtz said she paid $500 to attend the fundraiser, part of a protest cooked up by the gay rights group GetEqual, which gained notice in Obama’s first term for hectoring him during speeches and demanding more action on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues. Sturtz, who gave $5,000 to the Democratic Party and Obama's campaign in 2008, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, said she was devoting herself to full-time activism now pressing the White House on the employment discrimination issue.

The proposed executive order that prompted Sturtz’s outburst would prohibit federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.

LGBT activists, many of whom hailed Obama for his vocal support for same-sex marriage rights in the months leading up to his reelection in 2012, have been increasingly dismayed that the White House has not yet acted on the proposed order.

The issue has been building for years, pushed by gay rights advocates who argue that more than 20 percent of the U.S. workforce is employed by federal contractors. Advocates for the executive order have attempted to exert more quiet pressure, highlighting cases of discrimination by some firms and connecting workers to administration officials to make personal appeals.

White House officials have said they back legislation to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, but have declined to say whether the executive order is pending.

Metro Weekly, a gay newspaper, reported in 2012 that, as a presidential candidate in 2008, then-Sen. Obama had pledged to a Houston LGBT group that he would support a “formal written policy” of non-discrimination.

The president has the authority to offer temporary relief from immigration removals.

He could end the controversial Secure Communities program.

He could also broaden the number of immigrants eligible for deferred action.

President Obama is closing in on a record. Sometime around the end of this year, he will have deported 2 million undocumented immigrants, more than any other president.

Enough, already. The Obama administration should put the brakes on its deportation train. The president has the authority to offer temporary relief from immigration removals. With reform stalled, the president ought to stop trying to appease Republicans by being strong on immigration enforcement. He should consider executive action.

Obama has options to allow undocumented immigrants to live without the threat of deportation. Remember, this impacts only immigrants already here. He could end the controversial Secure Communities program, which turns local law enforcement officers into immigration agents. He could let more immigrants qualify for temporary protected status, which provides them with work and residence permits. In 2010, a leaked memo from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services revealed that the agency was exploring ""meaningful immigration reform absent legislative action."" Though an agency spokesman later characterized the memo as an ""internal draft,"" the legality of such measures was not in question.

Defer action

The president's most practical route to fewer deportations would be to broaden the number of immigrants eligible for deferred action. In 2012, his administration announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, aimed at helping those brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Not only has the program allowed 455,000 young immigrants the freedom to live and work openly, it has withstood legal challenges as well. The Washington Post has noted that this program could be expanded to include other discrete classes of people, such as the parents of citizen children, victims of domestic abuse, or whistle-blowers.

Show some courage

Although Obama said last month on Telemundo that expanding the program would be ""very difficult to defend legally,"" that is not true; it would just be very difficult to defend politically. Immigration reform activists have engaged in civil disobedience nationwide. Isn't it time the president display similar courage?

""I believe this president will be tempted ... to issue an executive order,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said in August, ""like he did for the DREAM Act kids a year ago, where he basically legalizes 11 million people by the sign of a pen."" The website PolitiFact judged this statement ""mostly false."" On his own, the president cannot offer citizenship, a path to citizenship, or permanent relief from deportation. He can take limited action to make our system more humane.

True, any executive action on immigration will anger conservative lawmakers. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., told USA TODAY that this ""would effectively kill immigration reform."" Yet Goodlatte and other House Republicans are already effectively killing immigration reform with their inaction. A unilateral move by the president might goad GOP lawmakers into actual legislating.

If Obama believes immigration reform still has a chance, he should not be deporting those who might be eligible for a path to citizenship. If he has given up on reform, he has every reason to move ahead with executive action. Either way, the right choice is to cut back on deportations.

“The president’s absolutely not telling the truth when he said the Secret Service made that decision to cut [the White House] tours,” Bongino said. “That’s the core of it: he is not telling the truth.”

In an interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos, Obama said the decision, made as a part of sequestration, was not one “that went up to the White House.”

“But what the Secret Service explained to us was that they’re going to have to furlough some folks,” Obama said in the interview. What furloughs mean is–is that people lose a day of work and a day of pay. And, you know, the question for them is, you know, how deeply do they have to furlough their staff and is it worth it to make sure that we’ve got White House tours that means that you got a whole bunch of families who are depending on a paycheck who suddenly are seeing a 5% or 10%–reduction in their pay. Well, what I’m asking them is are there ways, for example, for us to accommodate school groups–you know, who may have traveled here with some bake sales. Can we make sure that- kids, potentially, can–can still come to tour?”

Bongino, who served 12 years in the Secret Service including five years working directly at the White House before leaving to run as a Republican for U.S. Senate in Maryland, said Obama is lying because the Secret Service does not make such decisions.

“The Secret Service does not make political decisions,” Bongino said. “The Secret Service makes security decisions. His statement that it was a Secret Service decision internal budget decision–and keep in mind, I’m not speaking for the Secret Service, I’m speaking from experience of being with them. All he’d have to do is cancel one or two of his political trips and his Martha’s Vineyard vacation, which two years ago I was on and helped coordinate, he would save that money times ten. There was just no way this was a sound decision. To insinuate this is the first administration where the White House social office and the Executive Office of the President had no role in cancelling public tours at the White House, that he was the first president who was left out of the decision, is absolute nonsense.”

Bongino said he thinks the president is using “the Washington Monument strategy”–a ploy by a politician who tries to garner public opposition to spending cuts by eliminating popular public services first–in doing this to White House tours. “He wanted to inflict, there is no question in my mind, maximum pain upon the American people. But here’s the caveat: it had to be public pain. If you don’t see it, it doesn’t hurt.”

But Bongino said all the public pressure Obama has taken for the decision to cancel the tours caused the ploy to “backfire.” Regardless, the ex Secret Service agent who served three years at the George W. Bush White House and two years at Obama’s White House said Obama still will not admit he was wrong and is now trying to blame the Secret Service for his own behavior.

“Instead of coming clean and being honest with the American people that your office and likely you as well had a role in this, he’s again pulling the wool over your eyes just like he’s done on Benghazi, the immigration release [of thousands of illegal immigrants] where he said he didn’t know and Janet Napolitano said she didn’t know, this is nonsense,” Bongino said. “These are not security or budget decisions. These are strictly political decisions. Make no mistake about it.”

Bongino said the Secret Service is not correcting Obama because the agency has “a great, elite group of guys and they’re always going to take it on the chin.”

“I don’t speak for them but they’re obviously a patriotic group of men and women and they’re not lying when they say there will be overtime costs saved so it’s not like they’re being disingenuous,” Bongino said. “They’re trying to cover for this guy, I think, because they know it looks bad and they don’t want to get involved in the politics and I don’t blame them.”"
http://news.yahoo.com/weiner-spitzer-political-comebacks-fall-flat-074935096--politics.html,,[],"Weiner, Spitzer political comebacks fall flat","NEW YORK (AP) — Anthony Weiner's ill-fated mayoral campaign ended with a string of final embarrassments: He mustered a mere 5 percent at the ballot box. One of his sexting partners tried to crash his primary night rally. And Weiner was caught making an obscene gesture to reporters as he was driven away.

Outside a ""victory"" party where supporters mourned a disappointing fifth-place finish in the Democratic primary, cameras crowded around Sydney Leathers, the 23-year-old whose sexting with the former congressman brought his once-high-flying campaign to a screeching halt.

""Why not be here?"" Leathers asked reporters. ""I'm kind of the reason he's losing. So, might as well show up.""

Another politician with a sex scandal, Eliot Spitzer, lost the Democratic primary contest for city comptroller to Scott Stringer, the Manhattan borough president. Stringer took 52 percent of the vote to Spitzer's 48 percent.

Spitzer resigned as governor in 2008 and admitted he paid for sex with call girls. In exile, he bounced around television as a pundit. Then, just four days before the deadline, he announced he was running for comptroller.

On the final campaign day for both men, the spotlight fell heavily on Weiner. His staff sneaked him into his own event, presumably to avoid Leathers, who had camped outside his headquarters all day hoping to confront him. His wife, Huma Abedin, who stood by his side at the height of the scandal, was nowhere to be seen.

And after a concession speech in which he got choked up as he spoke of family, a scowling Weiner was caught by a photographer giving a middle-finger goodbye to reporters as he was driven away.

Leathers, who has launched a porn career since the scandal broke, said Weiner needed ""to stop being an embarrassment to the city of New York. He's going to continue this behavior. If it's not going to be me, it's going to be some other girl.""

At one point, one of Weiner's supporters scolded Leathers, saying: ""You must really be ashamed!""

Story continues

For his part, Weiner acknowledged in his concession speech that he was an ""imperfect messenger"" but also boasted of the staying power of himself and his campaign.

Weiner had been in political exile since he resigned from Congress in 2011 for sending women lewd online messages and pictures. He got into the mayor's race in May, and aside from a few dust-ups with hecklers, was largely well-received at first, holding the lead for most of June and July.

But after an obscure gossip website named The Dirty released X-rated exchanges between Weiner and Leathers that took place well after the candidate quit the House of Representatives, Weiner — and his sexting pseudonym, Carlos Danger — once again became a national punchline.

With 98 percent of precincts reporting Wednesday morning, Weiner was far behind in the city's Democratic mayoral primary. Public Advocate Bill de Blasio had 40 percent of the vote, the threshold needed to avoid triggering an automatic Oct. 1 runoff. If he cannot maintain that, he will face former city Comptroller Bill Thompson, who has 26 percent, for a potentially grueling three-week showdown, with the winner advancing to face Republican nominee Joe Lhota in the general election.

Spitzer took a steadier path to his loss. He took an early lead in the polls, but the race tightened dramatically in recent weeks as the Democratic establishment rallied around Stringer, his main opponent.

Unlike Weiner, who made a point of fielding voters' questions about his scandal, Spitzer apologized a few times and then refused to talk about it.

He largely eschewed retail campaigning — situations that could have led to awkward exchanges with voters — in favor of national TV interviews and a big television ad campaign, financed with his own millions.

But he could not avoid all mention of the scandal. The city's tabloids hounded him about the state of his marriage; Spitzer said he was still married, but his wife never appeared on the campaign trail.

""All of us should serve, participate,"" Spitzer told supporters in his concession speech. ""I intend to do so in different ways.""

I may as well have stayed here.

You know that the faltering American idol in the White House must be reeling in this scandalous spring. No Drama Obama is immersed in drama so over the top it could have been scripted by Shonda Rhimes and Karl Rove.

Just four months after his second inauguration, the president is buffeted by gushing investigations, smug and deranged Republicans, and cat-who-ate-the-canary conspiracists. The man who promised in 2008 to make government cool again is instead batting away charges that he has made government “Nixonian” again.

Asked about that on Thursday, Obama might have tried a little J.F.K. wit to dismiss the ridiculous assertion. Instead, he played the pill, as he too often does, huffily telling reporters, “Well, I’ll let you guys engage in those comparisons, and you can go ahead and read the history, I think, and draw your own conclusions.”"

FBI investigating allegations Sen. Menendez patronized prostitutes in Dominican Republic

A team of FBI agents has been conducting interviews in recent weeks in the Dominican Republic and the United States, looking into allegations that Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) patronized prostitutes in the Caribbean nation, but has found no evidence to support the claim, according to two people familiar with the investigation.

One person said agents have asked about whether a Florida eye doctor — a close friend and major campaign donor to Menendez — provided the senator with prostitutes on vacations there. Another person said investigators are looking into allegations involving underage prostitutes and sex parties.

The two, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an active investigation, said FBI agents are following leads provided by an unknown tipster. In a series of e-mails with the FBI, the tipster alleged that the doctor, Salomon Melgen, had made prostitutes available to Menendez while he was staying at his friend’s resort home in the Dominican Republic. The tipster, in particular, mentioned young prostitutes and prostitution parties.

The FBI agents are also examining the role Menendez played in advocating for a port security contract in the Dominican Republic that would benefit Melgen, two people familiar with the case said. Menendez has urged U.S. officials to put pressure on the Dominican government to enforce the dormant contract, saying enhanced port security is important for interdicting drug trafficking. Melgen is an investor in the company holding the contract.

FBI spokesman Michael Leverock, of the bureau’s field office in Miami, declined to comment for this article.

Menendez has vehemently denied the prostitution allegations, calling them false “smears.”

“As we have said all along, Senator Menendez welcomes any review because his actions have been appropriate, and we believe the facts will confirm that,” a Menendez aide said Friday.

The staff member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the senator’s efforts on behalf of the port deal were appropriate. “The senator has had a long history of advocating for increased port security across the world,” the aide said.

Melgen and his attorneys declined to comment on any criminal investigation.

The relationship between Menendez and Melgen has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks. Menendez acknowledged this month that he had failed to properly disclose two trips he took in 2010 on Melgen’s private plane to Melgen’s villa, near the resort of Casa de Campo. The senator said he wrote Melgen a personal check for $58,500 to reimburse him for the plane rides last month. The Senate Ethics Committee is investigating the matter.

Separately, Melgen is under criminal investigation over allegations of Medicare fraud. Three people with knowledge of the probe disclosed this week that it focuses on whether Melgen defrauded the government by overcharging Medicare for millions of dollars in eye injections and billing the government for treatments that were unnecessary.

The FBI and the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General raided Melgen’s Palm Beach eye clinic Jan. 29, searching records and collecting boxes of documents. The raid came days after the tipster’s e-mail exchange with the FBI was posted anonymously on a Web site.

Melgen’s attorney said this client was cooperating with authorities in the Medicare investigation and declined to answer further questions.

“At this time it would be inappropriate to comment about the ongoing investigation,” said the attorney, Kirk Ogrosky.

In checking into the prostitution allegations, FBI agents are examining claims initially made in a series of letters the tipster wrote last spring to staff members at a government watchdog group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), according to the two people familiar with their inquiries.

The claims were also carried on a conservative news Web site, the Daily Caller.

CREW’s executive director Melanie Sloan said her staff could not get the tipster to agree to meet or speak on the telephone. As a result, Sloan told a Washington Post reporter last month, she had doubts about the credibility of the person’s claims. The FBI began looking into the tipster’s story after CREW forwarded his information to the Justice Department and the FBI’s Washington field office in July.

Prostitution is not illegal in the Dominican Republic. But soliciting underage prostitutes is illegal. Also, a politician who accepts free gifts and special favors in exchange for official acts can face criminal prosecution for abuse of public office.

The allegations in the letters included the names of a few women who allegedly had improper relations with Menendez and Melgen, including that of a Dominican teenager who told a local television station she had no involvement and had never left her village.

The Miami Herald reached another one of the women for an interview, and she explained that she worked for Melgen and considered him a generous person but did not elaborate. An attorney for the woman, Svitlana Buchyk, told a Post reporter Friday that the tipster’s claims about her are “absurd.”

“Ms. Buchyk is an actress and model attending to her career,” said her attorney, Gerald Greenberg. “Any allegation that she had an improper relationship with Senator Menendez or anyone else is sheer nonsense. The claims about her that have appeared in fringe-media sources are irresponsible and utterly absurd.”

Greenberg declined to discuss whether his client had been interviewed by law enforcement officials.

In an e-mail to the tipster in September, FBI agent Regino Chavez wrote, “If you can give me . . . information on all the young ladies who were victimized that would be helpful.” The agent repeatedly asked the tipster, who called himself Pete Williams and only corresponded by e-mail, to meet, but he declined.

According to FBI affidavits filed in court, Chavez was listed last year as a member of a task force based out of the Miami field office that specialized in tracking crimes involving abuse of minors, soliciting minors to engage in prostitution and sex trafficking.

(Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images)

As the fifth day of the federal government shutdown began, members of the House came together in a moment of rare bipartisanship to pass a bill, by a vote of 407 to 0, approving back pay for furloughed government workers.

President Obama has expressed his support for the measure.

Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid supports the measure, but said Saturday that if furloughed workers are guaranteed back pay, there’s no reason to keep them out of work.

“It’s really cruel to tell workers they’ll receive back pay once the government opens and then refuse to open the government,” Reid said on the Senate floor, suggesting that House Republicans have authorized a “paid vacation” for furloughed workers.

After the House vote, Republican leaders called on Senate Democrats and the president to extend the same courtesy to other groups of Americans hurt by the shutdown.

“If it’s important to ease the pain for [federal employees], what about the vets?” House Majority Leader Rep. Eric I.Cantor (R-Va.) said. “Do the Democrats not feel it’s important to ease the pain on them?”

“What about the sick children who need access to clinical trials?” Cantor continued.

The House has passed several bills providing funding for the National Institutes of Health and other areas of the federal government that have been financially weakened since the shutdown began Tuesday. The Senate has rejected each bill, insisting on a so-called “clean” funding bill that will reopen all parts of the government.

President Obama cancelled his scheduled trip Thursday to Indonesia for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation conference, citing his need to remain in Washington to help undo the congressional deadlock.

House Majority Whip Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) called it a “unique opportunity” for both parties to break the impasse.

“If he’s here this weekend, we’re here this weekend. This can all end,” McCarthy said Saturday.

In a separate House measure Saturday, lawmakers voted 400 to 1 in favor of a bill allowing military chaplains the ability to minister on Sunday without breaking a federal law that forbids furloughed government employees from working.

The sole vote against the measure came from Rep. Bill Enyart (D-Ill.), a 35-year veteran of the U.S. armed forces who retired last year as an adjunct general of the Illinois National Guard.

“I am not going to vote for any more bills designed to allow people to hide behind the flag – or the cross,” Enyart said in a statement.

Enyart affirmed his support for U.S. service members, but said that he will not vote for what he called “feel-good bills” that only reverse shutdown implications for small groups of people.

“This is no way to govern,” Enyart said.

It’s unclear if or when the Senate will take up the bill."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/07/27/Sequester-Politics-Dems-Set-to-Blame-GOP-for-Budget-Cuts-Potential-Gov-t-Shutdown,2013-07-27 00:00:00,['Tony Lee'],"Sequester Politics: Dems Set to Blame GOP for Budget Cuts, Potential Gov't Shutdown","Just as they did with the sequester, Democrats will try to blame Republicans for a potential government shutdown or cuts to the budget that may occur as part of a new debt deal this fall.

Politico reported that, “President Barack Obama and his Democratic allies are eager to tag the GOP as the root cause of Washington dysfunction.” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Executive Director Kelly Ward told the publication that Democrats are planning to highlight “the inability of Republicans to actually govern” and make that into a central “narrative” going into the 2014 midterm elections.

Even though the sequester idea originated in the White House, as Bob Woodward documented, Obama and Democrats tried to blame Republicans for the calamity that it would cause. Those tactics largely backfired, as a majority of Americans favored the across-the-board budget cuts.

Yet House Republicans and their advisers still remain fearful of Democrats and their tactics that have just recently failed, believing that a government shutdown over de-funding Obamacare or budget cuts would lose Republicans the House.

Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK), a former National Republican Congressional Committee chairman, said, “If you ask me what is the one thing that could reshuffle the deck on an otherwise stable mid-term environment in 2014, the answer is a government shutdown.” Brock McCleary, a GOP pollster and former NRCC deputy executive director, agreed, saying the “only way Republicans will lose the House is to shut down the government or default on the debt.”

The current continuing resolution to fund the government expires on Sept. 30, and the nation is set to hit its borrowing limit shortly after. Republicans have a 17-seat majority in the House and only four Republicans represent Districts that lean Democratic, which means Republicans will be more vulnerable from the right. Republican voters in most Republican House Districts want them to be more fiscally conservative and de-fund Obamacare.

Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-SC) said his voters would “rather see Republicans veer more to the right” on fiscal matters, and Chris Chocola, the president of the Club for Growth, said, “the greatest risk for Republicans is for them to continue to disappoint their supporters. I don’t think they’ve inspired them or given them a reason to support them in quite a while.”

“At some point, they have to communicate to people there is a difference between Republicans and Democrats,” he told the publication."

She Joined The Post In Time Magazine', 'Has Also Worked At The Los Angeles Times.']",Obama’s approval drops as Americans take a dimmer view of his economic policies,"The afterglow of President Obama’s reelection and inauguration appears to have vanished as increasingly negative views among Americans about his stewardship of the economy have forced his public approval rating back down to the 50 percent mark, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.

In December, just after he won a second term, Obama held an 18-percentage-point advantage over congressional Republicans on the question of whom the public trusted more to deal with the economy. Now, it’s a far more even split — 44 percent to 40 percent, with a slight edge for the president — but the share of those saying they have confidence in “neither” has ticked up into double digits.

The poll contains ample evidence of the disillusionment voters feel toward both sides amid a sense of continuing dysfunction in Washington, which since December has been grappling with fiscal crises and deadlines of its own making.

Almost two weeks into the automatic across-the-board budget cuts known as the sequester, a slim majority of Americans dis­approve of the reductions. At the same time, nearly three-quarters say they are feeling no impact on their lives, and fewer than half expect a toll on their family finances if the cuts continue.

Still, large majorities expect that the sequester will eventually damage the economy, the military and the government’s ability to provide basic services. Most, 68 percent, say they would like the two sides to work together to come up with a deal to stop the cuts. The desire for cooperation is widely shared across party lines.

View Graphic Obama’s reelection honeymoon ends

Asked who is responsible for the sequester, 47 percent say Republicans in Congress and 33 percent say Obama.

The poll suggests a closer divide on which side the public trusts in the battles over issues such as immigration and gun control — closer, perhaps, than the public’s policy preferences would indicate. Americans largely support the administration’s stand on new measures to curb gun violence, but on basic trust on the issue, the president and Republicans in Congress fare about evenly.

Obama’s overall job-approval rating stands at 50 percent, down five points from before he took the oath of office in January. Looking along partisan lines, the slippage since then has been particularly pronounced among political independents. Two months ago, independents tilted clearly in his direction, with 54 percent approving and 41 percent disapproving. Now, half of independents express a negative opinion of the president’s performance; just 44 percent approve.

The president has also seen an erosion in confidence among groups that he has counted as core supporters. Compared with a Post-ABC poll in December, the share of liberals who place their faith in Obama over Republicans when it comes to dealing with the economy is 14 points lower; there has been a 12-point slide among women.

At 50 percent, Obama’s overall standing in the poll is lower than that of most other modern second-term presidents at this point in their terms. Of the seven second-term presidents who have been in office since Harry S. Truman, only George W. Bush had a positive rating as low as 50 percent at this stage.

Obama and Bush share another similarity, one that describes what is arguably the most potent force shaping political decision-making in recent years: a deeply divided electorate. Among post-World War II presidents, Bush and Obama are the only ones to have led a nation as politically polarized as it is today. In both cases, there is a gap of more than 70 points between Democratic and Republican assessments of the president.

Congress remains far lower than the president in public esteem, with only 16 percent approving of its performance and 80 percent disapproving. That negative feeling extends to both parties, with congressional Democrats registering a ratio of 34 percent favorable to 62 percent unfavorable sentiment; Republicans are lower still, at 24 to 72.

The poll was conducted March 7 to 10 among a random sample of 1,001 adults. The full survey has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

At a moment when the statistics — a booming stock market and surprising new strength in the job market — suggest a more vigorous economy, many Americans are not themselves seeing progress.

Barely more than half of those surveyed say the economy has started its recovery. And after a brief foray into neutral territory, most Americans again give Obama negative marks on handling the economy. The personal assessments of the economy’s trajectory relate directly to Obama’s overall rating: Seventy-three percent of those who say they sense economic growth approve of the way the president is doing his job, and an identical 73 percent of those who don’t see a recovering economy disapprove of his performance in office.

As they do on the economy, the president and the Republican opposition have rough parity on the question of who is better positioned on gun control, with Obama the choice of 42 percent and congressional Republicans, 41 percent.

On immigration, Obama has a six-point advantage, with 45 percent saying they trust him more and 39 percent expressing greater confidence in the Republicans’ approach. The margin may be surprisingly slender, given big majority support for a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants and strong Latino support for Obama in the November election.

Nor does the election seem to have produced a lasting consensus on which side is better equipped to figure out what government spending should be cut and what services preserved. When it comes to finding the right balance, 44 percent side with Republicans and 43 percent with the president.

The poll also confirms one of the political verities of deficit reduction: People may want to see an end to red ink, but there is rarely public support for reductions in popular social programs to achieve it.

Asked about alternatives to the automatic cuts now in place, 71 percent reject a reduction in Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, and 60 percent oppose raising the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67.

There is broader but still limited support for slicing business tax deductions. Most, 56 percent, say they back limiting tax deductions for high-income earners as part of a path out of the sequester. Tax reform is often considered a quid pro quo for reining in entitlement spending, which is a long-term driver of deficit spending.

A Post-ABC News poll last week found broad opposition to the across-the-board cuts to the military that started March 1 with the sequester, but there is majority support in the new survey for more targeted defense cuts.

""I can assure you that I certainly did not know anything about the (inspector general) report"" beforehand, Obama said Thursday.

The president, though, did not say whether he was previously aware of the IRS' actions, which allegedly started as early as 2010, well before the inspector general's office began to investigate. Republican lawmakers were inquiring about the alleged targeting of Tea Party groups by the IRS more than a year ago.

Obama, who spoke during a press conference alongside the Turkish prime minister, focused his remarks specifically on the IG report, noting that he wouldn't have caught wind of that report since those investigations are typically kept under wraps. He reiterated that he found the agency's actions ""unacceptable"" and sought to fix the problem ""the minute"" he found out about it. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney has previously said no one in the White House knew about the practice.

The comments were the latest effort by the White House to tamp down the controversy.

More On This...

After his press conference, Obama announced the appointment of White House budget official Daniel Werfel as the next acting IRS commissioner. This comes after Obama announced Wednesday that acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller would resign -- though Miller was apparently set to step down anyway.

An official close to Miller told Fox News, shortly after Obama's brief announcement, that the IRS chief was ""set to resign the position of acting commission as of early June."" He was planning to leave the IRS entirely a ""couple of months later, regardless of the current controversy,"" the source said.

These details were not mentioned by the president as he announced Wednesday evening Miller was resigning. Obama spoke following a meeting with Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and other top department officials in which they reviewed a highly critical inspector general’s report on the practice. The report concluded poor management allowed agents to improperly target Tea Party and other groups for more than 18 months, starting in 2010.

Obama said Lew asked for the resignation and Miller agreed, after being on the job since November 2012.

“Americans have a right to be angry about it, and I’m angry about it,” Obama said from the White House.

Republicans, who along with Democrats have slammed the IRS for the practice, welcomed the resignation Wednesday but made clear they would continue to investigate and press for accountability.

Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., said the resignation ""is a necessary first step but more heads need to roll.""

Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., reacting to the claim that Miller was leaving anyway, said it seemed like he was a ""perfect scapegoat"" for the administration.

Miller’s resignation was part of three-step plan Obama outlined to fix the problem.

The other steps are to put in place the safeguards recommended in the IG report and to work with Congress as it investigates.

“The good news is we can fix this,” Obama said.

Miller became acting commissioner after Commissioner Douglas Shulman completed his five-year term. Shulman had been appointed by President George W. Bush.

The president has proceeded cautiously since the IRS controversy was made public Friday. While he initially said the accusations were ""outrageous,"" he also said he wanted to wait until the report was released before addressing what should be done to hold accountable those responsible.

The report lays much of the blame on IRS supervisors in Washington who oversaw a group of specialists in Cincinnati who screened applications for tax-exempt status. It does not indicate that Washington initiated the targeting of conservative groups, but it does say a top supervisor in Washington did not adequately supervise agents in the field even after she learned the agents were acting improperly.

The Justice Department is also investigating the IRS targeting, as are three congressional committees.

Sources told Fox News that Miller will remain on the job ""for a couple of weeks.""

The House Ways and Means Committee said after the announcement of Miller's resignation that he still will attend a hearing Friday.

And the House Committee on Oversight and Government Affairs sent a letter Wednesday afternoon to the IRS requesting five employees named in the IG audit be made available for transcribed interviews by committee staff.

The Republican-led committee wants to start the interviews Monday.

The names and titles of the IRS employees requested are Holly Paz, a director; John Shafer, a manager; Gary Muthert, a screener; Liz Hofacre, a case coordinator; and Joseph Herr, a manager.

""The resignation of Steven Miller is a positive and important step as this agency struggles to try to regain the public’s trust,"" said Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee. ""A clean slate at the IRS with new leadership is imperative to fix this egregious encroachment on the lives of honest, hard-working Americans whose only sin was that they want to express their beliefs.""

Earlier in the day, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney sidestepped a question about whether Obama still had confidence in Miller, saying he wouldn't discuss personnel matters. He said Obama has expressed his overall view that IRS personnel had acted inappropriately.

""He wants to see that the actions taken, as revealed by the Treasury report, that are inappropriate, are met with consequences,"" Carney said. ""He will make clear to Treasury Department leaders that he expects action.""

Carney said Obama wants the public to ""understand and believe that the IRS applies our tax laws in a neutral and fair way to everyone.""

“Private capital should take a bigger role in the mortgage market. I know that sounds confusing to folks who call me a socialist,” the president said. “But I actually believe in the free market.” (His prepared remarks had invoked “folks who call me a raging socialist every day.”)



And “our housing system should operate where there’s a limited government role, and private lending should be the backbone of the housing market. And that includes, by the way, community-based lenders who view their borrowers not just as a number, but as a neighbor,” Obama said.

The president railed against massive government bailouts like those of Fannie and Freddie, which reaped vast profits in the housing boom — then got taxpayer rescue packages when the bubble burst in 2008.

“We can’t leave taxpayers on the hook for irresponsibility or bad decisions by some of these lenders or Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac,” he said. “We’ve got to encourage the pursuit of profit — but the era of expecting a bailout after you pursue your profit and you don’t manage your risk well, well that puts the whole country at risk. And we’re ending those days. We’re not going to do that anymore.”

As he started his remarks, someone in the crowd at Desert Vista High School shouted out “happy birthday, Mr. President!” and the audience sang “Happy Birthday” to him. Obama, whose birthday was Aug. 4, noted that he was now 52, but “Michelle says I don’t look a day over 51.”

The school is in Phoenix, Ariz., which was particularly hard hit when the housing bubble burst. Obama noted that ""the storm hit harder here"" as the crisis ripped through the nation's economy. In recent weeks, the White House has cautiously welcomed news that the housing sector is on the mend. There have been hopeful signs in Arizona, though there's a long road ahead.

On Wednesday, Obama is to take part in a roundtable with Zillow CEO Spencer Rascoff, with questions coming from across social media. To ask questions for the roundtable, which will stream live on Yahoo, visit our Homes section here."

A former Chicago-area executive is blowing the whistle in the latest case to showcase what is derisively known as the ""Illinois way"" -- politicians' practice of doing business by dishing out favors to friends who contribute generously to their campaigns.

This time, a top-ranking Democrat has been implicated. The case involves Illinois' most powerful Democratic leader -- state House Speaker Michael Madigan -- and the former head of the Chicago area's commuter rail service, Metra. In a rare move earlier this week, Metra's ex-CEO Alex Clifford came forward publicly to reveal specific details about how he says he was forced out of his lucrative job after refusing to cave to political pressure.

Clifford, who was hired from California in 2001, testified during a recent Regional Transportation Authority board meeting in Chicago. For two hours he spoke openly about what he calls serious ""ethical and moral character flaws"" from people who practice the ""Illinois way"" of doing business, including Madigan.

Clifford claims Madigan specifically wanted a pay raise for a Metra employee, Patrick Ward, who has been a generous contributor to Madigan's campaign, according to state records. Clifford testified: ""What is it that he (Ward) was doing so great and so different than other employees at Metra who have gone three years without a pay raise that would make this person special?""

Clifford ultimately rejected the request. In a statement, Madigan acknowledged sending a ""recommendation to Metra senior staff that Mr. Ward be considered for a salary adjustment. ... When notified Mr. Clifford had concerns about the appearance of the recommendation coming from my office, I withdrew the request.""

During a trip to the state Capitol in Springfield, Clifford says he was asked by Democratic state lawmaker Rep. Luis Arroyo to consider hiring somebody the Latino caucus sends him. Clifford says he told Arroyo ""we have a process. Times are different today at Metra than they were under my predecessor. Every applicant, every employee will come in through the front door.""

Clifford went on to point fingers at those who intentionally ""railroaded"" him into a poor performance evaluation which led to the end of his contract -- specifically Metra Chairman Brad O'Hallaron and another Metra board member. When Clifford approached O'Hallaron about his upcoming contract he claims O'Hallaron responded, ""but we're just dating."" Then said, ""I need to get a meeting with Mr. Madigan and I need to find out what kind of damage you've caused to our potential for future funding.""

When it was his turn to testify, O'Hallaron denied Clifford's accusations. O'Hallaron told the RTA board: ""If as alleged by Clifford I was seeking to protect Speaker Madigan, why would I take his allegations immediately over to the OEIG (Office of Executive Inspector General) if I thought there was pressure from Speaker Madigan? It just doesn't make sense.""

Clifford did not get the necessary votes to renew his contract earlier this year, but he left Metra with a $700,000 severance deal that some have characterized as ""hush money"" to keep Clifford quiet after threatening a lawsuit. Clifford denies that claim and says the money was ""100 percent about my ability to get a job and how I've been damaged.""

Metra announced on Friday that it plans to hire a well-known former federal prosecutor in Chicago to perform an independent investigation into Clifford's allegations and make recommendations concerning Metra's hiring and contract policies. Metra's board of directors must approve the hiring at a special meeting on Monday.

The man who oversees Illinois' government watchdog group says even though there was no illegal activity involved with the Metra scandal, the case has lawmakers squirming a bit more than usual.

""This is a very big deal, this is the first time in anyone's memory that Speaker Madigan has been implicated so directly in the workings of a public agency,"" Better Government Association President Andy Shaw said. ""Madigan and hundreds if not thousands (of politicians) do this every day. We just don't hear about it very often, because it happens behind closed doors.""

Shaw admits any hope for changing this type of behavior has to come from voters. ""This is only going to change in one of two ways. People coming out to vote and deciding who represents them. And secondly when a groundswell of public outrage forces public officials to impose higher ethics standards upon themselves.""

Illinois' history with questionable political ethics is rich. The state practically became the poster child for corruption during the criminal trial of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich. Blagojevich attempted to sell off Barack Obama's coveted U.S. Senate seat in return for hefty campaign donations referencing it in the now infamous phone call saying, ""I've got this thing and it's f------ golden and I'm not giving it up for f------ nothing.""

Blagojevich is currently serving out his 14-year sentence in federal prison in Colorado."

Apparently the president thinks he can furlough reality when talking about the debt limit. To suggest that raising the debt limit doesn’t incur more debt is laughably absurd. The very reason why you raise the debt limit is so that you can incur more debt. Otherwise what’s the point?

It’s also shameful to see him scaremongering the markets with his talk of default. There is no way we can default if we follow the Constitution. The Fourteenth Amendment, Section 4, requires that we service our debt first. We currently collect more than enough tax revenue to service our debt if we do that first. However, we don’t have enough money to continue to finance our ever-growing federal government (with our $17 trillion dollar national debt that has increased over 50% since Obama took office). That’s why President Obama wants to increase the debt limit. He doesn’t want to make the tough decisions to rein in government spending. So, he’s scaremongering the markets about default, just as he tries to scaremonger our senior citizens about their Social Security, which, by the way, is funded by the Social Security Trust Fund and is solvent through 2038.

It’s time for the president to be honest with the American people for a change. Defaulting on our national debt is an impeachable offense, and any attempt by President Obama to unilaterally raise the debt limit without Congress is also an impeachable offense. A default would also be a shameful lack of leadership, just as mindlessly increasing our debt without trying to rein in spending is a betrayal of our children and grandchildren who will be stuck with the bill.

Uh, no. Neither budget, thanks.

So if you are the party committees in charge of electing Democrats in 2014, and your base is up in arms over President Barack Obama's unforced error on his budget's Social Security cuts, what do you do?

If you're smart, like the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, you say nothing (at least so far). Why rub salt in the wounds of your strongest supporters? But if you're the guys at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, you ask them to cheer louder. In an email blast:



What does backfire look like? Instead of compromising to get solutions on the budget, NRCC Chairman Greg Walden outrageously attacked parts of President Obama’s budget proposal that were included at the demand of Republicans.""

Ah yes, DCCC, your supporters are outraged that Republicans won't applaud the cutting of Social Security benefits—cuts, by the way, that weren't even included in Paul Ryan's draconian cut-everything-else budget. I'm sure that brought in the dough from outraged Democratic donors desperate for ""compromise"" with recalcitrant Republicans!

But the DCCC isn't the only one stepping off the cliff with the president. The Democratic Governor's Association decided to play lemming as well.



President Obama just released a budget for next year that will reduce the deficit while investing in the things we need to keep our economy competitive for the long-term – like pre-K for four-year olds. On the other side, Paul Ryan and House Republicans have a budget that spends your hard-earned money on tax breaks for the wealthiest, ends Medicare and Social Security as we know them, and slashes other critical programs. Stand with us in supporting President Obama’s budget and say no to Paul Ryan’s disaster of a plan.

There's no doubt that Ryan's budget is a piece of shit, but if you're going to be outraged at cuts in Ryan's budget (which again, doesn't include the president's chained CPI proposal), then why would you want to stand with Obama's budget?

You wouldn't. A Social Security cut is a Social Security cut, no matter who proposes it. Heck, it's worse when proposed by Democrats. Republicans are assholes. We expect them to slash the safety net. But Democrats? If we stand for anything at all, we stand for taking care of each other.

Sign this petition telling the DCCC and the DGA that that that's what we should be standing for. Not Obama's cut-Social Security budget."

The appearance is “greatly misguided,” ABA Chief Executive Oren Teicher wrote in an open letter to the president. That’s because the online retailer has caused a net loss of jobs, the organization argues, while President Obama’s goal is to promote his plan for a stronger economy.

Obama’s tour is called “A Better Bargain for the Middle Class.”

Amazon has just announced that it will add 7,000 jobs -- 2,000 of those seasonal -- at its regional shipping and customer service centers. The company says its workers make 30% more than traditional retail staffers.

Amazon news releases often make comparative references without sharing specific data. But it’s possible to get a sense of what it will pay its Chattanooga, Tenn., warehouse workers: about $11 per hour, according to the jobs website glassdoor.com.

That’s a bit more than the $8.25 an hour McDonald’s pays its workers -- a wage that even McDonald’s acknowledges needs to be supplemented with a second job to make ends meet, and those “ends” include rent of just $600 and no budget for heat -- but it’s hard to see how an annual salary of less than $23,000 a year is a better bargain for the middle class.

While it’s hard to get people to agree on exactly what a middle-class wage is, in 2011, CNN Money reported that the first decade of the 21st century was the first time in American history that middle-class wages declined: Adjusted for inflation, median household income dropped from $53,164 to $49,445.

A 2012 Pew Research study showed that, on average, Americans think it takes $70,000 for a family of four to be middle class.

Publishers Weekly, the publishing industry trade magazine, quotes Obama deputy press secretary Amy Brundage on the appearance: “The Amazon facility in Chattanooga is a perfect example of the company that is investing in American workers and creating good, high-wage jobs,” she said Friday. “What the president wants to do is to highlight Amazon and the Chattanooga facility as an example of a company that is spurring job growth and keeping our country competitive.”

ABA’s Teicher protests that, writing, “At a time when Main Street retailers, including indie bookstores, show promise of recovering from the recession, we are disheartened to see Amazon touted as a ‘jobs creator’ and its warehouse facility used as a backdrop for an important jobs speech, when, frankly, the exact opposite is true.”

Citing the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, Teicher writes, “Every $10 million in spending that shifts from Main Street retailers to Amazon results in a net loss of 33 retail jobs. That would mean for 2012 alone — using Amazon’s own numbers about its increase in sales — Amazon cost the U.S. economy more than 42,000 jobs just last year!”

Can President Obama be a friend to independent booksellers and Amazon at the same time? He’s been photographed at independent bookstores Prairie Lights in Iowa City and Bunch of Grapes in Martha’s Vineyard. The next time he shows up to shop for books, they may have some less-than-enthusiastic words for him.

(CNN) —

From rising rhetoric between the president and top Republicans over the economy to a marquee Senate campaign showdown, politics are heating up in the summer sun and could boil over in the week ahead.

1. Economic tug of war

With budget showdowns looming, President Barack Obama continues to try to take his case directly to the American people.

The president travels to an Amazon distribution center in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on Tuesday and will again speak on the economy, which remains the top issue on the minds of Americans. The White House touts the address as the first in a series of policy speeches on Obama’s “better bargain for the middle class.”

John King: Obama thinks he’s getting the upper hand

“Tuesday’s speech will focus on manufacturing and high-wage jobs for durable economic growth, and the president will discuss proposals he has laid out to jump-start private-sector job growth and make America more competitive, and will also talk about new ideas to create American jobs,” White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters.

The Chattanooga address follows similar speeches last week where the president’s tone was sharper and more partisan than many had expected.

Obama: I won’t ‘twiddle my thumbs’ waiting for GOP

“If the Republicans don’t agree with me, I want them to lay out their ideas. If they have got a better plan to create jobs, rebuild our infrastructure, to make sure that they have great ports all along the Gulf, come on, let me know what your ideas are,” the president said Thursday in Jacksonville, Florida.

Congressional Republican leaders are pushing right back at the president – with deadlines to continue funding the federal government and raising the nation’s debt ceiling as well the date for implementing a crucial part of Obamacare on the horizon.

Obama touts economic agenda; GOP says he’s ‘all sizzle, no steak’

“Look, this president is a terrific campaigner. We all recognize that. He has got a way with words, too. But at some point campaign season has to end and the `working with others’ season has to begin,” Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor Thursday morning.

“His speech turned out to be all sizzle and no steak, that’s assuming there’s any sizzle left after you’ve reheated this thing so many times,” House Speaker John Boehner chimed in later.

With one week left before the congressional summer recess, both Democrats and Republicans will ramp up the rhetoric over the strong possibility of a government shutdown in the autumn. Both sides are pointing fingers in a heated blame game, and the fight will continue into the August recess as the action moves to lawmakers’ home states and districts.

2. Marquee Senate showdown begins

What could ultimately be the most expensive and bitter Senate battle in the 2014 midterm elections formally begins Tuesday when Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes kicks off her Democratic challenge to McConnell, who’s running for a sixth term in the Senate.

In a preview of how nasty things could get, Grimes blames McConnell for greatly contributing to the gridlock in Washington, saying in a video previewing her rollout that the Senate Republican leader is “the biggest part of the problem. He’s wasted decades blocking legislation that would have helped Kentucky and our country. And over the last few years he’s done it for the worst possible reason – out of spite.”

Web wars start in crucial 2014 Senate race

Even before announcing her candidacy this month, Grimes had already come under attack, both by an Internet ad put out by the McConnell campaign that poked fun at the amount of time she was taking to make a decision, and by a pro-McConnell independent group that went up with an ad that called her “Obama’s cheerleader in Kentucky.”

McConnell is known for taking the fight to his political opponents, and he quickly welcomed Grimes to the race by linking her to the president, who is unpopular in Kentucky, a red state in presidential elections.

“Accepting the invitation from countless Washington liberals to become President Obama’s Kentucky candidate was a courageous decision by Alison Lundergan Grimes, and I look forward to a respectful exchange of ideas,” McConnell said in a statement this month.

In her video, Grimes fired back, saying, “I don’t scare easy.”

Next weekend both Grimes and McConnell will attend the annual Fancy Farm picnic in the rural western tip of Kentucky. The picnic is famous as a traditional political gathering that attracts statewide candidates.

Also expected to attend that gathering is Matt Bevins, a Kentucky businessman who a few days ago formally launched a conservative primary challenge to McConnell, adding more political fire to an already combustible race.

3. House GOP to make another statement

Pegged to the scandal involving Internal Revenue Service targeting some political groups for special scrutiny, the GOP-controlled House of Representatives will vote on a series of bills in the week ahead to curb the power of the IRS and other federal agencies.

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor packaged 10 measures for floor votes and dubbed the final week before a monthlong summer recess as “Stop Government Abuse” week.

Republicans to make big push on oversight legislation

In addition to the IRS, another chief target of the Republican legislative push is Obamacare, which the House GOP has continually tried to roll back.

One bill sponsored by Rep. Tom Price, R-Georgia, would prohibit the IRS from implementing any provisions of the health care law. Since the IRS is the agency that would enforce the mandate that individuals must carry health insurance, this legislation essentially hamstrings the program. This bill is the latest in a string of more than three dozen times House Republicans have tried to repeal entirely or change parts of the health care law.

House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the effort, saying, “It is only fitting that Republicans would waste the last week at work this summer voting for the 40th time to repeal the Affordable Care Act and continue their record of no jobs bills, no budget agreement and no solutions for the middle class.”

Many Republicans expressed outrage after IRS employee Lois Lerner was placed on administrative leave but is still being paid, which the current law allows. A GOP bill sponsored by Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pennsylvania, would change that law and allow federal agencies to suspend employees who are under investigation without pay. Other Republican bills would limit bonuses for federal workers and impose a ban on any new IRS conferences until new changes are in place.

One topic the House won’t address before its five-week break is immigration reform. The Senate passed a bipartisan comprehensive immigration bill last month, but Boehner said instead the House will take a “step-by-step” approach but has not given any details yet on when it will vote or what specific measures will be taken up on the floor.

4. Scandals from coast …

It’s the tabloid political blockbuster of the summer: Amid falling poll numbers and a rising “sexting” count, New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner had a horrible week.

Opponent: Weiner is immature, disconnected from the truth

But the former seven-term Democratic representative, who resigned from Congress two years ago following a similar scandal, has so far resisted calls to end his bid for a second chance in politics.

All eyes will be on Weiner in the days ahead. Will Weiner’s poll numbers continue to plunge? Will more women who had inappropriate online relationships with Weiner speak out? Will Weiner’s wife, Huma Abedin, a longtime top adviser to Hillary Clinton, continue to support her husband’s bid for political redemption?

Weiner acknowledged Sunday that campaign manager Danny Kedem has left his team.

A lot of questions remain, and as of now, Weiner’s still giving answers.

Weiner says he has no response to Sidney Leathers

“But there’s going to reach a point fairly soon that I’m going to say I think I’ve said enough about it, and I’m going to keep just talking about other things,” Weiner told reporters Friday.

Stay tuned.

5. … to coast

On the left coast, it’s a similar story as another former Democratic congressman is facing calls to quit. San Diego Mayor Bob Filner is dealing with an explosion of sexual harassment allegations.

Filner said Friday he will take a two-week hiatus for “intensive counseling.” His move came one day after fellow Democrats called for his resignation.

Amid calls to resign, embattled Filner to enter clinic

Saying he had apologized to his staff, the citizens and the “women I have offended,” the mayor said, “It is simply not acceptable to explain away my conduct as the product of the standards of a different generation.”

On Thursday, the San Diego County Democratic Party voted 34-6 to ask the mayor to step down. Seven women have said they were targets of the mayor’s advances.

A group has begun a campaign aimed at getting more than the 100,000 signatures needed to try and recall Filner, who was a five-term congressman before being elected mayor last year.

One speaker was paid %2417%2C000 to discuss %27leadership through art%27

IRS employees told investigators Washington officials told them to scrutinize conservative groups

WASHINGTON (AP) — A government watchdog has found that the Internal Revenue Service spent about $50 million to hold at least 220 conferences for employees between 2010 and 2012, a House committee said Sunday.

The chairman of that committee, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., also released excerpts of congressional investigators' interviews with employees of the IRS office in Cincinnati. Issa said the interviews indicated the employees were directed by Washington to subject tea party and other conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status to tough scrutiny.

The excerpts provided no direct evidence that Washington had ordered that screening. The top Democrat on that panel, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, said none of the employees interviewed have so far identified any IRS officials in Washington as ordering that targeting.

The conference spending included $4 million for an August 2010 gathering in Anaheim, Calif., for which the agency did not negotiate lower room rates, even though that is standard government practice, according to a statement by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

Instead, some of the 2,600 attendees received benefits, including baseball tickets and stays in presidential suites that normally cost $1,500 to $3,500 per night. In addition, 15 outside speakers were paid a total of $135,000 in fees, with one paid $17,000 to talk about ""leadership through art,"" the House committee said.

The report by the Treasury Department's inspector general, set to be released Tuesday, comes as the IRS already is facing bipartisan criticism after agency officials disclosed they had targeted tea party and other conservative groups.

Agency officials and the Obama administration have said that treatment was inappropriate, but the political tempest is showing no signs of ebbing and has put the White House on the defensive.

Three congressional committees are investigating, a Justice Department criminal investigation is under way, President Barack Obama has replaced the IRS' acting commissioner and two other top officials have stepped aside.

The Treasury Department released a statement Sunday saying the administration ""has already taken aggressive and dramatic action to reduce conference spending.""

IRS spokeswoman Michelle Eldridge said Sunday that spending on large agency conferences with 50 or more participants fell from $37.6 million in the 2010 budget year to $4.9 million in 2012. The government's fiscal year begins Oct. 1 the previous calendar year.

On Friday, the new acting commissioner, Danny Werfel, released a statement on the forthcoming report criticizing the Anaheim meeting.

""This conference is an unfortunate vestige from a prior era,"" Werfel said. ""While there were legitimate reasons for holding the meeting, many of the expenses associated with it were inappropriate and should not have occurred.""

Issa's committee also released excerpts from interviews congressional investigators conducted last week with two IRS employees from the agency's Cincinnati office. The excerpts omitted the names of those interviewed and provided no specifics about individuals in Washington who may have been involved.

One of the IRS employees said in an excerpt that they were told by a supervisor that the need to collect the reports came from Washington, and said that in early 2010 the Cincinnati office had sent copies of seven of the cases to Washington.

The other said ""all my direction"" came from an official the transcript said was in Washington.

One of the workers also expressed skepticism that the Cincinnati office originated the screening without direction from Washington, according to the excerpts.

Appearing Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Issa said this conflicted with White House comments that have referred to misconduct by IRS workers in Cincinnati. Without naming White House spokesman Jay Carney, Issa said the administration's ""paid liar, their spokesperson"" is ""still making up things about what happens in calling this local rogue.""

He added, ""This is a problem that was coordinated in all likelihood right out of Washington headquarters and we're getting to proving it.""

In briefings with reporters, Carney has not referred to the Cincinnati IRS office as ""rogue.""

""He's good at throwing out outlandish charges but it's unclear what he's saying he lied about,"" White House spokesman Eric Schultz said of Issa's remark.

Cummings said Issa's comments conflicted with a Treasury inspector general's report that provided no evidence that the Cincinnati office received orders on targeting from anyone else.

""Rather than lobbing unsubstantiated conclusions on national television for political reasons, we need to work in a bipartisan way to follow the facts where they lead,"" Cummings said.

The interviews with IRS employees were conducted by Republican and Democratic aides on Issa's committee and also involved aides from both parties from the House Ways and Means Committee.

One of the employees was a lower-level worker while the other was higher-ranked, said one congressional aide, but the committee did not release their names or titles.

The IRS Cincinnati office handles applications from around the country for tax-exempt status. A Treasury inspector general's report in May said employees there began searching for applications from tea party and conservative groups in their hunt for organizations that primarily do work related to election campaigns.

That May report blamed ""ineffective management"" for letting that screening occur for more than 18 months between 2010 and 2012. But that report — and three hearings by congressional committees — have produced no specific evidence that the Cincinnati workers were ordered by anyone in Washington to target conservatives.

The latest report on IRS conferences will be the subject of a hearing Thursday by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

Werfel is scheduled to make his first congressional appearance as acting commissioner Monday when he appears before a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee.

According to congressional aides briefed by the inspector general's office, the IRS did not formally seek competitive bids for the city where the agency's 2010 conference was held, for the event planner who assisted the agency, or for the speakers.

The aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe a confidential congressional briefing, said other benefits given to some attendees at the Anaheim IRS conference included vouchers for free drinks and some tickets to attend Angels baseball games.

Two videos produced by the IRS were shown at the Anaheim conference. In one, agency employees did a parody of ""Star Trek"" while dressed like the TV show's characters; the second shows more than a dozen IRS workers dancing on a stage. The two videos cost the agency more than $50,000 to make, aides said.

The lecturer who spoke about leadership through art produced six paintings of subjects that included Abraham Lincoln, Michael Jordan, the rock singer Bono and the Statue of Liberty, the aides said."

Views of Clinton are far more positive: 70 percent favorable vs. 26 percent unfavorable. That gives him a huge net positive rating (+ 44 points).

The two former presidents and President Obama attended the memorial service for South African leader Nelson Mandela on December 11, and Bush joined Obama on Air Force One for the flight to Johannesburg.

Obama’s favorable rating has been more positive than negative for almost his entire presidency. However, in the last few months, during the botched health care roll-out, opinion of Obama has reversed.

At the end of Bush’s second term he had a 34 percent favorable rating (December 2008), but that’s been increasing the last few years during his retirement.

There’s a large partisan gap in views of Obama and Bush; for example, there’s an 80-point difference in Obama’s favorable rating among Democrats and Republicans. And there’s a 60-point gap in Bush’s positive rating from the two parties.

Eighty-five percent of Democrats have a positive view of Obama, while just five percent of Republicans feel that way.

Likewise, 85 percent of Republicans have a favorable opinion of Bush, while just 25 percent of Democrats agree.

Fully 93 percent of Republicans rate Obama negatively. In contrast, Bush’s unfavorable drops to 74 percent among Democrats.

Presidential Job Performance Comparisons

President Obama ends his fifth year in office under water on his job rating by 12 percentage points: 41 percent of voters approve of the job he’s doing, while 53 percent disapprove.

President Bush ended his fifth year in office in negative territory too, by nine points: 42 percent approved of his job performance and 51 percent disapproved in the Fox News poll conducted mid-December 2005.

Obama’s average approval rating for 2013 is 44 percent, just slightly below the 2005 average approval of 46 percent for Bush.

The Fox News poll is based on landline and cell phone interviews with 1,027 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from December 14-16, 2013. The full poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points."

USA TODAY

President Obama met Wednesday with the top four congressional leaders

House Republicans again attempted piecemeal funding bills to fund popular government services

The shutdown could clash with an impending vote to raise the debt ceiling

WASHINGTON — On the second day of the government shutdown, Congress and the White House drew no closer to resolving the impasse, although President Obama and key congressional leaders held their first meeting to discuss the budget crisis Wednesday afternoon.

Obama met with top four congressional leaders at the White House for a meeting, where leaders reiterated their positions after the meeting: Democrats continue to seek a stopgap funding bill and a debt ceiling increase with no conditions attached, while Republicans continue to mount an effort to seek concessions on the health care law.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Republicans ""keep moving the goal post"" for reaching a deal. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Democrats ""will not negotiate.""

While they called the meeting cordial, earlier in the day Obama said he is ""exasperated"" by the shutdown and blamed Republicans for trying to ""extort"" a delay or defund of the health care law.

""Absolutely, I'm exasperated, because this is entirely unnecessary,"" Obama told CNBC in an interview.

The White House said in a statement Wednesday evening that Obama stressed his view that the House should vote on the clean spending bill passed by the Senate, and that he would not negotiate over re-opening the government or raising the debt limit.

After meeting earlier Wednesday with Obama, leaders of major Wall Street financial firms joined in calling for a deal to end the shutdown and the uncertainty over the increase in the debt ceiling, which needs a congressional vote of approval by Oct. 17.

""While the government shutdown is unfortunate, the impacts of a debt default would be magnitudes worse and should not even be considered a viable option,"" said Lloyd Blankfein, CEO and chairman of the investment firm Goldman Sachs, in a statement.

""The economic damage associated with default or near-default would be severe and have serious consequences for the recovery of the U.S. and global economy,"" said Blankfein, who is also chairman of the Financial Services Forum, a group of financial and investment firms.

The shutdown has also raised the stakes for national security, two of the nation's top intelligence officials told a Senate panel Wednesday.

""I've never seen anything like this,'' Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""The damage will be insidious as this goes on.''

Clapper said 70% of the civilian workforce had been furloughed as part of the shutdown, which the director said has ""created a dreamland for foreign intelligence services to recruit'' U.S. personnel.

National Security Agency Director Keith Alexander said 4,000 computer scientists and 1,000 other scientists are among those furloughed.

Meeting request stirs war of words

Obama's request for a meeting, coupled with a letter by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to Boehner, opened a proxy fight between the various sides' spokesmen.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said the president is ""attaching no partisan strings"" to his request that Congress reopen the government. ""What the president is asking Republicans in the House to do is quite literally the least they could do. He's asking them to extend funding at the levels set in the previous fiscal year to keep the government open.""

Republicans want further negotiations said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Boehner, an Ohio Republican. ""It's unclear why we'd be having this meeting if it's not meant to be a start to serious talks between the two parties,"" Buck said.

Reid, D-Nev., sent a letter to Boehner Wednesday asking him to approve the Senate stopgap funding measure in exchange for a commitment to appoint senators to a committee to resolve longer-term budget issues. ""This conference would be an appropriate place to have those discussions,"" Reid wrote.

The conference committee would attempt to resolve differences in the budget plans passed by the Senate, controlled by Democrats, and the Republican-led House. Senate Democrats have asked for such a committee since the spring, but were rebuffed by Republicans, who said their differences were too great for a conference. House Republicans offered to appoint members to a separate committee on the stopgap bill on Monday as the shutdown neared, which Senate Democrats rejected.

""The entire government is shut down right now because Washington Democrats refuse to even talk about fairness for all Americans under Obamacare,"" responded Michael Steel, a spokesman for Boehner, ""Offering to negotiate only after Democrats get everything they want is not much of an offer.""

Small spending bills

House Republicans moved forward again Wednesday with a legislative strategy to advance piecemeal funding bills to reopen popular parts of the federal government including parks and national memorials and the Department of Veterans Affairs until a broader budget agreement is reached. Measures to reopen the parks and the National Institutes of Health passed Wednesday evening, but face slim prospects of passing in the Senate.

Republicans continue to ask for a one-year delay in the requirement in the Affordable Care Act that uninsured Americans buy health insurance in exchange for passage of the funding bill.

The state- and federal-run websites where people can shop for and buy health insurance opened Tuesday. They have experienced more than 4.7 million visitors, which has also led the sites to crash or cause long waits.

Senate Democrats and Obama oppose the piecemeal approach and continue to call on Republicans to approve the Senate-passed stopgap funding bill through Nov. 15 that has no provisions affecting the health care law. Senate Majority Whip Richard Durbin, D-Ill., challenged Boehner to allow a vote on the bill, which appears to have the support to pass on the votes of Democrats and moderate Republicans.

""What is (Boehner) so afraid of?"" Durbin said on the Senate floor.

Some House Republicans wavering

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has said she can deliver most of the Democrats' 200 House votes, and more than a dozen House Republicans have publicly said they would support a ""clean"" stopgap bill without provisions affecting the ACA.

One of those Republicans, Rep. Michael Grimm, R-N.Y., said he is working with a coalition of members and leadership to find a compromise. ""I'm willing to do that and there are many members that are going to make that push,"" he told CNN's New Day.

Democrats on Wednesday tried to force shutdown-ending legislation to the floor, but it failed 227-197. All GOP members voted against it.

Republicans are looking for ways to pass the stopgap bill and negotiate with Senate Democrats on a vote to raise the debt ceiling, the nation's borrowing limit.

""There is a strong possibility, if (Democrats) were willing to at least sit down and listen to us, that we could put a package together to solve all of these problems at once so we can get the government funded, stop this shutdown and also deal with the debt ceiling so that we don't have another crisis a week or two away from now,"" Grimm said.

By 4 p.m., the list of Republicans who were either quoted in published reports or had released public statements online, particularly on Twitter, saying they would vote for a spending bill without limits on the Affordable Care Act, had risen to close to 20. But their influence is limited unless Boehner agrees to put the Senate bill up for a vote.

Obama and Reid have been equally insistent that they will not negotiate on the debt ceiling because of the economic risks posed by a default. However, the two budget deadlines overlap further with each day the government remains shut down.

Treasury Secretary Jack Lew advised Congress late Tuesday that he was exhausting the last measures before the debt ceiling is hit Oct. 17.

Senate GOP leaders said they'd like to resolve the two issues separately, but that it may not be possible. ""Well, they are getting close to each other, aren't they? And I'd still like to resolve the current issue before we move on to the debt ceiling, but it's not exactly clear yet when that will be resolved,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

As of Friday morning, dozens of tractor-trailers were said to be on the road as part of the protest convoy.

Virginia state police say they stopped four tractor-trailer drivers on the Beltway, pulling them over after they began driving side-by side across all four northbound lanes of the Beltway in Fairfax County.

Their actions slowed traffic to about 15 mph. Officers warned the drivers not to impede traffic and did not write any tickets.

Police say a convoy of about 30 trucks began traveling north on Interstate 95 from Doswell, Va., on Friday morning. The truckers are circling the Beltway.

However, the presence was not quite the thousands of truckers that organizers had predicted. On Friday morning, just a handful of people had showed up at a key staging area.

According to MyFoxDC.com, organizers say more could show up through the weekend.

The rally, ""Truckers Ride for the Constitution,"" had called for 10,000 truck drivers to show up Friday morning and circle I-495 for the next three days, according to a Facebook page for the event.

""Truckers will lead the path to saving our country if every American rides with them!"" the Facebook page says, adding ""The American people are sick and tired of the corruption that is destroying America!""

On its website, the group lists several demands, including that President Obama resign immediately, that the debt ceiling not be raised and that National Security Agency surveillance of communications be ceased. The group is also complaining about low wages and rising fuel costs.

The event's organizers, however, have stressed that they intend to keep the protest peaceful and adhere to all traffic laws.

Swann reports that so far six IRS agents working out of the Cincinnati office–which is the central hub for processing tax-exempt applications–have been identified as sending scrutinizing letters to conservative groups. These include:

Mitchel Steele-IRS Agent

Carly Young-IRS Agent

Joseph Herr-IRS Agent

Stephen Seok-IRS Supervisor

Liz Hofacre-IRS Agent

Ms. Richards (full name unknown)-IRS Agent

These agents report to different managers, with a territory manager overseeing those managers.

Swann explains how the process works:

When an application for tax exempt status comes into the IRS, agents have 270 days to work through that application. If the application is not processed within those 270 days it automatically triggers flags in the system. When that happens, individual agents are required to input a status update on that individual case once a month, every month until the case is resolved. Keep in mind, at least 300 groups were targeted out of Cincinnati alone. Those applications spent anywhere from 18 months to nearly 3 years in the system and some still don’t have their non-profit status. 300 groups multiplied by at least 18 months for each group, means thousands of red flags would have been generated in the system. So who in the chain of command would have received all these flags? The answer, according to the IRS directory, one woman in Cincinnati, Cindy Thomas, the Program Manager of the Tax Exempt Division. Because all six of our IRS workers have different individual and territory managers, Cindy Thomas is one manager they all have common. It turns out Cindy Thomas’ name is one we have heard before. The independent journalism group ProPublica says in November of 2012 they had requested information on conservatives groups that had received non-profit status.

Cindy Thomas, says Swann, is the highest-ranking employee in the Tax Exempt and Government Entities Department in Cincinnati.

Democrats unleashed a barrage of pointed questions to IRS officials on Wednesday in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing. Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-MA) said if witnesses today are not more forthcoming and continue to stonewall the committee, “it will lead to a special prosecutor” in order “to get to the bottom of this.” He warned that “there will be hell to pay if that’s the route we go down.”

“It is possible that criminal activity may have occurred,” said Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George."

Larry Summers%2C Obama%27s former economic adviser%2C seen as gaining support recently

Janet Yellen helped craft Fed response to financial crisis

White House has said only that a decision will be made in the fall

President Obama will pick the first woman to head the Federal Reserve — one of the world's most powerful jobs -- over a veteran Washington insider, economists surveyed by USA TODAY predict.

Thirty-two economists said they expect Fed Vice Chairwoman Janet Yellen to succeed Chairman Ben Bernanke next year. Four predicted Obama will nominate Larry Summers, his former economic adviser and President Clinton's Treasury secretary.

The survey was done last week amid a flurry of media reports suggesting that the field was narrowing to a choice between Yellen and Summers or that Summers was the front-runner.

The White House has said only that a decision will be made in the fall. In an interview with The New York Times published over the weekend, Obama said he has narrowed his choice to ""some extraordinary candidates."" Treasury Secretary Jack Lew declined to express a preference in an interview on ABC's This Week on Sunday.

Yellen is ""extremely well-qualified and she's been there through the (financial) crisis,"" says Diane Swonk, chief economist of Mesirow Financial. ""We need continuity.""

Vincent Reinhart, chief U.S. economist of Morgan Stanley and former head of monetary affairs at the Fed, thinks Obama will pick Summers.

""The president really has tended to reward loyalty,"" Reinhart says, ""and Summers has that history with the president that Yellen doesn't.""

The presumptive horse race between Yellen and Summers to be the nation's top economist has transfixed Washington in a uneventful political summer even though the White House says a nominee won't be announced until fall.

After reports last week that Summers may be emerging as the favorite, Senate Democrats began a petition in support of Yellen and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi endorsed her in a Bloomberg Television interview. ""It would be great to have a woman,"" Pelosi said.

Bernanke hasn't said whether he plans to step down when his second four-year term ends in January, but his departure is widely expected.

The Fed chairman is the most influential voice on a policymaking committee that can speed up or slow down U.S. economic growth by lowering or raising interest rates, among other moves that ripple across the global economy.

Yellen, 66, chaired the Council of Economic Advisors under Clinton and headed the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank for six years before becoming vice chairwoman of the Fed's board of governors in 2010.

Obama likely would relish the opportunity to nominate the first female Fed chief, says Nariman Behravesh, chief economist of IHS.

Like Bernanke, Yellen has used a collegial style to push through bold programs by building consensus on the Fed's politically diverse Federal Open Market Committee.

""She convinces people through the strength of her argument but she's not argumentative,"" says Swonk, with Mesirow Financial.

Summers, 58, is widely regarded as brilliant but sometimes arrogant. ""Summers doesn't play nicely with others,"" Swonk says. ""Congress doesn't like him."" As Treasury secretary, she says, he took part in the 1990s banking industry deregulation that led to the 2008 financial crisis.

Reinhart says criticism of Summers as domineering is overstated, noting he held senior positions in two administrations that required him to work with colleagues.

As Obama's chief economic adviser in his first term, Summers was a key architect of the policies that helped pull the nation from recession and he is viewed as having a steady hand in a crisis.

Most telling, Reinhart says, is that the White House apparently is floating Summers' name. ""But we haven't heard anything that can really be construed as a trial balloon about Yellen,"" he says."
http://news.yahoo.com/obama-njs-christie-together-again-mutual-aid-073313011.html,,[],"Obama, NJ's Christie together again in mutual aid","POINT PLEASANT BEACH, N.J. (AP) — President Barack Obama casually tossed a football as Gov. Chris Christie won a stuffed bear in an arcade Tuesday along a New Jersey boardwalk, signaling the famed Jersey Shore is back seven months after Hurricane Sandy bore down with force.

Obama, with a left-handed soft toss, went 0 for 5. Christie scored a hit on the first try, prompting a high-five from the president.

""That's because he's running for office,"" Obama joked, a nod to the Republican governor's re-election campaign and the perception that Obama's visit helps Christie in Democratic-leaning New Jersey.

The odd couple of politics, Christie and Obama found common cause in Point Pleasant Beach, where about half the boardwalk was destroyed in the storm. Christie held back as Obama, dodging rain in a blue rain jacket, worked a rope line, shaking hands with a crowd that gathered for his arrival.

The trip gives Obama a chance to showcase the widely praised Federal Emergency Management Agency at a time when attention has focused on the Internal Revenue Service and its targeting of conservative groups. The president also gets to draw attention to the kind of bipartisanship that has been harder to find in the nation's capital.

White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters traveling to New Jersey with Obama that the president believes Christie ""has done an excellent job in the efforts he's undertaken.""

For Christie, the president's appearance is yet another way to showcase his beloved Jersey Shore. The Republican governor has been touting it throughout the Memorial Day weekend as a destination point that is back in business, and he broke a Guinness world record Friday by cutting a 5.5-mile-long ceremonial ribbon that symbolically tied together some of the towns hardest-hit by Sandy. The state has a $25 million marketing campaign to highlight the shore's resurgence in time for the summer season.

Both men will reprise the remarkable bipartisan tableau they offered during Sandy's immediate aftermath, when Obama flew to New Jersey just days before the November election to witness the storm's wreckage. Politically, the visit plays well for both men. Christie, seeking re-election this year, will stand shoulder to shoulder with a president popular among Democrats in a Democratic-leaning state. And Obama, dueling with congressional Republicans on a number of fronts, gets to display common cause with a popular GOP stalwart. (Obama was not scheduled to meet with state Sen. Barbara Buono, Christie's likely Democratic opponent in the governor's race.)

Story continues

Christie, in an interview with NBC on Friday, played down the politics, even when asked whether ties to Obama could hurt him among conservatives if he were to seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.

""The fact of the matter is, he's the president of the United States, and he wants to come here and see the people of New Jersey,"" Christie said. ""I'm the governor. I'll be here to welcome him.""

To be sure, New Jersey is still rebuilding. Obama is visiting those regions that have been among the first to recover — Christie ranks the recovery of the state's famous boardwalks as an eight on a scale of 10 but concedes that in other parts of the state many homeowners are still rebuilding six months after the devastating superstorm struck. Overall, the storm caused $38 billion in damages in the state, and harmed or wrecked 360,000 homes or apartment units.

But the coastal recovery is a big potential boon for the state, where tourism is a nearly $40 billion industry.

For Obama, coming off a week that had the IRS in the crosshairs of a scandal, the trip also offers an opportunity to demonstrate the work of FEMA, whose response to disasters has been met with bipartisan praise.

Indeed, inside the White House, FEMA is perceived as an example of what's best about government. The agency, panned for its response under President George W. Bush to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, has made a turnaround under administrator Craig Fugate and has been commended for its work in disasters from the Joplin, Mo., tornado in 2011 to Sandy last year.

The visit also occurs as Congress is away for a Memorial Day break, a weeklong recess that likely will silence the daily attention lawmakers, particularly Republicans, had been paying to the IRS political upheaval as well as the ongoing debate about the fatal attacks at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, last year and an investigation of media leaks that has stirred opposition from the media and many lawmakers."

In it, I highlight all those places that Congress could have cut the military budget, items that the Pentagon itself wanted to cut, and Congress chose not to. Why? Because those cuts would mean ending contracts with companies in their districts. Just.to.hard.to.do.

So instead, Congress is going to repeat it's 1990-style military retiree screw you over deal. Back then, it was health care. Military retirees had been promised a lifetime of free healthcare. They lost it when Congress and President Clinton signed a budget agreement that started to charge retirees for seeing the doctor. They fought back but they fought alone because the civilian community didn't see such a big deal at the time. For 20 years, many a military member has cussed out Clinton for his part in all of this. In fact, I would say it was one of the major reasons why vocal military opinion swayed against Democrats for so long.

Now we're going to see President Obama sign similar legislation. Different retiree benefit but just another generation of military retirees to screw over. Don't think we're getting screwed? Military families certainly do:

From a military spouse at MilitarySpouse.com:



We’ve embraced many hardships. I’ve sacrificed plenty over the years. I know I personally gave up my career to support my husbands – without regret. My occupation is not portable, so I’ll have to start over – someday, when I stop moving every two years. My youngest is five years old and she’s already lived in four states. I’ve said goodbye to family, knowing we’ll never live in the same state again. Because aren’t all grandparents meant for Skyping and not sleepovers? My children are forced to change schools every two years, expected to make new friends and adapt to imbalances in education from state to state. My husband’s office is an intricate part of the national defense of our country. So, that means T-ball games are missed, so are school plays, recitals, activities, help with home work, bed time routines and of course, family vacations. Not to mention, let’s send you off to a war zone for an unknown amount of time, too. My husband has spent 20 years in the United States military. It’s not your typical day job. And, quite frankly, I think I have it pretty good. I know other military families out there have it a lot worse. I’ve embraced my suck, we all do. So, when I hear the Minority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi (D), spout out in a news conference, we have to “embrace the suck”, I want to scream! How about trying out a new slogan “Embrace Your Promise.”

So how about it? Are you with us or against us?

You can send a letter to your Representative, your Senators, and President Obama in one single go by visiting the Military Officers Association of America. You don't have to be military, just mark that you're an MOAA Family/Friend.

Under federal law, the President is required to submit his budget blueprint to Congress no later than the first Monday in February. President Obama has met that deadline only once.

When asked at a press briefing Friday, White House deputy press secretary Josh Earnest wouldn’t confirm the budget’s release. “I don’t have a budget date to announce to you,” he said. It is telling that the White House didn’t inform Congress of the delay, but left the task to budget staff at the Pentagon.

A major part of a President’s job is to manage the Executive Branch and its numerous federal agencies. The President’s budget proposal is the Administration’s estimation of the resources it will need to meet its mission and priorities for the coming year. Historically, the President submits his budget before Congress gets to work on a final spending plan.

This year, however, House and Senate Budget authors will unveil their spending plans weeks ahead of President Obama. Like many other legislative deliberations, Obama will be on the sidelines.

Senate Budget Committee Ranking Member Sen. Jeff Sessions blasted the delay. “He will be submitting it after the House and Senate have produced a budget proposal and adjourned for Easter. So while the President speaks of his deep concern for American workers and families, he fails to even submit to Congress his financial plan to help those workers and families.”

Since Obama took office, the government has mostly been on auto-pilot. Senate Democrats have refused for the past four years to even bring a budget plan to the floor for a vote. This inaction has caused the government to run on a series of “continuing resolutions”, which simply extend all current spending, with modest increases, for a set period of time.

As a result, there have been no real talks about prioritizing spending nor reducing or eliminating ineffective programs. It has allowed Obama and the Democrats to give lip-service to the need to cut spending, without having to provide any specific recommendations. It’s budgetary shadow-boxing.

Obama is simply uninterested in the day-to-day workload required to successfully manage the federal government. He can’t even be bothered when federal law requires that he “show his work” to the nation.

Consider Fisker Automotive. In August 2009, this wannabe plug-in electric hybrid car company was hard up for cash to pay suppliers and faced potential layoffs.

A green-energy loan was the only hope, Fisker executive Bernhard Koehler explained in an e-mail to the Department of Energy — because it would help bring in private money. “We are oversubscribed in this equity round with the DOE support — and nowhere without it,” Koehler pleaded.

A month later, in September 2009, the Energy Department approved a $529 million low-interest loan. Vice President Biden stood before the proposed site of a Fisker plant in Delaware and described the department’s program as “seed money that will return back to the American consumer in billions and billions and billions of dollars of good new jobs.”

Sure enough, private money started flowing in to Fisker by the tens of millions. Apparently, investors liked the idea of a firm that enjoyed access to cheap government funding.

1 of 50 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles goes green View Photos A collection of cartoons about the environment and global warming. Caption A collection of cartoons on the environment and climate change. Wait 1 second to continue.

All told, Fisker attracted $1.1 billion in private investment, the vast majority of which took place after it got the DOE loan.

Alas, government loans could not overcome Fisker’s fundamental problem: no experience mass-producing automobiles, let alone the complex battery-powered luxury cars that it proposed to sell for more than $100,000. Today, the company is nearly bankrupt; taxpayers are on the hook for $171 million, and private investors are probably nearly wiped out. (The story is well told, with documents, at PrivCo.com.)

In other words, that’s more than a billion dollars in capital that can’t create jobs elsewhere in the economy — but might have, if the government had not propped up and promoted Fisker.

A committee of the Republican-majority House is searching for proof that Fisker got its loan because of its political connections. It’s certainly true that the Silicon Valley venture capital (VC) firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers was Fisker’s biggest backer, and that KPCB’s lineup includes such Democratic heavies as John Doerr and Al Gore.

I doubt the committee will find a smoking gun, though. This is a story of self-serving groupthink, not a blatant quid pro quo. Fisker’s fool’s gold took in members of the U.S. elite, from Leonardo DiCaprio to KPCB “strategic limited partner” Colin Powell. For the private investors, Fisker was about getting rich while feeling virtuous. For the Obama administration, it was about doing something for green jobs. The former will be held accountable financially; the latter, politically.

That doesn’t make the Fisker debacle a victimless episode or a disaster only in the sense of opportunity cost. State university endowments and charitable foundations had exposure through KPCB investment funds. The College Illinois fund, a state-run prepaid tuition plan used by 30,000 families, sank $10 million into Fisker. It did so at the urging of Advanced Equities Inc. (AEI), a Chicago-based firm that Fisker paid to raise private capital after the Energy Department loan.

AEI did not enjoy a sterling reputation. A 2008 Forbes article portrayed it as an oft-sued operation, notorious for foisting dubious VC deals on its clientele. An anonymous ex-employee called it “a bucket shop.”

AEI eventually raised more than half of Fisker’s private capital. “They are good at what they do,” Fisker board member (and KPCB partner) Ray Lane, no relation, told the Wall Street Journal. (Through a spokeswoman, Lane declined a request for an interview.)

San Diego businessman Daniel Wray typifies the investors AEI pulled in. He spent $210,000 on preferred shares prior to January 2012 — when AEI told him that his stake would be downgraded to common stock unless he ponied up $84,000 more within a week.

Wray is suing, claiming that AEI took him by surprise — though it must be said that such “pay to play” gambits are not unprecedented in the VC biz, especially in “late-stage” start-ups desperate for cash, as Fisker was in early 2012.

Last September, Advanced Equities paid the Securities and Exchange Commission $1 million to settle fraud charges related to its fundraising for another KPCB-backed green start-up, Bloom Energy. Allegedly, one of AEI’s top officials told would-be investors that the CIA had ordered $2 billion of its fuel cells, which it hadn’t. Advanced Equities shut down last year.

Government can efficiently affect energy usage through fuel taxes and basic research. When it intervenes on behalf of specific technologies and specific companies, however, bad things happen — resource misallocation, windfall-seeking, even, sometimes, corruption. The Fisker debacle proves once again that, in the immortal words of former White House economist Larry Summers, “government is a crappy VC.”

Summers, President Obama’s preferred candidate to lead the Federal Reserve, the messy debate over a military attack in Syria was the final sign.

After weeks of opposition to his candidacy from an array of progressives, the president’s inability to rally Congressional Democrats on Syria persuaded Mr. Summers that his most important audience — the Senate, which must confirm a Fed chairman — probably could not be won over.

He concluded that the White House was also unlikely to overcome opposition to his candidacy from many of the same Democrats, who view him as an opponent of stronger financial regulation, according to supporters who insisted on anonymity to describe confidential conversations with him.

“Clearly Obama couldn’t bring his own most enthusiastic supporters to back him on an issue of national security,” one supporter said. “How was he going to corral them for Larry?”"

That estimate incorrectly assumed that all 300 interns work 52 weeks per year.

The White House may not be able to afford to pay its interns.

While pressure has been mounting for President Obama to pay his interns, there could be a reason why the White House hasn't ponied up: It would cost more than $2.5 million a year.

That's about what the White House paid to give tours of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., which were infamously halted in March due to forced spending cuts.

Related: White House urged to pay interns

The figure assumes Obama would pay his interns $9 an hour, the number he suggested the minimum wage should be raised to during his State of the Union address in January.

The White House has said it employs more than 300 interns each year, with 150 this summer alone, and ""more than 100"" in the fall and spring semesters. Each intern is expected to work 45 hours per week.

We assumed the White House would be paying 125 interns at $9 per hour for 50 weeks per year.

The figure can be taken two ways. On the one hand, it means the White House is getting $2.5 million of free work each year. On the other, it is a relatively large amount of money to shell out at a time when the White House is being forced to cut back on many expenses.

Related: Spending cuts likely deeper in 2014

That may give pause to the interns who are calling on Obama to set an example by paying them.

The Fair Pay Campaign, a grassroots lobby set to launch around Labor Day, has said that not paying interns creates a situation where only a privileged few can afford to work there -- it can cost several thousands of dollars to cover rent and other living expenses while not getting paid.

""If you want to break into these industries, you have to work for free,"" said Mikey Franklin, the leader of Fair Pay's charge. ""That's not a reality for a lot of people who aren't upper middle class.""

The White House was not immediately available for comment."

Summers, the former Treasury secretary and senior White House economic adviser, has withdrawn as a candidate for Federal Reserve chairman in a startling development that raises urgent questions about who will lead the central bank when Chairman Ben S. Bernanke steps down in four months.

Summers withdrew after an intense uproar among liberal Democrats, women’s groups and other advocacy organizations against his potential nomination — a highly unusual assault on the candidate who President Obama favored for the job.

Obama has said he is considering two other candidates for the post, Fed Vice Chairman Janet L. Yellen and former Fed vice chairman Don Kohn. But he was leaning toward picking Summers, people close to the White House say, and the economist’s decision to take his name out of the ring might lead Obama to pursue a wider range of candidates.

Summers helped Obama navigate the depths of the financial crisis and recession, providing a degree of support that Obama has told aides he deeply valued. No official, with the possible exception of former Treasury secretary Timothy F. Geithner, did more to influence the president’s response to the traumatic events he faced at the beginning of his term, which Obama plans to highlight this week as he marks the fifth anniversary of the financial crisis.

On Sunday, Summers telephoned the president to tell him he was withdrawing his name from consideration.

“It has been a privilege to work with you since the beginning of your Administration as you led the nation through a severe recession into a sustained economic recovery,” Summers wrote in a letter to the president.

He added: “This is a complex moment in our national life. I have reluctantly concluded that any possible confirmation process for me would be acrimonious and would not serve the interest of the Federal Reserve, the Administration, or ultimately, the interests of the nation’s ongoing economic recovery.”

Obama accepted Summers’s decision, lauding him and saying that he planned to continue to consult his former adviser.

“Larry was a critical member of my team as we faced down the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and it was in no small part because of his expertise, wisdom and leadership that we wrestled the economy back to growth and made the kind of progress we are seeing today,” Obama said. “I will always be grateful to Larry for his tireless work and service on behalf of his country.”

The decision marks a disappointing turn of events for the renowned economist, who had operated at the highest levels of academia and government. But he has been dogged by controversies. Summers has come under fire for his support for deregulating parts of the banking sector while he was Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton. While president of Harvard University in 2005, he also sparked controversy for his comments on women’s aptitude in math and science.

People close to the White House said Summers faced not only a rebellion among liberal Democrats but also other challenges, including a debate over whether to launch a military strike against Syria that stretched out the Fed process and gave more time for opposition to build.

“It was just a perfect storm of bad timing,” said one person close to the White House, who requested anonymity in order to speak candidly about private deliberations. “It would have been absolute war, and the president would have had to spend all of his political capital. Larry decided not to drag him through it.”

The contest for Fed chairman had taken on the form of a political campaign this summer, as allies of Summers and Yellen advanced their cases in the news media — and in behind-the-scenes whispering campaigns.

A wide array of current and former Obama officials backed Summers, arguing that his crisis experience and economic prowess made him an exceptional candidate. Yellen’s supporters, meanwhile, noted that she has deep Fed experience and has been an architect of the central bank’s efforts to reduce unemployment.

The drama started after word of Summers’s candidacy first circulated early this summer — when most Fed watchers thought Yellen would be appointed.

Liberals on Capitol Hill, as well as a wide array of economists, erupted. They said he had a brusque personality that would be problematic at the Fed.

Summers’s allies took to the media, noting that he was an architect of the president’s push for tough financial regulations after the crisis and couldn’t be so difficult to work with if he had garnered the support of so many of his White House colleagues.

When questioned on Capitol Hill, Obama made many of the same points in defense of his former adviser. But given the heated opposition, Obama decided to announce publicly that he would wait until the fall to make a decision, hoping to buy time and cool tensions.

Some former administration officials say, in retrospect, that the White House got the strategy wrong. While the noise from Capitol Hill died down for a while — and Senate leadership privately told the White House it would do all it could to get Summers through — key voices in the opposition grew louder.

In the past week, Democratic Sens. Jon Tester (Mont.) and Sherrod Brown (Ohio), members of the banking committee, which would have had to endorse Summers, announced that they would vote against him. Another committee Democrat, Sen. Jeff Merkely (Ore.), had said long ago that he would oppose Summers, and it was widely assumed that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) would have joined them as well.

That would have meant that Obama would have had to court Republicans to get Summers confirmed — a difficult task at the same time he would be trying to strip away Republican support for a deal to keep the government open and raise the federal borrowing limits.

“The truth is that it was unlikely he would have been confirmed by the Senate,” said Sen. Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.), a liberal who said he would have voted against Summers if he was approved by the Senate banking committee.

Obama is now short on time to make a nomination, given that the Senate often takes a few months for confirmation. While some speculated Sunday that Obama might turn to Geithner, a person close to the former Treasury secretary said he does not want to be considered.

The decision may give a lift to markets, which were concerned about the uncertainty surrounding the Fed nomination process and the perception that Summers would have been less supportive of the Fed’s efforts to reduce unemployment.

“This news should be positive for the markets,” said Millan Mulraine, director of U.S. rates research at TD Securities. “We could see a rally.”

Summers’s friends expressed regret that the perception of him has been more caricature than reality, arguing that he would have pushed the Fed strongly to reduce unemployment and to demand more transparency in the financial system."

This is a shame. I don’t share the GOP’s philosophy, but I do believe that competition makes both of our major parties smarter. I also believe that a big, complicated country facing economic and geopolitical challenges needs a government able to govern.

What we don’t need is the steady diet of obstruction, diversion and gamesmanship that Republicans are trying to ram down the nation’s throat. It’s not as if President Obama and the Democrats are doing everything right. It’s just that the GOP shrinks from doing anything meaningful at all.

The most glaring example, at the moment, is in the Senate. For four years, Republican senators lambasted their Democratic colleagues — with justification — for not approving a budget, one of the basic tasks of governance. Sen. John Cornyn(R-Tex.), and others regularly took to the Senate floor to announce the number of days since the body last produced a spending plan and to blast Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) for this shocking failure.

Two months ago, Reid and the Democrats finally passed a budget. Since the House has already passed its version — the controversial plan authored by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) — the next step should be for both chambers to appoint members of a conference committee that would iron out the differences. But Republicans won’t let this happen.

Specifically, far-right conservatives including Ted Cruz of Texas, Marco Rubio of Florida, Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky are refusing to allow the Senate to appoint its representatives to the conference. Yes, having demanded this budget for four years, Republicans are now refusing to let it go forward.

Some Republicans, that is. Establishment types such as John McCain of Arizona are apoplectic at the antics of their tea party-inspired colleagues, which McCain called “absolutely out of line and unprecedented.”

Cruz and the others are worried that a conference committee might not only work out a budget but also make it possible to raise the federal debt ceiling without the now-customary showdown threatening default and catastrophe. They believe that brinkmanship is the only way to stop runaway government spending, which produces massive trillion-dollar deficits, which add to the ballooning national debt, which . . .

Hold on, senator. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the deficit is shrinking rapidly and will fall to $642 billion this fiscal year. That’s still substantial, but it’s less than half the deficit our government ran in 2011. More important, if annual deficits continue to decline as the CBO predicts, the long-term debt problem begins to look more manageable. That’s good news, right?

What Republicans ought to do is declare a victory for fiscal conservatism and move on to the battle to have their priorities reflected in the budget — a promising fight, since the conferees appointed by the GOP-controlled House are hardly going to be flaming liberals. Instead, the party seeks not consensus but crisis.

This is no way for a 2-year-old to act, much less the self-proclaimed “world’s greatest deliberative body.”

And speaking of juvenile behavior, I would be remiss not to mention how Rep. Darrell Issa of California and his GOP colleagues in the House are embarrassing themselves by straining to turn Obama administration missteps into Watergate-style scandals.

The deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, resulted from a security lapse of the kind that every recent administration, unfortunately, has suffered. Since future administrations will have lapses as well, congressional oversight could be useful in at least making sure the specific mistakes of Benghazi are not repeated. But instead, House Republicans summon the television cameras and ask round after round of tendentious questions — without paying the slightest attention to the answers.

Similarly, on the question of how and why the IRS gave added scrutiny to conservative “social welfare” groups seeking nonprofit status, House inquisitors seem barely interested in what actually happened. “What did the president know and when did he know it?” was an appropriate question. But the follow-up — “Harrumph, well then, why didn’t he know sooner?” — isn’t much in the way of scandal material.

And concerning the Justice Department’s overzealous crusade to thwart classified leaks — and investigative reporting — it is amusing to watch House Republicans twist themselves into champions of the hated Lamestream Media. Who knew?

None of this is boosting the GOP’s poll numbers. I’ve got an idea: Why don’t they try doing the people’s business for a change?

The White House had suggested GOP willingness to let sweeping defense cuts take effect was the culprit -- but an aide to House Speaker John Boehner quickly reminded Democrats that Republicans have tried to stop those cuts.

""These arbitrary, automatic cuts were a creation and demand of the White House in 2011,"" Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said. ""Twice the House has passed legislation to replace them with common sense cuts and reforms. If there was any uncertainty late last year about the sequester, it was because the Democratic-controlled Senate, per usual, never lifted a finger to pass a plan to replace it.""

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi earlier alleged that GOP feet-dragging during talks over the fiscal crisis and willingness to accept automatic defense cuts contributed to the economic squeeze. The Commerce Department report showed the economy shrinking for the first time since 2009.

""Consumer confidence overall has been rising, and consumer spending has been rising, but there's more work to do, and our economy is facing a major headwind ... and that's Republicans in Congress,"" Carney said Wednesday.

The White House press secretary blamed ""talk about letting"" automatic spending cuts kick in, ""as though that were an acceptable thing.""

Carney, however, glossed over the fact that both Democrats and Republicans agreed to the 2011 debt-ceiling legislation that set in motion more than $500 billion in defense cuts. Lawmakers had a chance to nix those cuts by agreeing to a comprehensive deficit-reduction plan -- but they couldn't reach a deal. While a few Republicans had discussed letting the cuts kick in, most congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle still say they want to avert them.

Pelosi further charged Wednesday that ""today's disappointing GDP report is a direct result of the economic uncertainty created by House Republicans' strategy of obstruction and manufactured crises.""

But Rep. Sam Graves, R-Mo., chairman of the House Small Business Committee, said the economic numbers are a product of White House policies.

""Is this stunt in economic growth really a surprise? Anti-growth policies and an anti-business White House produce just that -- a lack of growth,"" Graves said.

The looming cuts to defense and other areas are thought to have played some role in the economic contraction in the last quarter, as many contractors have already started cutting back.

The economy was also hurt by fewer exports and sluggish growth in company stockpiles. The drop occurred despite stronger consumer spending and business investment.

The Commerce Department said Wednesday that the economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter. That was a sharp slowdown from the 3.1 percent growth rate in the July-September quarter.

Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, incoming chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, said the ""stunning contraction"" can't be blamed only on defense cuts and fiscal crisis talks -- though he did say accelerated defense spending in the third quarter ""artificially boosted"" growth at the time.

He added: ""The bottom line is that America's economy continues to struggle primarily due to President Obama's penchant for political brinkmanship and the pervasive uncertainty caused by his focus on higher taxes, regulation and ObamaCare.""

The White House said while GDP is the broadest measure of economic activity, other indicators of economic performance suggest that the economy continued to recover in the fourth quarter.

""Some of the fiscal issues that may have weighed on the economy in the fourth quarter of 2012 were resolved with the passage of the American Taxpayer Relief Act in early January, which provided more than 98 percent of Americans and 97 percent of small businesses with the certainty that their income taxes will not rise,"" the White House said in a statement Wednesday, before Carney spoke to reporters. ""Today's report is a reminder of the importance of the need for Congress to act to avoid self-inflicted wounds to the economy. ... The weakness was mainly the result of one-time factors.""

But the fact that the economy shrank at all, combined with much lower consumer confidence reported Tuesday, may raise fears about the economy's durability in 2013. That's because the automatic spending cuts - which were delayed in the latest fiscal crisis deal -- will cut into domestic and defense programs starting in March unless Congress reaches a deal to avert them.

And Americans are coming to grips with an increase in Social Security taxes that has begun to leave them with less take-home pay.

Still, the government spending cuts and slack inventory growth in the fourth quarter offset a 2.2 percent increase in consumer spending. And business spending on equipment and software rose after shrinking over the summer.

Consumer spending added 1.5 percentage points to GDP, and business investment added 1.1 points -- both stronger contributions than in the third quarter.

And for all of 2012, the economy expanded 2.2 percent, better than 2011's growth of 1.8 percent.

Exports fell by the most in nearly four years, a result of Europe's recession and slower growth in China and some other large developing countries.

Incomes, though, jumped last quarter as companies paid out special dividends and bonuses ahead of expected tax increases in 2013. Commerce estimated that businesses paid nearly $40 billion in early dividends. After-tax income, adjusted for inflation, rose 6.8 percent, the most in nearly four years.

Superstorm Sandy likely also dragged on growth by closing factories, disrupting shipping and shutting down retail stores. While the department did not specify its effects on GDP, it estimated that Sandy destroyed about $36 billion in buildings and other private property and $8.6 billion in government property.

Subpar growth has held back hiring. The economy has created about 150,000 jobs a month, on average, for the past two years. That's barely enough to reduce the unemployment rate, which has been 7.8 percent for the past two months.

The biggest question going forward is how consumers react to the expiration of a Social Security tax cut. Congress and the White House allowed the temporary tax cut to expire in January, but reached a deal to keep income taxes from rising on most Americans.

The tax increase will lower take-home pay this year by about 2 percent. That means a household earning $50,000 a year will have about $1,000 less to spend. A household with two high-paid workers will have up to $4,500 less.

Spending keeps going up. Revenues%2C however%2C are not.

Does that mean that the ballooning debt is all Obama%27s fault%3F No.

The United States can%27t go on forever increasing its debt by 60%25 every four years.

President Obama, the Democrats, and plenty of Republicans in Congress, would like it if you'd spend the next few weeks talking about gun control. That's because when you are, you're not talking about the country's financial situation.

And, as the graph included here, taken from OMB budget data, illustrates, the situation is dire. Spending keeps going up. Revenues, however, are not. And, since we're borrowing the difference, President Obama has what Politico is calling a debt problem: ""The staggering national debt — up about 60% from the $10 trillion Obama inherited when he took office in January 2009 — is the single biggest blemish on Obama's record, even if the rapid descent into red began under President George W. Bush. Obama has long emphasized Bush's role in digging the immense hole. But he owns it now.""

Well, things did start to go south under Bush. But look at that graph more closely. In 2003, when we invaded Iraq (one of those ""two wars on the credit card"" that Obama likes to blame for the debt), and when we passed the Bush tax cuts (the other thing Obama likes to blame for the debt) revenue actually started to climb. The revenue and spending lines start to converge, and, as they head up to 2006 it actually looks as if the two might cross, with revenue outpacing spending.

Even the New York Times noticed, spotting unexpected increases in revenue in 2005, and in 2006 noting that a ""surprising"" increase in tax revenues was closing the budget gap. The heady possibility of surpluses was in the air. But -- look at the graph again -- everything changes in 2007.

What happened in 2007? The financial crisis hadn't struck yet. But we did elect a new Democratic Congress, with Democrats controlling both houses for the first time in over a decade. The trend immediately reversed, and became much worse with President Obama's election in 2008 and inauguration in 2009. (In fact, despite talk of ""wars on the credit card,"" we could save a lot of money by cutting defense spending back to where it was in 2007.)

So does that mean that the ballooning debt is all Obama's fault? No. Most of those spending bills got Republican votes, too. But it does mean that, as Politico notes, Obama now owns the 60% increase in the debt that has occurred on his watch, and can no longer credibly blame Bush (under whom plenty of Democrats voted for spending bills).

Economist Herbert Stein observed that something that can't go on forever, won't. The United States can't go on forever increasing its debt by 60% every four years. Therefore, it won't. The only question is how things will stop -- smoothly or catastrophically.

As we head into the next debt-ceiling debate, it's worth considering these words from a patriotic senator concerned with America's future:

""The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. . . . It is a sign that the U.S. government can't pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our government's reckless fiscal policies. … Leadership means that 'the buck stops here.' Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better. I therefore intend to oppose the effort to increase America's debt limit.""

The senator? Sen. Barack Obama, in 2006.

I wish that guy was President now.

The memos, which come from a government involved in the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade negotiations, detail continued disputes in the talks over the deal. The documents reveal broad disagreement over a host of key positions, and general skepticism that an agreement can be reached by year-end. The Obama administration has urged countries to reach a deal by New Year's Day, though there is no technical deadline.

One memo, which was heavily redacted before being provided to HuffPost, was written ahead of a new round of talks in Singapore this week. Read the full text of what HuffPost received here. (Note: Ellipses indicate redacted text. Text in brackets has been added by a third party.) Another document, a chart outlining different country positions on the text, dates from early November, before the round of negotiations in Salt Lake City, Utah. View the chart here. HuffPost was unable to determine which of the 11 non-U.S. nations involved in the talks was responsible for the memo.

""These are not U.S. documents and we have no idea of their authorship or authenticity,"" a spokesman for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said. ""Some elements in them are outdated, others totally inaccurate."" The spokesman declined to specify which parts were outdated or inaccurate.

The Obama administration has been leading negotiations on the international trade accord since 2010. The countries involved in the talks include Australia, Brunei, Chile, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.

One of the most controversial provisions in the talks includes new corporate empowerment language insisted upon by the U.S. government, which would allow foreign companies to challenge laws or regulations in a privately run international court. Under World Trade Organization treaties, this political power to contest government law is reserved for sovereign nations. The U.S. has endorsed some corporate political powers in prior trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the scope of what laws can be challenged appears to be much broader in TPP negotiations.

""The United States, as in previous rounds, has shown no flexibility on its proposal, being one of the most significant barriers to closing the chapter, since under the concept of Investment Agreement nearly all significant contracts that can be made between a state and a foreign investor are included,"" the memo reads. ""Only the U.S. and Japan support the proposal.""

Under NAFTA, companies including Exxon Mobil, Dow Chemical and Eli Lilly have attempted to overrule Canadian regulations on offshore oil drilling, fracking, pesticides, drug patents and other issues. Companies could challenge an even broader array of rules under the TPP language.

New standards concerning access to key medicines appear to be equally problematic for many nations. The Obama administration is insisting on mandating new intellectual property rules in the treaty that would grant pharmaceutical companies long-term monopolies on new medications. As a result, companies can charge high prices without regard to competition from generic providers. The result, public health experts have warned, would be higher prices around the world, and lack of access to life-saving drugs in poor countries. Nearly every intellectual property issue in the November chart is opposed by a broad majority of the 12 nations. The December memo describes 119 ""outstanding issues"" that remain unresolved between the nations on intellectual property matters. The deal would obligate nations to develop many standards similar to those in the United States, where domestic prescription drug prices are much higher than costs in other nations.

Also according to the December memo, the U.S. has reintroduced a proposal that would hamper government health services from negotiating lower drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. The proposal appears to have been universally rejected earlier in the talks, according to the memo.

Australia and New Zealand have medical boards that allow the government to reject expensive new drugs for the public health system, or negotiate lower prices with drug companies that own patents on them. If a new drug does not offer sufficient benefits over existing generic drugs, the boards can reject spending taxpayer money on the new medicines. They can also refuse to pay high prices for new drugs. The Obama administration has been pushing to ban these activities by national boards, which would lock in big profits for U.S. drug companies. Obamacare sought to mimic the behavior of these boards to lower domestic health care costs by granting new flexibilities to U.S. state agencies for determining drug prices.

The U.S. is also facing major resistance on bank regulation standards. The Obama administration is seeking to curtail the use of ""capital controls"" by foreign governments. These can include an extremely broad variety of financial tools, from restricting lending in overheated markets to denying mass international outflows of currency during a financial panic. The loss of these tools would dramatically limit the ability of governments to prevent and stem banking crises.

""The positions are still paralyzed,"" the December memo reads, referring to the Financial Services Chapter. ""The United States shows zero flexibility.""

Previously leaked TPP documents have sparked alarm among global health experts, Internet freedom activists, environmentalists and organized labor, but are adamantly supported by American corporations and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The Obama administration has deemed negotiations to be classified information -- banning members of Congress from discussing the American negotiating position with the press or the public. Congressional staffers have been restricted from viewing the documents.

This story has been updated with a comment from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and to specify that prescription drug flexibilities under Obamacare are provided to state boards."

Werfel, who currently serves as the controller of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), also worked with the Bush administration.

""Throughout his career working in both Democratic and Republican administrations, Danny has proven an effective leader who serves with professionalism, integrity and skill,"" Obama said in an emailed statement. ""The American people deserve to have the utmost confidence and trust in their government, and as we work to get to the bottom of what happened and restore confidence in the IRS, Danny has the experience and management ability necessary to lead the agency at this important time.""

WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama will appoint a new acting commissioner to the Internal Revenue Service this week, a senior administration official confirmed to The Huffington Post.

The news comes a day after the president announced the departure of acting commissioner Steven Miller, as the tax agency has become engulfed in scandal for targeting conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status leading up to the 2012 election.

""It is important to institute new leadership that can help restore confidence going forward,"" Obama said Wednesday in a statement.

Treasury Secretary Jack Lew requested Miller's resignation after a Treasury Department inspector general's report released earlier this week found that lower-level IRS staff acted out of incompetence by subjecting groups applying for 501(c)(4) status to greater scrutiny if they had words like ""tea party"" in their names. The report also found that the targeting was not politically motivated, but lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have called for a firm response from the president.

Obama said he had directed Lew to continue investigating the IRS and pledged to ""work with Congress as it performs its oversight role"" in the process.

Some Republicans have argued that dismissing Miller is not enough, given that the acting commissioner had already been planning to leave his post in June. Nonetheless, it was influential Republican lawmakers such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) who initially demanded Miller's resignation.

At a press conference Thursday, the president rejected calls for a special counsel to investigate the agency.

""I think that it's going to be sufficient for us to be working with Congress. They've got a whole bunch of committees,"" Obama said, pointing out the IG had produced a report and conducted an audit. He added that Attorney General Eric Holder had also announced a criminal investigation into what happened.

""Between those investigations, I think we're going to be able to figure out exactly what happened, who was involved, what went wrong, and we're going to be able to implement steps to fix it,"" Obama said. ""That, ultimately, is the main priority that I have, but also I think the American people have.""

Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), the second-ranking Democrat in the House, told HuffPost on Wednesday that the administration had acted swiftly and appropriately amid the controversy.

""It was good the president said there's going to be accountability and responsibility,"" Hoyer said. ""And the guy who's the head, like the coach, takes the responsibility. I think it was the appropriate action.""

Jennifer Bendery contributed reporting.

We will need fossil fuels like oil and gas for the foreseeable future. So there’s really little choice (sigh). We have to press ahead with fracking for natural gas. We must approve the Keystone XL pipeline to get Canadian oil. This mantra, repeated on TV ads and in political debates, is punctuated with a tinge of inevitability and regret. But, increasingly, scientific research and the experience of other countries should prompt us to ask: To what extent will we really “need” fossil fuel in the years to come? To what extent is it a choice? ... “It’s absolutely not true that we need natural gas, coal or oil — we think it’s a myth,” said Mark Z. Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering and the main author of the study, published in the journal Energy Policy. “You could power America with renewables from a technical and economic standpoint. The biggest obstacles are social and political — what you need is the will to do it.”

President Obama visits the Middle East, makes history as he speaks war to Syria and Iran and peace to Israelis and Palestinians, and the talk back home circles The Big Question: Will Hillary run?

Not incidentally, the women’s vote is hers. Even Republican women would find it hard not to cast a ballot for Hillary. If not her, then who?

Head Start education programs for low-income students are being slashed. So are medical services for 2 million native Americans living on Indian reservations and in Alaska. The Army is suspending tuition assistance for soldiers hoping to enroll in classes, while scholarship funds have been curtailed for children of troops who were killed in combat. ... Still, not everyone who depends on the federal government is suffering in these austere times. According to the Wall Street Journal, the USDA is on the verge of purchasing 400,000 tons of sugar in a massive bailout of domestic sugar processors. The move would cost taxpayers about $80 million.

The major beneficiaries of this bailout would be cane growers in Florida and beet operations in Minnesota, Michigan and North Dakota. Big Sugar has outsized political clout in Washington, as evidenced by the silence of so-called fiscal conservatives. Heavy campaign contributions are spread among Democrats and Republicans alike. Barack Obama took money from the sugar industry, as did Mitt Romney. Hefty donations went to both of Florida’s senators, Bill Nelson and Marco Rubio. Every time somebody in Congress tries to kill the sugar subsidy, the measure gets voted down — by some of the same lawmakers who love to rail against public spending on welfare benefits, health care and education.

Judging from the squeals we're hearing from members of Congress whose districts are threatened by cuts, the effects are intolerable. The complaints from Democrats, who never wanted the sequester to go into effect, were predictable. But some of the complaining comes from Republicans who welcomed the sequester as an overdue act of belt-tightening. Tea Party Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Texas) has decried cuts to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which he called ""one of the few legitimate functions of government."" (The Johnson Space Center, with about 3,000 civilian employees, happens to be in his Houston-area district.) The sequester, Stockman warned, could put all Americans in danger — by hampering NASA's work to protect the Earth from asteroids.

Kathleen Parker is apparently fixated on Hillary 2016, and thinks that you are, too.Um, maybe inhome, Kathleen, but the rest of America kind of cares about what the current president is doing. Still, Parker does admit something that has to be tough for her to acknowledge. Carl Hiaasen looks at a portion of government that's miraculously dodged the budget cuts.Maybe they're just too sweet to fail. Or maybe... Doyle McManus says that the sequester is showing up in more than just programs that help kids and soldiers.But who really ""wins"" on the sequester is still an open question. Consider this your ""read it all"" political article of the morning.

Paul Krugman examines another small instance of the Rand-ification of the right.

On today’s right, not only is civic virtue, nay patriotism, associated with narrow defense of your own self-interest, any deviation from that standard — like being an affluent person who nonetheless supports aid to the poor paid for by progressive taxation — is considered prima facie hypocritical. … All through the 2012 campaign we were lectured about the evils of “attacking success“, which was defined as any criticism of how a wealthy individual got that way. But as soon as they think they spot an opening, right-wingers go ahead and … attack success.

A perfect storm has gathered over Colorado. The prevailing winds of value-free politics, the decline of authentic debate, and the increasing global warming of relativism will collide with the upslope of secularism and the denial of religious liberties to converge with individualistic notions of freedom absent responsibility, producing powerful thunderstorms of hypocrisy, and the rain of radical liberalism.

Sarah Huntzinger deserves an award for her piece in the Denver Post. Maybe two awards. After all, it's not every day you see someone combine a staggering persecution complex with writing worthy of Bulwer-Lytton.Admit it. You know you're going to read the rest of it just to see if she can keep up this level of indignent insanity. She can. Good lord, she can.

But remember, while a little ranting can be good for you, a lot is not.

Two studies were conducted to explore how people experience and express their anger on a particular type of Web site, known as a rant-site. Study 1 surveyed rant-site visitors to better understand the perceived value of the Web sites and found that while they become relaxed immediately after posting, they also experience more anger than most and express their anger in maladaptive ways. Study 2 explored the emotional impact of reading and writing rants and found that for most participants, reading and writing rants were associated with negative shifts in mood.

So, in all things moderation. Including being immoderate."

The appearance is “greatly misguided,” ABA Chief Executive Oren Teicher wrote in an open letter to the president. That’s because the online retailer has caused a net loss of jobs, the organization argues, while President Obama’s goal is to promote his plan for a stronger economy.

Obama’s tour is called “A Better Bargain for the Middle Class.”

Amazon has just announced that it will add 7,000 jobs -- 2,000 of those seasonal -- at its regional shipping and customer service centers. The company says its workers make 30% more than traditional retail staffers.

Amazon news releases often make comparative references without sharing specific data. But it’s possible to get a sense of what it will pay its Chattanooga, Tenn., warehouse workers: about $11 per hour, according to the jobs website glassdoor.com.

That’s a bit more than the $8.25 an hour McDonald’s pays its workers -- a wage that even McDonald’s acknowledges needs to be supplemented with a second job to make ends meet, and those “ends” include rent of just $600 and no budget for heat -- but it’s hard to see how an annual salary of less than $23,000 a year is a better bargain for the middle class.

While it’s hard to get people to agree on exactly what a middle-class wage is, in 2011, CNN Money reported that the first decade of the 21st century was the first time in American history that middle-class wages declined: Adjusted for inflation, median household income dropped from $53,164 to $49,445.

A 2012 Pew Research study showed that, on average, Americans think it takes $70,000 for a family of four to be middle class.

Publishers Weekly, the publishing industry trade magazine, quotes Obama deputy press secretary Amy Brundage on the appearance: “The Amazon facility in Chattanooga is a perfect example of the company that is investing in American workers and creating good, high-wage jobs,” she said Friday. “What the president wants to do is to highlight Amazon and the Chattanooga facility as an example of a company that is spurring job growth and keeping our country competitive.”

ABA’s Teicher protests that, writing, “At a time when Main Street retailers, including indie bookstores, show promise of recovering from the recession, we are disheartened to see Amazon touted as a ‘jobs creator’ and its warehouse facility used as a backdrop for an important jobs speech, when, frankly, the exact opposite is true.”

Citing the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, Teicher writes, “Every $10 million in spending that shifts from Main Street retailers to Amazon results in a net loss of 33 retail jobs. That would mean for 2012 alone — using Amazon’s own numbers about its increase in sales — Amazon cost the U.S. economy more than 42,000 jobs just last year!”

Can President Obama be a friend to independent booksellers and Amazon at the same time? He’s been photographed at independent bookstores Prairie Lights in Iowa City and Bunch of Grapes in Martha’s Vineyard. The next time he shows up to shop for books, they may have some less-than-enthusiastic words for him.

(CNN) —

From rising rhetoric between the president and top Republicans over the economy to a marquee Senate campaign showdown, politics are heating up in the summer sun and could boil over in the week ahead.

1. Economic tug of war

With budget showdowns looming, President Barack Obama continues to try to take his case directly to the American people.

The president travels to an Amazon distribution center in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on Tuesday and will again speak on the economy, which remains the top issue on the minds of Americans. The White House touts the address as the first in a series of policy speeches on Obama’s “better bargain for the middle class.”

John King: Obama thinks he’s getting the upper hand

“Tuesday’s speech will focus on manufacturing and high-wage jobs for durable economic growth, and the president will discuss proposals he has laid out to jump-start private-sector job growth and make America more competitive, and will also talk about new ideas to create American jobs,” White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters.

The Chattanooga address follows similar speeches last week where the president’s tone was sharper and more partisan than many had expected.

Obama: I won’t ‘twiddle my thumbs’ waiting for GOP

“If the Republicans don’t agree with me, I want them to lay out their ideas. If they have got a better plan to create jobs, rebuild our infrastructure, to make sure that they have great ports all along the Gulf, come on, let me know what your ideas are,” the president said Thursday in Jacksonville, Florida.

Congressional Republican leaders are pushing right back at the president – with deadlines to continue funding the federal government and raising the nation’s debt ceiling as well the date for implementing a crucial part of Obamacare on the horizon.

Obama touts economic agenda; GOP says he’s ‘all sizzle, no steak’

“Look, this president is a terrific campaigner. We all recognize that. He has got a way with words, too. But at some point campaign season has to end and the `working with others’ season has to begin,” Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor Thursday morning.

“His speech turned out to be all sizzle and no steak, that’s assuming there’s any sizzle left after you’ve reheated this thing so many times,” House Speaker John Boehner chimed in later.

With one week left before the congressional summer recess, both Democrats and Republicans will ramp up the rhetoric over the strong possibility of a government shutdown in the autumn. Both sides are pointing fingers in a heated blame game, and the fight will continue into the August recess as the action moves to lawmakers’ home states and districts.

2. Marquee Senate showdown begins

What could ultimately be the most expensive and bitter Senate battle in the 2014 midterm elections formally begins Tuesday when Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes kicks off her Democratic challenge to McConnell, who’s running for a sixth term in the Senate.

In a preview of how nasty things could get, Grimes blames McConnell for greatly contributing to the gridlock in Washington, saying in a video previewing her rollout that the Senate Republican leader is “the biggest part of the problem. He’s wasted decades blocking legislation that would have helped Kentucky and our country. And over the last few years he’s done it for the worst possible reason – out of spite.”

Web wars start in crucial 2014 Senate race

Even before announcing her candidacy this month, Grimes had already come under attack, both by an Internet ad put out by the McConnell campaign that poked fun at the amount of time she was taking to make a decision, and by a pro-McConnell independent group that went up with an ad that called her “Obama’s cheerleader in Kentucky.”

McConnell is known for taking the fight to his political opponents, and he quickly welcomed Grimes to the race by linking her to the president, who is unpopular in Kentucky, a red state in presidential elections.

“Accepting the invitation from countless Washington liberals to become President Obama’s Kentucky candidate was a courageous decision by Alison Lundergan Grimes, and I look forward to a respectful exchange of ideas,” McConnell said in a statement this month.

In her video, Grimes fired back, saying, “I don’t scare easy.”

Next weekend both Grimes and McConnell will attend the annual Fancy Farm picnic in the rural western tip of Kentucky. The picnic is famous as a traditional political gathering that attracts statewide candidates.

Also expected to attend that gathering is Matt Bevins, a Kentucky businessman who a few days ago formally launched a conservative primary challenge to McConnell, adding more political fire to an already combustible race.

3. House GOP to make another statement

Pegged to the scandal involving Internal Revenue Service targeting some political groups for special scrutiny, the GOP-controlled House of Representatives will vote on a series of bills in the week ahead to curb the power of the IRS and other federal agencies.

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor packaged 10 measures for floor votes and dubbed the final week before a monthlong summer recess as “Stop Government Abuse” week.

Republicans to make big push on oversight legislation

In addition to the IRS, another chief target of the Republican legislative push is Obamacare, which the House GOP has continually tried to roll back.

One bill sponsored by Rep. Tom Price, R-Georgia, would prohibit the IRS from implementing any provisions of the health care law. Since the IRS is the agency that would enforce the mandate that individuals must carry health insurance, this legislation essentially hamstrings the program. This bill is the latest in a string of more than three dozen times House Republicans have tried to repeal entirely or change parts of the health care law.

House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the effort, saying, “It is only fitting that Republicans would waste the last week at work this summer voting for the 40th time to repeal the Affordable Care Act and continue their record of no jobs bills, no budget agreement and no solutions for the middle class.”

Many Republicans expressed outrage after IRS employee Lois Lerner was placed on administrative leave but is still being paid, which the current law allows. A GOP bill sponsored by Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pennsylvania, would change that law and allow federal agencies to suspend employees who are under investigation without pay. Other Republican bills would limit bonuses for federal workers and impose a ban on any new IRS conferences until new changes are in place.

One topic the House won’t address before its five-week break is immigration reform. The Senate passed a bipartisan comprehensive immigration bill last month, but Boehner said instead the House will take a “step-by-step” approach but has not given any details yet on when it will vote or what specific measures will be taken up on the floor.

4. Scandals from coast …

It’s the tabloid political blockbuster of the summer: Amid falling poll numbers and a rising “sexting” count, New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner had a horrible week.

Opponent: Weiner is immature, disconnected from the truth

But the former seven-term Democratic representative, who resigned from Congress two years ago following a similar scandal, has so far resisted calls to end his bid for a second chance in politics.

All eyes will be on Weiner in the days ahead. Will Weiner’s poll numbers continue to plunge? Will more women who had inappropriate online relationships with Weiner speak out? Will Weiner’s wife, Huma Abedin, a longtime top adviser to Hillary Clinton, continue to support her husband’s bid for political redemption?

Weiner acknowledged Sunday that campaign manager Danny Kedem has left his team.

A lot of questions remain, and as of now, Weiner’s still giving answers.

Weiner says he has no response to Sidney Leathers

“But there’s going to reach a point fairly soon that I’m going to say I think I’ve said enough about it, and I’m going to keep just talking about other things,” Weiner told reporters Friday.

Stay tuned.

5. … to coast

On the left coast, it’s a similar story as another former Democratic congressman is facing calls to quit. San Diego Mayor Bob Filner is dealing with an explosion of sexual harassment allegations.

Filner said Friday he will take a two-week hiatus for “intensive counseling.” His move came one day after fellow Democrats called for his resignation.

Amid calls to resign, embattled Filner to enter clinic

Saying he had apologized to his staff, the citizens and the “women I have offended,” the mayor said, “It is simply not acceptable to explain away my conduct as the product of the standards of a different generation.”

On Thursday, the San Diego County Democratic Party voted 34-6 to ask the mayor to step down. Seven women have said they were targets of the mayor’s advances.

A group has begun a campaign aimed at getting more than the 100,000 signatures needed to try and recall Filner, who was a five-term congressman before being elected mayor last year.

Yesterday, after the fiscal cliff had been passed through Congress, President Obama claimed victory. “Just recently,” he told supporters, “Republicans in Congress said they’d never agree to raise tax rates on the wealthiest Americans. We’ve now raised those rates, permanently, making our tax code more progressive than it’s been in decades.”

But more important than Obama’s triumphalism was his insistence that he will not – repeat, will not – negotiate over the debt ceiling. At all. “While I will negotiate over many things,” Obama said, “I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they’ve already racked up through the laws that they passed.” Of course, Obama has racked up those bills, and it is he who refuses to pay the freight with any cuts whatsoever. But now he’s declaring the unilateral authority to avoid discussing the debt ceiling. “What the president was saying was, ‘I’m not going to play chicken with the debt limit,'” said Jen Psaki, Obama’s spokeswoman.

Under the Constitution of the United States, the House of Representatives has the power of the purse strings. It is Congress that decides whether or not to incur more debt, not the president. And yet Obama has essentially stated that he will not stand for any negotiation surrounding that Congressional power.

That’s tyrannical. But unlike in the past, the Democrats in Congress are willing to go along with such systemic perversion. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has shown himself quite willing to give Obama unlimited power to raise the debt ceiling.

So the question now is whether Republicans will stand strong against this unconstitutional aggression from President Obama. In 2011, Republicans in Congress caved, and ended up with the pathetic fiscal cliff proposal that set up massive tax increases and an across-the-board cut. Then they made that cave complete in order to avoid those default tax increases.

Now, however, they have a second chance to stand tall. But they will have to stand together, and they will have to hold Obama’s feet to the fire. The issue of the debt ceiling is about more than spending. It is about whether we have a Constitutional system worth preserving, or whether the President should be allowed to run roughshod over it. Speaker of the House John Boehner has been re-elected — and in achieving re-election, he has given himself a second bite at an apple he missed in 2011, during that disastrous debt ceiling debate. The time for compromise is finished. Our thug president ended it. Republicans must realize that, and act accordingly.

The organization is calling on Congress to conduct “substantive” investigative hearings in the wake of recent reports that senior IRS officials knew in 2011 exactly what was going on, despite initial claims that local “low-level” employees were the only ones involved in targeting conservatives.

Tea Party Patriots co-founder Jenny Beth Martin said that on Friday “we learned that the IRS lied to Congress and the American citizens when Douglas Schulman said there was ‘absolutely no targeting’ of Tea Party groups who applied for nonprofit status.” Martin was referencing Schulman’s March 2012 Congressional testimony.

Today we are learning that the IRS lied when they said that only “low-level employees” were to blame for outrageous and egregious overreach and abuse of power. The AP is reporting in June 2011, IRS division head Lois Lerner instructed employees to change the criteria for “flagging groups ‘immediately'” and in August 2011 “the IRS” Rulings and Agreements office “held a meeting with chief counsel so that everyone would have the latest information.”

A Saturday report by the Associated Press, citing a draft of a forthcoming Inspector General report, found that “senior Internal Revenue Service officials knew agents were targeting Tea Party groups as early as 2011.” The AP notes that this report’s findings “seemingly contradicts public statements by the IRS commissioner.”

On Friday, the IRS admitted to targeting conservative and Tea Party groups and apologized for the behavior. But with this new information, Martin said her organization “rejects the apology from the Internal Revenue Service.”

“It appears the IRS committed crimes and violated our ability to exercise our First Amendment Right to Free Speech,” Martin said. “A simple apology is not sufficient reparation for violating the Constitutional rights of United States citizens.”

In the release, Martin said Tea Party Patriots is “encouraged to hear that Congress plans to investigate. Those responsible must be held accountable and must resign or be terminated for their actions.”

Martin also asked conservative grassroots activists “around the country to help us with two things.”

First, she asked activists to help make sure “that the hearings in Congress are substantive and get to the bottom of this scandal to reveal how deep it runs, how many other lies the IRS has told related to the these tactics, and what will be done to insure no other group of citizens is so unfairly discriminated against solely because they are speaking out against rampant government.” She called on members to “call your Member of Congress and both of your Senators to let them know that we must get to the bottom of this scandal.”

Second, she said Tea Party Patriots needs to “hear from you if you or your local group has felt intimidated by the IRS actions over the last 4 years.”

Are you part of a local group who applied for tax-exempt status? What is the status of that application? Did you set out to form a group but were so intimidated by the IRS tactics that you abandoned that goal and wound up participating only as individuals rather than incorporating and coordinating activity with other groups?

Martin provided a website for conservatives to use to submit any stories of abuse, available here."

In answers to Finance Committee questions, Mr. Froman said on May 17 that he still held those assets but would sell them off within 90 days of confirmation as trade representative.

Mr. Grassley said the president once called the Ugland House “the biggest tax scam in the world.”

“Yet he nominated two top advisers in a row who invested in the Ugland House,” Mr. Grassley said. “He also nominated a commerce secretary with significant offshore income.”

Mr. Froman’s 2009 financial disclosure forms showed holdings in three different Citigroup accounts that maximize profits through “carried interest,” a tax loophole that allows private equity and hedge fund managers to claim compensation as capital gains, thus paying a lower tax rate than if that pay is taxed as income.

Mr. Froman received a $2 million payout from Citigroup to waive his holdings in the India Infrastructure Carried Interest Plan and from another investment called the Sustainable Investments Carry LP. Another account, Citi Infrastructure Investors Carried LP, showed $1 million to $5 million in assets in 2009.

(CNN) —

If all the recent wrangling over the fiscal cliff has revealed anything, it’s how tense and strained President Obama’s relationship is with Republicans in Congress.

Borger: Fiscal cliff was bound to collapse

And Obama’s relationship with Congress reached yet another low Thursday when House Speaker John Boehner confirmed to CNN that he has told House Republicans he will no longer negotiate legislative deals with the president.

And in an opinion piece on Thursday, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas faulted the president for all the fiscal brinksmanship since 2010. The new No. 2 Senate Republican also suggested that “[i]t may be necessary to partially shut down the government in order to secure the long-term fiscal well being of our country.”

Low bar for new Congress

In the White House’s relationship with Capitol Hill, “the real negative is clearly that the relationship with House Republicans is as bad as ever,” CNN contributor and Princeton University historian Julian Zelizer said, adding that the House GOP refuses to acknowledge any mandate from Obama after November’s election.

“They are going to fight the president tooth and nail,” Zelizer said, a problem made worse by the fact that Boehner “is not in control” of House Republicans, particularly the contingent of fiscal conservatives brought to Washington by support from the tea party movement.

Zelizer: GOP faces choice – leadership or gridlock?

CNN contributor Ruben Navarrette Jr. said Obama’s strained relationship with congressional Republicans dates back to the contentious debate over Obama’s signature health care legislation, where the president showed his willingness to push through major proposals and major legislation without consulting them.

“He is so good at the business of politics that he’s really outmaneuvered them,” Navarrette observed about Obama’s relationship with Republicans over the past four years.

Navarrette: The real issue is runaway spending

The already difficult relationship isn’t helped by unique issues on each side.

The GOP has been struggling to define itself and its message in tough economic times amidst twin concerns about government spending and income inequality.

Zelizer: What the tea party cost the GOP

And buoyed by his electoral success in 2008, legislative successes in the first half of his first term and by winning a second term, Obama adopted a take-it-or-leave-it attitude with Republicans, even as the nation teetered on the edge of the fiscal cliff.

“My preference would have been to solve these problems in the context of a larger agreement, a bigger deal, a grand bargain. But with this Congress, that was obviously a little too much to hope for at this time,” Obama said Monday afternoon at a White House event that at moments seemed like a campaign gathering.

At the same event, Obama also warned the GOP about expected battles over spending cuts in the coming months.

“Now, if Republicans think that I will finish the job of deficit reduction through spending cuts alone,” Obama said, “[I]f they think that’s going to be the formula for how we solve this thing, then they’ve got another thing coming. That’s not how it’s going to work.” Rather, Obama declared “it’s going to have to be a matter of shared sacrifice, at least as long as I’m president. And I’m going to be president for the next four years.”

Obama’s recent post-election trash talking directed at Congress is “defiance politics” that misunderstands what it means to win an election, Navarrette said.

The president’s recent comments are like “an end zone dance, a celebration” or, in the world of mixed martial arts competition, like “putting your foot on the other guy’s neck and holding your hand up in the air,” after you’ve felled your opponent, according to Navarrette.

Instead of taking every opportunity to remind Republicans that he won (and they lost) last November, Obama needs to realize that “with winning elections comes the responsibility to lead,” Navarrette said. As the person in whom the public has placed its trust and confidence, “your burdens are much greater (than your losing opponent’s).”

Democrats counter that Obama hasn’t had anyone to make a deal with.

“When John Boehner comes to the table and he can’t even bring his deputy or his third in command to vote for the deal that he is agreeing to, I think you’ve got a real crisis of leadership in the House,” former White House press secretary Bill Burton said.

Debt Ceiling: Welcome to Fight Club

“And so the president showed that even in that case, he can get a deal that moves the ball forward for the country, but going forward, you just wonder, how much control does Boehner have over the folks in the House and what kind of deals are we going to be able to get?”

For all his recent public swagger when it comes to Congress, Obama “really does compromise a lot,” said Zelizer. For example, Zelizer pointed out that during recent negotiations over the fiscal cliff, the president changed his position substantially on the income threshold for eliminating the Bush tax cuts.

While he says he doesn’t think there’s much more Obama can do publicly to smooth over the differences with House Republicans, Zelizer said that Obama can’t let stand Boehner’s declaration that he’s abandoning any more legislative deal-making with the White House. The president would be wise to try to work behind the scenes to keep Boehner “in the fold and maintain some sort of relationship” with the speaker.

And Zelizer noted an encouraging pattern in the recent fiscal brinksmanship between Congress and the president.

After negotiations between Boehner and Obama broke down, “(Senate Minority Leader Mitch) McConnell stepped up and put the deal together,” observed Zelizer, who added the Senate could take the lead again in working out agreements on things like handling automatic spending cuts put off by this week’s fiscal cliff deal and likely upcoming battles over the debt ceiling and funding the federal government.

Zelizer noted that after McConnell negotiated a deal with Vice President Joe Biden, Boehner allowed House Republicans to entertain an alternative that would have included more spending cuts, an alternative which never made it to a vote because fiscal conservatives couldn’t muster a majority in the House GOP to support its passage.

Ultimately, Boehner kept his pledge to Democratic leaders in Congress to put the Senate’s deal up for a House vote. By making the pledge before the terms of the Senate deal were even set, Zelizer said, Boehner sent a signal to House Republicans that they were going to lose the battle over the fiscal cliff even if they didn’t like the Senate deal.

The maneuvers by McConnell and Boehner suggest a path forward if repeated, according to Zelizer, because if GOP leaders continue not to obstruct Democrats as they try to move forward with legislation, that could help bring around tea party Republicans in the House.

Tea party calls for consequences after fiscal cliff vote

In order to improve their relationship with the White House, Navarette said Republicans “have to fix what’s broken in their own party, they have to heal the divisions in their own party … and define what the GOP is about.”

Boehner re-elected speaker in midst of public defections

Calling it “a miracle” that Boehner was re-elected as speaker, Navarette said the GOP must also decide which role it wants to play in Obama’s second term. Will they try to be accommodating and try to work with the president to find solutions to problems, including some problems Republican donors and the Republican establishment wants fixed? Or will they play the proverbial loyal opposition?

Both are “not terribly attractive options” for the GOP, Navarette said, especially up against a masterful political strategist like Obama.

And Navarrette suggests that the sports-loving and competitive Obama invite top Republicans over to the White House for his annual Super Bowl watching party in order to build personal relationships across the aisle in Congress.

For Obama, moderating his triumphal, defiant approach when it comes to Republicans and Congress is also important because, Navarette points out, gun control and immigration reform are both high on Obama’s second term agenda. And there are strong feelings on the part of conservatives and Obama’s liberal base on both issues.

Politics in 2013: 5 things to watch for

Obama talks about ‘worst day of my presidency,’ goals for next term

On the fiscal issues where Obama has repeatedly clashed with Capitol Hill Republicans in the past two years, Zelizer warns that recent events could repeat themselves.

“It’s going to be rough, going to be tough, we’re going to see this issue recur again and again over the years,” the historian said.

Indeed, both Obama and McConnell, the GOP’s new lead fiscal negotiator, already seem to be playing out a familiar script.

3 more fiscal cliffs loom

The last fiscal battle barely over, Obama wasted no time late Tuesday night staking out his position in the battles to come.

After saying “I am very open to compromise,” the president went on to fire a shot over Congress’ bow in the likely fight in February over raising the debt ceiling. “[W]hile I will negotiate over many things, I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they’ve already racked up through the laws that they passed,” Obama declared, “Let me repeat: We can’t not pay bills that we’ve already incurred.”

McConnell quickly fired back.

“The president may not want to have a fight about government spending over the next few months, but it’s the fight he is going to have, because it’s a debate the country needs,” McConnell wrote in a Yahoo op-ed published Wednesday night, adding that Obama “must show up” and deliver a serious plan for slashing federal spending.

“That’s the debate the American people really want. It’s a debate Republicans are ready to have. And it’s the debate that starts today, whether the president wants it or not,” McConnell wrote.

Although he has sworn off direct negotiations with Obama, Boehner echoed McConnell’s remarks on Friday.

“With the cliff behind us, the focus turns to spending,” Boehner told House Republicans.

For the first time, the activities of the Obama administration are receiving a sustained public vetting. Americans’ outrage over Benghazi is amplified by the Internal Revenue Service’s intimidation of conservative grassroots organizations and a cascade of negative headlines. There is the real sense the Obama administration has been less than forthright with the American people, the press and lawmakers.

Recent events have rightly focused the nation’s attention squarely on the actions of the Obama administration. It is incumbent upon the House of Representatives to conduct oversight hearings on those actions, but it would be imprudent to do anything that shifts the focus from the Obama administration to the ideological differences within the House Republican Conference.

To that end, we urge you to avoid bringing any legislation to the House Floor that could expose or highlight major schisms within the conference. Legislation such as the Internet sales tax or the FARRM Act which contains nearly $800 billion in food stamp spending, would give the press a reason to shift their attention away from the failures of the Obama administration to write another “circular firing squad” article.

Make no mistake, principled conservatives will still oppose bad policy if it comes to the floor. Rather than scheduling such legislation for consideration, we urge you to keep the attention focused squarely on the Obama administration. As the public’s trust in their government continues to erode, it is incumbent upon those of us who support a smaller, less intrusive government to lead.

Sincerely,

Oh yeah, there's a new sheriff in town.

Previous diaries have illuminated the sputtering non-responses of regulators (Comptroller of Currency, SEC, etc.) to Sen. Warren's (sort of rhetorical) questions, who were not able to say when they had taken any banker to trial.

But the true sign that her line of questioning struck a nerve with bankers accustomed to the comfy status quo, was in the immediate, terrified howling pushback by numerous banking executives - who refuse to come out into the open and identify themselves, rather remain anonymous.

Elizabeth Warren asked why banks traded below book value while most corporations trade above book value. She proposed some possible explanations:



""One would be because nobody believes that the banks' books are honest,"" she said. ""Second, would be that nobody believes that the banks are really manageable. That is, if they are too complex either for their own institutions to manage them or for the regulators to manage them.""

She also earned significant ire from bankers with her line that one reason big banks mostly trade below book value may be that “nobody believes” their books are honest. Most of the complaints came on background or off the record given that these bankers have to deal with Warren in the Senate for at least six years and perhaps much longer and are (apparently quite justifiably) freaked out at the prospect.

The ads will also highlight GOP priorities by spotlighting GOP opposition to nixing loopholes enjoyed by the top one percent even as a lifeline expires for over one million far less fortunate Americans. There may also be a second round of ads launched when Congress returns in early January. The ads — backed by a “significant” buy, a source says — will be run by Americans United for Change. Other groups involved in the broader campaign include the National Employment Law project, AFSCME, the AFL-CIO, SEIU, and UAW. 2) House Democrats are planning a big push in local media, with the goal of using local coverage to dramatize how constituents in Republican districts will be impacted by the expiration of benefits. This is hyper-granular stuff: I’m told Ways and Means Committee Dems are collecting county-by-county data on the number of people who will be kicked off benefits, and pushing local press outlets to reflect these numbers in their coverage.

The idea is to make it harder for individual lawmakers to escape the direct consequences, in their districts, of failing to renew benefits, bringing it home ... 3) Liberal groups are drawing up lists of House Republicans who are both vulnerable and reside in states where unemployment is high. The targeting of them will take various forms, such as conference calls — directed at local media in their states and districts — that feature people who are losing benefits. Meanwhile, labor unions are planning events in states, and liberal groups are planning polls on unemployment benefits in both marginal districts and nationally. Results should be released next week.

Sargent notes that the ultimate objective of this campaign is to convince voters, despite the media's automatic inclination to blame ""Congress"" for any gridlock or federal inaction, that the blame for failing to pass an extension of this popular program and hurting 1.3 million Americans in the process falls squarely on the Republican Party. And just as with the contrast between Democrats and Republicans on maintaining current levels of food assistance programs for the neediest, there is certainly room to gain political ground from the electorate by campaigning on conservative heartlessness toward the poor—especially when said conservatives insist on having poor kids sweep school floors to earn their lunches while their wealthier counterparts stand idly by.

Without question, maintaining food stamps and unemployment benefits is an unqualified good. But there is room for debate on whether focusing on the safety net nearly exclusively is harming the liberal project at large. At the New York Times, Thomas Edsall cribs substantially from a post by Roosevelt Institute Fellow Mike Konczal to argue that doubling down on the ""social safety net"" strategy actually detracts from the progressive agenda at large:



In practice, Konczal writes, the political left has abandoned its quest for deep structural reform — full employment and worker empowerment — and instead has “doubled-down” on the safety net strategy. The result, in his view, is “a kind of pity-charity liberal capitalism.” Konczal’s poignant description of the problem goes a long way toward explaining the current struggles of the left. The question is whether there is an effective worker empowerment strategy at a time of globalization, offshoring and robotization. Insofar as Democrats concentrate the bulk of their efforts on means-tested transfer programs (on the extension of long-term unemployment benefits, Medicaid and food stamps, for example), they leave the most needy and vulnerable to the vagaries of public opinion. Survey data find that during hard times people become less altruistic and more inclined to see the poor as undeserving. They turn to the right, not the left, in periods of economic stress.

Edsall makes the case that business interests are more than happy to have the social safety net in place because the welfare state allows them to pay wages that would otherwise be completely inadequate while expecting government to pick up the tab and ensure that these workers have enough resources to prevent the fabric of society from fraying completely. Meanwhile, the current political debate is occurring between Democratic elites who support ""pity-charity liberalism"" despite the lack of a broader empowerment agenda, and a Republican Party infected with such a case of Social Darwinism that it seems to want to see the poor starve, seemingly out of spite if nothing else.

Edsall concludes:



The call of Konczal and his colleagues on the progressive left for an empowerment agenda — for structural economic reform — faces roadblocks far higher than many people realize. The loss of a political movement (economic liberalism) and its political vehicle (a stable progressive coalition) has put the left into a position of retreat, struggling to protect besieged programs that are designed explicitly for the poor and that therefore lack strong public backing. The shift of the Democratic Party from economic to “pity-charity” liberalism has put the entire liberal project in danger. It has increased its vulnerability to conservative challenge and left it without a base of politically mobilized supporters. Progressives are now dependent on the fragile possibility that inequality and socioeconomic immobility will push the social order to the breaking point and force the political system to respond.

Now, none of this is to argue that Democrats and progressive allies should not continue to fight tooth and nail for extensions of the social safety net. Obviously, common decency, economic justice, and the maintenance of the social fabric depend on the continuance of these programs. But especially now that Republicans have been using their control of the House of Representatives to chip away at the social safety net at every opportunity, playing defense is not enough. It is critical to go on offense and fight for a broader empowerment agenda and fundamental structural economic reform, rather than continue to simply defend the social safety net while austerity and economic inequality force ever-increasing numbers of people to rely on it.

Edsall is correct that the political power of the bottom half of the economic spectrum has been gutted and hollowed out; that we have lost a political movement and a political vehicle at the nationwide level. At the local level, however, there are signs of coalescence as minimum wage increases take hold across the country, and as fast food strikes spring up organically across the country. And in Senator Elizabeth Warren, we have one nationwide leader who is willing to not just defend the social safety net, but put fundamental economic reform at the top of her agenda.

The progressive movement is starting to see the energy and leadership necessary to stop simply playing defense, and start advocating for an empowerment agenda that can reverse the decades of squeezing and fracturing endured by the middle class. The question is whether we can sustain enough organizational strength to capitalize at both the local and the federal level and bring about the type of fundamental economic change we need."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/14/obama-jobs-plan_n_2450429.html,2013-01-14 00:00:00,"['Labor Reporter', 'Senior Reporter']",Obama's Job One: Middle-Class Employment Problems Loom Over Second Term,"WASHINGTON -- On election night in Chicago two months ago, President Barack Obama triumphantly pledged to fight for a middle class he'd appealed to relentlessly -- and successfully -- on the 2012 campaign trail.

""I believe we can build on the progress we've made and continue to fight for new jobs and new opportunity and new security for the middle class,"" Obama said. ""I believe we can keep the promise of our founders, the idea that if you're willing to work hard ... you can make it here in America.""

The central challenge of Obama's second term is whether he can keep that founder’s ""promise"" to working Americans. It won't be easy, and in an era of divided government and amid cries for austerity and budget cuts, it does not seem likely that the president will offer sweeping new proposals to do so. The administration has said that its top two priorities at the outset of its second term are immigration reform and gun control. Despite an ongoing jobs crisis, creating quality jobs seems to have fallen a few slots on the president's to-do list.

As Obama implicitly acknowledged, the American middle class has fallen on hard times, saddled with historic levels of debt, skyrocketing health care costs and flat wages. By most accounts, middle-class Americans are no better off than they were when the president took office in 2009, in the wake of an unprecedented financial crisis and in the midst of the Great Recession.

The arithmetic is stark. Median household income is lower than when Obama took office, according to Census Bureau data -- lower even than when President Bill Clinton left office in 2001. The middle 60 percent of households -- those earning between $20,262 and $101,582 -- captured a smaller share of aggregate income in 2011 than they did in 2009, while the top fifth, which already made more than the other groups combined, captured more. Surveys of public opinion reveal a middle class that is smaller, poorer and less optimistic than ever. And although the unemployment rate fitfully has fallen below 8 percent for the first time since Obama's 2009 inauguration, most new jobs are too low-paying to sustain middle-class families.

There is more to the plight of the American middle class than numbers can express -- and a greater threat to the country than economists can quantify.

Democracy, after all, can't thrive without a broad, strong, educated core of citizens. But today they find themselves buffeted by the remorseless dictates of global capital, the need for evermore education and training and the burdens of higher taxes to pay for social programs they need, such as health care.

Battling these global and cultural trends is difficult. In fact, it is unfair to ask any one person -- even a president, even Barack Obama -- to overcome them all. The president’s first responsibility in 2009 literally was to do his part to save the world’s frozen capital, banking and trade systems -- without which the American middle class would have had no prospects at all.

Most fair-minded observers would say that Obama did his part, and acquitted himself well under crushing circumstances. A workable and affordable health care system, the central legislative success of his first term, can (if he sets it up properly) be of great benefit to middle-class workers.

But now he must make good on his own promise -- not always central to his discourse or decision making -- to find more good-paying middle class jobs.

How?

On the stump this year, the president made manufacturing a centerpiece of his vision, arguing that a combination of tax reform, investment and education could help repatriate quality jobs to U.S. soil and stabilize the middle class. Perhaps sensing the political popularity of such an idea in Rust Belt states like Ohio and Michigan, the Obama campaign set the lofty but achievable goal of creating a million new manufacturing jobs during the president's second term.

In a recent interview on ""Meet the Press,"" the president renewed his commitment to investing in infrastructure, which he called ""broken,"" as another way to create good-paying jobs.



With the conversation in Washington focused not just on austerity but how much austerity to apply to a sputtering economy, it's hard to imagine what kind of rebooted jobs plan the president could propose for his next term while staying within the bounds of political reality.

""In the short term, we are in a pretty difficult spot,"" said John Schmitt, an economist with the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research who studies economic inequality and unemployment. ""Even if there was a serious commitment on the part of the administration towards a jobs program of some sort, it would run into a lot of trouble in the Congress.""

Without a clear and politically viable policy objective for jobs -- unlike, say, banning high-capacity magazines to address mass shootings -- the administration is likely to continue the piecemeal approach to economic recovery that it took for most of the president's first term, observers say.

Obama's landmark 2009 stimulus bill pumped billions of dollars into the ailing economy, stemming the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs each month. The bill addressed the short-term fallout in the private sector by cutting taxes and pouring money into infrastructure projects and expanded unemployment insurance benefits.

But since then, additional spending has been all but off the table. Obama has repeatedly proposed more infrastructure spending, but the White House has routinely given up such demands in negotiations with congressional Republicans.

The lack of stimulus since the initial package -- aside from the repeated extensions of long-term unemployment insurance -- has exasperated left-leaning and centrist economists.

""The answer is very clear: We need substantial additional stimulus to support the economy,"" said Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), a left-of-center think tank. ""We are choosing, as a country and as a town [Washington], not to do it, with millions of jobless workers.""

To address the decline in manufacturing jobs, the Obama administration has undertaken a number of modest initiatives, such as launching a manufacturing institute in Youngstown, Ohio, with $30 million in federal funding, a joint effort between industry and schools to train workers for tomorrow's manufacturing jobs. The Youngstown facility focuses on training workers for 3-D printing technology, the kind of modern manufacturing industry where observers see a lot of potential.

The facility is an acknowledgment that tomorrow's manufacturing jobs will be different from the ones of the past. Gone are the days when a new high school graduate could show up at the factory door, get trained on the shop floor and earn a good wage and a pension. Jobs like those in 3-D printing require more advanced training and a certain degree of computer literacy. The same goes for other areas where experts, as well as the White House, see promise, like industrial robotics or nanomanufacturing. Obama's own tech advisers have warned that the country's ""historic leadership"" in manufacturing technology is ""at risk"" if it can't cultivate the right talent for these fields.

In his 2013 budget proposal, Obama called for devoting $1 billion to create a national network of institutes like the one in Youngstown -- a recommendation that hasn't exactly become a priority for Congress. Neither have the loftier goals of his earlier manufacturing package, such as extending tax breaks to companies that return jobs to U.S. shores. They appear unlikely to move forward in a second term, even if the president chooses to champion them.

""The administration has done some things but could do a lot more to help manufacturing,"" said Scott Paul, director of the non-profit Alliance for American Manufacturing. What the White House has done so far is ""not well-publicized or well-known. They will ultimately be helpful, but so much of the debate has become politicized, it's hard to make progress on some of the meaningful issues.""

And in the end, the manufacturing plan still faces some cold mathematics. The U.S. lost more than 5 million manufacturing jobs in the first decade of this century, falling from 17 million to 12 million. Fewer than 9 percent of American workers have manufacturing jobs, compared with more than 20 percent in 1979. Creating a million new such jobs puts only a dent in that sector's -- and the middle class's -- long-term woes.

""It doesn't come close to restoring manufacturing employment to what it had been,"" Paul noted, adding that he still found the goal admirable.

Even setting aside the immediate joblessness crisis, Obama still faces the long-term problems of deteriorating wages and growing income inequality for the poor and middle class. Since 1979, the top 1 percent of American households captured more than 38 percent of income growth, while the bottom 90 percent received just shy of 37 percent, according to EPI.

The Great Recession technically ended halfway through 2009, but the economic recovery of the past few years is replacing office workers, real estate brokers and insurance claims adjusters with retail salespeople, restaurant workers and warehouse hands.

Mid-wage jobs -- ones with median hourly wages ranging from $13.84 to $21.13 -- accounted for 60 percent of the jobs lost during the recession, according to an analysis by the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group. During the recovery since then, mid-wage jobs have represented just 22 percent of growth. Jobs earning less than $13.84 per hour made up 58 percent of recovery growth, according to the NELP.

The president pledged during his 2008 campaign that by 2011 he would have the minimum wage raised to $9.50 and pegged to inflation, a move that worker advocates have clamored for for years, claiming it would help raise the wage floor for the working poor and the middle class. But the federal minimum wage remains $7.25 per hour, well below a living wage in most areas.

Many of those same worker advocates tie the stagnation of real wages to the decline of collective bargaining in the workplace. The rate of unionization in the U.S. has fallen to a historic low, with just 7 percent of private-sector workers now belonging to a union. Labor leaders believe that labor law needs to be amended to make it easier for workers to join unions. Their best shot came and went under the president's watch, when Democrats failed to pass the Employee Free Choice Act when they controlled both chambers of Congress.

""I do feel disappointment,"" said Schmitt, the Center for Economic and Policy Research economist. ""That said, we're also in a [political] context where it's extremely difficult to make any progress on the concerns of low- and middle-wage workers.""

Despite those shortcomings, and despite the acrimony on Capitol Hill, liberals like Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO federation of unions, are bullish on Obama's second term, given the focus on the middle class and jobs during the election.

""It all starts with the political will, or the national appetite, to again create jobs that are going to be family-supportive and middle-class producing, and I think that's underway right now,"" Trumka said. ""People are talking about it. That's the difference between this election and the ones in the past. We actually had a debate about what's hollowing out the country and what isn't. And our side won, big time.""

Now the president’s challenge is to turn that political victory into an economic one for the people who supported him.

David Guth, a tenured associate professor of journalism, tweeted Monday: ""The blood is on the hands of the #NRA. Next time, let it be YOUR sons and daughters. Shame on you. May God damn you."" The words came following the Navy Yard shooting in Washington.

Guth was put on paid administrative leave Friday, and the university has taken steps to distance itself from the tweet. In a statement reported by Fox4 in Kansas, the school's vice chancellor called the tweet ""repugnant,"" while Ann Brill, Kansas' journalism dean, said the university does not agree with Guth and does not ""advocate violence directed against any group or individuals.""

#NavyYardShooting The blood is on the hands of the #NRA. Next time, let it be YOUR sons and daughters. Shame on you. May God damn you. — David Guth (@DWGuth) September 16, 2013

While the university has taken steps against Guth, Republican state lawmakers want Guth fired. If he isn't, they say, the school could face consequences. State Senate President Susan Wagle (R-Wichita) and Senate Majority Leader Terry Bruce (R-Hutchison) have both issued statements calling for Guth's dismissal. State Sen. Greg Smith (R-Overland Park) released a statement Friday saying that unless further action is taken against Guth, he will react.

""As a public educator in the Kansas high school education system, I am often consulted by my students as to which college they should attend,"" Smith said in his statement. ""As long as Professor Guth remains employed by the University of Kansas I will no longer recommend the university as an institution worthy of attendance by any of my students nor, as a state senator, will I support any budget proposals or recommendations for the University of Kansas.""

Other Republican lawmakers echoed Smith's comments about the university budget. State Rep. Travis Couture-Lovelady (R-Palco) told The Huffington Post that the university's latest budget proposal is arriving this week on lawmakers' desks -- and it asks for an increase. Swift action against Guth is needed to show that the university does not tolerate his tweet, Couture-Lovelady said.

""It is a university decision,"" Couture-Lovelady said. ""We are elected representatives of the people who develop the budget for the university. I could see something like this being detrimental to their cause. Things like this hurt their cause, and it's unfortunate. I want to see them continue to grow.""

State Rep. Brett Hildabrand (R-Shawnee), one of the most vocal pro-Second Amendment legislators in Kansas, told HuffPost that he and other lawmakers have been in contact with the university to express their opinions that Guth should be fired.

""He went after the children of NRA members, and some of those children could be students in one of his classes,"" Hildabrand said. ""That sets up a hostile environment for the students.""

Guth has been standing by his comments, telling Fox4KC Thursday that he does not want people to be shot.

""If you look at how I structured the statement, I didn’t really bring [the NRA’s) children into it,” he said, according to Fox4KC. “I carefully structured the statement to make it conditional, but apparently it was too much of a nuance for some people.”

“I don’t want anybody harmed. If somebody’s going to be harmed, maybe it ought to be the people who believe that guns are so precious that it’s worth spilling blood over,” Guth added, according to Fox4KC. Guth did not immediately respond to a request for comment from HuffPost.

Several lawmakers expressed concern that Guth's administrative leave is paid. Rep. Reid Petty (R-Liberal) said that while he doesn't think administrative leave is enough of a sanction for Guth, it's not the job of the legislature to interject itself into Guth's employment status.

""I don't think that it is appropriate for us,"" Petty said. ""We can share our opinions and you have the chancellor and the Board of Regents. If you had a pattern of professors saying outrageous things, then we could.""

Jack Martin, University of Kansas spokesman, said the university did not have a comment on the legislators. He referred back to the statement the school released announcing Guth's suspension.

All of the legislators contacted by HuffPost said they agree that Guth has a First Amendment right to free speech. But, they said, he's paid by the taxpayer and has embarrassed the state.

""He has freedom of speech. Speak all he wants as a former KU professor,"" state Rep. J.R. Claeys (R-Salina) told HuffPost. ""When he voices an insensitive and threatening opinion, he doesn't get to take the good image of our institutions down with him.""

UPDATE: 10:30 p.m. -- Guth told The Huffington Post in an email he agreed with University of Kansas officials' request to take paid administrative leave because of the threats. He explained:

""I have had conversations with the university and have agreed to this action -- an administrative leave with pay -- in light of the abusive email threats I and others have received. It is in it the best interests and peace of mind of our students that I remove myself from the situation and let cooler heads prevail. It is unfortunate that my comments have been deliberately distorted. I know what I meant. Unfortunately, this is a topic that generates more heat than light. I don't think any further comment would be appropriate at this time."""

Pollak'],"Obama's Strongest Opposition May Come from Within–over Spoils, not Principle","I have seen more powerful men than Barack Obama fall. I worked in South Africa during Thabo Mbeki’s presidency, when the ruling African National Congress (ANC) won 70% of the vote and earned the power to change his country’s constitution unilaterally. In 2005, I watched from the gallery as he told Parliament he was dismissing his deputy, Jacob Zuma, over allegations of corruption stemming from a lucrative arms deal.

Two years later, Mbeki was ousted by his party and forced to resign his presidency of the country. Zuma is now president, and the ruling party is both fractured by rivalries and weakened by the growing strength of the opposition Democratic Alliance. The growing current of dissent in South Africa is not, primarily, over principles or policies but over clashes over the spoils of power in a time of economic stagnation and turmoil.

President Obama holds unprecedented sway over his own party–and yet the first signs of internal tension are already bursting into the open. The news that he has turned his campaign into a permanent, non-profit organizing outfit to push for his policies has been greeted with frustration by members of the Democratic National Committee, who see the new “Organizing for Action” group as a competitor for fundraising dollars and power.

The Hill reports on the open dissatisfaction at the DNC:

DNC members said they were caught off guard when the leaders of the president’s reelection team announced Obama for America was morphing into Organizing for Action (OFA), a nonprofit group that can take unlimited “soft money” donations….While the new group will seek to go toe to toe with GOP outside groups like Crossroads GPS, some Democrats aren’t pleased that Obama didn’t fold his powerful grassroots operation back into the DNC.

The looming fights over spending, deficits and debts also threatens the coalition that re-elected President Obama. The Obama administration designed a sequester whose non-defense cuts would scare as many voters and interest groups as possible. It expected that sequester to be canceled; now there is a strong chance that it may go through. If it does, interest groups and lobbies may find themselves fighting each other–and Obama.

Many of the president’s strongest backers were prepared to wait until the election was over to demand their money’s worth. Hollywood, for example, watched the defeat of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) in frustration–and patiently waited for Obama to return to office. Now, having won its tax benefits in the fiscal cliff talks, it may revive SOPA again.

Yet it will have to compete with other interest groups in the Democrats’ coalition, who believe that the president was not aggressive enough in his first term and are no longer willing to accept the idea that compromise with Republicans is necessary. The rush to redeem promises made by Obama to each of these constituencies will likely increase friction within Democratic ranks–just as Republicans are pressing their case on debt.

That is why the most important opposition to Obama may come from within–some on matters of principle, such as the loose alliance of liberal and pro-Israel groups opposing Chuck Hagel’s nomination for Secretary of Defense; and others on pure self-interest. Republican opposition will still be critical, especially given the effective veto the House still holds. But it will likely be given a boost by Democrats’ own greed and impatience."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/06/medias-hillary-bandwagon-loses-wheel/,2013-11-06 00:00:00,"['Howard Kurtz', 'Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst', 'The Host Of']",The media’s Hillary bandwagon loses a wheel,"Well, that was quick: Hillary Clinton is no longer inevitable.

The media giveth and the media taketh away. And so the consensus that she will be sworn in as president in January 2017 has begun to crumble.

All right, I’m exaggerating a bit. More than two years before the Iowa caucuses, normal people haven’t even tuned in. And many in the press undoubtedly believe that Clinton will be facing off against Chris Christie, who as expected won a huge reelection victory yesterday. (For junkies: a network exit poll had her beating Christie in New Jersey, 49 to 43 percent.)

I’ve always had problems with the whole Hillary inevitability scenario, having seen that evaporate in 2008. But the conventional wisdom in the press seemed set in cement, notwithstanding the fact that Clinton hasn’t said she’s running.

Now comes liberal New York Times columnist Frank Bruni to say that, gadzooks, she’s slipping in the polls. An NBC/Wall Street Journal survey found that Clinton’s favorability rating had slipped from 56 to 46 percent, while her unfavorable rose from 29 to 33 percent. Stop the presses!

“Here we go. The beginning of the end of her inevitability...

“Voters are souring on familiar political operators, especially those in, or associated with, Washington. That’s why Clinton has fallen. She’s lumped together with President Obama, with congressional leaders, with the whole reviled lot of them.”

That’s an excellent and underappreciated point.

“And some of the ways in which she stands out from the lot aren’t flattering. She comes with a more tangled political history of gifts bestowed, favors owed, ironclad allegiances and ancient feuds than almost any possible competitor does…

“And what would the argument for a Hillary presidency be? Something interesting happens when you ask Democrats why her in 2016. They say that it’s time for a woman, that she’ll raise oodles of dough, that other potentially strong candidates won’t dare take her on. The answers are about the process more than the person or any vision she has for the country. There’s no poetry in them. That’s not good.”

I wouldn’t dispute for a second that Hillary Clinton is the overwhelming Democratic front-runner, even if there’s a challenge from the left, and that the groundbreaking nature of her candidacy will be a major asset. But I’ve always felt the media bestowed the inevitability crown too quickly, and here’s why.

No one knows what the political climate will be in 2016, but I know this: After eight years of one party controlling the White House, voters are usually ready for a change. Only once since the advent of presidential term limits—when George H.W. Bush defeated the hapless Mike Dukakis to succeed Ronald Reagan—has the country given one party 12 straight years.

If the Obama administration is limping out of office at relatively low popularity, that will affect the woman who was the president’s secretary of State. If ObamaCare is judged by then to have been a disaster, that will affect the woman who first pushed universal health care when her husband was president.

And since Hillary has been a national figure since 1992, and Bill is such a force in the Democratic Party, it’s a bit harder for her to run as a fresh face if Washington seems like a mess.

She could overcome all of that, of course, with an inspiring campaign. But it’s a tad early to say that in November of 2013.

Meanwhile, Carla Marinucci of the San Francisco Chronicle is razzing her approach to the lecture circuit:

“Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton hasn’t even started her 2016 presidential campaign yet — and she’s already shutting out the press.

Clinton’s much-anticipated speech at the Moscone Center on Saturday before the National Association of Realtors conference, a convention that is drawing 22,000 people to San Francisco this week, will be blacked out — closed to the media.

“So will her big fundraiser Saturday night with Chelsea Clinton at San Francisco’s Regency Ballroom, a ‘Millennial Network’ event to benefit the Clinton Foundation.

“The decision to bar reporters from the Clinton speech before thousands of Realtors is ‘per her team’s request,’ a National Association of Realtors spokeswoman told us in an e-mail Monday.

“Seriously? In San Francisco? The easiest Democratic audience in the country? The region that’s home to Twitter, Facebook and Google?”

And it’s her buckraking that draws fire from National Review’s Victor Davis Hanson:

“Hillary Clinton is no doubt a talented speaker. She recently went into what the left wing sees as the heart of darkness of the American 1 percent at Goldman Sachs, purportedly gave two brief chats, and walked away with a reported $400,000 in fees. Such compensation is almost as profitable as Hillary’s long-ago cattle-future trading, in which as a talented rookie speculator she beat one-in-several-million odds by parlaying an original $1,000 investment into a $100,000 profit.

“That Goldman’s shenanigans were central to the 2008 housing and financial meltdown — and were empowered, in part, by Bill Clinton’s own prior twofer of deregulating Wall Street and appointing to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae greedy, though liberal, incompetents of the likes of James Johnson, Franklin Raines, and Jamie Gorelick — apparently meant nothing to Hillary.”

You can expect to see much more of this if she runs.

Confrontational Christie

There was one speed bump on Chris Christie’s big reelection, and that was the image of his wagging a finger at a New Jersey teacher who challenged him.

His heated encounter with Melissa Tomlinson of the state’s largest teachers’ union is getting plenty of coverage. Here’s part of her interview with Salon:

Christie’s opponent has called him a “bully.” Do you think that’s fair? Is that how you saw him?

I’m going to be honest … I haven’t seen enough of him to say, “Yes, he’s a bully.” Did I feel bullied at the time? Yes I did. I left shaking.

Why shaking?

It was a kind of a scary confrontation. He shouted at me. The crowd shouted at me. The crowd cheered when he shouted at me. People told me I was in the wrong place to be doing this. People need to understand it has to be done — somebody has to do it.

The governor responded in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper:

TAPPER: The photograph of this big strong governor berating a poor little teacher as some might see it, could be counterproductive to what you want to achieve.

CHRISTIE: First is that whole incident as an incident was mischaracterized and overdramatized by the teacher who belongs to a portion of the teachers union.

Are there times I wish I would have said something? Sure. But what I think people see in me is that I’m genuine.

That’s sort of a microcosm of the debate over Chris Christie and his outsize personality.

That “self-censoring,” Palin said, meant a campaign where “we weren’t allowed to tell the truth about who the candidate was, Barack Obama.”

“What that got us, this kind of complacency and self-censoring of a campaign where we weren’t allowed to tell the truth about who this candidate was – Barack Obama – what it got us was a list of these scandals,” Palin said.

Palin held up a white piece of paper she dubbed “the redneck version of a whiteboard,” on which she had scrawled the titles of numerous Obama administration scandals – including Fast & Furious, Benghazi and IRS targeting.





Because writing them down somehow makes these 'scandals' worse.And what did the McCain brainiacs' silencing of her attempts to speak the truth about Obama get us? Things like reminding us about the 57 states gaffe? (The irony of Gaffemaster Palin bringing up this incident is rich).It got us scandals! Scandals I tellz ya!

So it's all John McCain and his brainiacs fault. If Sarah Palin had just been allowed to speak the truth, if only Americans knew Barack Obama had visited Bill Ayers in 57 states, she and McCain could have won that election!

Probably the one right thing John McCain did after the historic error of selecting Sarah Palin, half-term governor of Alaska, as his running mate was muzzling her immediately. She most likely was told not to talk about anything at all really. Thank you once again John McCain for giving us Sarah Palin in 2008, and thus Barack Obama."
http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/michele-bachmann-departure-came-surprise-tea-party-organizers-171413266.html,,[],Bachmann’s departure came as a surprise to tea party organizers,"Earlier this month, while planning a press conference with other lawmakers and tea party leaders in response to the Internal Revenue Service's unfair targeting of conservatives, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann told Tea Party Patriots national coordinator Jenny Beth Martin that she longed to travel and speak to tea party groups more often than she had been able to recently.

At the time, Martin didn't think much of Bachmann's comment, which she said was just made in passing. As planned, Martin joined Bachmann and other tea-party-friendly lawmakers outside the U.S. Capitol building on May 16 to speak out against the federal tax collection agency's practices. The IRS controversy helped breathe some new life into the tea party movement by offering a fresh platform to rail against both its targeting of conservatives and its role in implementing the federal health care law.

Two weeks later, when Bachmann abruptly announced she would not seek re-election to her House seat, Martin suddenly remembered what Bachmann had told her. Perhaps she had been hinting at something?

""Maybe she couldn't engage in a full-blown campaign at home and also spread the message in the way she is able to around the country,"" Martin told Yahoo News in an interview. ""And also at the same time fight the battles on Capitol Hill. There's only so much a single person can do.""

From the onset of the movement, Bachmann was one of the tea party's most prominent champions in Washington. She co-founded the House Tea Party Caucus in July 2010, spoke at rallies for groups around the country, introduced a bill to repeal President Barack Obama's health insurance overhaul immediately after it passed and embraced the tea party label during her short-lived run for president in 2012.

When Obama gave his first State of the Union address in 2011, Bachmann made waves by giving a televised ""tea party response"" in coordination with Tea Party Express. To many, she was (and is) the face of the tea party in the capital city.

Story continues

Bachmann's decision to leave Congress came as an abrupt surprise to tea party coordinators, according to Martin and Tea Party Express Chairwoman Amy Kremer, two leaders of tea party groups that have worked closely with Bachmann since the movement's early days during Obama's first term. Bachmann was traveling in Russia and out of pocket when her video announcing the decision was posted online on Wednesday morning, leaving tea party leaders to draw their own conclusions about the reason for her departure.

Tea party organizers said they were disappointed by Bachmann's move, but they say they hope she will continue working with them when she leaves office. They also expressed hope that she will seek office again soon by running for Senate or launching another bid for the presidency.

""We have not heard the last of her,"" Kremer told Yahoo News. ""Just because she's not seeking re-election for her congressional seat doesn't mean she won't run for higher office at some point. I still think she has a platform.""

Kremer was quick to add that as a movement established to function without an identifiable leader, she does not anticipate that Bachmann's departure will mean the end of the tea party.

""She's been a strong and vocal voice for us, but the tea party movement is so diverse and there are so many people involved with different local groups, different national groups. The tea party movement is not focused on any one individual or any one organization,"" Kremer said. ""The tea party movement is what it is because of the people who are out there across the country, not because of any one leader, whether it is a leader of an organization or somebody in the halls of Congress."""

The minute-long spot, posted Tuesday evening on Weiner’s campaign site, features the former congressman speaking directly to the camera about the state of his mayoral bid.



""You know, sometimes people say to me, 'This campaign is pretty rough. You may want to quit.' I know there are newspaper editors and other politicians that say, ‘Boy, I wish that guy Weiner would quit,’” the Democratic mayoral hopeful says in the spot. “You don’t know New York. You certainly don’t know me. Quit isn’t the way we roll in New York City. We fight through tough things. We are a tough city.”

The spot was released exactly one week after Weiner admitted that he continued to send sexual messages to women he met online even after he was forced out of Congress for similar online dalliances. His wife, Huma Abedin, who joined him in his other campaign ad, is not featured in his latest spot.

Weiner, who looks visibly tired in the ad, insists the race is not about him but “helping New Yorkers.”

“If someone wants to come out with something embarrassing about you in your private life, you have to talk about that for a little while,” Weiner says. “But it’s also reminded me that citizens, when they come up to ya, and they want to talk to you about a situation on their block or at their child’s school or something going on at their job site, that’s what this campaign is all about, and I’ll never forget that.""

It’s unclear if the campaign is reserving television airtime for the spot. A spokeswoman for Weiner did not respond to a request for comment."

http://news.yahoo.com/filibuster-reaction-harry-reid-nuclear-hypocrisy-184412234.html,,[],Filibuster Reaction: Harry Reid’s nuclear hypocrisy,"Editor’s note: This piece from Roger Pilon first appeared on the National Review Online website just before the Senate’s historic filibuster vote, and it appears with the CATO Institute’s permission.

Harry Reid is set to “go nuclear.” He wants to end the filibuster as it applies to appellate court nominations — not by a two-thirds vote of the Senate, as Senate rules require, but by a simple majority. And given the short memories now in evidence, he may just succeed.

On Monday, for the third time in less than a month, Senate Republicans filibustered an Obama nominee to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. That’s the court that’s checked the president more than once, as when it said he couldn’t make “recess appointments” when the Senate wasn’t in recess. So in a Tuesday closed-door lunch, Reid moved closer to ending the practice, and it’s reported he picked up crucial support from California Democratic senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer along with Judiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy among others.

The hypocrisy here should not go unnoticed. Although the filibuster for legislation has a long history, prior to 2003 it was seldom used to block executive-branch nominations — and appellate-court nominees in particular. In fact, Democrats themselves began using it this way in the 108th Congress, after they lost the Senate in the 2002 midterm elections. Here’s the backstory.

Start with Bush v. Gore, the Supreme Court’s December 2000 decision that effectively decided the presidential outcome, creating a firestorm among Democrats, especially among the legal professoriate. On January 13, 2001, for example, 554 professors from 120 law schools took out a full-page ad in the New York Times condemning the Court’s majority for having acted not as judges but as “political proponents for candidate Bush.” And at a Democratic retreat a month later Yale’s Bruce Ackerman urged members not to confirm a single Bush nominee for the Supreme Court until after the 2004 elections.

Story continues

Democrats got their break in May when Vermont senator James Jeffords left the Republican party. That switched control of the Senate to the Democrats, who immediately turned their attention to the eleven appellate court nominees then before the Senate Judiciary Committee, two of them Democrats — a gesture from Bush. Those two were immediately confirmed. The rest would not even get hearings. Instead, Democrats began calling for “litmus tests” — explicit demands that nominees state their views on everything from abortion to affirmative action to Congress’s unquestioned power to regulate anything and everything.

But the near lock-down on appellate-court nominations did not end with the 2002 midterm elections, which switched control of the Senate back to the Republicans. It was then that Senate Democrats began the unprecedented filibustering of appellate-court nominations. The most egregious case was that of Miguel Estrada, whose life story was pure American dream. First nominated by President Bush in May 2001, Estrada finally withdrew his name from further consideration some 27 months later, after seven failed cloture votes in the next, 108th Congress.

Things came to a head early in the 109th Congress when Republicans themselves, still in control of the Senate, threatened finally to “go nuclear” — to end the appellate-court filibusters Democrats had introduced only in the previous Congress. That was headed off when the bipartisan “Gang of 14” reached a compromise: Democrats would filibuster nominees only in “extraordinary circumstances,” they agreed, and Republicans would not use the nuclear option. That compromise held for the rest of the 109th Congress — though not without difficulties — but it became moot after Democrats regained control of the Senate following the 2006 midterm elections since they no longer needed to filibuster Bush nominees.

In sum, after the 2000 election was decided, Senate Democrats sat on their hands for two years as Bush appellate-court nominees twisted in the wind. In the minority after the 2002 elections, those Democrats then initiated the filibuster for many of Bush’s nominees. Only after the 2005 Gang of 14 compromise was imposed did things settle down. And after the 2006 elections, Democrats no longer needed to filibuster.

So is the Republican use of the filibuster today simply fair turn-around — with Democrats in no position to complain when Republicans use tactics they themselves introduced? If so, that would be enough to illustrate the hypocrisy of today’s Democratic protests. But that’s not what’s at issue here. In the D.C. Circuit matter, which has driven Senator Reid to the nuclear option, Republicans are not raising ideological objections to Obama’s nominees — as Democrats did when they filibustered Bush’s picks. Their objection, rather, is that these judges are not needed, because the workload of the court is so light. In fact, speaking of hypocrisy, Democrats, in the minority in the 109th Congress, used that very rationale to urge Judiciary Committee chairman Arlen Specter in a July 2006 letter not to confirm any additional Bush nominees to the D.C. Circuit — and none was confirmed after that letter from Senators Leahy, Feinstein, Schumer, and Durbin was sent, all of whom are still on the committee. Yet now, when the court’s workload is even lighter, Democrats cry foul when Republicans point that out.

In fact, look at the numbers from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. In 2006, written decisions per active judge had declined by 17 percent since 1997. Since 2006 they have declined another 27 percent. In 2006, the total number of appeals filed had declined by 10 percent since 1997. Since 2006 they have declined another 18 percent. The Administrative Office ranks the twelve circuits using various caseload benchmarks: 2013 is the 17th straight year that the office has ranked the D.C. Circuit last on both appeals being filed and appeals being terminated. There simply is no need for more judges on the D.C. Circuit when those there now do not have enough to do — unless, of course, the aim is to have a bench more sympathetic to rule by presidential diktat, which may be precisely why Senator Reid wants to go nuclear.

[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'][twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

(CNN) – Anthony Weiner's top opponents for New York City's Democratic mayoral race each got a chance to address the former congressman in a major televised debate Tuesday night, but City Council Speaker Christine Quinn took more than one shot at the flagging candidate as the two engaged in heated exchanges throughout the night.

Two minutes deep into the five-candidate showdown, Weiner was already acknowledging and apologizing for his sexting scandal, but he urged voters to move beyond his ""personal failings"" and focus on the more substantive issues in the race.



""At the end of the day this campaign is not about me or about anyone else on this stage, it's about you,"" he said, looking at the camera.

All four of his opponents on stage agreed, with each saying they're tired of talking about Weiner. Public Advocate Bill de Blasio added the former congressman ""should step aside for the good of the city.""

""We need a debate on the issues,"" he said. ""We should not be talking about one individual and their personal life.""

City Comptroller John Liu pleaded: ""Please don't ask me any more questions about him.""

Weiner has vowed to stay in the running despite his sharp drop in the polls after admitting last month that he continued having online relationships with women for more than a year after his 2011 resignation from Congress.

At Tuesday night's debate-hosted by WABC, New York Daily News, Univision and the League of Women Voters-Quinn said Weiner was ""right"" in that New Yorkers have ""heard a lot about his personal issues.""

""For me the bigger issue is his record,"" she said, before taking a swipe at the limited amount of legislation passed under his name during his dozen years in Congress.

Hitting back, Weiner faulted Quinn for getting term limits overturned, an unpopular move that allowed Mayor Michael Bloomberg to win a third term and allowed Quinn to stay in the speaker's office.

""The speaker refuses to apologize for overturning the will of the people,"" he said. ""I've owned up to my personal failings, but I have a record that I'm proud of...and that's not something the speaker can claim.""

Quinn stood by her decision on term limits and argued neither she, nor any other New Yorker, ""should be lectured by Anthony Weiner about what we need to apologize for tonight–or ever.""

As the field of candidates, which also included former City Comptroller Bill Thompson, debated local issues, Weiner stepped in to paint himself as an outsider.

""This is the problem: They all come from basically the same place. They've been part of municipal government for decades now,"" he argued. ""If you want someone truly independent, who's going to stop this noise ... you have a choice here.""

Turning to Weiner, Quinn begged to differ.

""Not for nothing, you were in government your whole career until you had to resign from government, so I'm not sure why you're finger-pointing at people in government,"" she said.

Tuesday's debate came hours after a new poll showed a dramatic switch in the race. According to the Quinnipiac University survey, de Blasio jumped to the front of the pack with 30% of support among likely Democratic primary voters.

Quinn, the former front-runner, fell behind with 24% and Thompson came in at 22%, just four weeks before the September 10 primary. Weiner remained behind all three at 10%, while Liu had 6% support."

http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/ickes-returns-to-democratic-committees-rules-and-bylaws-panel/,2013-08-27 00:00:00,"['Jonathan Martin', 'Topics.Nytimes.Com Top Reference Timestopics People M Jonathan_Martin Index.Html']",Ickes Returns to Democratic Committee’s Rules and Bylaws Panel,"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — The Democratic National Committee’s summer meeting here late last week was starkly different from the gathering of its Republican counterparts earlier in the month. There were no surefire news-making speakers like Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey or former Speaker Newt Gingrich, nor was there consideration of any made-for-cable-news resolutions, like one that tried to bar a pair of television networks from sponsoring future presidential debates.

Rather, it was a sedate gathering where routine party business was conducted routinely by national and state Democratic officials in a suburban Phoenix resort.

But when Harold M. Ickes walked into the Rules and Bylaws Committee meeting on Thursday afternoon and rejoined the panel, at least one longtime Democratic strategist raised her eyebrows.

“He predated the Clinton era, but when I saw Harold reappointed to the D.N.C., he surely, in my judgment, symbolizes the return of the Clintons,” said Donna Brazile, a fellow member of the rules committee.

Mr. Ickes said he was put back on the committee by Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the national committee and herself an ardent advocate for Mrs. Clinton in 2008, but he also acknowledged that he “actively sought” the seat.

“It is in my view the most important committee at the D.N.C. because of its role in shaping the nomination process,” he said, adding a bit mischievously, “The goal is to design rules to nominate the strongest candidate for the general election.”

That, he added, would be up to the voters but there is no question who he believes that candidate is.

Mr. Ickes, 73, is a fixture in the Clinton’s world. He ran Bill Clinton’s New York campaign in the 1992 Democratic primary and served as a deputy chief of staff in Mr. Clinton’s White House. He was a top adviser to Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign, and Mrs. Clinton’s chief liaison at the D.N.C. during her primary battle against Barack Obama. From his perch on the rules committee he memorably railed against a compromise on disputed delegates in the waning days of the Democratic primary.

At a notably less sedate national committee meeting in late May 2008, Mr. Ickes argued in vain against what he called the “hijacking” of Mrs. Clinton’s delegate share from two disputed state primaries. “I am stunned that we have the gall and the chutzpah to substitute our judgment for 600,000 voters,” Mr. Ickes said at the time.

A few weeks later, Mrs. Clinton conceded the race to Mr. Obama. The following year, with Mr. Obama as party leader, Mr. Ickes left his rules committee post. According to party records, he had served on the rules panel since at least 1992.

“I was not reappointed after the 2008 election for some pretty obvious reasons,” Mr. Ickes said.

Now, five years later — with Mr. Obama a lame duck and speculation soaring about whether Mrs. Clinton will seek the White House again — her procedural maven is back in his old position at the national party. The rules committee is tasked with setting the guidelines governing the presidential nominating process.

Mrs. Clinton does not lack for support among national committee members — that much was obvious by the rate in which unofficial campaign buttons promoting her for 2016 were sold in the hallway outside the conference room here.

But with Mr. Ickes, a canny tactician with decades of presidential campaign experience, again on the rules committee, she has a strategist on a key committee who could advocate for her interest.

As one party official put it, Mr. Ickes not only knows how the party works but effectively “wrote the rules” for the national committee over the years, at least until he was thwarted by Mr. Obama.

Mr. Ickes said he did not rejoin the committee at the behest of either Mr. or Mrs. Clinton but conceded that he understood the meaning of his reappearance as Democrats begin to consider life after Mr. Obama.

“I was on the rules committee for years and years, but, yes, I can understand people reading it that way,” he said."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/04/16/Weiner-poll-second,2013-04-16 00:00:00,['Ben Shapiro'],Refractory Period Over: Weiner's NYC Mayoral Poll Numbers Swell,"A new poll from NBC New York and Marist College says that disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner (D-NY), who lied to the American public about tweeting pictures of his junk to random women around the country, is now running a hard second in a potential mayoral matchup. Christine Quinn, the current Speaker of the House in New York, runs first with 26 percent of the vote; Weiner follows with 15 percent. While Nate Silver of the New York Times suggests that this number is actually limp for Weiner, given his 100 percent name recognition, it still gives him a leg up on the rest of the crowd.

It’s no coincidence that Weiner is now preparing to get on his hands and knees before the public in New York. As USA Today reports, Weiner says “I think I’ll be spending a lot of time, here on out, saying I’m sorry.”

Weiner and his wife Huma are plastered on the new cover of the New York Times Magazine. He still refuses to answer questions about his tweet scandal. But it’s clear he understands he’s got to get the monkey of the story off his back, or he’ll take a spanking at the ballot box. He says, “I have been excruciatingly honest, in letter by letter, detail by detail, with my wife. An embarrassing amount is in the public domain … But out of respect for the idea that I’ve laid it all out for her and out of some respect for the privacy of the people who were at the other end of these correspondences, who had their lives turned upside down, I am not going to go into the details of every bit of it.”

Respect for his own possible mayoral run is more like it. He’s relying on his new book, Keys to the City, to carry him to victory. According to Weiner, the penis apparently mightier than the rhetorical sword.

The D.C. Council member kicks off her bid for the Democratic nomination to lead the city.

The D.C. Council member kicks off her bid for the Democratic nomination to lead the city.

D.C. Council member Muriel Bowser launched a mayoral bid Saturday, kicking off a year-long Democratic primary campaign that is likely to center on the pace of progress in city government, the ethics of elected officials and the direction of the city’s remarkable growth.

Bowser made her announcement in front of her childhood home in North Michigan Park, a working-class Northeast neighborhood of brick duplexes and modest detached homes that have housed working-class, mostly African American Washingtonians for generations.

Her remarks Saturday and in an interview with The Washington Post indicate that the Ward 4 Democrat is designing her campaign to exploit Mayor Vincent C. Gray’s perceived weaknesses — his deliberate bearing and the federal investigation into his 2010 campaign.

“Will you go the distance with me?” Bowser, 40, asked a cheering crowd of more than 100 people Saturday. “It won’t be easy, but we need a change.”

She did not mention Gray directly but said, “Corruption has robbed us of our focus, our momentum, our need to think big and act swiftly.”

Bowser, a political confidante of former mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D), becomes the first candidate to officially enter the race, leapfrogging Gray (D), who could announce a reelection bid before late fall when candidates begin circulating ballot petitions for the April Democratic primary. Still more council members could enter the race: Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6) has formed an exploratory campaign, Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) has said he plans to run and David A. Catania (I-At Large) is pondering a bid.

Much of her campaign, Bowser said in the interview, will concern how to “manage the growth” the city has experienced in recent years — in particular, how to reconcile the anxieties of longtime residents with the expectations of newer ones. Census figures indicate that the city has reversed decades of population loss in the past five years, leading to pressures on affordable housing and employment.

“You’ll find that a lot of people who have lived here for a long time — white and black — feel like that the growth is pushing them out or causing prices to go up, the senior citizens to get hurt,” she said. “How do we manage it to the point that D.C. is welcoming to people who have lived here for five decades or people who have lived here for five months?”

A name Bowser mentioned only in passing Saturday, but one that will hover over the entire campaign, is Fenty. Bow­ser’s political patron, he served as Ward 4’s council member before launching a mayoral run from the stoop of his childhood home. After winning in 2006, he endorsed Bowser to replace him on the council and paved the way to victory for her. Since then, Bowser has easily won twice.

Besides being a backer of Fenty’s initiatives, Bowser also adopted some of his trademarks: a focus on constituent services over legislative heft, a shared political team and a campaign color known colloquially as the “Big Green Machine.”

Fenty’s 2010 loss to Gray, after his alienation of broad swaths of the black community, threatened Bowser’s future as a citywide candidate, but two revelations — of illegal activity within Gray’s campaign and a separate $650,000 “shadow campaign” for him — have helped burnish her prospects. Gray has denied any wrongdoing.

With Fenty settled in private life, Bowser is well positioned among potential mayoral candidates to assume his mantle in what could resemble a reprise of 2010. But while Bowser retains strong connections to Fenty — her campaign chairman and treasurer, lawyer Bill Lightfoot and businessman Ben Soto, served in the same positions for Fenty in 2010 — she has been wary about making too explicit a connection.

“I have great respect for the mayor, he’s a friend of mine, and we share a lot of ideals for our city,” she said of Fenty. “But I don’t think people confuse me with him.”

Asked about Bowser’s candidacy, Gray said he “refused to engage” her on campaign issues at this point.

Although Gray, 70, has not said whether he will seek reelection, he has rhetorically laid the groundwork for doing so. He has touted the city’s growth, a spate of economic-development projects and steady progress in some city agencies. His administration has also issued a five-year economic development strategy, a 20-year sustainability plan and a long-term affordable-housing framework.

Privately, Gray has told friends that he would run for reelection based on the progress he said the city has made. The Gray administration and some supporters said he continues to win the confidence of the business community and big-money contributors by delivering good city services. But detractors note that Gray’s grass-roots base — those who would canvass and help get out the vote — is fractured because of the federal probe and resentment that many of the 2010 die-hard volunteers did not get jobs and have been shunned by the administration.

Bowser’s brother, Marvin Bowser, who introduced her Saturday, said afterward that the biggest challenge for her campaign going forward is to get locals who have been “disillusioned” with the Gray administration to publicly voice support for her campaign.

Bowser indicated she would renew one of the central debates of the 2010 race, when Fenty’s insistence to move on city projects “as fast as humanly possible” was derailed by Gray’s pledge to move more deliberately to involve communities and interest groups more thoroughly in decision-making.

“Certainly, we want plans. We’ve had plans created in this District for decades,” she said. “But what people really want is action, urgency and energy behind these ideas.”

Bowser said she also intends to rekindle the debate over education — one that moved from center stage during the Fenty years to a less prominent position among the Gray administration’s priorities. The high-pitched debates that characterized the tenure of Schools Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee have been replaced by a less strident tone.

Bowser would not identify a particular policy she would pursue, other than moving more aggressively on schools issues and seeking to “connect the dots” among early childhood education, public and charter schools, the city’s universities and workforce development.

Besides a campaign agenda that appears to be heavier on governing styles than policy prescriptions, Bowser is open to attacks that her résuméand legislative record are thin compared with those of her potential council challengers.

Bowser was a mid-level administrator in Montgomery County government before joining the D.C. Council, where her key legislative accomplishment was pushing an ethics law amid a spate of controversies a year ago. But some critics saw the effort as less than thorough because it did not includechanges in campaign finance laws.

Although Bowser is critical of former council chairman Gray’s deliberation in running the government, she has been deliberate in determining whether to seek the mayor’s seat.

Friends and supporters said the nudges to persuade Bowser to run began in late 2011 and early 2012 as the investigation into the Gray campaign continued. But Bowser relented, telling close friends that she was focused on reelection.

“She said, ‘Never take anything for granted,’ ” said a friend who requested anonymity to speak freely about their private conversations.

Bowser listened to the refrain more intently after she was reelected to the council and embarked on an informal citywide listening tour. She became more visible outside Ward 4, traveling to other neighborhoods, including those east of the Anacostia River.

Businesswoman LaRuby May recalled spotting Bowser in January at an awards brunch in Congress Heights. “She was warmly received,” said May, 37. “I talked to her and told her I would support her.”

Subtle promises of support became more overt and targeted. May invited Bowser this month to the ribbon-cutting of Roundtree Residences, a 91-unit affordable-housing community built through the National Housing Partnership Foundation and the development arm of May’s church, Allen Chapel AME.

“It was absolutely intentional on my part to invite her to give her some exposure to Ward 8,” May said. “This is in line with her philosophy on economic development.”

Eric Magwood served on Gray’s campaign finance committee but has defected to Bowser’s camp. Magwood, 47, said he is discouraged by the investigation into the mayor’s 2010 campaign. “Unfortunately, I was one of the people on the campaign who didn’t know what was going on,” said Magwood, a political consultant whose conversations with Bowser began about five months ago.

Before deciding to enter the race, Bowser said she called a circle of her oldest and closest supporters. One of them was Fenty.

He had one thing to say, Bowser said: “Go for it.”

In November, Ted’s 32-year-old cousin, Joseph Kennedy III — the son of a former U.S. representative, Joseph Kennedy II — became the latest pledge when he won the congressional seat left by Barney Frank, who retired. Even Ted Jr.’s son, Edward Kennedy III, has announced his intention to run for U.S. senator from Massachusetts someday. He was, at the time of his announcement, 11.

“There is this question with every member of my family,” Patrick Kennedy said. “How do we fit into this amazing legacy that we have been given by dint of our birth?” That is not a sentence most people utter. But his point was that simply running for an office because it is available is the family default option, and it’s not necessarily the best one.

Patrick did not seek re-election in 2010 and now devotes much of his life to promoting treatment and research for his twin causes, mental illness and brain injuries. He married, moved to New Jersey and has two children. He has sad green eyes, a big pillow of red hair and the gawky bearing of an overgrown boy. But he also has the weary voice of someone who could be 65.

Patrick told me he has no regrets about his career choices, but his own life proves his original point: that the family reflex to run early is not for everyone. He has battled depression and alcohol and drug addictions for years, and he admits that the United States Congress was not the best place to wrestle these goblins. “When you grow up in my family, being somebody meant having power, having status,” Patrick told me back in 2006, when I was reporting an article for The Times not long after police found him disoriented, having crashed his car into a barrier near the Capitol at 2:45 a.m. “The compensations you got were all material and superficial,” he said. “I’ve come to realize, in the last few months, that that life made me feel all alone.” After the article ran, Patrick told me his father was furious at him for unburdening himself publicly. “Save that stuff for your shrink, not a reporter,” Senator Kennedy said to him.

Ted Jr. is less the unburdening type. He has granted few interviews and he seemed nervous when we talked, or perhaps a bit suffocated by Keil, who was always with us. Keil, whom I first met back in his journalism days, is a friendly and earnest operator who, like many in Washington, is always working. (I ran into him once at the supermarket and teased him about the work Purple Strategies was doing to help BP “reposition” its image after the spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Without missing a beat, Keil unleashed his own gusher, calling BP the “the greatest corporate turnaround story in history” before moving on to the deli counter.) He sat in on all three of my meetings with Ted Jr., monitored a subsequent phone call and also stayed close by during my meeting with Patrick. He made backup recordings of all of our conversations, which is not unusual for public-relations people to do, but typically happens with high-level subjects, not with someone who has never run for office and wasn’t really running for anything now. The aggressive “management” of the story conveyed an impression of both loftiness and hand-holding — or, at worst, of a Not Ready for Prime Time Kennedy being propped up by consultants.

All of that said, there’s something innately likable about Ted Jr. People who have known him over the years generally describe a solid, down-to-earth guy who is quite normal, given his royal lineage. And his instinct to become a fully formed human being before answering the “call to service” was admirable. His priority, by all accounts, has always been to raise a family and nurture them as unassumingly as possible (again, for a Kennedy). As he put it, “I pretty much spent half my life trying to resist other people’s timetables.” Later, when I asked him to elaborate on this, he added: “My father was the single most important person in my life. But in some ways, we all live our lives resisting what our parents want us to become.”

In early 1985 Ted Jr. was 23 and living in Somerville, Mass., outside Boston. Tip O’Neill, the district’s longtime representative, had announced he would retire at the end of his term. This seemed an obvious starter gig, but Ted Jr. was not interested. His 34-year-old cousin, Joe — Robert F. Kennedy’s son — ran and won instead. “I never seriously considered that race,” Ted Jr. told me. “My father was strongly considering me.” Ted Sr. commissioned a poll that came back “a slam dunk for Ted,” said Steve McMahon, who was one of the people then running Senator Kennedy’s political operation. Ted Jr.’s decision not to run, McMahon said, “was against the advice and counsel of pretty much everyone around him.” Senator Kennedy was disappointed, Ted Jr. told me. “He couldn’t understand why someone with all the built-in advantages would not take advantage of the opportunity.”"
http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/05/19/1210132/-The-Only-Scandal-Regarding-the-IRS-is-How-EVERY-Tea-Party-Group-Obtained-501-C-4-Status,2013-05-19 00:00:00,"['This Content Is Not Subject To Review Daily Kos Staff Prior To Publication.', 'Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags']",The Only Scandal Regarding the IRS is How EVERY Tea Party Group Obtained 501(C)(4) Status,"But all told, a critical look at some of the activities of those tea party applicants currently under review by IREHR or those already designated as 501(C)(4) reveals the potential for a threat to democratic governance in general.

From the IREHR website: The Tea Party and the IRS “Scandal” The Actual Facts of the Case

Here are the not-so-known facts of a few of those cases:

• The First Coast Tea Party Inc. of Jacksonville, Florida, for example, which applied for 501(c)(4) status in 2009 and received it in 2011. Commenting about the recent IRS controversy on Facebook, the group declared “We file a tax return, account for every penny.. We do not endorse candidates that is a no no.” Yet the group’s activities included public bragging about directly helping Republican campaigns. In an August 30, 2012 Facebook post, for instance, the group advertised a Jacksonville rally for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan, adding, “bring your chairs and your signs, make sure they know that the First Coast Tea Party is and has been helping their campaign.”

It must be noted here that three weeks after receiving 501(C)(4) status the group declared a ""state of emergency"" on their Facebook page, pleading with supporters to campaign for Romney.

THIS is just one example of why the IRS wanted all their Facebook postings.



“FLORIDA FRIENDS, IF YOU LIVE IN ANY OF THESE 3 COUNTIES GET OFF THE COUCH NOW, GET YOUR FRIENDS OFF THE COUCH. GET TO THE REPUBLICAN HEADQUARTERS AND OFFER AND THEN DO SOME WORK. PHONES, (YOU CAN EVEN DO THESE CALLS FROM HOME) AND WALK AND KNOCK. NOW. WE CANNOT LOSE FLORIDA TO OBAMA.. NOW. THIS IS MOST CRITICAL.” [Emphasis in Original]

That plea came from the official Face book account of the organization as opposed to coming from random supporters.

• Similarly, the Louisville Tea Party was granted 501(c)(4) status in 2009. Nevertheless, it published a list of “officially tea party endorsed candidates for the 2011 Kentucky primary.” They also published an article “The Rationale for Romney-Ryan,” arguing for Tea Partiers to vote for the Republican candidate.

Then there’s...

• The Katy Tea Party Patriots, which filed for 501(c)(4) non-profit status in 2009. This group actually ran an “Oust Obama 2012” campaign, organizing block-watching with the Fort Bend GOP, and phone-banking against Obama at GOP headquarters in Sugarland and Houston, Texas. Still featured on the frontpage of the group’s website at the time this article was written is an October 4, 2012 article entitled, “Our Country's Future” by Katy Tea Party Patriots President, Darcy Kahrhoff. She urged members to vote for Gov. Romney. ""Please take time to talk with friends and family you may have living out of state, and try to convince them to vote for Governor Romney, especially if you have friends and family in Florida, Colorado, or Ohio. Also, find a Senatorial candidate to support in these states, and go to FreedomWorks to phone bank for these patriots. Everything you can do to help will matter. We can, and we must, win this!""

Not to be outdone...

• The Central Valley Tea Party Inc. This regional California Tea Party group was granted the much more politically limiting IRS 501(c)(3) tax status back in 2009. It should be noted that this tax-status explicitly prohibits partisan political activity. According the IRS, “Under the Internal Revenue Code, all section 501(c)(3) organizations are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office. The prohibition applies to all campaigns including campaigns at the federal, state and local level. Violation of this prohibition may result in denial or revocation of tax-exempt status and the imposition of certain excise taxes.”

Despite this (c)(3) designation, the front-page of the group's website features ""upcoming events"" instructing members to ""Volunteer for Measure G,"" and ""Volunteer for Vidak for Senate.” In the latter case, the website simply tells members...



""Please volunteer to do phone banking or precinct walking to help win the election.""

""So it’s time to get excited to vote for the better candidate. It’s time to talk him up to friends and family. It’s time to join with groups like Operation Swing State (www.operationswingstate.org) and make calls in support of his candidacy.""

In an article in the October 2012 issue of the Central Valley Tea Party Times entitled,Paul Szopa told fellow Central Valley Tea Partiers to get out and campaign for GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney,

Another Tea Party group granted the 501(c)(3) non-profit status by the IRS...

• The Tifton, Georgia-based Tiftarea Tea Party Patriots, Inc., which received the designation in 2010. The group also appears to have engaged in openly political activity, including publicly endorsing candidates. On October 9, 2012, in a post on the group’s website “Are you ready to vote?” the group offered up an endorsement for Romney, “The choice is simple. Obama has stated, He will transform America and acted to do such. Everything this Administration stands for, is Government and control of every aspect of life. This is the pipe dream of a Socialist’s mentality, for in their eyes, you the individual, do not know and cannot do, what is right, so someone else has to make decisions for you, to ensure, you do not make the wrong choices or actions. Or you chose Romney, who does not want to transform America, the greatest nation in history of human kind. He wants to allow, the individual, to have the right, to succeed and fail on his own regard, while ensuring those freedoms, given by our Creator and to assure those inalienable rights, written about in the Declaration of Independence are retained by their proper owners, ‘We the People.’”

Note these are only a few of the many examples of blatant political involvement by tea party 'non-profits' reviewed by IREHR. Of course, there are plenty more. As the title of this diary indicates, the REAL scandal here is how often the IRS granted 501(C)(4) status to groups that egregiously violated standards.

Even though the agency was clearly inundated with applications there's no excuse for the incompetency of its employees. As far as I know the agency was at full strength; no cutbacks, no furloughs... just incompetency.

Now, one must ask:



After the firing of several high level IRS employees over this incident, how likely is it that Tea Party groups will be prevented these sorts of violations in the future?

I don't know if we want to know the answer to that question.

Here's an article written for Salon.com by Joan Walsh highlighting what appears to be one of the few groups denied 501(C)(4) status -- a Democratic group."

Will the implementation of some of the most important provisions of ObamaCare this fall and next year result in the ""train wreck"" Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) predicted a few days ago?

No. But you can be certain that there will be no shortage of political candidates and high-powered political spin doctors who will be working relentlessly between now and the 2014 midterms to convince us that it will be.

ObamaCare -- even though it already has reduced the number of uninsured Americans by several million and has limited price gouging by insurance companies -- represents the best hope that many Republicans will have of maintaining or boosting their majority in the House and possibly retaking the Senate.

Think about it. The economy seems to be on the right track. Just last week the stock market reached record highs and the jobless rate fell to its lowest point in four years. The war in Iraq is over and most American troops are scheduled to be out of Afghanistan by the end of next year. The GOP appears to have lost the advantage to Democrats on gun control and immigration, and abortion and gay rights are no longer the reliable campaign wedge issues they once were.

That leaves ObamaCare and ""big government spending"" as just about the only issues that remain for right-leaning candidates, barring any unforeseen domestic or global calamity. But if their campaigns against ObamaCare next year are as successful as their campaigns against it were in the 2010 midterms -- and the White House and supporters of the law are once again asleep at the switch -- GOP candidates might not need anything else to talk about to take both houses of Congress.

When Barack Obama was inaugurated in January 2009, there was wide support for health care reform, and Republican strategists knew it. They realized they might be able to turn reform into a winning issue for their candidates by mounting a campaign to make people afraid of what the Democrats might try to do. So just as Congress was beginning preliminary work on what eventually became the Affordable Care Act, GOP message guru Frank Luntz persuaded his clients to condemn whatever the Democrats proposed as a ""government takeover of health care.""

Even though the bill that ultimately became law was anything but a government takeover, GOP lawmakers and candidates never missed an opportunity to insist that it was. Luntz' sound bite was repeated hundreds of times in floor speeches by Republican members of Congress in the hours before the House voted on its version of the bill on November 7, 2009.

Their fear-based campaign worked so well to influence public opinion that GOP candidates have never stopped using the ""government takeover"" meme, which is why the perception of ObamaCare as being exactly that has become a reality for millions of Americans.

When you consider the inadequate job that the White House and the president's supporters have done in explaining how the law benefits just about every one of us -- and never letting us forget why reform was necessary in the first place -- it's little wonder Republicans see opportunity once again.

There no doubt will be glitches when the online health insurance exchanges go live on October 1 for the relatively small percentage of Americans who will use them to shop for coverage because their employers don't offer health insurance as an employee benefit. The exchanges will work just fine for the vast majority of people, but there will be some who will have complaints. You can expect the law's critics to give every one of them a voice in their effort to create the impression that the exchanges are a disaster and that the government can't do anything right.

Similarly, some people who have been paying relatively low premiums for what they don't realize is junk insurance will be upset when junk insurance is outlawed next year. Because real insurance costs more than junk, some invariably will complain about having to pay higher premiums for coverage that will actually be there if and when they need it.

You can also expect that a fair number of folks will squawk when the requirement to have health insurance kicks in on January 1. And you can bet that the opponents of the law will be aided, unwittingly in most but certainly not all cases, by the media. Just as local TV reporters tell us about the drivers who crash into each other instead of the rest of us who get to our destinations unharmed, the media will focus on the glitches. And they'll interview far more complainers than happy campers.

I'm betting that Frank Luntz and other Republican strategists have already been hired to craft the sound bites to use against Democrats next year. If the Democrats and consumer advocates who support ObamaCare are not at work developing their own strategies to counter the coming barrage of misleading spin, the GOP will have an excellent chance of controlling Capitol Hill after the next elections."

""Everyone understands that we are not going to be involved, as long as our personal friends and people who we feel obligations [to] are involved,"" said Clinton, speaking from Rwanda, where he was doing work through his foundation.

Clinton's comments, the first he's made on the New York City campaign, were extremely judicious. But they also serve to distance the Clintons from Weiner and his wife, Huma Abedin, who remains an aide to Hillary Clinton.

Many have compared Weiner and Abedin to the Clintons, who in their younger years stuck together through a scandal. But that comparison has reportedly infuriated the Clintons.

Nevertheless, the two worlds overlap, with Abedin maintaining close contact with Hillary Clinton as her husband's campaign persistently moves forward.

For his part, Weiner said recently that he has ""enormous respect"" for the Clintons and called them ""tremendous friends."""

Anthony Weiner quit Congress after a sexting scandal in 2011

Wife says she has forgiven him

Weiner says he won%27t drop out of the race

NEW YORK -- Former congressman Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., said he would not quit his race for mayor of New York City, despite acknowledging that he continued to send women inappropriate online messages after a sexting scandal forced him to resign from Congress in 2011.

""I said that other texts and photos were likely to come out, and today they have,"" Weiner said in a hastily arranged news conference with his wife by his side. Weiner acknowledged that some of the inappropriate texts were sent after he had resigned.

""Some of these things happened before my resignation, some of them happened after,"" Weiner said.

""I'm sure many of my opponents would like me to drop out of the race,"" he said, but he refused to drop out of the race. After the news conference he went directly to a mayoral candidate forum.

""Anthony has made some horrible mistakes both before he resigned from Congress and after,"" said Weiner's wife, Huma Abedin. ""I love him, I have forgiven him, I believe in him.""

An online gossip site called The Dirty posted screenshots Monday of online messages between an account in the name of Anthony Weiner and that of an unidentified woman. The site said the messages were sent last August, more than a year after Weiner left Congress. Weiner discusses her potential involvement in a blog for Politico, the political news site, and talks about his cats. He also asks the woman to delete other messages they exchanged.

A second, salacious chat exchange posted by The Dirty was from an account using the name Carlos Danger, which the site, quoting the unidentified woman, says is Weiner.

Weiner stepped down from Congress in June 2011 after admitting that he had texted lewd pictures of himself to women, reversing previous denials. In May, Weiner entered the race for New York City mayor and his wife, an aide to former secretary of State Hillary Clinton, is campaigning for him. The couple have an 18-month-old son.

On Tuesday, Weiner said his behavior was ""problematic to say the least, and self-destructive to say the most,"" but he reminded reporters that he had said at the time that more pictures and messages might be out there. The messages revealed Monday ""don't represent all that much that is new.""

Because of the upcoming Sept. 10 Democratic primary, ""I'm surprised that more things didn't come out sooner,"" he said Tuesday.

""While some things that have been posted today are true and some are not, there is no question that what I did was wrong,"" Weiner said in a written statement. ""This behavior is behind me. I've apologized to Huma and am grateful that she has worked through these issues with me and for her forgiveness. I want to again say that I am very sorry to anyone who was on the receiving end of these messages and the disruption that this has caused. As my wife and I have said, we are focused on moving forward.""

At the news conference, Weiner refused to detail which of the messages were authentic.

Sometimes smiling and sometimes near tears, the elegantly dressed Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton, addressed one of the biggest questions of the Weiner story: why she is still married to him. ""It took a lot of work and a whole lot of therapy to get to the point where I could forgive Anthony,"" she said.

Staying with Weiner ""was not an easy choice in any way,"" she said. ""But I made a decision that it was worth staying in this marriage. that was a decision I made for me, for our son and for our family. I didn't know how it would work, out but I did know that I wanted to give it a try.""

George Arzt, a New York Democratic political consultant, said the new revelations would make Weiner's campaign much harder, particularly with former N.Y. governor Eliot Spitzer running for city comptroller after his own sex scandal.

""Obviously he has a lot of problems, plus the fact that I think that Spitzer has taken a lot of air out of his balloon, because they have overlapping aberrant behavior,"" Arzt said. ""There is a cumulative impact for the public. They're willing to give anyone a second chance, and then they see the repetitive nature of his misdeeds, and they say, nah, I just can't.''

The WorldNutDaily columnist and frequent Faux News guest is out with a new column that calls for Obama to be overthrown ""by any means necessary""--even if they aren't legal.



I have said previously that if a preponderance of Americans suddenly became aware of what I and a few others know (not “believe,” but know), they would stream into our nation’s capital by the millions, concern for personal safety cast aside in light of that which is at stake. They would demand the resignation of those in this administration, as well as many who have facilitated its crimes. Seeing this, these ruling class elites would have no choice but to retreat – or to attempt to forcibly quell the movement. Such action at that point would undoubtedly fail, given the determination of so large and motivated a host. This administration, much of the Congress, and the creatures who support the same in blissful, belligerent ignorance must be neutralized if this nation is to survive in any semblance of its intended form. And it must be done by any means necessary, because such criminals have proven that they are not dissuaded by trifles like legality. The law, in our President’s estimation, is what he says it is. This has been proven time and again. So Obama and his cabal, and in all likelihood a substantial segment of Congress must go. We must also extricate the radicals and Islamists whom Obama has so kindly insinuated into high places in our government. And the culture of our government must change. Indeed, it will take some time and sacrifice, but America has never faced a threat such as this. In truth, I don’t think any nation has.

Rush maintains that nothing short of a coup is necessary to pull the country from ""the brink of totalitarianism."" The best that can be said about this sentiment is that Rush is blind in his right eye. After all, we now know that a substantial element of the GOP deliberately planned to defund Obamacare knowing full well it would cause a shutdown. Tell me how that isn't undemocratic.

Moreover, Rush is the last person to wring his hands about authoritarian excess. Before the 2012 election, he claimed that the first priority for a Romney administration should have been to arrest Democrats and journalists for treason--a claim that he reiterated back in July. In the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombings, he called for all Muslims to be lined up and shot.

I really have to wonder--what does it say about Faux News and WorldNutDaily that this guy is still associated with them?"

Washington (CNN) - What a difference a month makes.

A new CNN/ORC International poll indicates a dramatic turnaround in the battle for control of Congress in next year's midterm elections.



Democrats a month ago held a 50%-42% advantage among registered voters in a generic ballot, which asked respondents to choose between a Democrat or Republican in their congressional district without identifying the candidates.

That result came after congressional Republicans appeared to overplay their hand in the bitter fight over the federal government shutdown and the debt ceiling.

But the Democratic lead has disappeared. A new CNN/ORC poll indicates the GOP now holds a 49%-47% edge.

The new survey was conducted last week and released Tuesday.

The 10-point swing follows a political uproar over Obamacare, which included the botched rollout of HealthCare.gov and controversy over insurance policy cancelations due primarily to the new health law.

The turnaround in the CNN/ORC poll follows similar shifts in recent national surveys from Quinnipiac University and Fox News.

At a news conference two weeks ago, President Barack Obama acknowledged that problems plaguing the startup of the new healthcare law could hurt Democrats.

""There is no doubt that our failure to rollout the ACA smoothly has put a burden on Democrats, whether they are running or not because they stood up and supported this effort through thick and thin,"" Obama said.

The CNN/ORC poll, released as the President makes a West Coast campaign fundraising swing on behalf of fellow Democrats, indicates both parties making gains within their base.

""It looks like the biggest shifts toward the Republicans came among white voters, higher-income Americans, and people who live in rural areas, while Democrats have gained strength in the past month among some of their natural constituencies, such as non-white voters and lower-income Americans,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.

""If those patterns persist into 2014, it may indicate that Obamacare is popular among those who it was designed to help the most, but unpopular among the larger group of voters who are personally less concerned about health insurance and health care,"" Holland said.

Republicans currently have a 17-seat advantage in the U.S. House with the Democrats holding a 55-45 majority in the Senate.

While the generic ballot question is one of the most commonly used indicators when it comes to the battle for Congress, the poll results are a long way from predicting what will happen next November.

""There is just under a year to go before any votes are actually cast and the 'generic ballot' question is not necessarily a good predictor of the actual outcome of 435 separate elections,"" Holland cautions.

""A year before the 2010 midterms, for example, the Democrats held a six-point lead on the generic ballot but the GOP wound up regaining control of the House in that election cycle, thanks to an historic 63-seat pickup,"" he said.

The poll was conducted November 18-20 for CNN by ORC International, with 843 adult Americans, including 749 registered voters, questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points."

Yeah, why didn’t these guys do things the normal way? A donation to the campaign war chest and a promise to “keep in close contact,” followed by a visit from a lobbyist with a copy of the proposed legislation?

“Most lawmakers in Congress do a lot of that stuff. They’re just more tactful in how they go about it,” said Melanie Sloan of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. She recalled the recent discovery that Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey had been using his influence to try to resolve a multimillion-dollar Medicare billing dispute for a Florida ophthalmologist whose company contributed more than $700,000 toward the election of Senate Democrats, Menendez included. The senator, who is nothing if not a skilled practitioner of business as usual, is shocked, wounded and dismayed that anyone would imagine a quid pro quo.

“At least he’s expensive,” Sloan said.

Our New York gang comes pretty cheap. Although perhaps it’s heartening to realize that America is still a country so filled with promise that even the chairman of the Bronx Republican Party can dream of one day being indicted for taking a $15,000 bribe. There are hardly any Republicans in the Bronx to chair — the party leader himself, who got the job when his predecessor went to the clink, actually lives someplace in the suburbs.

One of the stranger elements to the New York story was word that a Bronx assemblyman named Nelson Castro has been wearing a wire for the feds for virtually his entire political career. He originally got into trouble when election officials noticed nine voters were registered as living with him in his one-bedroom apartment. Unable to demonstrate how all that worked out, Castro agreed to cooperate with authorities and became the F.B.I.’s own social networking system. Nobody knows yet what else showed up on the Castro tapes, but the assemblyman announced his resignation this week, expressing pride “of my accomplishments and the many benefits that I have secured on behalf of my district over the last four years.”

So, here’s a hopeful thought: maybe you can hit a point of ethical bankruptcy where, for want of anybody else to sell out, all the plotters betray each other."

Hunt', 'Bloomberg View']","Deeply Conservative, but Not an Obama-Hater","WASHINGTON — Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona likes President Obama, voted to give him the authority to strike Syria, supported the comprehensive immigration legislation favored by the White House, and works comfortably with members of the opposing party.

The six-term House Republican, who is now serving his first term in the Senate, also is a rock-ribbed conservative, especially on economic and fiscal issues. He has been a darling of the Club for Growth; before going to Congress, he ran the Goldwater Institute in his home state.

As a conservative who mixes conviction and civility, he is a member of a vanishing breed. He stands out among the Tea Party-driven congressional Republicans who are threatening to shut down the government or risk a U.S. default by refusing to increase the debt ceiling — and do not withhold their venom toward Mr. Obama. (Representative Kerry Bentivolio of Michigan, for example, delights his constituents with his relish for a presidential impeachment. His animosity runs so deep that he said he “couldn’t stand” to be in the same room with Mr. Obama.)

On most social questions, Mr. Flake is squarely on the right. He opposes abortion rights, and, unlike Arizona’s senior senator, John McCain, he refused to break with orthodoxy and support a mild background check for gun buyers. He is a Mormon — a graduate of Brigham Young University in Utah and a former missionary in Africa — and opposes same-sex marriage. But he is not a demagogue; in the House, he voted to repeal the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” restriction and to allow gays to serve in the armed forces."

He Sketches The Foolish', 'The Fallacious', 'The Felonious In Politics.']","Dana Milbank: Lindsey Graham, watching his right flank","Lindsey Graham is turning himself into the mad dog of Capitol Hill.

First, the Republican senator from South Carolina opposed Chuck Hagel’s nomination to be defense secretary because of Hagel’s foreign policy views. Then he argued that Hagel had not produced sufficient background material. Now he’s arguing against Hagel because of the administration’s handling of the attack on U.S. diplomats in Benghazi, Libya, last September — when Hagel was a professor at Georgetown University.

“I am going to fight the idea of jamming somebody through until we get answers about what the president did personally when it came to the Benghazi debacle,” he said in the Senate TV studio Wednesday, a day before his unprecedented filibuster of a nominee to a national-security Cabinet post.

“How do you respond to critics who say you’re just moving the goal posts?” CNN’s Dana Bash asked.

“Oh, I’m going to take every opportunity. I’m not denying it,” he answered.

“You are moving the goal posts?” Bash asked. Several of us in the room chuckled.

“No!” Graham said, then explained how he was indeed moving the posts. “I’m going to hit you and keep hitting you, absolutely,” he said, raising his voice. Thumping the lectern, he added, “You better believe I’m not going to let this thing go.”

Fox News’s Chad Pergram pointed out that the treatment he was giving Hagel was in a “rare category.”

Graham made a fist. “Am I supposed to sit on the sidelines and be a good compliant Republican and just let this administration not account for what I think is a national security breakdown of monumental proportions?” He added that “I guaran-damn-tee you” that Democrats would treat a Republican president even worse.

And I guaran-damn-tee you this: Graham’s antics have as much to do with events in Columbia, S.C., as with events in Washington. His sentiments are no doubt genuine, but the ferocity with which he has been attacking the Obama administration — taking a high-profile role on Benghazi, Susan Rice, Hagel and gun control — are helping him to repel a tea party primary challenge at home.

Graham acknowledged the pressure when I asked him about the influence of home-state politics on his recent actions. “You know, I’m in a red state. I know I’m always exposed in a Republican primary,” he said. But he argued, correctly, that he continues to take a leading role on immigration, which infuriates many conservatives.

“I think it’s positive for me to one day beat the hell out of them and the next day see if we can do a deal,” he said. He described his role in the opposition as a balance between saying “yes for the common good of the country where you can” and saying “no because you need to.”

The problem is Graham, to get through the 2014 primary, needs to say “no” more often now. And Congress can hardly afford for one of its few remaining dealmakers to take an obstreperous turn. But perhaps Graham should be given some slack. The Republican primary system has gone haywire, and this may be the only way a sensible lawmaker can survive it.

Not too long ago, Graham had been in deep trouble with South Carolina conservatives because of his talk about climate-change legislation, his votes for both of Obama’s Supreme Court nominees, his criticism of the Bush administration’s wiretapping and interrogation programs, and his championing of “Grahamnesty” immigration reforms.

But the gradual repositioning has apparently worked. A survey by Public Policy Polling in December found that the percentage of Republicans saying they would vote for him in a primary has climbed to 51 percent from 37 percent in January 2011.

And Graham isn’t letting up. At a hearing on gun control, he unnerved a witness, a U.S. attorney, by beginning his questions with a blunt inquiry: “Do you own a gun?” At a Benghazi hearing, he got the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to admit he was “surprised” about Hillary Clinton’s ignorance of the ambassador to Libya’s request for more security shortly before he was killed.

And Graham delivered a memorable hectoring of Hagel for the nominee’s prior claim that lawmakers are “intimidated” by the Israel lobby. “Name one,” Graham challenged. Hagel couldn’t.

Graham, who has voted the conservative line 90 percent of the time over his career, argues that his new positions are consistent with his previous ones — and they are. But the difference is in the emphasis. In order to survive the Republicans’ backward primary system, Graham needs to de-emphasize anything that might make him appear to be reasonable.

He last flew down after his father died in October. More than 500 people attended the funeral at Seaview Baptist Church. A roadblock had to be erected in a town where many of the roads are still dirt paths. Friends said he did not talk of his troubles.

Beverton Roye said Thompson had assured him earlier that he would prevail. “He said: ‘Don’t worry about me. I’m going to be all right. I’m clean,’ ” said Roye, who is chief public health inspector for St. Elizabeth parish. “Those are the exact words he said to me.”

The usually media-shy Thompson basked in the spotlight each year during the televised, black-tie NAACP Image Awards. For more than a decade, TCBA had been the accounting firm that tabulated the results. But last year, the NAACP used other accountants.

President Obama, Gov. O’Malley, Del. Norton and Del. Donna M. Christensen, who represents the U.S. Virgin Islands, have returned contributions they believed were associated with Thompson. Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (D-Va.) also returned money that had been given to his gubernatorial campaign.

TCBA is now BCA. Thompson sold his 79 percent interest to Ralph Bazilio. He has sold some of his properties, including the salon that he allowed his hairdresser to use.

Lawyer Charles Parsons sued Thompson when he tried to renege on the sale of the salon. “His assets are being stripped, and here I was, one of the strippers,” Parsons said.

Parsons said he met with Thompson in person three or four times. They settled in March. Parsons noticed that Thompson never showed up in his tailor-made suits.

“I thought he would be a very arrogant guy. . . . He’s had so much money sloshing around the gas tank,” Parsons said. “The fact of the matter is he wasn’t without his charm. He saw the humor in things. He laughed. He was laughing at a time when his world was coming down.”

New York (CNN) – The now-immortalized final moment of Anthony Weiner's failed New York mayoral campaign was the candidate's middle finger directed at a reporter curbside as his car drove away Tuesday night.

CNN affiliate NY-1 captured Weiner flipping the bird on video as the candidate departed his primary election night party after delivering his concession speech, punctuating the end of his bizarre campaign and an odd evening.



Press, Weiner security scuffle. Reporter: ""These are the type of people you surround yourself w/, who push us?"" Cue: pic.twitter.com/TAKCKz88xc — Lindsey Christ (@LindseyChrist) September 11, 2013

If that wasn't enough drama, Weiner had trouble getting into his event as Sydney Leathers, the woman at the center of the sexting controversy that began the unraveling of his mayoral campaign, had shown up outside in what she admitted was a blatant play for media attention. Weiner's problem was there was only one entrance to Connolly's Pub and Restaurant, the election night headquarters for his campaign.

""I'm here to celebrate. I think he needs some sex therapy,"" explained Leathers, who is now embracing a career in the porn industry.

In Weiner's final days, more curiosity than serious candidate

Dressed in a skintight, red dress and platform black pumps, Leathers got what she was looking for as some of the press inside headed outside to interview the newly minted porn star. For about 30 minutes, it was a media frenzy outside. Leathers stuck around for several hours hoping Weiner would show up, even heading inside to the bar to drink a glass of white wine with a male friend.

""We went to his campaign headquarters today first, and he decided to rearrange his schedule because apparently he doesn't think he can handle confronting me or me being in his presence so I felt like it was only appropriate to make one last stop,"" she said.

She was right that campaign staff didn't want a scene out front as they spent a long time figuring out how to choreograph Weiner's arrival. When the candidate finally showed just before 11 p.m., he quickly bolted into a next door McDonald's restaurant. The press corps and Leathers gave chase – yes, this really happened – security pulled a blocking maneuver as Weiner ducked through a door that connected Connolly's and the Mickey D's.

Despite the antics, Weiner made no mention of the spectacle outside during his concession speech. But his mood may have been reflected by his departing gesture.

After the bruising debt-ceiling fight — as well as Standard & Poor's subsequent downgrade of the nation's credit rating — Obama's job approval rating has sunk to a low of 44 percent, a 3-point drop since July. His handling of the economy stands at a low of 37 percent. And only 19 percent believe the country is headed in the right direction, the lowest mark for this president.

Perhaps most ominously for Obama, a majority of poll takers — 54 percent — think he's facing a longer-term setback from which he's unlikely to recover. Back in January, just 39 percent agreed with that assessment.

Indeed, that 54 percent is virtually identical to George W. Bush's score on the same question in the Nov. 2005 NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, which was released just months after Bush's widely criticized handling of Hurricane Katrina.

""When [Obama] addresses the American public, he is going to have one more chance to provide some sense of hope and optimism that he ... can provide answers to what is a woeful economy,"" said Democratic pollster Peter D. Hart, who conducted the survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff.

But both Hart and McInturff contend that Obama wasn't the only party damaged by the debt ceiling debacle. A whopping 82 percent now disapprove of the job Congress is doing. In the history of this poll, it's an all-time high level of dissatisfaction with Capitol Hill.

In addition, when asked who is most to blame for the S&P downgrade, a plurality points to congressional Republicans. And a majority of respondents say they would vote out every single member of Congress if they could.

""Everybody in Washington is taking a substantial hit,"" McInturff said.

Silver linings for Obama

Yet Obama, in particular, took a gut punch. According to the poll, just 42 percent give the president high marks for possessing strong leadership qualities. That’s a 12-point drop from May (in the days following Osama bin Laden’s death).

In addition, his high marks for being a good commander in chief have plunged 10 points (from 51 percent in May to his current 41 percent rating); his high marks for having the ability to handle a crisis have dropped 14 points (from 53 percent to 39 percent); and his high marks for achieving his goals have declined another 14 points (from 41 percent to 27 percent).

If there's a silver lining for Obama, it's that a combined 70 percent of respondents still find him likeable (though nearly six in 10 say they disapprove of many of his policies). And 50 percent approve of his handling of foreign policy, which Hart says is significant because it suggests that the public doesn't think that everything Obama touches can be viewed negatively.

What's more, in a hypothetical general election contest, Obama leads Texas Gov. Rick Perry by five points, 47 percent to 42 percent. And he leads former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney by one, 46 percent to 45 percent, though that margin is down five points since June.

But for the first time in the poll, more say they'd probably vote for a generic Republican candidate (44 percent) than say they'd probably vote for Obama (40 percent).

""Obama is no longer the favorite to win re-election,"" Hart said, explaining that a head-to-head score will usually conform to the generic one, especially when so many believe the country is headed in the wrong direction.

Perry takes commanding GOP lead

And there's a new favorite in the race for the Republican presidential nomination.

Heading into the post-Labor Day sprint and the NBC News/Politico-sponsored debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library on Wednesday, Perry is the first choice among 38 percent of GOP voters — followed by Romney at 23 percent, Texas Rep. Ron Paul at 9 percent and Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann at 8 percent.

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and ex-Godfather’s Pizza CEO Herman Cain are tied with 5 percent of GOP voters each, while former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum gets 3 percent and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman gets 2 percent.

The NBC/WSJ survey is the latest poll to show Perry leading Romney nationally. In recent days, Gallup, Quinnipiac and CNN have had Perry out in front.

On the 'super committee' and 9/11

Also this week, Congress returns to work, and topping the agenda is the start to the 12-member Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction — better known as the “super committee.”

In the poll, 60 percent say it would be acceptable if the ""super committee"" considers reducing the deficit by ending the so-called Bush tax cuts for families earning $250,000 or more per year. Moreover, 56 percent say it would be acceptable if it considers reducing the deficit by a combination of tax increases and spending cuts.

By comparison, just 37 percent believe it’s acceptable for the committee to reduce the deficit by only cutting spending and not raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy. And only 20 percent say it’s acceptable to lower the deficit by reducing spending on Medicare.

Finally, this Sunday will be the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks. According to the poll, 42 percent believe the U.S. is now safer than it was before the attacks — a 9-point increase from Aug. 2010.

Thirty-six percent think the U.S. is about as safe as it was before the attacks, and 21 percent say it’s less safe.

But, by more than a 2-to-1 margin, respondents maintain that the 9/11 attacks had less of a personal impact to them than the economic recession did.

Forty-six percent cited the recession as the event that had the greatest effect on them, versus 20 percent who cited the 9/11 attacks.

The NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll was conducted of 1,000 adults (200 reached by cell phone) from Aug. 27-31, and it has an overall margin of error of plus-minus 3.1 percentage points.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/08/02/Daily-Beast-Harasses-Private-Citizens-Who-Donated-to-Palin-s-PAC,2013-08-02 00:00:00,['Tony Lee'],Daily Beast Harasses Private Citizens Who Donated to Palin's PAC,"This week, the Daily Beast contacted and harassed private citizens who made contributions to Sarah Palin’s political action committee, SarahPAC. In doing so, the outlet attempted to also weaken her organization by smearing it in the eyes of those most responsible for ensuring Palin’s free-market populist message and conservatism is widely disseminated.

During the first half of 2013, a political off-year in which there are few elections, Palin’s political action committee spent $35,000 more than it took in. The Daily Beast seized on that number and tried to convince donors to SarahPAC that Palin was defrauding them by spending money on expenses common to every political action committee.

As the Daily Beast conceded, Palin’s donors were not buying the Beast’s malarkey.

Tim Crawford, the treasurer of SarahPAC, told Breitbart News that since 2013 is an off-year, the organization did not aggressively raise money, cognizant of the fact conservative donors were flooded with requests during the 2012 election cycle.

“For the most part we gave our donors a break and didn’t fundraise aggressively at all. Very pleased with the results,” Crawford told Breitbart News. “It is an off year after a presidential election where every donor was bombarded with requests.”

As the Daily Beast mentioned, Palin’s PAC did make a $5,000 contribution to Jason Smith; the conservative Republican won a special election in Missouri’s Eighth Congressional District in June by a hefty margin, 67% to 27%.

John Avlon, the co-founder of the anti-Tea Party “No Labels” group, was recently promoted to be the “Executive Editor” of the Daily Beast. Avlon oversees a publication that declared the Tea Party was dead earlier this year before conceding less than six months later that the movement has roared back to life.

“No Labels” donors want to see the Tea Party destroyed, and Avlon’s group benefits financially and politically if the Tea Party and conservatives are weakened. Palin, coincidentally, is the political figure who former South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint said had the most impact in Republican primaries. Furthermore, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) declared at this year’s CPAC that he would not be in the Senate were it not for Palin’s support in the Texas Republican Senate primary.

Showing Palin’s strong grassroots support, the Daily Beast acknowledges that 75% of SarahPAC’s donations are from “small donors” who contribute less than $200. The Daily Beast admitted they reached out to a “number” of donors and got three on record, all of whom dismissed the outlet’s assertion that SarahPAC was wasting their money.

One donor said, “I trust her judgment and her record.” Another said she has “done research” on Palin’s advisers and the ones that she uses are the “good” ones. Another donor mocked the Daily Beast for insinuating Palin was wasting their money, simply telling the reporter, “Come on, get real.”

The publication seems troubled that Palin, a figure whose star power is surpassed by few in American politics, paid North Star Strategies’s Jason Recher to organize and accompany Palin to events to ensure they went smoothly. To the Daily Beast’s surprise, Palin also has advisers, like Rebecca Mansour–who is mentioned in the piece–that are indispensable to any political figure, especially those like Palin whose time is in demanded like few others.

Breitbart News has already systematically undercut Avlon’s assertion that Palin was being hypocritical for railing against Washington’s permanent political class while having political advisers who fight against it. Palin’s advisers are different, as Breitbart News reported:

They don’t hang “for sale” signs around their necks every election cycle to field a slate of candidates to butter their breads. They don’t go on television shows while not disclosing their business interests or allegiances when attacking other candidates. In fact, it is difficult to even think of the last time a Palin staff member actually went on a television program. Again, it is because these are people who work for Palin, are assembled for the long run, and put Palin’s interests ahead of their own. They don’t have a stable or roster of clients.

In closing, the Daily Beast criticized Palin’s PAC for spending money on hotel rooms so that Palin could give a “commencement speech in the tiny town of Republic, Washington.” As Breitbart News reported, Palin gave that speech in a town elitist New York outlets like the Daily Beast so often dismiss, deride, and ignore.

The Daily Beast criticized Palin for paying her way–and not forgetting her roots–to speak at the high school graduation in Republic, Washington. Perhaps the outlet expected her to walk or drive to give that address. More disturbingly, though, the outlet harassed and pestered private citizens who donated to her political organization, trying to turn them off from supporting a political figure and organization that runs counter to the one co-founded by the Daily Beast’s Executive Editor.

That is the type of permanent-political-class politics that Palin and her political action committee have always fought."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/10/20/CBS-Congress-Using-Slush-Funds-to-Bankroll-Lavish-Lifestyle,2013-10-20 00:00:00,['Wynton Hall'],60 Minutes: Congress Using 'Slush Funds' to Bankroll Lavish Lifestyles,"On Sunday, a 60 Minutes investigative report by veteran CBS reporter Steve Kroft and Government Accountability Institute (GAI) President and Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer revealed how leadership PAC loopholes allow members of Congress to convert campaign cash into lavish lifestyle upgrades for themselves and their family members.

“It’s another example, unfortunately, where the rules that apply to the rest of us, don’t really apply to the members of Congress,” said Schweizer on 60 Minutes.

The report, which contained selected material from Schweizer’s forthcoming book Extortion: How Politicians Extract Your Money, Buy Votes, and Line Their Own Pockets, revealed embarrassing and outlandish instances of cronyism and self-enrichment by members of Congress. Despite the fact that funds from leadership PACs are supposed to go to help elect fellow members of one’s own political party, lax campaign laws allow lawmakers to turn their leadership PACs into private slush funds to fund just about anything.

Rep. Rob Andrews (D-NJ), for example, tapped his wife, a lawyer and an associate law dean at Rutgers School of Law-Camden, to be a PAC compliance officer for his leadership PAC. She approved the use of donor dollars to fly her, Rep. Andrews, and their two daughters to Edinburgh, Scotland for a wedding at a posh resort. Andrews’s leadership PAC paid $16,575 in airfare. His campaign committee picked up the rest of the tab, which was slightly under $14,000. Schweizer says Andrews’s leadership PAC even paid for the wedding gift, which was china from Bloomingdale’s. Andrews and his wife even merged a campaign event with their daughter’s graduation party, allowing them to combine the costs of the two events, even though the PAC did not pick up the entire bill.

When Kroft confronted the Democratic New Jersey congressman, Andrews said, “I think we should take a look at having clearer rules at what they can and cannot be spent for. I’d be for that.” Andrews claimed he could not speak more on the matter because of a pending House Ethics investigation, even though Kroft said the committee told him they were fine with Andrews speaking about the matter.

Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY) attempted to use $6,230 in campaign funds to pay for a personal trainer. Meeks’s staff claimed using campaign money for a fitness instructor is a legitimate expense, because gym visits alleviate stress from Meeks’s “official duties.” The investigation also revealed that Meeks has used $35,000 from his leadership PAC on NFL games.

Sen. Saxby Chambliss’s (R-GA) leadership PAC dropped $107,752 at the Breakers resort in Palm Beach during the 2012 election cycle. That is over three times as much money as he gave the National Republican Senatorial Committee to get fellow Republicans elected. One year, Chambliss spent nearly one-third of his entire leadership PAC funds on golf, limos, and at least one private jet ride. His leadership PAC also picked up a $26,814 dinner tab at Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse and $10,344 at Pebble Beach.

The 60 Minutes special also revealed how members of Congress exploit a self-loan loophole that allows politicians to loan their own campaigns money at high interest rates and then let the loans linger to generate hundreds of thousands of dollars in passive streams of profit for themselves.

Rep. Grace Napolitano (D-CA) has bagged at least $294,245 since 1998 by loaning her congressional campaign money at interest rates up to 18%–a scheme that effectively funneled campaign contributor donations into her personal bank account. After numerous attempts to interview Napolitano, Kroft finally confronted her outside a Hispanic Caucus meeting.

“She told us that as a woman and a minority, banks wouldn’t lend her money, so she had to withdraw $150,000 from an investment account to lend it to her campaign,” said Kroft.

Kroft then questioned why she would charge 18% interest. “That’s what the Mafia gets,” he exclaimed.

“It isn’t like I’ve really profited,” said Napolitano. “I still live in the same house. I drive a small car. I am not a billionaire, or a millionaire, for that matter.”

The 60 Minutes report also revealed that members of Congress are permitted to use leadership PAC money to hire their own family members. As Kroft and Schweizer point out, most corporations have nepotism laws that prevent the hiring of family members. And while congressional rules bar family members from serving on a congressman’s official staff, lawmakers are free to hire family to serve on their campaigns.

Former Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX) put his daughter, grandson, daughter’s mother-in-law, grandson-in-law, granddaughter, and another relative–six family members in total–on his campaign payroll. The Paul progeny received a combined $304,599.

Kroft also confronted retiring Rep. Rodney Alexander (R-LA) about actions Schweizer reports on in Extortion. Alexander paid his two daughters over $130,000 in combined expenses for working on his campaign, which he won with an overwhelming 78% of the vote. Kroft asked Alexander what his daughters did.

“They do everything that others do for other campaigns,” said Alexander. “Somebody has to do that work. I kept it with someone I can trust. If one can’t trust their daughter, then who can they trust?”

Kroft and Schweizer agreed that leadership PACs are hotbeds of cronyism and self-enrichment.

“The abuse is substantial and pretty widespread,” said Kroft.

Schweizer agreed and said that is precisely how the Establishment likes it.

“We hear a lot about how there’s so much partisan fighting in Washington,” said Schweizer. “Here’s a great example of bipartisanship. Both sides like this current system.”

Sunday’s 60 Minutes report is just the tip of the iceberg. According to Schweizer’s publisher, next week’s Tuesday release of Extortion will include never-before-released documents and revelations on several top Democrats, Republicans, President Barack Obama, and Attorney General Eric Holder."

Anthony Weiner quit Congress after a sexting scandal in 2011

Wife says she has forgiven him

Weiner says he won%27t drop out of the race

NEW YORK -- Former congressman Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., said he would not quit his race for mayor of New York City, despite acknowledging that he continued to send women inappropriate online messages after a sexting scandal forced him to resign from Congress in 2011.

""I said that other texts and photos were likely to come out, and today they have,"" Weiner said in a hastily arranged news conference with his wife by his side. Weiner acknowledged that some of the inappropriate texts were sent after he had resigned.

""Some of these things happened before my resignation, some of them happened after,"" Weiner said.

""I'm sure many of my opponents would like me to drop out of the race,"" he said, but he refused to drop out of the race. After the news conference he went directly to a mayoral candidate forum.

""Anthony has made some horrible mistakes both before he resigned from Congress and after,"" said Weiner's wife, Huma Abedin. ""I love him, I have forgiven him, I believe in him.""

An online gossip site called The Dirty posted screenshots Monday of online messages between an account in the name of Anthony Weiner and that of an unidentified woman. The site said the messages were sent last August, more than a year after Weiner left Congress. Weiner discusses her potential involvement in a blog for Politico, the political news site, and talks about his cats. He also asks the woman to delete other messages they exchanged.

A second, salacious chat exchange posted by The Dirty was from an account using the name Carlos Danger, which the site, quoting the unidentified woman, says is Weiner.

Weiner stepped down from Congress in June 2011 after admitting that he had texted lewd pictures of himself to women, reversing previous denials. In May, Weiner entered the race for New York City mayor and his wife, an aide to former secretary of State Hillary Clinton, is campaigning for him. The couple have an 18-month-old son.

On Tuesday, Weiner said his behavior was ""problematic to say the least, and self-destructive to say the most,"" but he reminded reporters that he had said at the time that more pictures and messages might be out there. The messages revealed Monday ""don't represent all that much that is new.""

Because of the upcoming Sept. 10 Democratic primary, ""I'm surprised that more things didn't come out sooner,"" he said Tuesday.

""While some things that have been posted today are true and some are not, there is no question that what I did was wrong,"" Weiner said in a written statement. ""This behavior is behind me. I've apologized to Huma and am grateful that she has worked through these issues with me and for her forgiveness. I want to again say that I am very sorry to anyone who was on the receiving end of these messages and the disruption that this has caused. As my wife and I have said, we are focused on moving forward.""

At the news conference, Weiner refused to detail which of the messages were authentic.

Sometimes smiling and sometimes near tears, the elegantly dressed Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton, addressed one of the biggest questions of the Weiner story: why she is still married to him. ""It took a lot of work and a whole lot of therapy to get to the point where I could forgive Anthony,"" she said.

Staying with Weiner ""was not an easy choice in any way,"" she said. ""But I made a decision that it was worth staying in this marriage. that was a decision I made for me, for our son and for our family. I didn't know how it would work, out but I did know that I wanted to give it a try.""

George Arzt, a New York Democratic political consultant, said the new revelations would make Weiner's campaign much harder, particularly with former N.Y. governor Eliot Spitzer running for city comptroller after his own sex scandal.

""Obviously he has a lot of problems, plus the fact that I think that Spitzer has taken a lot of air out of his balloon, because they have overlapping aberrant behavior,"" Arzt said. ""There is a cumulative impact for the public. They're willing to give anyone a second chance, and then they see the repetitive nature of his misdeeds, and they say, nah, I just can't.''

Pollak'],"With 60 Minutes Joint Interview, Obama Suggests Republicans Surrender","Beyond the media fawning over the spectacle of President Barack Obama and outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sitting down for an interview together on 60 Minutes–old rivals, reunited!–there is a message that the president wants to send. Not just the fact that Vice President Joe Biden will not be his first pick for 2016, but also the signal that Republicans ought to forget about a revival in four years: liberalism is here to stay.

Republicans seem to have concluded that their overall revival depends on finding the right candidate to win. If so, they may be in for a long wait. Clinton is so popular right now–with Republicans as well as Democrats–that she is easily the favorite to win in 2016. Freshman Rep. Tom Cotton (R-AR) welcomed her during last week’s Benghazi hearings by telling her he had wished her to win the 2008 Democratic primary; even Paul Ryan suggested on Meet the Press that a President Clinton might have solved the debt crisis by now.

Clinton’s popularity is partly due to the fact that she is so different to Obama. She is not as hostile to opposition, and gives more direct-sounding answers to tough questions, even when she is being just as evasive. She once gave the impression of being more centrist, as well, famously voting in 2002 to authorize the Iraq War–a vote that her rival punished her for on the campaign trail in 2008, claiming he would have voted differently.

In truth, there is not much daylight between the Alinskyite pair. Clinton not only carried out the Obama administration’s awful foreign policy–she did so with enthusiasm. She lectured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for 45 minutes over construction in Jewish parts of Jerusalem, for example, and launched an abortive “reset” in relations with Russia (a gesture that failed even in its theatrics; the button read “overcharge”).

Obama and Clinton are also closely bound together in the Benghazi failure, a scandal whose details are still being kept from the public, even though it is broadly clear that the White House chose not to intervene to save U.S. personnel, and at the same time engineered a cover-up in which both Obama and Clinton agreed to a fraudulent alibi that blamed the deadly attack on an anti-Islam video on YouTube that few had seen.

Yet the two have avoided accountability, since the media failed to pursue the Benghazi scandal before the election (or actively suppressed it), and now that the election is long gone, most have adopted the “what difference does it make?” attitude displayed by Clinton on Capitol Hill last week. She ought to be haunted by those words, and those four dead Americans, for the rest of her career; chances are, however, that she will not.

Obama’s joint interview was likely planned as a gesture of support and unity as the Benghazi scandal returned–however briefly–to the headlines. Yet it also serves a political purpose for the president, as he moves forward with an aggressive and confrontational agenda designed to divide and marginalize opposition and lay the foundation for radical changes, not just for the next four years but the in years beyond.

President Obama wants Republicans to know that the left’s moment is not fleeting; that the changes he makes today will be ratified by the electorate, through Clinton, in 2016 and possibly 2020; in short, that there is no hope for a resurgence and they may as well yield. Whether he succeeds may depend less on how Republicans rebuild themselves, and more on whether Biden–and other Democrats–disrupt the Obama-Clinton alliance."

Can loneliness kill you?

THE TAKE

Hillary’s Ties to Obama Could Cost Her

Some Republicans believe revelations about Benghazi could raise questions about Hillary Clinton’s stewardship at the State Department. But for Clinton, the general tenor of scandal that has suffused the administration could cost her more.

If the media focus shifts from Obama’s second-term legacy to second-term scandals, it could cast a pall over those looking to capitalize on his coattails.

Clinton knows all too well about the public’s desire for change, both from her own presidential race and the conclusion of her husband’s second term. Public dissatisfaction with George W. Bush sent Democratic voters looking for someone with less time in Washington and disconnected from the war in Iraq. Nearly a decade earlier, then-Vice President Al Gore awkwardly tried to distance himself from his former boss after Bill Clinton’s sex scandal, despite voters’ widespread approval of Clinton’s policies.

By connecting herself to Obama so closely—most recently with a joint sitdown on 60 Minutes—Clinton hoped to benefit from Obama’s strong popularity among Democrats. Now there’s a very real chance that the rewards of that loyalty could dissipate.

‘ONE IS THE LONELIEST NUMBER?’ MAYBE NOT. Loneliness can increase your likelihood of sickness and even death, The New Republic reports. Loneliness is not being frequently alone nor does it mean someone who has few friends is lonely. Loneliness is a “want of intimacy” and an “interior” experience. The cause of loneliness is combination of genes and environment. “Although genes may predispose children toward loneliness, they do not account for everything that makes them grow up lonely. Fifty-two percent of that comes from the world.”Some have pushed back against the idea that the feeling of loneliness can cause health problems, arguing rather that it’s the symptoms of loneliness. For example, lonely people lack a support network, or someone who will look out for them, and therefore get sick more often. Read more

Two Democratic political operatives were convicted Thursday night in the illegal scheme after only three hours of deliberations. They were found guilty on all counts.

Former longtime St. Joseph County Democratic party Chairman Butch Morgan Jr. was found guilty of felony conspiracy counts to commit petition fraud and forgery, and former county Board of Elections worker Dustin Blythe was found guilty of felony forgery counts and falsely making a petition, after being accused of faking petitions that enabled Obama, then an Illinois Senator, to get on the presidential primary ballot for his first run for the White House.

Morgan was accused of being the mastermind behind the plot.

According to testimony from two former Board of Election officials who pled guilty, Morgan ordered Democratic officials and workers to fake the names and signatures that Obama and Clinton needed to qualify for the presidential race. Blythe, then a Board of Elections employee and Democratic Party volunteer, was accused of forging multiple pages of the Obama petitions.

""I think this helped uphold the integrity of the electoral system,"" the prosecutor, Stan Levco told reporters.

“Their verdict of guilt is not a verdict against Democrats, but for honest and fair elections,” he said.

The scheme was hatched in January of 2008, according to affidavits from investigators who cite former Board of Registration worker Lucas Burkett, who told them he was in on the plan at first, but then became uneasy and quit. He waited three years before telling authorities about it, but if revelations about any forgeries were raised during the election, the petitions could have been challenged during the contest. A candidate who did not qualify with enough legitimate signatures at the time, could have been bounced from the ballot.

The case raise questions about whether in 2008, then candidate Obama actually submitted enough legitimate signatures to have legally qualified for the primary ballot.

“I think had they been challenged successfully, he probably would not have been on the ballot,” Levco told Fox News.

Under state law, presidential candidates need to qualify for the primary ballots with 500 signatures from each of the state's nine congressional districts. Indiana election officials say that in St. Joseph County, which is the 2nd Congressional district, the Obama campaign qualified with 534 signatures; Clinton's camp had 704.

Prosecutors say that in President Obama's case, nine of the petition pages were apparently forged. Each petition contains up to 10 names, making a possible total of 90 names, which, if faked, could have brought the Obama total below the legal limit required to qualify. Prosecutors say 13 Clinton petitions were apparently forged, meaning up to 130 possibly fake signatures. Even if 130 signatures had been challenged, it would have still left Mrs. Clinton with enough signatures to meet the 500 person threshold.

Levco said a total of “100 to 200” signatures had been forged on Obama’s and Clinton’s petitions.

An Indiana State Police investigator said in court papers that the agency examined the suspect Obama petitions and ""selected names at random from each of the petition pages and contacted those people directly. We found at least one person (and often multiple people) from each page who confirmed that they had not signed"" petitions ""or given consent for their name and/or signature to appear.""

Numerous voters told Fox News that they never signed the petitions.

""That's not my signature,"" Charity Rorie, a mother of four, told us when we showed her the Obama petition with her name and signature. She was stunned, saying that it ""absolutely"" was a fake.

Charity told Fox News that her husband's entry was also a forgery, and that they have never been contacted by investigators or any authorities looking into the scandal.

""It's scary, it's shocking. It definitely is illegal,"" she told us.

Robert Hunter, Jr. told Fox news that his name was faked, too.

""I did not sign for Barack Obama,"" he told us. As he examined the Obama petition in his hands, Hunter pointed out that ""I always put 'Junior' after my name, every time...there's no 'Junior' there

Even a former Democratic Governor of Indiana, Joe Kernan, told Fox News that his name was forged.

“This is a bitter sweet moment for free and fair elections,"" observed Ryan Nees, the Indiana born Yale “University senior who first exposed the scheme in the independent political newsletter, Howey Politics Indiana and South Bend Tribune.

Nees said the multiple guilty verdicts were ""bitter, because a five-person conspiracy succeeded in illegally placing two presidential candidates on the ballot, but sweet because they were exposed, tried for their crimes, and convicted.""

Nees previously told Fox News that the fraud was clearly evident, ""because page after page of signatures are all in the same handwriting,"" and that nobody raised any red flags ""because election workers in charge of verifying their validity were the same people faking the signatures.""

The nation's tax agency has admitted to inappropriately scrutinizing smaller tea party organizations that applied for tax-exempt status, and senior Treasury Department officials were notified in the midst of the 2012 presidential election season that an internal investigation was underway. But the IRS largely maintained a hands-off policy with the much larger, big-budget organizations on the left and right that were most influential in the elections and are organized under a section of the tax code that allows them to hide their donors.

""The IRS goes AWOL when wealthy and powerful forces want to break the law in order to hide their wrongful efforts and secret political influence,"" said Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat who is among a small Senate group pushing campaign finance reform measures that would force these big outside groups to disclose their donors. ""Picking on the little guy is a pretty lousy thing to do.""

Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS and the Koch brothers' Americans for Prosperity were among those that spent tens of millions of dollars on TV ads and get-out-the-vote efforts to help Republicans. Democrats were aided in similar fashion by Priorities USA, made up of former Barack Obama campaign aides, and American Bridge 21st Century Foundation, an opposition research group led by a former adviser to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

And yet those groups so far have escaped investigations into whether they have crossed the blurry line under the law between what constitutes a tax-exempt ""social welfare"" organization that is free from donor reporting requirements and a political committee subject to taxes and disclosures.

Watchdog groups and lawmakers who have sought more disclosure and restrictions on such groups claim an injustice. They say the IRS saga over the targeting of smaller groups shines a bright light onto the agency's failure to guard against the flood of secret money into the political system through the creation of the deep-pocketed groups.

Yet other advocates of reform worry that, in light of the IRS disclosure of targeting small groups, government regulators will be less likely to scrutinize the tax-exempt status of the bigger, more powerful groups out of fear that they will appear to be targeting groups for political reasons.

""We expect that opponents of disclosure will try to use the recent developments to allow the groups that are misusing the tax laws to hide donors to continue misusing them. But that's a battle that we will engage in,"" said Fred Wertheimer, founder and president of watchdog group Democracy 21.

Since a series of court decisions including the Supreme Court's ruling in the 2010 Citizens United case, the IRS has seen an influx of applications -- from 1,735 in 2010 to 3,357 in 2012 -- by so-called social welfare groups wanting to form under section 501(c)(4) of the federal tax code. That section grants tax-exempt status as long as the primary mission of these organizations is not politics and influencing elections. The IRS makes that determination. Such nonprofits can keep secret the names of their donors, which are not subject to traditional campaign finance limits.

The rules are fuzzy. The law says that these groups can only be involved in social welfare activity and not politics. But IRS regulations give the groups leeway to conduct political activities -- as long as that is not its ""primary activity."" That conflict opens the door to potential abuses and different interpretations of what is allowed and what is prohibited.

An IRS inspector general's report released this week recommended developing for the first time specific guidelines to measure the primary activity of social welfare organizations, and some in Congress have shown a willingness to review big groups like the nonprofit Crossroads GPS and its sister super PAC, American Crossroads. They spent a combined $176 million in the last election cycle, much of it on television advertisements to benefit Republican candidates.

A Senate investigative panel led by Democrat Carl Levin of Michigan and Republican John McCain of Arizona has been reviewing the use of social welfare groups for political causes for the past year and now is examining the agency's handling of the tax-exempt reviews.

And in a letter to congressional investigators Thursday, Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., urged the House Ways and Means Committee not to ignore the influx of groups that may be abusing the tax code as part of its upcoming IRS probe, saying: ""I hope we can remove the incentive for any group, regardless of its political orientation, to seek 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status to engage in significant political campaign activities while hiding their donors.""

Despite the bipartisan outcry over the IRS scandal, there's little incentive for lawmakers on either side of the aisle to push for reforms because Republicans and Democrats alike benefit from these big outside groups.

In fact, just the opposite may be happening.

Some congressional Democrats, fearful of being tied to the scandal, are backing the push for more aggressive enforcement of these groups. And some conservative leaders and Republican donors are using the IRS scandal to help protect the status quo while preparing to pump hundreds of millions of dollars -- raised anonymously in many cases with no contribution limits -- into the next election cycle, just as they did last fall.

""I would hope that this new information about the politicization of the IRS should put the brakes on any sort of disclosure of donors who wish to remain anonymous,"" said Charlie Spies, who helps raise money for several conservative organizations and previously led the super political action committee that raised more than $140 million to benefit Mitt Romney's presidential bid. ""We're now seeing exactly what the risk is for donors to be disclosed.""

At least some tea party groups are unwilling to trust the agency with more enforcement power in the wake of such damaging revelations.

""The IRS' integrity is shattered,"" said Jenny Beth Martin, chairman of the Tea Party Patriots, which was among the largest nonprofit conservative groups the IRS targeted. She said that now, more than ever, donors need freedom to give money anonymously ""without fear of retribution"" from a politicized IRS. In the meantime, she says her organization's influence is growing, fueled by anonymous unlimited donations.

Wertheimer, of Democracy 21, said the ""laundering of secret money into elections"" will become a greater scandal than IRS misconduct unless something is done.

""There will be efforts to sweep this under the rug,"" he said. ""They may succeed on a temporary basis for a relatively short period, but they are not going to succeed in the long term."""

USA TODAY

Democrat resigned in 2008 after admitting he hired prostitutes

Spitzer has until Thursday to collect voter signatures to get on ballot

He declared interest in NYC comptroller%27s race during interview with %27The New York Times%27

Former New York governor Eliot Spitzer, who resigned five years ago amid a prostitution scandal, said he's running for New York City comptroller because he misses the policy fights and wants a chance to help shape the city's budget.

Spitzer, a Democrat, did a round of media interviews on Monday morning as New York City residents awoke to his surprising interview in The New York Times that he will ask voters for ""forgiveness."" Spitzer has until Thursday to collect the 3,750 signatures he needs from voters to get on the ballot for comptroller -- a job for which he said he believes he has the right ""skill set.""

""I sinned, I owned up to it, I looked them in the eye, I resigned, I held myself accountable,"" Spitzer said on CBS' This Morning program. ""It's now five years later. I hope they (voters) look back at what I did as attorney general, as governor, as a prosecutor and say, 'hey, this guy was ahead of the curve on Wall Street issues.' ""

On the Bill Press radio show, Spitzer said running for comptroller ""is an opportunity to participate in the budget of the city."" He told WCBS that he wants a chance to tell the public, ""here's what I can do."" For the past few years, Spitzer has worked as a political commentator on TV and has taught at City College of New York.

The self-described ""steamroller"" who once cracked down on Wall Street became the first New York governor since the 1970s to step down. In a memorable news conference with his wife, Silda, standing somberly at his side, Spitzer admitted in 2008 that he was a client of a high-end prostitution ring while governor.

On CBS, Spitzer denied that he and his wife are separated and said he discussed with his family his political plans -- which were made final this weekend. Asked if running for New York City comptroller was a step down from governor, Spitzer said, ""Service is service.""

""I think anybody who's been through what I've been through, sure, you want redemption,"" he said. ""If that's what I wanted I don't think this is the path to do it. But what I am seeking is service ... the most satisfying thing for me ever is public service.""

Spitzer is now the third high-profile politician derailed by scandal to seek public office this year. Democrat Anthony Weiner, who resigned from Congress amid a sexting scandal in 2011, is running for New York City mayor and is at or near the top of some public opinion polls on the race.

Republican Mark Sanford was elected in May to a congressional seat in South Carolina, four years after admitting an extramarital affair.

Spitzer has set up a new Twitter account, @SpitzerforNYC, to promote his candidacy and had more than 1,600 followers as of Monday morning.

Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer is among the most prominent candidates seeking the comptroller's job, which is responsible for the city's finances. The comptroller also serves as the city's chief auditor. Kristin Davis, who ran the prostitution ring that Spitzer was accused of frequenting, is also running.

USA TODAY

Christine Quinn has 9-point lead over Anthony Weiner among Democratic voters

Weiner refuses to quit race despite salacious messages sent to women

Quinn says Weiner has caused the mayor%27s race to become a %27circus%27

New York City mayoral candidate Christine Quinn on Friday denounced rival Anthony Weiner's ""reckless behavior,"" but said it is up to voters to render judgment on his history of sending lewd messages to women online.

Quinn, the City Council speaker, has a 9-percentage point lead over Weiner for the Democratic nomination for mayor, according to a poll released Thursday.

The survey by NBC 4 New York, The Wall Street Journal and the Marist Institute for Public Opinion was the first taken since Weiner confirmed earlier this week that he continued to send salacious messages to women even after he resigned from Congress in 2011.

New York City ""deserves a mayor who's serious, who has a real record of results, of vision for the future, who's responsible and mature,"" Quinn said Friday on CNN's The Lead program. ""All we've seen here ... is really a pattern of reckless behavior, an immaturity and a real disconnect from the truth.""

For most of this week, much of New York City politics has been consumed by Weiner and his latest scandal instead of issues such as housing and education. Weiner has been adamant that he won't quit the race, even as his lewd online behavior has become a punchline for late-night comics and dominates media coverage of the race.

""New Yorkers are smart people. They're cutting through this circus,"" Quinn said on CNN. ""And they've been having conversations with me every day about the real issues in their lives. And they want the mayor to be about their lives and not themselves.""

Quinn said it's natural for polls to go up and down, but added she is ""incredibly confident"" about victory because of her record on key issues. Women's groups on Friday began stepping up their support of Quinn.

Party primaries are Sept. 10. If no candidate gets more than 40% of the vote, a runoff will be held Oct. 1.

Responding to a question with a joke, Matthews said he felt bad for Christie’s wife. The obvious insinuation is that the overweight governor crushes her during sex:

Two days after Election Day, Chris Christie has crushed his opponent. Is he gonna be the Republican …” began McGrath.

“The one I feel for is his wife,” Matthews cut in.

After a brief pause, some chuckled as McGrath asked, “Why’s that?”

“Did you just say, ‘crush?'” Matthews said. “I mean, use your imagination.”

The crowd erupted.

This is not the first time Matthews has publicly mocked Christie’s weight:

Matthews said during a “Q & A Cafe” event two years ago with Carol Joynt, “He must be 300-plus, and that’s something he’s just gotta deal with, because you’re not going to say, ‘I’m going to cut the budget,’ well, how about starting with supper?”

In their efforts to undermine a likely GOP presidential candidate, the mainstream media have taken issue with Christie’s weight in various ways, ranging from cheap shots to scare tactics. Earlier this week, Time Magazine declared Christie the “elephant in the room” on its cover. Earlier this year, CNN’s Jim Acosta warned Americans that Christie could die in the Oval Office.

It is also no coincidence that Politico piled on today with a “serious” piece examining Christie’s weight.

The media love Christie when he is hugging Barack Obama and trashing conservatives. But the media also know that he is about to threaten Hillary Clinton’s ascension to the White House. By laying the groundwork with the weight issue now, the media hope to turn Christie into a national fat joke as a way to undermine his candidacy.

http://news.yahoo.com/huma-lost-her-halo-135605503.html,,[],Huma Has Lost Her Halo,"When Michele Bachmann picked on Huma Abedin a year ago — claiming she had some convoluted connection to the Muslim Brotherhood — there was a rush to defend the longtime Hillary Clinton aide. The Minnesota congresswoman quickly got a scolding from House Speaker John Boehner, Sen. John McCain, House Intelligence Committee chair Mile Rogers. But now that her husband, Anthony Weiner, is running for New York City mayor, the attacks on Abedin aren't so ridiculous, and Abedin herself is not quite so untouchable. Sen. Chuck Grassley is continuing his investigation into Abedin's unusual arrangement from June 2012 to February 2013 to work part-time as a consultant to the State Department while working as a consultant to Teneo Holdings, a New York-based strategic advisory group, the New York Daily News' Dan Friedman reports.

RELATED: Anthony Weiner May Think He's Closer Friends with the Clintons Than They Do

Grassley claims Abedin is stonewalling his investigation into whether she used her government connections to give information to Teneo clients. Abedin didn't respond to Grassley's June letter until July 5, when the Daily News reported her silence. ""I certainly never 'gathered information from government sources for the purpose of informing investment decisions of Teneo's clients,' as the Senate letter suggests,"" Abedin wrote. Grassley responds that ""The State Department and Ms. Abedin haven't provided a single document that I requested."" He says he'll keep pursuing his probe.

RELATED: What Did Huma Abedin Really Learn from Hillary Clinton?

And while there has been much praise of Abedin's handling of her first press conference this week, after it was reported that Weiner sent crotch pictures to other women more than a year after he resigned from Congress, she doesn't quite have the halo she once did. Slate's Dave Weigel points out that six years of news coverage of Abedin has remarkably focused on rave reviews of her physical appearance. (""Her appearance is just like, ‘Hoh my God!’ She takes your breath away,"" James Carville said. ""[T]he women in our office definitely watch what Huma wears,"" Philippe Reines, who later worked as Clinton's spokesman, said.) The two main non-fashion things she's known for — standing by her husband and cashing in on Washington connections — are pretty ""ordinary,"" Weigel says.

RELATED: Huma Abedin Will Not Have Trouble Finding Her Next Job

It's in the latter category that Abedin still shines. As The Washington Post reported on Thursday, friends of Bill and Hillary Clinton generally felt that ""if you wanted to stay in Hillary’s good graces, you answer the call from Huma."" So they donated to Weiner's mayoral campaign. And they still are! At least, as long as Abedin sticks by him, the New York Post reports:

“If you look at the contributors to Anthony around the country, they weren’t giving for Anthony — they were giving for Huma,” the source said. “For many people, Huma is the gateway to Hillary. She’s one of the closest aides; she’s an adopted daughter. You think [power agent] Bob Barnett would give to Anthony? [Billionaire] Haim Saban wouldn’t give Anthony a second chance.”

But Clinton's biggest donors haven't bothered with Weiner, the Post says. That's because they ties to Hillary are already close enough."

Sound familiar? Perhaps reminiscent of Bill Clinton’s second term, after the Monica Lewinsky story broke? During that time, Republicans became so consumed by their hatred of Clinton and their conviction that this event would bring him down that they convinced themselves the rest of the country was just as outraged by his behavior as they were. By the way, what was Clinton’s lowest Gallup job-approval rating in his second term, throughout the travails of investigations and impeachment? It was 53 percent. The conservative echo machine had worked itself into such a frenzy, the GOP didn’t realize that the outrage was largely confined to the ranks of those who never voted for Clinton anyway.

These days, the country is even more polarized, and the conservative echo chamber is louder than ever before. Many conservatives made it all the way to Election Day last November unaware that their White House nominee was falling short. How could Mitt Romney possibly lose when everyone they knew was voting for him? Except that he did lose, and it wasn’t even a very close race. Five other post-World War II presidential elections had closer outcomes.

The simple fact is that although the Republican sharks are circling, at least so far, there isn’t a trace of blood in the water. A new CNN/ORC survey of 923 Americans this past Friday and Saturday, May 17-18, pegged Obama’s job-approval rating at 53 percent, up a statistically insignificant 2 points since their last poll, April 5-7, which was taken before the Benghazi, IRS, and AP-wiretap stories came to dominate the news and congressional hearing rooms. His disapproval rating was down 2 points since that last survey.

In Gallup’s tracking poll, Obama’s average job-approval rating so far this year is 50 percent. For this past week, May 13-19, his average was 49 percent, the same as the week before. The most recent three-day moving average, through Sunday, May 19, was also 49 percent. Over the past two weeks, even as these three stories/scandals have dominated the news, they have had precisely zero effect on the president’s job-approval numbers. His ratings are still bouncing around in the same narrow range they have been for weeks.

Maybe that will change. Maybe these allegations will start getting traction with voters. But it might just be that Americans are more focused on an economy that is gradually coming out of the longest and deepest economic downturn since the Great Depression. Most economists say the current quarter will show a slowdown in economic growth from the first quarter’s 2.5 percent pace, but they expect the economy to be stronger in the second half of this year. People may be encouraged by housing prices rising and the stock market setting record highs—and their retirement accounts may actually be looking better. The University of Michigan’s widely watched Consumer Sentiment Index is at the highest level since 2007, before the recession. The Conference Board’s more volatile Consumer Confidence Index is also generally moving up, although it isn’t at the record level of the Michigan index. The National Federation of Independent Business’s Index of Small Business Optimism, which took a deep plunge after the election, increased last month and is on an upward trend since the beginning of the year. Maybe the people and businesses polled have written off Washington as a political cesspool, and so these stories don’t affect them much. Perhaps they see this town as a place that can’t seem to get anything right.

One wonders how long Republicans are going to bark up this tree, perhaps the wrong tree, while they ignore their own party’s problems, which were shown to be profound in the most recent elections. Clearly none of these recent issues has had a real impact on voters yet. Republicans seem to be betting everything on them, just as they did in 1998—about which even Newt Gingrich (who was House speaker that year) commented recently to NPR, “I think we overreached in ’98.”

Republicans and conservatives who are so consumed by these “scandals” should ask themselves why, despite wall-to-wall media attention and the constant focus inside the Beltway—some are even talking about grounds for impeachment—Obama’s job-approval needle hasn’t moved. The CNN/ORC poll suggests that people are aware of and watching the news, but they aren’t reacting, at least not yet. Clearly Republicans hope the public will begin to respond. But at what point do they decide that maybe voters might be more interested in other issues or worries than about politicians on one side pointing fingers and throwing allegations at those on the other side? At what point might the GOP conclude that it is just digging the hole a little deeper?"

The Obama team’s brazen attempt to convert the assets of its political campaign into assets to promote the President’s political agenda and the electoral fortunes of his Democratic allies is unprecedented in American political history. It is clearly a violation of the intent of current federal election laws.

The Obama team is betting that they’ve cleverly discovered a loophole, one that Republicans will fail to challenge legally. Even if the legality of this unprecedented and highly political attempt to circumvent the intent of federal election law is challenged, Obama’s team is further betting that their attorneys will argue their case successfully before regulators and judges. To date, the Obama tactic has caught Republicans flat footed.

Not only is the conversion of questionable legality, it also is in absolute contradiction to everything President Obama has ever said about the negative influence of large financial donations on the political process in America. In 2010, for instance, when the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision paved the way for SuperPACs that could accept unlimited donations from individuals and corporations alike, President Obama was one of the Court’s harshest critics. But the President’s opinion on the evils of unlimited donations to political organizations–especially those that pretend to be “issues advocacy” groups–appears to have changed in the three years since that decision.

The expensive and valuable assets of Obama for America were quickly made available to Organizing for Action, which has already begun to use them extensively in Obama’s “permanent campaign,” hosting State of the Union listening parties and bombarding the internet with pro gun control emails. It is unclear if the new Organizing for Action entity has paid fair market value–or anything at all, for that matter–to the old Obama for America organization for these assets.

The assets include a sophisticated state-of-the-art analytics driven data base that holds extensive information on each of 2 million Obama for America volunteers, 17 million email subscribers, 22 million Twitter followers, and virtually every registered voter in the country. These assets will deployed by the same management team that ran Obama for America, headed up by former campaign manager Jim Messina. At Organizing for Action, Messina will use the technological infrastructure developed over several years at Obama for America to instantaneously deliver communications in multiple formats (email, text, facebook, tweets) using the same methodology to the same vast audience that received those very similar messages during President Obama’s presidential campaigns.

“Issues advocacy” social welfare non-profit groups organized under Section 501 c 4 of the Internal Revenue Service code, which Organizing for Action claims to be, are not subject to the same federal election laws that prohibit corporate donations and limit individual contributions to political candidates to $2,600 per election. In its new iteration, the organization that was until January 17, 2013 known as Obama for America and was governed by these strict campaign laws can now accept unlimited donations from both corporations and individuals. Better yet, it is not required to publicly disclose the names of these donors.

All this is happening while the Organizing for Action management team–and the Obama administration–are pretending and saying out loud with a straight face that it is not a political organization. In reality, it is nothing but a political organization, and its immediate purpose is to advance the President’s second term agenda and defeat Republican House and Senate candidates in 2014. With that accomplished, and Democrats in control of both the House and Senate there will be nothing to stop President Obama and his radical left wing agenda.

Even MSNBC’s Chuck Todd found the cash for access scheme unpalatable. “This just looks bad,” Todd said on Monday. “It looks,” Todd said “like the White House is selling access.It’s the definition of selling access. If you believe money has a strangle hold over the entire political system this is ceding the moral high ground.”

Todd is right. It looks bad because it is bad.

Bob Edgar, the president of the usually liberal advocacy group, Common Cause, agrees with Todd. “It just smells. The president is setting a very bad model setting up this organization,”he said.

White House press secretary Jay Carney tried to sell the administration line that Organizing for Action is just like any other 501 c 4, and this sort of thing is done all the time to the usually compliant White House press corps on Monday, but most of them could barely withhold their incredulity at Carney’s claims. Indeed, Carney became so frustrated at their skepticism that he abruptly curtailed the normal press briefing and walked off unceremoniously as unanswered questioned were left hanging in the air."

IRS list obtained by USA TODAY reveals names of 162 groups scrutinized by tax agency

More than 80%25 of groups on the list were affiliated with the Tea Party or other conservative causes

IRS also questioned political activities of progressive and centrist groups

Correction: An earlier version of this story understated the number of groups represented by the the American Center for Law and Justice.

WASHINGTON — Newly uncovered IRS documents show the agency flagged political groups based on the content of their literature, raising concerns specifically about ""anti-Obama rhetoric,"" inflammatory language and ""emotional"" statements made by non-profits seeking tax-exempt status.

The internal 2011 documents, obtained by USA TODAY, list 162 groups by name, with comments by Internal Revenue Service lawyers in Washington raising issues about their political, lobbying and advocacy activities. In 21 cases, those activities were characterized as ""propaganda.""

The list provides the most specific public accounting to date of which groups were targeted for extra scrutiny and why. The IRS has not publicly identified the groups, repeatedly citing a provision of the tax code prohibiting it from releasing tax return information.

More than 80% of the organizations on the 2011 ""political advocacy case"" list were conservative, but the effort to police political activity also ensnared at least 11 liberal groups as of November 2011, including Progressives United, Progress Texas and Delawareans for Social and Economic Justice.

The IRS controversy first exploded in May, when Exempt Organizations Director Lois Lerner admitted that the IRS had targeted Tea Party groups for additional scrutiny beginning in early 2010. The IRS placed a hold on those applications for more than 20 months, an inspector general's investigation found.

On Nov. 16, 2011, IRS lawyers in Washington sent a list of cases to front-line agents in Cincinnati, along with comments and guidance on how to handle political organizations.

Tax law experts say those comments appear to show IRS employees trying to apply the murky rules governing political activities by social welfare groups.

But the American Center for Law and Justice, a nonprofit legal institute that represents 33 of the groups appearing on the IRS list, said it appears to be ""the most powerful evidence yet of a coordinated effort"" by the IRS to target Tea Party groups.

""The political motivations of this are so patently obvious, but then to have a document that spells it out like this is very damaging to the IRS,"" said Jay Sekulow, chief counsel for the ACLJ. ""I hope the FBI has seen these documents.""

The IRS categorized the groups as engaging in several advocacy-related activities that could have barred them from tax-exempt status, such as lobbying and ""propaganda.""

But the word ""propaganda"" doesn't appear in section 501(c)(4), which governs the social welfare status that most Tea Party groups were applying for, said John Colombo, a law professor at the University of Illinois. Instead, it appears in section 501(c)(3), which governs public charities.

""There would be no reason I would think to flag them if it's for a 501(c)(4) status,"" Colombo said. ""That's very odd to me.""

In three cases, IRS lawyers noted that groups appeared to be connected to Republican politicians: Stand Up for Our Nation Inc., linked to former Alaska governor Sarah Palin; Reform Jersey Now Inc., linked to Gov. Chris Christie; and American Solutions for Winning the Future, founded by former House speaker Newt Gingrich. Gingrich's group was approved last year.

Five groups were flagged as having ""anti-Obama"" materials in their applications or on their websites.

For instance, the IRS said the website of the Patriots of Charleston contains ""negative Obama commentary."" Though the IRS didn't cite examples, a November 2011 article on the group's site says: ""Obama's and the Democrats' track record of disaster is based upon a combination of their ignorance and their fundamental desire to convert America into a ruling class of wealthy all-powerful elitists and a single class of serfs.""

""The web site, as we explained to them on multiple occasions, is really a blog"" that members can submit commentary to, said Joanne Jones, the group's vice chairwoman. ""I'm not going to tell you we weren't political. We were to an extent, but we were within the limits of the law. For example, there's one clear-cut issue: We did not endorse candidates.""

""To focus in on somebody saying something anti-Obama,"" she said, ""it's almost like the speech police there. It's disturbing. It's the kind of overreach that leads into Obamacare.""

The group received its tax exemption in September 2012.

RHETORIC OF SOME GROUPS QUESTIONED

It wasn't just anti-Obama rhetoric the IRS was looking out for. Progress Texas was identified by the IRS as engaging in lobbying, propaganda and political activities. IRS lawyers in Washington noted ""anti-Rick Perry"" rhetoric, referring to the Republican Texas governor, then a presidential candidate.

Progress Texas received a tax exemption as a social welfare group in June, 2012.

Campaign-finance watchdogs say the IRS scrutiny came out of a justified effort to police ""dark money"" in politics. After the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that corporations and unions — and even non-profit groups — could engage in independent political advertising, social welfare groups became a vehicle for funneling undisclosed cash into the election system.

That's the position of Progressives United, a group founded by former senator Russ Feingold, D-Wis., that itself appeared on the 2011 IRS target list.

""The fact that our group received some scrutiny does not change at all our opinion that scrutiny like this from the IRS, it's their job. The law applies to us as it would any conservative group,"" said Progressives United's Josh Orton. ""I feel like there's this group of campaign finance nihilists who want to expand this into an argument that there should be no scrutiny at all. They want a wild west of election law, because they want to continue using secret corporate money to influence elections.""

Crossroads GPS, a group affiliated with GOP strategist Karl Rove, spent $70 million on the 2012 election. Its 2010 application for a tax exemption, obtained by the non-profit news organization Pro Publica last year, said it would spend 50% of its resources on ""public education."" In the 2011 list, the IRS noted ""significant anti-Obama rhetoric."" Crossroads has not received a tax exemption.

'WE ARE TOTALLY ABOVE BOARD'

The Tea Party of North Idaho filed its tax-exempt application in February, 2010 — the same month IRS screeners in Cincinnati first brought Tea Party applications to the attention of officials in Washington, according to IRS employee testimony before a congressional committee.

A lawyer in the IRS Exempt Organizations Technical Unit in Washington wrote the Idaho group had ""No significant amount of clear campaign intervention; however little issue advocacy or educational; significant inflammatory language, highly emotional language, little to no educational information on issues.""

The IRS lawyers recommended that screeners in Cincinnati look for other materials — including ""press releases, commentary, articles, and research reports,"" according to the IRS list.

That's when Leslie Damiano, who co-founded the North Idaho group, started getting what she considered to be intrusive questions from the IRS. She said the tax agency wanted to know who her donors were, and what companies they own. They wanted to know the educational background of the group's board members. And they wanted to know whether candidates were invited to the group's meetings, and whether it made endorsements.

""We're a conservative organization. We invited some independents,"" she said. ""We never had any rallies that were off the charts by any stretch of the imagination.""

Frustrated with the process, the Tea Party of North Idaho withdrew its application in 2012.

""We had an accountant, we had a bookkeeper. We were totally above board with everything we did,"" Damiano said.

REDUCING THE NATIONAL DEBT

Some groups caught in the IRS' net had no connection to national politics on either side. The Citizens for the Preservation of Rural Murrysville says it's ""dedicated to the preservation of the open and natural, rural character of Murrysville, Pa.,"" although the IRS said it endorsed some local candidates. The Sarasota Bay Tiger Club is one of several similar Florida clubs that provide ""a non-partisan forum on current political issues."" The club says it has ""never endorsed political candidates nor advocated a particular ideology,"" but the IRS said in its spreadsheet that it was ""unclear"" if that was the case.

The list also includes the Association to Reduce the National Debt, which was seeking to be recognized as a charity so it could solicit tax-deductible contributions — and give those contributions to the U.S. Treasury to put toward the national debt.

Founder Seth Eisenberg said the group was not political — and he told the IRS that.

IRS tax specialists noted ""no political campaign activities."" But two years after applying, the association still hasn't gotten his ruling letter. And without that letter, contributions are not tax-deductible and no one will give, he said.

All for a group that said it wanted to give the government money.

""I thought this would be a fast-tracked application. A no-brainer. But it got caught up in this whole political controversy,"" Eisenberg said. ""It's the greatest irony that ever was.""

To be sure, many will claim it is not the salaciousness of the pictures and graphically sexual tweets of Carlos Danger (Anthony Weiner’s Twitter name) that is driving this story. Many will say that it is the lies about his online behavior that keeps this story in the 24/7 news lineup. That is simply hogwash. America is a country that has been trained to be sexually puritanical in discourse while sexually liberal behind closed doors or by implication in music, videos and movies.

This applies to the common man and politicians alike. Most by now are aware that from FDR to Kennedy, sexual escapades were common. In the case of President Clinton, those that verbally attacked him for the Monica Lewinsky ""sex scandal"" were themselves guilty of similar or worst sexual escapades (puritanical in condemnation while sexually liberal).

It is unsettling that the New York Times thought it had the right to suggest that Anthony Weiner leave the mayoral race inasmuch as they never suggested that Giuliani or Clinton resign for their ""sexual misdeeds."" What is even more disconcerting is the mainstream media’s 24/7obsession with the story. Their righteous indignation for what is so far a fantasy; a virtual sexual affair as they probe with psychological analysis, moral analysis, with a dose of excoriation is uncalled for.

The media would do much better if they had concentrated on Wiener's fitness to be mayor based on his qualifications relative to other mayors. Does he display the passion and political knowledge to be the head of a city of over 8 million people? Is any other mayoral candidate more qualified? Judging Weiner based on his discovered sexual proclivities while not doing so for all the other candidates is reason enough to stick with only his qualifications.

The reality is that there is a real scandal. The real scandal isn’t about Weiner however. It is about a derelict mainstream media. While an excessive amount of time is being spent on a virtual sexual scandal, there are many issues that materially affect the working middle class that go unreported.

The Court heard arguments on Mar. 18 in Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona.

In earlier years people had to go to their county seat of government–typically the county courthouse–to register to vote in a system that made it very difficult to commit voter registration fraud. A federal commission is authorized by the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA, or “Motor Voter”), which was pushed and signed by Bill Clinton, to develop a federal form for mail-in registration.

Arizona passed a law requiring people registering to vote by mail to include proof of citizenship. It was designed as a modest attempt to prevent illegal voting by foreigners that could undermine the legitimacy of the election returns in the democratic process.

The record in this case includes over 200 people who had submitted fraudulent voter registrations, who later swore under oath to a commission investigating this matter that they were not even U.S. citizens. They say workers from groups like the now-defunct ACORN–who were getting paid for each registration form they turned in–talked them into signing it, and that these individuals did not know it was a crime for them to do so.

NVRA requires states to “accept and use” the federal form. Arizona argues it accepts and uses the form, and that adding the requirement for someone to attach proof of citizenship is allowed. The plaintiffs and the Obama administration argue that if you add anything to the federal requirements, you are not accepting and using the federal form. This case will turn in part on which side the justices take on that issue.

Usually when federal law conflicts with state law, it is resolved under the Supremacy Clause in Article VI of the Constitution, whereby federal law trumps state law under certain circumstances. Instead of the Supremacy Clause, this case will be decided under the Elections Clause in Article I of the Constitution. That provision says that states are primarily in charge of voting and elections, but “Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations …”

There is a large body of Supreme Court precedent interpreting the Supremacy Clause. This case may turn on whether the Elections Clause works by the same rules, or instead if there is a different framework that determines when federal election law trumps state election law.

It is unclear which way this case will go, with some justices sending signals one way or the other.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, “Congress did specify how citizenship was to be handled. And it was to be [signing the form where you declare you are a citizen, under] penalty of perjury.” She added she understands NVRA as saying, “each state must accept and use the federal form, period. That’s the end of it.”

Justice Antonin Scalia seemed to fault Arizona for not making certain claims earlier in the litigation. But Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne explained that this lawsuit began under his predecessor Terry Goddard, who is a Democrat, and that Horne did not know why Goddard did not think to use a different strategy.

Scalia also seemed sympathetic to Arizona’s argument. For example, he remarked that the federal form requires nothing to show the individual is a citizen except, “check off, ‘I am a citizen,’ right? So it’s under oath. Big deal. If you’re willing to violate the voting laws, I suppose you’re willing to violate the perjury laws.”

Going into yesterday’s argument it was possible that two justices, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy, were swing votes in this case. We should find out by late June which side prevailed.

When they are reading off the same talking points, that’s when presidencies fall apart.”

-- Dan Pfeiffer, senior adviser to President Obama, in an interview with the Washington Post.

In the little that President Obama has said publicly about his administration’s recently exposed domestic surveillance programs he has returned to the overall motif of his presidency: warning against excessive distrust of the federal government.

While hawks wait anxiously to see if Obama can summon the political courage to defend the programs he has expanded despite his onetime opposition, the president has so far used the occasion to preach against what he seems to believe is a virus of anti-government sentiment in the nation.

(At this moment it appears more likely that Obama will mostly leave it to Republicans to defend his programs, as he and they did with his war in Afghanistan and his flying killer robots. But who knows? The stakes are so huge here that even Obama may not be immune to political risk taking.)

More On This...

Obama’s commencement speech this year at Ohio State, his 2011 reprise of fellow liberal icon Theodore Roosevelt’s “New Nationalism” speech and many others, particularly his off-the-cuff comments on those who “get bitter and cling…” have been musings on the theme that the deep distrust of government in the United States is not just harmful but artificial – that moneyed corporate interests are behind these sentiments.

Obama’s argument in concentrate is that rich people play on the fears and prejudices of the working class in order to block government from fulfilling its rightful role as regulator and protector. This is a particularly unhappy view of the condition of the American experiment arguing as it does that the majority of the citizenry has been bamboozled into mistrusting their own protector.

Whatever the dark impulses and manipulations Obama believes lay at the heart of American disdain for government, the effect is that the president does not often deign to honestly engage the critics of his agenda and worldview. If he thinks that the Koch Brothers and Exxon lurk behind every critic of big, powerful government (apparently a view shared by many in the IRS), why would Obama give them the time of day?

If they are not, as the president says “on the level,” why indulge them and allow them to distract from his goal of reorganizing the community of the disenfranchised around the banner of “collective action?”

As scandals and misdeeds rack his administration, though, Obama is paying a high price for his cynicism as Americans return the favor.

Just flip through the results of the latest FOX News poll:

[pullquote]

-- 56 percent of voters believe Obama did not try to rescue the doomed garrison in Benghazi, Libya because he didn’t want to risk his re-election.

-- 62 percent agree that Obama’s NSA phone surveillance constitutes “an unacceptable and alarming invasion of privacy rights.”

-- 63 percent believe that Obama’s Justice Department seized reporter’s records for political reasons, compared to 29 percent who take the administration’s national security argument to be true.

-- 68 percent believe that the White House isn’t telling the truth about the targeting of the president’s political enemies by the IRS. Just 24 percent believe the White House line that Team Obama neither directed nor was aware of the targeting.

-- 74 percent said that when it comes to openness and transparency, the Obama administration is either the same or worse than George W. Bush’s administration.

The result is that Obama, in whom the public had long placed more trust than it did in his government, finds himself for the first time at the break-even point on the question of whether he is personally honest and trustworthy. That rating, which stood at a shimmering +49 percent in the spring of 2009, is almost certainly heading into negative territory.

All of that leads to Obama’s lowest job approval rating since April 2012 when the economy again tumbled amid ""headwinds."" It's worth noting that voters are darned cheery about the economy and still are turning on the guy. And the 44 percent who still give him a passing grade will likely shrink too.

Obama has consistently questioned the patriotism and motives of his adversaries. It was enough to win him a second term against a candidate whom Team Obama turned (with Mitt Romney’s help) into the personification of corrupt corporate abuse of middle-class America.

But as Obama comes under withering attack from left, right and center, he is finding that many voters don’t think he is on the level either.

And Now, A Word From Charles

“So here is a guy saying, ‘It's over, essentially. I am winding it down.’ And at the same time running this unbelievably huge, invasive program whose only idea, whose only basis is the vast terror threat out there. So he doesn't only support the program, he contradicts it in public. That's a total lack of leadership and that's why his numbers, the poll numbers he now has are markedly down.”

USA TODAY

Christine Quinn has 9-point lead over Anthony Weiner among Democratic voters

Weiner refuses to quit race despite salacious messages sent to women

Quinn says Weiner has caused the mayor%27s race to become a %27circus%27

New York City mayoral candidate Christine Quinn on Friday denounced rival Anthony Weiner's ""reckless behavior,"" but said it is up to voters to render judgment on his history of sending lewd messages to women online.

Quinn, the City Council speaker, has a 9-percentage point lead over Weiner for the Democratic nomination for mayor, according to a poll released Thursday.

The survey by NBC 4 New York, The Wall Street Journal and the Marist Institute for Public Opinion was the first taken since Weiner confirmed earlier this week that he continued to send salacious messages to women even after he resigned from Congress in 2011.

New York City ""deserves a mayor who's serious, who has a real record of results, of vision for the future, who's responsible and mature,"" Quinn said Friday on CNN's The Lead program. ""All we've seen here ... is really a pattern of reckless behavior, an immaturity and a real disconnect from the truth.""

For most of this week, much of New York City politics has been consumed by Weiner and his latest scandal instead of issues such as housing and education. Weiner has been adamant that he won't quit the race, even as his lewd online behavior has become a punchline for late-night comics and dominates media coverage of the race.

""New Yorkers are smart people. They're cutting through this circus,"" Quinn said on CNN. ""And they've been having conversations with me every day about the real issues in their lives. And they want the mayor to be about their lives and not themselves.""

Quinn said it's natural for polls to go up and down, but added she is ""incredibly confident"" about victory because of her record on key issues. Women's groups on Friday began stepping up their support of Quinn.

Party primaries are Sept. 10. If no candidate gets more than 40% of the vote, a runoff will be held Oct. 1.

Republicans took delight in his discomfort, but they have their own 100-day question to answer: What have they done since November to turn around their fortunes?

The president has had a difficult spring. His gun legislation, though it mustered more than 50 votes, was blocked in the Senate. His advisers are more optimistic about immigration reform, but the measure still faces serious obstacles, especially in the House. Implementation of his health-care law worries some members of his own party. And if there is genuine progress on the budget, no one has been able to describe it.

What do Republicans have to show politically for the president’s travails? So far, there is little to suggest they have truly begun to solve the problems highlighted by Mitt Romney’s loss to Obama last November, party weaknesses that were cited in a post-election report by a Republican National Committee task force.

Congressional Republicans still have far lower approval ratings than the president, although so do congressional Democrats. That is almost always the case. But Republicans also have taken positions on issues this year that have left them on the wrong side of public opinion. Those issues include background checks for gun purchases, the best way to deal with the budget (spending cuts alone vs. a combination of cuts and taxes) and, to a lesser extent, whether illegal immigrants should be given a path to citizenship.

In a recent Washington Post-ABC News survey, seven out of 10 Americans said the GOP is out of touch with the concerns “of most people” in the country. Neither Obama nor the Democratic Party has sterling ratings on this question (slightly positive for Obama and slightly negative for the Democratic Party). But the Republican deficit is far bigger than that of the other two. Even 49 percent of Republicans said their party is out of touch.

Obama’s news conference in two minutes: The president took questions from reporters at the White House on Tuesday, discussing Syria, the Boston bombings, closing Guantanamo, immigration reform, and Jason Collins. (The Washington Post)

Republican opposition to universal background checks for gun purchasers continues to reverberate. The opposition may threaten few individual members, given the leanings of individual congressional districts or constituencies in largely Republican-leaning states. But it is likely to hurt Republicans in areas and among voters they need to win presidential races — suburbs and female voters being prime examples.

Immigration divide

After an election in which their nominee won just 27 percent of the Hispanic vote, many Republicans said it was time to find a new strategy to attract Hispanics to the party. That brightened prospects for comprehensive immigration reform, which George W. Bush tried to enact in his second presidential term, only to be thwarted by his own party.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), whose conservative credentials were not in question, took the lead in working out a bipartisan proposal as a member of the Senate Gang of Eight that included Republicans John McCain (Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.). The group’s work raised the hopes of reform advocates that this was the year for action.

Since then, criticism has been rising on the right, echoing complaints from conservatives that killed prior reform efforts. In an op-ed he co-wrote in USA Today, former senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina, president of the Heritage Foundation and once a strong Rubio backer, attacked the proposal as “legislated amnesty.” National Review’s latest cover shows the Florida senator along with two other members of the Gang of Eight — McCain and Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) — with the headline “Rubio’s Folly.”

Obama said Thursday in Mexico that he remains optimistic that an immigration reform bill will pass this year, saying the time is right for enactment. Rubio now says his proposal probably needs stronger border security measures to pass the Senate and earlier said the bill could not pass the House in its current form, presaging a rocky path ahead.

The legislative maneuvering has a long way to go. The fact that many of the Republicans who might run for president in 2016 favor immigration reform reflects concern that the party not be cast negatively when this process ends. If Republicans end up blocking the bill, or even if it passes but over significant Republican opposition, they could pay a significant price with the Hispanic community.

Republicans also have not broken through on the economy or the budget. Over the past three years, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has offered a series of comprehensive budgetary blueprints, but he has yet to muster broad public support for the main elements of his package.

The fact that Obama has spent the winter and spring talking about things other than the economy has given Republicans the opportunity to begin to fill that vacuum. So far they haven’t done so, rhetorically or substantively. To most voters, the Republican economic message remains focused more on green eyeshade budget accounting than on kitchen-table concerns of middle-class families.

Rubio’s engagement on immigration is an example of something that has been missing in the Republican Party’s overall approach during Obama’s tenure, which is a willingness to offer concrete and constructive ideas — to be for something rather than just against things — and to go out and really try to sell them.

Republican governors, from Louisiana’s Bobby Jindal to Wisconsin’s Scott Walker to New Jersey’s Chris Christie, to name three of the 30 GOP state leaders, have the opportunity to turn their conservative philosophy into a popular governing agenda that could be taken nationally in a presidential race. But for all the flurry of talk about the 2016 race already starting, at this point the governors are subordinate to the party’s congressional wing.

2014 vs. 2016

The year so far highlights the frustrations Obama has experienced trying to work his will on Capitol Hill. As long as his approval rating hovers at or below 50 percent, Republicans can look to the 2014 elections with optimism. But the year so far also points to the vulnerabilities of a congressionally based party whose members play to narrower constituencies. And as Republicans learned last year, there is often a big difference between the electorates in midterm elections and in presidential elections. A good 2014 does not necessarily mean success in 2016.

Had the president been able to maintain the momentum he gained from his reelection victory, Republicans would be in even worse shape. GOP pollster Bill McInturff pointed out that the fact that Obama has had setbacks and run into questions “has allowed breathing room for thought, recovery and some capacity to regroup.”

As long as Obama is in the White House, many Republicans will define success as stopping bad things from happening. That could be a trap, as the party trades short-term legislative “victories” for what could become longer-term problems. Obama has second-term problems, but in this case, politics might not be a zero-sum game. If Republicans fail to find a message and an agenda that appeal to a broader constituency, they could continue to struggle to win a national election.

Pollak'],"NPR: Liberal Groups Now Say They Were 'Targeted' by IRS, Too","Tamara Keith of National Public Radio filed a story Tuesday on efforts by liberal non-profit groups to claim that they, too, were “targeted” by the IRS, just as conservative groups were. None of them, however, can claim that they were singled out because of their names or views–and many received approval before the 2012 election.

Keith notes that several “progressive” groups received extensive inquiries from the IRS when they applied for 501(c)3 or 501(c)4 status, including intrusive questions about their donors. Some complain that approval took nearly two years. Keith draws parallels between their experience and that of conservative groups.

But Keith notes that “everyone” agrees that what happened to groups with “Tea Party” and “Patriot” in their names was wrong–and could well have added that there are no parallels to some of the worst abuses that conservative groups endured, such as questions about the content of their prayers, or leaks of donor lists.

Keith’s report amplifies one of two narratives Democrats and the left have been spinning in the past several weeks to deflate the IRS scandal. One is that the IRS ought to be investigating political non-profit groups; the other, somewhat conflicting story is that the abuse conservative groups experienced was not unique.

The story was released on the day that Tea Party groups are gathering for an “Audit the IRS” rally in Washington to protest the agency’s conduct. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee continues its investigation of the IRS, as legislators debate calls for a special prosecutor into the scandal.

Update: As Breitbart News’ Mike Flynn has noted, Democrats did not call any liberal non-profit groups to testify before the House Oversight Committee earlier this month when several of the Tea Party and conservative groups that had been targeted spoke to legislators about their experience of abuses by the IRS.

http://news.yahoo.com/mitt-romney-47-192834720.html,,[],Mitt Romney: What 47%?,"You likely remember this, but let's just do some quick catching up. On Sept. 17, 2012, Mother Jones released a video, helped by former President Carter's grandson, of a private fundraiser for Mitt Romney. Here's what the GOP presidential nominee said:

There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it. That that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what. And I mean, the president starts off with 48, 49, 48—he starts off with a huge number. These are people who pay no income tax. Forty-seven percent of Americans pay no income tax. So our message of low taxes doesn't connect. And he'll be out there talking about tax cuts for the rich. I mean that's what they sell every four years. And so my job is not to worry about those people—I'll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.

MORE FROM NATIONAL JOURNAL

The remarks turned out to be quite damning. And now, 10 months later, there are new words from Mitt Romney trying to jedi mind trick the old ones all away.

RELATED: 100% of New Obama Ads Are Talking About 47%

In a Washington Post excerpt of Dan Balz's upcoming book on the 2012 election, Romney put forward one of his most adamant defenses of the 47 percent comments. Balz's interview with Romney took place in late January, 2013. Here's Romney on what went through his head when he first heard about the video being released:

As I understood it, and as they described it to me, not having heard it, it was saying, 'Look, the Democrats have 47 percent, we've got 45 percent, my job is to get the people in the middle, and I've got to get the people in the middle.'... And I thought, 'Well, that's a reasonable thing.' ... It's not a topic I talk about in public, but there's nothing wrong with it. They've got a bloc of voters, we've got a bloc of voters, I've got to get the ones in the middle. And I thought that that would be how it would be perceived — as a candidate talking about the process of focusing on the people in the middle who can either vote Republican or Democrat. As it turned out, down the road, it became perceived as being something very different.

Story continues

Calling the idea behind the comments ""a reasonable thing"" is a bit off from Romney's comments this June, in which he told CNN that he was ""very upset"" over what he said. The new view of his remarks also pushed aside the idea that those 47 percent weren't just ""Democrats,"" but in Romney's assessment were ""dependent upon government ... believe they are victims"" and that he'd never be able to ""convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.""

RELATED: James O'Keefe Is the Real Victim Here

Balz specifically asked Romney about the ""personal responsibility"" remark. Mitt Romney said it was fiction:

Actually, I didn't say that.... That's how it began to be perceived, and so I had to ultimately respond to the perception, because perception is reality.

Think of it as a ""sorry, I'm not sorry."" It's also a fascinating, one-sentence summation of how easy it is for a campaign aparatus to become an impenetrable bubble.

RELATED: Scott Brown Goes All In on Warren's Cherokee Pa-Paw

Romney then presented Balz with his own take on the event. Some of which is here:

In two months, my job is to get the people in the middle. But this was perceived as, 'Oh, he's saying 47 percent of the people he doesn't care about or he's insensitive to or they don't care—they don't take responsibility for their life.' No, no. I'm saying 47 percent of the people don't pay taxes and therefore they don't warm to our tax message. But the people who are voting for the president, my job isn't to try and get them. My job is to get the people in the middle. And I go on and say that. Take a look. Look at the full quote. But I realized, look, perception is reality. The perception is I'm saying I don't care about 47 percent of the people or something of that nature, and that's simply wrong.

This doesn't really mesh with the full quotation above from Mother Jones's video transcript. Mother Jones's David Corn was caught pretty surprised by the new comments. But Romney did realize one thing:

Well, clearly that was a very damaging quote and hurt my campaign effort.

That's a statement you don't need much more context for."

http://news.yahoo.com/carl-demaio-running-for-congress-in-california--220037721.html,,[],"How a young, gay congressional candidate could shake up the GOP","SAN DIEGO — It’s January 2015, and a newly elected House member from California walks side by side with his male partner to be sworn into office in Washington. The young lawmaker is a supporter of same-sex marriage. He believes the government should keep abortion legal. He considers himself an environmentalist.

He's also a Republican.

This could be the future for one Carl DeMaio, a former San Diego city councilman and recent mayoral candidate who is expected to challenge freshman Democratic Rep. Scott Peters in the state's 52nd congressional district. DeMaio has announced his plan to challenge Peters, but the unfolding sexual harassment scandal surrounding San Diego Mayor Bob Filner could also draw DeMaio into a special election for the mayor's office if Filner is recalled.

DeMaio, 38, doesn’t fit the mold of a traditional Republican. His election could make him the only openly gay GOP member of Congress. (Just two openly gay Republicans have ever served in the House.) DeMaio's views on same-sex marriage and abortion are also at odds with the party platform.

But DeMaio says he’s not interested in making social issues central to his campaign. While open about his beliefs, his run is focused on government accountability and pocketbook-issue reform instead of relitigating the culture wars.

“We ought to take those divisive issues, particularly the social issues, and set them off to the side,” DeMaio told Yahoo News in an interview. “It’s not appropriate for the government to be making decisions for people in their private lives. Instead, we should demand that we look beyond labels to embrace common sense ideas on financial reform and holding these government programs accountable.”

DeMaio's policy views — economically conservative and socially liberal — place him in a libertarian wing of the Republican Party, one that seems to be growing in popularity among young voters. But he's reluctant to put himself in any category.

Story continues

“I warmly embrace the libertarian label, but I also want to point out that one of my biggest frustrations in politics is that people want to shove one or two big labels on some people that sums who they are and what they believe and what their record has been. I think that’s limiting,” DeMaio said.

Despite his potential of being a maverick if he makes it to Congress, DeMaio is not a fringe candidate. He has early support from the party establishment — the National Republican Congressional Committee, the official party group responsible for electing Republicans to the House, is backing him full force. In July, California Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the third-ranking House Republican, hosted a fundraiser for him in Washington. The invitation branded DeMaio as a “New Generation Republican.”

Given his background, DeMaio seems like just the type of candidate that the soul-searching Republican Party is looking for.



“I actually think that we are going to make headway in the Republican Party on these issues in the coming years,” DeMaio told Yahoo News. “It is going to be a totally different thrust for the Republican Party.”

DeMaio was born in Iowa, and his family moved to Southern California when he was a child. DeMaio’s father left the family and his mother died while he was still in high school. Young DeMaio was sent to boarding school at Georgetown Preparatory School near Washington, and he went on to graduate from Georgetown University.



As a young man in the nation’s capital during Newt Gingrich’s Republican Revolution in 1994, DeMaio plugged into the city’s conservative scene, developing his skills as a policy researcher. He took a job with the Congressional Institute, a think tank that hosts conferences for lawmakers on policymaking.



He went on to found his own group, The Performance Institute, which does similar work and emphasizes transparency reforms and efficiency in government. Through the 1990s and early 2000s, DeMaio established himself as a policy wonk, publishing position papers on government reform for various groups, including the libertarian Reason Foundation based in California.

DeMaio won a seat on the San Diego City Council in 2008, where he focused on several city-based reforms, including a successful push to overhaul the costly pension program for city workers by placing new employees into private, 401(k)-style retirement accounts.

He ran a robust campaign for mayor of San Diego in 2012, losing to Democrat Bob Filner by just 3 percentage points despite a surge in Democratic turnout across the state supporting President Barack Obama's re-election.

DeMaio announced his candidacy to challenge Peters in May.



A DeMaio victory would give a boost to Republicans in California, where the party has been steadily losing ground for two decades. There are currently just 15 Republicans among the state's 55-member congressional delegation, the nation's largest.

According to early poll numbers, DeMaio could be a viable challenger. His mayoral campaign provided him with strong name-ID in the district, a crucial leg up for any candidate challenging an incumbent. A Survey USA poll conducted in June, 17 months before next year’s election, showed DeMaio leading Peters in a hypothetical matchup by 11 percentage points.

As with any political campaign, DeMaio has also made enemies. His support of the pension overhaul enraged organized labor interests, and he won few friends within the gay community when he accepted campaign donations from supporters of the movement to ban same-sex marriage in California. Last year, when DeMaio and his partner, Jonathan Hale, walked together in the San Diego LGBT Pride Parade, some in the crowd booed him along the way.

Publicly, national Democrats dismiss DeMaio as a grandstander. But privately, some express concern that he could be a strong challenger to Peters, particularly since there is little daylight between the two candidates on some of the social issues that have tripped up other Republican candidates in previous races around the country. The election will also occur midway through Obama's second term, an election cycle that historically isn't as hospitable to the president's party.

But since DeMaio's former political foe, Filner, is almost sure to face a well-organized recall campaign in the coming weeks, DeMaio is considered a prime candidate to run in a special election to replace him. Filner has conceded behaving inappropriately but is refusing to resign.

DeMaio told Yahoo News that he would “absolutely” sign a petition to recall Filner, but was coy when asked if he would seek the mayor’s office.

“There are benefits and liability in weighing into that question right now,” DeMaio told Yahoo News. “I’m going to continue to focus on how we can rid our city of the cancer that is Bob Filner. Until he departs that office, our city will be held hostage and our people’s business will not get done.”

In San Diego, the accusations against Filner, (which DeMaio warned about during the campaign against him last year), have dominated the news cycle for weeks. Filner on Tuesday challenged the recall in a written statement, but the campaign is likely to begin as early as this month, forcing DeMaio to make what will surely be a difficult choice."

But as much as congressional Republicans are enjoying their schadenfreude, they would be well advised to think long and hard about their next steps. Even the most cursory look at opinion polls or focus groups reveals that the public is convinced we have an ineffectual and out-of-touch Congress that spends too much time backbiting, grandstanding, and Monday-morning quarterbacking while the country’s problems fester. Arguably, showboating for the cameras and holding hearings are what Congress does best; the temptation is unavoidable.

This is coming from same guy who on May 14th wrote a piece titled While Republicans Rant about Benghazi and IRS, Public Mostly Yawns "" indicating that poll numbers are showing the faux scandals to be having zero impact on President Obama.

Well, a journalist-pollster with integrity would leave the story at that, right? But no. In this day and age there is no such thing as simply reporting facts and leaving them be. Charlie Cook dispenses this ""advise"" to GOP for no other stated reason than to brign President Obama's poll numbers down just so history can be repeated.

If the facts don't fit your narrative, why, gin up your own ""facts""!!

The lowest week of Gallup polling thus far for Obama was 40 percent, occurring in August and October of 2011. Arguably, he is due for a dip, given that each of his modern predecessors has dropped into the 30s or below. Presidents Ford, Reagan, and Clinton each hit a low point of 37 percent. President George W. Bush’s low ebb was 31 percent; Nixon’s was 27 percent; Carter’s was 28 percent; and George H.W. Bush’s was 29 percent.

Charlie Cook is after all twiddling his thumbs waiting to see which ""scandals"" real or ginned up """" because "".""

Well, in Charlie Cook's warped mind that ""something"" can only be negative which must be induced to occur if it doesn't do so naturally. Yeah...

This is a more virulent version of the diatribe we heard last year in the run up to the 2012 elections, No President has been re-elected with Unemployment rates above 7%, then 8%, Enthusiasm gap, Obama 2008 coalition was a fluke, blah blah blah!

But reading that piece made me sick. As sequester takes it's horrible toll on many vulnerable people who've been rendered invisible; as GOP House votes to deny those same people access to healthcare (however imperfect it is); as the conservative movement rabidly tears our commonweal apart, our Journalists focus on meta, on inducing bloodsport so their little historical boxes can be ticked. Really, Charlie?...

This is the media cauldron within which Democrats are trying to govern these United States of America. PATHETIC!

http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/05/09/political-science-hawking-rapped-for-israel-boycott/,2013-05-09 00:00:00,[],Political Science: Hawking rapped for Israel boycott,"Great minds don’t have to think alike, but they ought to be open to discussion, say critics of physicist Stephen Hawking, who is boycotting a major academic conference in Israel out of solidarity for Palestinians.

Hawking wrote a May 3 letter to Israeli President Shimon Peres saying he planned to respect a boycott of the June event because he considers the Israeli government’s policy toward the Palestinian territory a “disaster.” But Israel Maimon, chairman of the President’s Conference, called boycotting an academic event “outrageous and unwarranted.""



""Israel is a democracy in which everyone can voice their opinions, whatever they may be,” Maimon told the Jerusalem Post. “Boycotting is not compatible with open democratic dialogue.""

The decision by Hawking -- who uses a wheelchair due to motor neurone disease -- to skip the event, which Peres personally sponsors, was initially blamed on health reasons by Cambridge University, where the 71-year-old “A Brief History of Time” author has taught and studied.

But in his letter to Peres and event organizers, Hawking made clear he was boycotting over what he considers Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory.

[pullquote]

“I accepted the invitation to the Presidential Conference with the intention that this would not only allow me to express my opinion on the prospects for a peace settlement, but also because it would allow me to lecture on the West Bank,” Hawking wrote. “However, I have received a number of emails from Palestinian academics. They are unanimous that I should respect the boycott. In view of this, I must withdraw from the conference. Had I attended, I would have stated my opinion that the policy of the present Israeli government is likely to lead to disaster.”

The Wolf Foundation, which gave Hawking its Wolf prize in physics in 1988, said it was “sad to learn that someone of Professor Hawking’s standing chose to capitulate to irrelevant pressures and will refrain from visiting Israel.”

However, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which seeks to pressure Israel on behalf of Palestinians, said in a statement it “deeply appreciated” Hawking’s decision."

He said that after consulting with his family and taking the temperature of the city’s electorate, he believed New Yorkers would be open to his candidacy. “I’m hopeful there will be forgiveness, I am asking for it,” he said.

His re-emergence comes in an era when politicians — like Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina and the New York mayoral contender Anthony D. Weiner — have shown that public disapproval, especially over sexual misconduct, can be fleeting, and that voters seem receptive to those who seek forgiveness and redemption.

As loyal as its viewers are, there are always wary network executives and even exhausted writers and producers who'd just as soon let it go. It's a good policy, after all, to leave your audience wanting more.

Clinton's finale could hardly have been more dramatic. After falling ill with a stomach virus in early December, she fainted, suffered a concussion and landed in a hospital with a blood clot between her brain and skull. Meanwhile, her detractors drummed up conspiracy theories about ""Benghazi fever,"" and her supporters had a moment of genuine fear that Clinton might not be around to follow the script that so many have been writing for her over the last several years.

That script goes something like this: Clinton will take a long, much-deserved vacation, then assume a low-key schedule of advocacy work and lucrative speaking engagements. She'll exercise, sleep more and eat better.

""I would like to see whether I can get untired,"" she said in November.

Her hair will finally find the sweet spot between the Stepford-esque helmet head of the campaign trail and the current granny-cum-Eileen-Fisher-model look. She might even, heaven forfend, indulge in some surgically assisted ""freshening up.""

And then in late 2014, a more vibrant, less jowly Clinton will return to the spotlight and announce her candidacy for president.

It'll be a win-win. Voters who supported Clinton in 2008 will be thrilled in a better-late-than-never kind of way. Voters who were so besotted with Barack Obama that they turned on Clinton as if canceling plans with an old friend in favor of a hot date will be thrilled in an all's-right-with-the-universe kind of way.

When it comes to historic elections, 2008 was just what most Democrats wanted. First the exciting young black guy, then the somewhat less exciting but eminently reliable old white lady. It was as if liberal voters promised to eat their vegetables if they could just have dessert first.

But as Clinton's health scare reminded us, vegetables are perishable. Clinton is 65 and presumably healthy, but she cannot be presumed to maintain her past and current energy levels into her 70s. Moreover, as she has said numerous times, she has no plans to seek the presidency in 2016. She has instead joked that maybe she'll host a decorating show.

Nonetheless, Clinton's fans are even now closing their eyes and imagining her in the Oval Office. And the idea that she may never get there — by choice, defeat or some kind of health or personal circumstance — remains unthinkable, even devastating. To put another woman in the job, even one that might better uphold the liberal principles that made Clinton's supporters love her in the first place (someone like, say, Elizabeth Warren), would be a kind of betrayal, not to mention a long shot.

But for Clinton voters, there's something even more devastating than that: admitting that 2008 was their one and only chance, and they missed it.

During the 2008 Democratic primary, when support shifted from Clinton to Obama, the rationale was that he stood a better chance of winning. Clinton was too polarizing — too Clintonesque. But there was another rationale: the less-discussed yet widely held belief that an Obama presidency today would in no way preclude a Clinton presidency tomorrow.

Amid the rancor of that primary, the question for lots of Democrats wasn't ""Which one do we want?"" but ""Which one goes first?"" It wasn't enough to get a candidate elected; they wanted a lock on the successor, too.

But in real life, unlike in a script, the gun that appears in the first act isn't guaranteed to go off in the third. Voters may have been willing to wait for a Clinton presidency, but that doesn't mean she's going to wait for them.

And who could blame her? If her political career were a television drama, it would be in something like its 20th season now. Maybe it's time her fans stopped demanding more episodes. Anyway, that decorating show sounds promising.

""I want to assure my opponent and supporters that I will stay steadfast in the race and let the voters take a careful look at the real issues facing Villa Park on April 9th,"" he said in the statement.

On Thursday, some of those supporters were withdrawing or reconsidering their endorsements of his candidacy after learning that two photos of Heidelmeier were posted on a website that touts itself as offering ""your most diverse phone sex experience.""

One picture is of Heidelmeier wearing a blue shirt, staring into the webcam, while the other shows an exposed genital underneath a blue shirt. Both pictures were dated from February, and in his statement, Heidelmeier acknowledged that the pictures were of him.

A 23-year-veteran of the village's Police Department, Heidelmeier was ousted as chief last year in a decision that divided residents. Now he's running against one of his harshest critics on the Village Board who pushed him to retire.

The race already had generated a stew of political drama before the pictures began circulating this week.

Trustee John Davis, a frequent critic of Heidelmeier, said he discovered Tuesday that someone had anonymously put a printout of the website and pictures in his mailbox. On Wednesday, he said, he went to Heidelmeier's house and gave him the printouts.

""I said, 'I run an honest campaign, and I want nothing to do with this.' And I handed it to him,"" Davis said. ""He was surprised.""

Davis said the pictures were ""spreading through town like wildfire.""

Heidelmeier's opponent, Trustee Deborah Bullwinkel, said she heard about them Tuesday from Davis. She said her campaign had nothing to do with finding the pictures or circulating them.

""I really feel bad for John (Heidelmeier) and his family,"" she said. ""I really do.""

DuPage County Board member Elizabeth Chaplin, who had previously endorsed Heidelmeier, dropped her support, calling the news ""unfortunate.""

""I have three kids, and I think the whole thing is just troubling, so I can't endorse him,"" Chaplin said Thursday. ""Everyone makes mistakes … and talking to him, he's a nice man, but with this coming out, I just can't support him.""

Tom Cullerton, a Democratic state senator and former Villa Park president; former DuPage County Board Chairman Bob Schillerstrom; Oakbrook Terrace Mayor Tony Ragucci; and Villa Park trustees Don Kase and Chris Aiello all were listed as endorsing Heidelmeier.

None but Aiello returned messages this week seeking comment on whether they still support his candidacy.

Aiello said he still supports Heidelmeier despite the “stupidity of his conduct” that led to the online posting. That’s because, Aiello said, the ex-chief has the unique ability to recruit people to work at solving problems.



“This ability to bring good people together is a quality of character that is the basis for my continuing to support Mr. Heidelmeier, the underdog,” Aiello said in a statement.

International Union of Operating Engineers Local 399 President Brian Hickey said union leaders would re-evaluate whether they should continue to support Heidelmeier.

Heidelmeier did not return requests seeking additional comment Thursday on his decision to remain in the race.

In his statement, Heidelmeier said he regretted that ""this private situation became public"" and said the revelations were ""unquestionably not fair"" to his family. But he said what happened does not hinder his ability to lead the village.

""I did nothing unlawful,"" he said, ""or anything that diminishes my ability to serve the people of Villa Park.""

With some policy differences at the margins, the four top candidates have all promised to improve neighborhood services, hire more police officers and streamline city government to help private industry create jobs.

Many of the several dozen candidate forums ahead of Tuesday’s vote have focused on improving the city’s infrastructure, hardly a rallying cry to inflame voters.

“So much of what’s being discussed gets perceived as ‘same old stuff,’” said Mark Larson, talk show host on KCBQ-AM (1170). “People are talking more about Obamacare than the mayor’s race.”

The name of Filner, if uttered at all, is said with a sneer.

“Bob Filner was a dead-end for this city,” said Councilman Kevin Faulconer, the only Republican among the four top candidates.

Councilman David Alvarez, one of three major Democratic candidates in the race, prefers not to use Filner’s name at all, instead referring to unfinished business at City Hall left by “the last mayor.”

If Filner, who resigned Aug. 30 and now awaits a Dec. 9 sentencing on sex harassment charges, hopes to repair history’s judgment on his brief, chaotic tenure as mayor, the time has not yet arrived.

“The final legacy of the Filner fiasco is that his personal peccadilloes cost the city millions in unnecessary electoral and litigation expenses and, worse, months of leadership and forward movement on a host of pressing issues,” said Carl Luna, political science professor at San Diego Mesa College.

Another aspect of the Filner legacy may be one he never intended: that his resignation gives the Republican Party a chance to reclaim the mayor’s job despite the fact that registration is trending toward Democrats and independents.

At last count, 40.2% of voters are Democrats, 27.7% independents and 27% Republicans.

When Filner was elected a year ago as the city’s first Democratic mayor in two decades, turnout was nearly 80%. But for this week’s election, the county registrar is predicting a 50% turnout.

Filner’s resignation may prove to be “a speed bump on the road to a more purple — and eventually blue — San Diego,” Luna said.

Based on requests for absentee ballots, the Democratic turnout, particularly in blue-collar neighborhoods south of Interstate 8, is lagging, according to a local think tank, the National University System Institute for Policy Research.

“Unlike November 2012, voter turnout has been low and concentrated in only a handful of neighborhoods,” said Vince Vasquez, senior policy analyst at the institute and author of the report.

The strategy of GOP and business community heavyweights to rally around one candidate — and discourage former Councilman Carl DeMaio from entering the race — appears to be working. At an invitation-only gathering in La Jolla after Filner’s resignation, the group decided on Faulconer.

Polls now suggest that Faulconer is the only candidate with even an outside chance of winning enough votes to avoid a runoff.

In the drive toward election day, former Assemblyman Nathan Fletcher had tried to gain advantage by portraying Faulconer as the candidate of an entrenched power structure.

“I didn’t need a group of insiders and status-quo folks to anoint me and tell me I could run,” Fletcher said to Faulconer during a roundtable discussion among major candidates on KUSI-TV.

Alvarez and Fletcher are jousting for the second spot and a runoff with Faulconer early next year. Each has the endorsement of a collection of party notables and labor unions.

Fletcher finished third in last year’s mayoral primary behind Filner and DeMaio. At the time, he was an independent, having dumped the Republican Party. Now he’s a Democrat.

“As we go through life, we change positions,” Fletcher said during the roundtable, attempting to explain his party shifting.

Faulconer, 46, in his second term representing a beach district, was a close ally of former Mayor Jerry Sanders. Support from Sanders and the editorial page of the U-T San Diego newspaper is key to his campaign.

Fletcher, 36, who served in Iraq as an enlisted Marine, is now an executive at Qualcomm, whose co-founder, Irwin Jacobs, is a major supporter. Alvarez, 33, in his first term representing a district south of Interstate 8, is backed by labor unions and the Sierra Club.

Former City Atty. Michael Aguirre, 64, the third Democrat among the major candidates, is endorsed by the newspaper La Prensa. He refers to his opponents as “fine young men” but decries a political system that requires them to seek endorsements and contributions from groups such as labor unions with issues pending at City Hall.

Aguirre has attempted to shift the discussion to the city’s pension payments, which he warns will leave little money to improve neighborhood services.

The other candidates have shown little interest in dwelling on the pension issue that dominated city politics for nearly a decade and sparked media-fanned public anger aimed at city employees and their labor unions. The issue now seems to have lost its resonance with voters.

“I think, after Filner, people are looking for a little less drama,” political consultant John Kern said.

""I'm convinced that I'm gonna be the next mayor of this city,"" he told the Today Show's Savannah Guthrie, in an interview that will air on Monday.

Though Weiner surged in the polls at first, news that he had sent lewd messages to a woman named Sydney Leathers wreaked havoc on his campaign. Latest polls show Weiner at fourth place, trailing NYC Public Advocate Bill DeBlasio, NYC City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and former NYC Comptroller Bill Thompson. The Democratic primary is scheduled for September 10th.

Weiner also admitted that he had probably misled the public about when his extramarital affairs ended.

""Should I have said it happened on a particular date? Maybe you're right, maybe I should have,"" he said. He told Guthrie it was ""fair"" to say that, by not admitting from the get-go that the behavior continued after he resigned from Congress, he allowed a misperception.

Chuck Hagel to head the Defense Department, the Left is struggling with Obama’s decision to nominate John Brennan as the new CIA Director. Dubbed the “Assassination Czar” by the far-left program Democracy Now, Brennan was Obama’s original choice to head the CIA when he was first elected in 2008. An uproar from the left, however, caused Brennan to withdraw his nomination. With reelection safely behind him, though, Obama clearly feels emboldened to push again for Brennan.

The left’s ire was particularly acute four years ago, because Brennan had been a high-level CIA official during the Bush Administration. At the time, the left was consumed with moral urgency to reverse many Bush anti-terror policies. Brennan was seen as a key player in the development of those policies.

Brennan spent years at the CIA and served as chief of staff to former director George Tenet during the creation of the post-9/11 detention and interrogation programs. The New Yorker’s Jane Mayer described him as a “supporter” of the programs, which included torture and the use of secret prison “black sites.”

After he withdrew his name for consideration for the CIA job, Brennan was appointed by Obama to be his chief counter-terrorism advisor. In that role, he has overseen a sweeping expansion of the drone program and adoption of a “kill list,” where the President can order targeted assassinations of terrorists.

Brennan has helped construct and justify the Administration’s claim that it can kill people, including American citizens, abroad on its own authority, even when those people are not in countries with which we are at war. His speech in April was a sort of catechism, culminating in “targeted strikes are wise.” We have done it in Pakistan and Yemen; could we do it in London or Paris?

In the aftermath of Brennan’s nomination yesterday, the ACLU cautioned the Senate not to proceed with confirmation “until it assesses the legality of his actions in past leadership positions in the CIA during the early years of the George W. Bush administration and in his current role in the ongoing targeted killing program”. ACLU’s statement is telling, since the organization doesn’t usually take positions on nominees for the executive branch.

Obama’s decision to forge ahead with Brennan’s nomination suggests he feels he has a personal political mandate following his reelection. Brennan’s legacy hasn’t changed in the four years since his name was first floated as CIA Director. If anything, the civil libertarian critique of his record has strengthened, given the increased use of drone strikes and targeted assassinations.

Obama understands, however, that much of the left’s outrage directed against Bush wasn’t as much about his specific policies as his political affiliation. Obama has continued most of the Bush-era anti-terror policies, as even staunch leftists now wearily acknowledge.

Although I actively opposed Brennan’s CIA nomination in 2008, I can’t quite muster the energy or commitment to do so now. Indeed, the very idea that someone should be disqualified from service in the Obama administration because of involvement in and support for extremist Bush terrorism polices seems quaint and obsolete, given the great continuity between Bush and Obama on these issues. Whereas in 2008 it seemed uncertain in which direction Obama would go, making it important who wielded influence, that issue is now settled: Brennan is merely a symptom of Obama’s own extremism in these areas, not a cause. This continuity will continue with or without Brennan because they are, rather obviously, Obama’s preferred policies.

A tiredness usually settles in during a President’s second term. Even the left gets weary of its moral outrage. While the usual suspects are expressing outrage over Brennan’s nomination, his confirmation fight will likely end with a whimper. As Greenwald notes, these are “obviously Obama’s preferred policies.”"

Two Democratic political operatives were convicted Thursday night in the illegal scheme after only three hours of deliberations. They were found guilty on all counts.

Former longtime St. Joseph County Democratic party Chairman Butch Morgan Jr. was found guilty of felony conspiracy counts to commit petition fraud and forgery, and former county Board of Elections worker Dustin Blythe was found guilty of felony forgery counts and falsely making a petition, after being accused of faking petitions that enabled Obama, then an Illinois Senator, to get on the presidential primary ballot for his first run for the White House.

Morgan was accused of being the mastermind behind the plot.

According to testimony from two former Board of Election officials who pled guilty, Morgan ordered Democratic officials and workers to fake the names and signatures that Obama and Clinton needed to qualify for the presidential race. Blythe, then a Board of Elections employee and Democratic Party volunteer, was accused of forging multiple pages of the Obama petitions.

""I think this helped uphold the integrity of the electoral system,"" the prosecutor, Stan Levco told reporters.

More On This... Trial begins for officials accused in Obama, Clinton ballot petition fraud

“Their verdict of guilt is not a verdict against Democrats, but for honest and fair elections,” he said.

The scheme was hatched in January of 2008, according to affidavits from investigators who cite former Board of Registration worker Lucas Burkett, who told them he was in on the plan at first, but then became uneasy and quit. He waited three years before telling authorities about it, but if revelations about any forgeries were raised during the election, the petitions could have been challenged during the contest. A candidate who did not qualify with enough legitimate signatures at the time, could have been bounced from the ballot.

The case raise questions about whether in 2008, then candidate Obama actually submitted enough legitimate signatures to have legally qualified for the primary ballot.

“I think had they been challenged successfully, he probably would not have been on the ballot,” Levco told Fox News.

Under state law, presidential candidates need to qualify for the primary ballots with 500 signatures from each of the state's nine congressional districts. Indiana election officials say that in St. Joseph County, which is the 2nd Congressional district, the Obama campaign qualified with 534 signatures; Clinton's camp had 704.

Prosecutors say that in President Obama's case, nine of the petition pages were apparently forged. Each petition contains up to 10 names, making a possible total of 90 names, which, if faked, could have brought the Obama total below the legal limit required to qualify. Prosecutors say 13 Clinton petitions were apparently forged, meaning up to 130 possibly fake signatures. Even if 130 signatures had been challenged, it would have still left Mrs. Clinton with enough signatures to meet the 500 person threshold.

Levco said a total of “100 to 200” signatures had been forged on Obama’s and Clinton’s petitions.

An Indiana State Police investigator said in court papers that the agency examined the suspect Obama petitions and ""selected names at random from each of the petition pages and contacted those people directly. We found at least one person (and often multiple people) from each page who confirmed that they had not signed"" petitions ""or given consent for their name and/or signature to appear.""

Numerous voters told Fox News that they never signed the petitions.

""That's not my signature,"" Charity Rorie, a mother of four, told us when we showed her the Obama petition with her name and signature. She was stunned, saying that it ""absolutely"" was a fake.

Charity told Fox News that her husband's entry was also a forgery, and that they have never been contacted by investigators or any authorities looking into the scandal.

""It's scary, it's shocking. It definitely is illegal,"" she told us.

Robert Hunter, Jr. told Fox news that his name was faked, too.

""I did not sign for Barack Obama,"" he told us. As he examined the Obama petition in his hands, Hunter pointed out that ""I always put 'Junior' after my name, every time...there's no 'Junior' there

Even a former Democratic Governor of Indiana, Joe Kernan, told Fox News that his name was forged.

“This is a bitter sweet moment for free and fair elections,"" observed Ryan Nees, the Indiana born Yale “University senior who first exposed the scheme in the independent political newsletter, Howey Politics Indiana and South Bend Tribune.

Nees said the multiple guilty verdicts were ""bitter, because a five-person conspiracy succeeded in illegally placing two presidential candidates on the ballot, but sweet because they were exposed, tried for their crimes, and convicted.""

Nees previously told Fox News that the fraud was clearly evident, ""because page after page of signatures are all in the same handwriting,"" and that nobody raised any red flags ""because election workers in charge of verifying their validity were the same people faking the signatures.""

[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'][twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

(CNN) – Anthony Weiner's top opponents for New York City's Democratic mayoral race each got a chance to address the former congressman in a major televised debate Tuesday night, but City Council Speaker Christine Quinn took more than one shot at the flagging candidate as the two engaged in heated exchanges throughout the night.

Two minutes deep into the five-candidate showdown, Weiner was already acknowledging and apologizing for his sexting scandal, but he urged voters to move beyond his ""personal failings"" and focus on the more substantive issues in the race.



""At the end of the day this campaign is not about me or about anyone else on this stage, it's about you,"" he said, looking at the camera.

All four of his opponents on stage agreed, with each saying they're tired of talking about Weiner. Public Advocate Bill de Blasio added the former congressman ""should step aside for the good of the city.""

""We need a debate on the issues,"" he said. ""We should not be talking about one individual and their personal life.""

City Comptroller John Liu pleaded: ""Please don't ask me any more questions about him.""

Weiner has vowed to stay in the running despite his sharp drop in the polls after admitting last month that he continued having online relationships with women for more than a year after his 2011 resignation from Congress.

At Tuesday night's debate-hosted by WABC, New York Daily News, Univision and the League of Women Voters-Quinn said Weiner was ""right"" in that New Yorkers have ""heard a lot about his personal issues.""

""For me the bigger issue is his record,"" she said, before taking a swipe at the limited amount of legislation passed under his name during his dozen years in Congress.

Hitting back, Weiner faulted Quinn for getting term limits overturned, an unpopular move that allowed Mayor Michael Bloomberg to win a third term and allowed Quinn to stay in the speaker's office.

""The speaker refuses to apologize for overturning the will of the people,"" he said. ""I've owned up to my personal failings, but I have a record that I'm proud of...and that's not something the speaker can claim.""

Quinn stood by her decision on term limits and argued neither she, nor any other New Yorker, ""should be lectured by Anthony Weiner about what we need to apologize for tonight–or ever.""

As the field of candidates, which also included former City Comptroller Bill Thompson, debated local issues, Weiner stepped in to paint himself as an outsider.

""This is the problem: They all come from basically the same place. They've been part of municipal government for decades now,"" he argued. ""If you want someone truly independent, who's going to stop this noise ... you have a choice here.""

Turning to Weiner, Quinn begged to differ.

""Not for nothing, you were in government your whole career until you had to resign from government, so I'm not sure why you're finger-pointing at people in government,"" she said.

Tuesday's debate came hours after a new poll showed a dramatic switch in the race. According to the Quinnipiac University survey, de Blasio jumped to the front of the pack with 30% of support among likely Democratic primary voters.

Quinn, the former front-runner, fell behind with 24% and Thompson came in at 22%, just four weeks before the September 10 primary. Weiner remained behind all three at 10%, while Liu had 6% support."

That's not going to happen.”

-- Then-Sen. Barack Obama at a campaign rally in Oregon, May 17, 2008.

World leaders don’t seem to be paying much heed to President Obama. And not just when it comes to domestic spy leaker Edward Snowden’s ultimate destination.

Obama today will announce what promises to be a hammer blow to cheap, coal-fired electricity as part of his legacy project of curbing global warming. But as Obama prepares to deliver what U.S. environmentalists hope will be a knockout punch to coal power here, the rest of the world is gobbling up every coal BTU it can get.

U.S. carbon emissions dropped last year more than any other major industrialized country, due in substantial part to the first round of Obama’s EPA regulations (aided by cheaper natural gas from Obama-approved fracking and a perpetually sluggish economy).

Meantime, China, India, Russia and other growing economies were firing up the coal furnaces. In the last decade, global carbon output increased by 2.6 billion tons beyond anything emitted in the United States, according to BP’s latest global survey on energy and the environment.

Obama and new Secretary of State John Kerry say they remain committed to making the U.S. a signatory to a U.N. carbon treaty. As unlikely as that may be in the U.S. Senate, it looks even more unlikely given the tendencies in other major emitters. President Putin of Russia and President Xi of China seem especially unlikely to do anything that would slow their domestic growth to levels seen in places already under a carbon crackdown like the U.S. and Europe.

But Obama, who as a candidate promised to “bankrupt” power companies that rely on coal power, will today make good. This action, he says, will set an example for the other nations to follow.

The courts and the voting public have blocked Obama from delivering any of his comprehensive plans on carbon dioxide, which he and many others attribute to an increase in global temperatures prior to the late 1990s.

Global temperatures have been steady for the last 15 or so years despite massive increases in carbon dioxide output. Climatologists who believe mankind is driving climate changes are looking for ways to explain why warming has stalled despite forecasts that the past 15 years would bring catastrophic warming. Their models have so far proved incorrect.

But those extremely alarmed about carbon, including Obama, argue that the consequences are still seen in severe weather events like hurricanes and tornadoes.

Obama, who is working hard to shore up his political base after revelations that he hugely expanded secret domestic surveillance programs, may not be able to impose federal fees on carbon emissions or regulate carbon dioxide as a toxic substance as he previously tried to do, but he still may be able to make electricity so expensive that his preferred green alternatives (especially given heavy federal subsidies) will be cost-effective.

[pullquote]

This effort will be even more important to Obama’s shaky political fortunes if he, as expected, accedes to pressure from business and labor groups to authorize a pipeline to bring Canadian oil to American refineries. Environmentalists are howling over the project that they say will increase U.S. complicity in climate change. Obama needs something to offer these folks, already unhappy to find out the size of his domestic spy regime, if he really is going to cave on Keystone.

Obama doesn’t need Congress to cripple carbon. By expanding the EPA’s standards for new plants to existing plants, Obama will hasten the conversion to fracked natural gas by utilities. Even though the programs will take time to implement and face legal challenges, power companies have long seen the writing on the wall and are already switching to more expensive fuels. The conversion and the price increases due to heightened demand will accelerate.

The idea here is for Americans to pay the price to show a moral example on climate to the rest of the world. It’s not that it will make much difference to the composition of the atmosphere but that previously reticent nations will want to follow suit.

But as it turns out, the world doesn’t much care about America’s carbon footprint. For most of the planet’s 7 billion residents, the question is how they are living, not what the United States is emitting. Add to that the mounting questions about climate science and it is hard to see Putin and others jumping on the bandwagon of more expensive energy.

Today’s announcement will be more good news for the president’s patrons and political partners in the green energy and natural gas businesses who have already benefited hugely from his policies. But as far as changing the planet, its looking like a great big “nyet.”

When the leaders of the globe’s two great powers meet, scribblers pay attention.

But for one middle-class constituent who almost landed on Obama’s agenda, the quick Western swing will be forever remembered for the meeting that did not happen, a subsequent tumble into the politico-media mulcher and what Paul Scott now hopes will be a mostly happy ending.

All Scott, a 60-year-old car salesman from Santa Monica, wanted was to promote the virtues of electric cars. He co-founded the nonprofit Plug In America and had a featured role in the 2006 documentary “Who Killed the Electric Car?”

So when an email invitation arrived for Friday’s Democratic National Committee fundraiser in Santa Monica — with a $32,400 donation opening the door to a special reception and a few minutes of face time with the president — Scott thought about it a little. He’d given a few hundred dollars before. This time, he decided to go all in.

It was an outsized play for a guy who earns $50,000 to $60,000 a year and doesn’t have a huge savings account. “This was the biggest thing I had ever done in my life,” said Scott, who simply had to tell the president how much more he could do to talk Americans out of their gas guzzlers and into electric vehicles.

To get maximum voltage out of his investment, the silver-haired salesman wrote a column and emailed it to dozens of news outlets. In “My Lunch with Obama,” he wrote about why he was willing to pay “a large percentage of my retirement savings” for the chance to ask the president a question or two.

Scott calculated that in little more than a decade, he had saved $16,000 by harnessing solar energy at his home and funneling some of it to his electric-powered Nissan Leaf, just like the ones he sells at a downtown dealership.

“It begs the question,” he wrote, “what would our planet and political process look like if millions of Americans stopped giving hundreds of billions to polluting industries and spent their savings instead on locally generated, renewable electricity and local goods and services?”

USA Today and several automotive publications picked up the story. That, in turn, provoked a second wave of interest from conservative commentators. Their focus was on the appearance that the Democrats were selling access to the president.

Conservative firebrand Michelle Malkin’s website headlined: “Electric car advocate pays $16k a minute to personally ask Obama to push carbon tax.” The story blew up online when it was picked up by the Drudge Report.

On Monday, Scott received another email from the Democratic National Committee, informing him he was no longer welcome at the luncheon and his $32,400 would be returned. “They insinuated that I did it to gain media attention,” Scott said.

On that count, he pleads guilty. “I support Democratic politicians and I certainly support the president; he is a fantastic president,” Scott said. “But I also have a message that is crucially important for our society and I have to get that message out any way I can.”

Officials at the DNC did not respond to a request for comment.

The party’s earlier email to potential donors said $10,000 would get a seat at Friday’s lunch, $16,200 a picture with the president and $32,400 a photo and “a very special one-hour round table discussion with the President after the luncheon.”

Kelly R. Olsen, a former Santa Monica City Council member, planned to make a video of his friend’s thoughts about his presidential encounter. Olsen helped move the city’s vehicle fleet to clean-burning fuels in the 1990s. He calls Scott “a human being who is dedicated and believes in something ... and was willing to put his money where his mouth is.”

Olsen thinks Scott got blackballed because he “pulled back the curtain” on the way politicians exchange access for contributions.

Scott does not want to dwell on the negative. He said it was never his intention to point out the unseemly side of money in politics. He is not a man who believes in half-measures. A onetime marathoner and self-taught gymnast, he spends long sessions on the rings and parallel bars next to the Santa Monica Pier.

He will sell only the electric Leaf and directs customers who want an internal-combustion vehicle to co-workers. “I won’t sell a gas car,” he said. “My goal in life is to get as many of them off the road as humanly possible.”

He rattles off petroleum industry statistics: $700 billion spent per year in America on oil products, an estimated $80 billion annually for military protection of oil assets and $10 billion in subsidies for the industry. That’s not counting increased healthcare costs from dirtier air or for environmental cleanups after oil spills, he adds.

He wants a tax on carbon — and thus gasoline — to cover those indirect societal costs. That’s one of the things he hoped to discuss with Obama. Another was the benefits of “hyper-miling,” the practice of efficiently accelerating and coasting that Scott says can improve fuel efficiency by as much as 30%.

“I am terribly disappointed to not see the president,” Scott said, “but the most important thing is getting the message out. We have got to move the needle on this issue.”

The video Maryland Democrat Chris Van Hollen’s recent “parliamentary inquiry” on the floor of the House of the Representatives is making the rounds, and will likely be seen by millions by the end of the week. I include this video at the bottom of the page.

The video puts to rest any argument that the GOP wants to end the shutdown and get government working again. Perhaps they are having too much fun waving confederate flags in front of the White House. The bill, H.R. 368, forbids anyone except “the Majority Leader or his designate” from bringing a clean continuing resolution to the floor for vote.

Now it doesn’t surprise me in the least that Republicans would do this. It doesn’t outrage me that the use of backhanded, undemocratic measures are being employed by the party controlled by Tea Party loons.

What does infuriate me is the fact the seven Democrats crossed party lines to vote for a resolution that gives Eric Cantor, and only Eric Cantor the ability to bring fourth a vote a clear CR to get the government working aging…and yes, open the monuments.

And now several of the seven House Democrats that voted for HR 368, are Tweeting and saying that they want a clean CR and are supporting the discharge petition. But I’m not falling for it. These seven members willfully voted against democracy, and supported the GOP’s effort to create yet another manufactured crisis.

The seven back-stabbing, turncoat, worthless Democrats are:

Ron Barber AZ-2

John Barrow GA-12

Dan Maffei NY-24

Sean Patrick Maloney NY-18

Jim Matheson UT-4

Mike McIntyre NC-7

Collin Peterson MN-7

Here’s what some of these dishonest Reps. have been Tweeting:



These are examples back-stabbing Democrats who side with the Tea Party when they think we’re not watching, then want us honest Democrats to believe them in wanting the shutdown to end.

Words are not capable of expressing my outrage and pure contempt for these low-life, scumbag traitors in our party.

Thank you Chris Van Hollen for pulling back the curtain and exposing these truly worthless Democrats!

(CNN) —

Vice President Joe Biden has apologized to President Barack Obama for putting him in a tough position that led to Obama’s announcement that he now supports same-sex marriage, senior administration officials said Thursday.

Obama said in an interview that aired Thursday on ABC that he made his decision public earlier than he had planned after Biden’s weekend remark that he was “absolutely comfortable” with letting gays and lesbians marry.

Two senior administration officials said Biden and Obama met Wednesday morning, and Biden apologized for putting Obama in a tough spot. Obama responded by saying that he knew Biden was speaking from the heart, said the officials, who didn’t want to be named discussing private conversations between the president and vice president.

Biden’s remarks on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday launched a controversy that led to Obama announcing that his position on same-sex marriage, which he had previously called “evolving,” had shifted to support. When Obama’s full interview aired Thursday, he said his disclosure came sooner than planned as a result of Biden’s comments.

“I had already made a decision that we were going to probably take this position before the election and before the convention,” Obama said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” Biden “probably got out a little bit over his skis, but out of generosity of spirit,” he said.

He added that he would have “preferred to have done this in my own way, on my own terms,” but “all’s well that ends well.”

Separately, Biden spokeswoman Kendra Barkoff said Obama “has been the leader on this issue from day one, and the vice president never intended to distract from that.”

Once Biden’s comments drew attention to the issue, Obama made plans to announce his support next week on a previously scheduled appearance on the ABC talk show “The View,” a senior administration official said Thursday. The president and his advisers knew Obama would be asked about the issue in the wake of Biden’s NBC interview, said the official, who didn’t want to speak publicly about internal administration discussions.

Ultimately, they decided to move up the timeline and have him announce his support during the ABC interview at the White House, the official said. And a top Democrat told CNN that Obama knew the issue would come up at the convention, partly because of a push for support for same-sex marriage to be included in the Democratic Party platform, and in debates.

Multiple top Democrats told CNN the president’s senior aides are annoyed with Biden for forcing the conversation on same-sex marriage now. One source said Biden has, in the past, counseled the president against coming out for same-sex marriage, making this move that much more frustrating.

But the sources said they don’t believe it will create a lasting rift between the two leaders. Biden is known to go off-script, something Obama knew when he selected his vice president.

In explaining to ABC how his position has evolved, Obama noted that his daughters Malia and Sasha have “friends whose parents are same-sex couples. It wouldn’t dawn on them that somehow their friends’ parents would be treated differently. And frankly that’s the kind of thing that prompts a change of perspective, not wanting to somehow explain to your child why somebody should be treated differently when it comes to the eyes of the law.”

Asked about whether his new position is a calculated move in an election year, Obama said it would “be hard to argue that somehow this is something that I’d be doing for political advantage. Because frankly, you know, the politics – it’s not clear how they cut.”

The interview aired the same day Obama attended a fundraiser in Los Angeles, where support for same-sex marriage is strong. Movie star George Clooney hosted the event, which is raking in $15 million, according to a top Democratic source. And on Monday, openly gay singer Ricky Martin is hosting a fundraising event for Obama in New York.

But some in the African-American community have expressed strong disapproval of Obama’s endorsement of same-sex marriage. A Democratic official said the White House has been actively reaching out to African-American community leaders and pastors and will continue to do so in the wake of the president’s decision, but the official noted that even the president’s base won’t always agree with him on everything. “There are going to be issues you don’t agree on,” the official said.

And Obama told ABC he won’t spend much time talking about the issue, because he’s focused on the economy. The announcement puts Obama squarely at odds with presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who has since reiterated his opposition to same-sex marriage.

“And I do not favor civil unions if they are identical to marriage other than by name,” Romney said during a Wednesday visit to Fort Lupton, Colorado. “My view is the domestic partnership benefits, hospital visitation rights and the like are appropriate, but that the others are not.”

The issue is a divisive one in American politics, but it’s uncertain how the development might play out at the voting booth.

A Gallup Poll released Tuesday indicated 50% of Americans believe same-sex marriages should be recognized by law as valid, with 48% saying such marriages should not be legal – a dramatic shift from a few years ago. A Gallup poll in 2009 found 40% supported same-sex marriage and 57% were opposed.

But a CNN/ORC International poll, taken in late March, indicated policies toward gays and lesbians were tied for last in people’s opinions of the most-important issues facing the country.

Obama said he supports states deciding the issue on their own, but added that he was “disappointed” by Tuesday’s vote on the issue in North Carolina, where a ban on same-sex marriage was added to the constitution. Obama called the amendment discriminatory against gays and lesbians, a spokesman said earlier Wednesday.

Six states – Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York – and the District of Columbia issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, while 31 states have voted in favor of constitutional amendments that seek to defend traditional definitions of marriage as a heterosexual union.

In February, Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire signed a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage beginning in June, but opponents there have pledged to block the bill and called for voters to decide the issue. Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley signed into law a bill that permits the state’s same-sex couples to wed as of January 1, and state residents may vote to affirm such a law.

Minnesota will vote on a state constitutional amendment similar to the one in North Carolina, while Maine will have a referendum on allowing same-sex marriage. Meanwhile, two cases seeking to overturn laws forbidding the practice, one from California and another from Massachusetts, could be headed to the U.S. Supreme Court in coming months.

Human Rights Campaign published a confidential tax return of the National Organization for Marriage.

There is no question that someone at the IRS leaked the document that was published by the HRC.

It is imperative that Congressional investigators get to the bottom of the issue.

The world is learning about the corruption of the IRS in targeting conservative groups, including various Tea Party organizations, for heightened scrutiny. But the corruption goes much deeper than harassing groups seeking first time non-profit designations, into actively sabotaging existing non-profit groups by releasing confidential information.

In March of 2012 the Human Rights Campaign published a confidential tax return of the National Organization for Marriage, which was immediately republished byThe Huffington Post and other liberal news media outlets. The HRC and NOM are the leading national groups on opposing sides of the fight over gay marriage. HRC wants to redefine marriage to make it genderless, while NOM wishes to preserve marriage as the union of one man and one woman.

NOM a target

My organization was not the only conservative-linked political group or business that appears to have faced shady actions from IRS employees. ProPublica reported this week that the IRS handed over to them confidential documents of nine conservative organizations whose applications for non-profit status were still pending. Among them: Crossroads GPS, a key group backing Mitt Romney's presidential campaign.

Our case was particularly egregious because the IRS leak of confidential information fed directly into an ongoing political battle. For months before March 2012, the pro-gay marriage HRC had been demanding that my group, NOM, publicly identify its major donors, something that NOM and many other non-profits refuse to do. The reason is simple. In the past, gay marriage advocates have used such information to launch campaigns of intimidation against traditional marriage supporters.

Just as gay marriage proponents were demanding the information, the IRS appears to have illegally given them exactly what they were looking for. The tax return released by the HRC contained the names and addresses of dozens of major donors to NOM. And there's little doubt where the documents came from. The tax returns contained internal coding added by the IRS after the returns were originally submitted.

For the IRS to leak any organization's tax return to its political opponents is an outrageous breach of ethics and, if proven, constitutes a felony. Every organization — liberal and conservative — should shudder at the idea of the IRS playing politics with its confidential tax return information. But the situation here is even more egregious because the head of the HRC was at the time serving as a national co-chair of President Obama's re-election campaign.

The release of NOM's confidential tax return to the Human Rights Campaign is the canary in the coal mine of IRS corruption. Contrary to assertions that the targeting of Tea Party groups was an error in judgment by low-level IRS bureaucrats, the release of NOM's confidential data to a group headed by an Obama campaign co-chair suggests the possibility of complicity at the highest levels of politics and government. This wasn't a low-level error in judgment; it was a conscious act to reward a prominent Obama supporter while punishing an opponent.

That's the reason the IRS has not been very interested in getting to the bottom of what happened. Federal investigators have interviewed NOM officials about the matter, but our efforts to find out what has become of the investigation have been stonewalled at every turn.

Not about marriage

The tendency of some is to set this serious issue aside because it is seemingly part of the war on traditional marriage, an issue that divides the country in half and bedevils many. But given the broader issues being raised about the IRS, that's not right.

At this stage, nobody is accusing the White House or the Obama re-election campaign of illegal activity. But there is a serious question about whether there was communication or possible collusion between the IRS and the HRC, and if there was, whether anyone at the White House or the Obama re-election campaign was involved.

It is imperative that congressional investigators get to the bottom of the issue. If the IRS can get away with leaking NOM's confidential tax return to its chief political opponent, then no taxpayer is safe from political retribution by the federal government.

The Palins became good friends with Kyle in the past two years.

Kyle, the former Navy SEAL and author of American Sniper, a New York Times bestseller, was murdered on February 2 at a Texas gun range, allegedly by a former Marine suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) whom Kyle was trying to help.

In a Facebook note, Palin wrote she found it “sad to see that flags aren’t flying at half staff for this American hero” and hoped Obama “pays his respects in some gesture of condolence” for someone who “sacrificed so much to keep him and all of us safe.”

Obama has publicly acknowledged people like Sandra Fluke and famous rappers, but he is not attending Kyle’s funeral and did not issue a statement after Kyle’s death.

“We may never know to what extent Chris kept us free or how many lives he saved by his brave actions in the line of fire. But his fellow warriors know how important he was. My son Track couldn’t meet Chris when Todd and I first met him because Track was deployed to Iraq,” Palin wrote. “Then when we got to know Chris even better, our son was deployed in Afghanistan. We’ve met a lot of people in recent years, and Track has been privileged to meet them as well. But he said about Chris, ‘Mom, he’s the ONE person in the entire world I would be star-struck to meet. He’s it.'”

Palin first met Kyle during the premiere of Stephen K. Bannon’s “The Undefeated” movie in Pella, Iowa in 2011. Kyle was in charge of security for that event.

After attending the funeral, Palin suggested ways to honor and remember Kyle and, in another Facebook posting, wrote:

It was a beautiful memorial service for Chris Kyle at Cowboys Stadium this afternoon. What a celebration of a great life! All in all, is there a finer human being who has crossed the 50-yard line star in Texas than Chris Kyle? Please click on the following link for information on how we can help out the families of Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield. As patriotic Americans, this is a tangible way to show appreciation and support for good people. On a personal note, I thank you who’ve sent birthday greetings today, and it would be awesome if you’d join me in supporting the families of these heroes by helping them out!

The Palins got to know Kyle better when Todd Palin was on the show “Stars Earn Stripes” with Kyle. The Palins, along with the rest of the cast, spent a lot of time on set with Kyle’s family. Kyle was the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history.

“God bless this great warrior,” Palin said. “Let us keep his wife and children in our prayers, and may we never forget him or his sacrifice.”

Report,"Don’t look for a new Justice Department report about American gun violence to receive any serious media coverage over the coming days, or ever. According to the report from the department’s Bureau of Statistics, every argument the media and the left are currently making to push for new restrictions on our Second Amendment civil rights, are made up of anti-science nonsense. This report not only proves the media wrong, it proves the NRA right.

Between the years of 1993 and 2011, as the assault weapons ban expired, more Americans purchased guns, the Supreme Court overturned outright gun bans, and individual states not only loosed gun control restrictions but also issued concealed carry permits to private citizens, incidents of gun violence in America collapsed.

Between 1993 and 2011, nonfatal gun crimes plummeted 69%; from 1.5 million to 467,300. Gun-related murders dropped 40%; from 18,253 to 11,101. Gun-related murders for black Americans plummeted by 51%.

The report also shows that the media-created hysteria over school shootings is wildly misleading. Between ’93 and ’11, the murder rate in schools dropped by almost a third; from 29 to 20.

Background checks have also been exposed as another bogus narrative the media’s crafted out of thin air. This report proves beyond any doubt that closing the so-called gun show loophole will accomplish next to nothing. Less than one-percent of state prisoners caught with a gun purchased it at a gun show. Moreover, who knows how many of those criminals might have passed or did pass a background check.

So-called assault weapons are also not a problem, Only “2% of state inmates and 3% of federal inmates were armed with a military-style semiautomatic or fully automatic firearm.”

What this study clearly shows is that Obama, Democrats, and the media don’t give a damn about stopping gun violence. If they did, they would be focused on everything but the one and two-percent problems.

What we have here is a yet-another culture war; nothing more nothing less — and one aimed at the type of law-abiding citizens who attend gun shows and enjoy these so-called assault weapons. In other words, Red State conservatives.

What is especially crucial to keep in mind is that 2011 is not some kind of outlier. If you study the original report, you will see that these decreases are all part of an 18-year trend, not an outlier year or two.

This report is extremely good news is you are the kind of person who gives a damn about human life.

But if you are cynical, power-hungry Democrats more uncomfortable with the idea of human freedom than you are pleased with a decrease in human life, this report is bad news. Furthermore, if you are a dishonest member of the media who believes that delivering political wins to Democrats is more important than human life, this report is also bad news.

There is just no question that an armed American populace is a safer American populace. This study also proves that smart policing and a willingness to award serious jail time to violent offenders (two areas our criminal justice system have focused on over the last two decades) does a helluva lot more to decrease the rate of gun violence than purely symbolic gun-grabbing laws.

Thanks to this study we also know for a fact now that the Newtown massacre is being exploited by the media only to demonize Obama’s political enemies.

Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy using the skeet range at Camp David.

This column has been updated with a new ruling

The New Republic: “Have you ever fired a gun?”

President Obama: “Yes, in fact, up at Camp David, we do skeet shooting all the time.”

New Republic: ”The whole family?”

Obama: “Not the girls, but oftentimes guests of mine go up there. And I have a profound respect for the traditions of hunting that trace back in this country for generations. And I think those who dismiss that out of hand make a big mistake.”

— from an interview published Jan. 27, 2013

A number of readers have raised questions about the president’s statement that he goes skeet shooting “all the time” while at Camp David. In these suspicious times, they would like to see some evidence.

But the White House has been oddly silent about the matter.

On Monday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said he did know how often the president has gone skeet shooting and that he has not seen a photograph. “When he goes to Camp David, he goes to spend time with his family and friends and relax, not to produce photographs,” Carney told reporters.

Of course, this did not stop the White House from releasing these photographs in 2011. (Obama is shown at Sasha Obama’s birthday party at Camp David; the second was taken the same weekend of Vice President Biden, but that is not at Camp David):

Then, on Wednesday, Carney tersely said he had no response to a challenge from Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) for a skeet shooting contest with the president.

We e-mailed a White House official on Tuesday and then Carney twice on Wednesday asking for the name of an Obama guest at Camp David who could confirm the president’s account. (The White House does not publicly release the names of guests.) We received no response all three times.

So let’s review what we do know.

The Facts

In skeet shooting, participants use shotguns to hit clay disks that are automatically flung into air, in an effort to simulate bird hunting. An interesting blog about Camp David, in a post from 2010, reports that many presidents have enjoyed skeet shooting at the rustic retreat. (Check out the photo of John F. Kennedy skeet shooting with future Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee.) The blog also displays overhead images over the years showing that the skeet range is located near the helicopter pad.

We searched high and low through hundreds of news reports to see if there was ever any other mention of Obama engaged in skeet shooting. We found that Obama, in a weekly radio address in 2012, congratulated Kim Rhode on becoming “the first American to win individual medals in five straight Olympics with her gold in skeet shooting” and Army Sgt. Vincent Hancock for a second skeet gold.

But when the Olympic athletes later visited the White House, Obama did not make a reference to having attempted skeet shooting. Instead, he spoke of other sports that moved him to do better:

“But I was inspired to watch you guys even though I couldn’t do what you do. I was inspired to run a little bit faster watching Tyson Gay, and lift a little more after watching Holley Mangold, or do a few more crunches after watching Michael Phelps and the other swimmers. Somehow, it didn’t work quite on me.”

In 2011, Politico reported that Obama was “an infrequent visitor” to Camp David, compared to other presidents:

Those close to Obama say the president — who owns a home in Chicago — is more of an “urban guy,” who prefers hitting the basketball court and the golf course on weekends to blow off steam. On a sunny Sunday afternoon, upon returning from Camp David on his most recent trip, Obama headed straight for the links. And while Camp David includes a movie theater, bowling alley, swimming pool and endless biking and hiking trails, Obama prefers to stick close to the White House when he’s not on vacation.

Again, no mention of skeet shooting.

(UPDATE: A reader pointed us to an Associated Press article in 2010 which reported that after Obama met with the Texas Christian University national championship rifle team, one team member quoted Obama as saying he had practiced shooting a rifle with the Secret Service.)

We also could not find evidence that Obama ever tried skeet shooting before he became president.

During the 2008 campaign, a group that called itself the American Hunters and Shooters Association — which some pro-gun groups attacked as a front for anti-gun forces — endorsed Obama and announced he would attend a skeet shooting event in September in Colorado. “The Obama campaign says the skeet shooting event will highlight the Democrat’s support of the Second Amendment and hunting rights,” the Associated Press reported. But Ray Schoenke, a former Washington Redskins football player who headed the organization, said in an interview Wednesday that in the end Obama did not attend the Colorado event.

Schoenke said that after Obama’s election, the organization — which he said was intended to bridge the gap between urban liberals and rural gun owners — closed down because of lack of support from the Obama administration. He said he did many events in support of the Obama campaign in 2008 but Obama never mentioned having ever handled a firearm.

During a September 2008 campaign event in Duryea, Pa.., Obama was point blank asked if he was “going to take away the guns.” He gave a rather long answer, but he made no reference to having used a weapon himself — and this certainly would have been the perfect moment. Instead, he speaks of “your guns:”

“The bottom line is this: If you’ve got a rifle, you've got a shotgun, you've got a gun in your house, I'm not taking it away. All right? So they can keep on talking about it, but this is just not true.

“And, by the way, even if — here's another thing you've got to understand. Even if I wanted to take it away, I couldn’t get it done. I don't have the votes in Congress….

“It's your guns. We're not going to mess with them, all right? I hope I made that clear. Is everybody clear back there in the back? Because I see a couple sportsmen back there. All right? Spread the word with your friends. I'm not going to take away your guns.”

Generally, a politician who has handled firearms will advertise that fact to gun owners. Indeed, here’s how Obama’s 2008 rival for the Democratic nomination, then-Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, spoke about guns after another mass killing that year, according to the AP:

Clinton told an audience she supported gun rights, two days after a student opened fire on the campus of Northern Illinois University, killing five before turning the gun on himself. Clinton said she believed in getting guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill even as she favored protecting the rights of law abiding gun owners.

“I've gone hunting,” she said. “I know you may not believe it, but it's true. My father taught us to shoot.”

Clinton told reporters later she had once shot a duck in Arkansas, along with “a lot of tin cans, targets and some skeet.”

The Pinocchio Test

The evidence suggests that until Obama had access to a shooting range as president, he never went skeet shooting. He certainly did not speak like a politician who had once used a firearm.

But it is also curious that the White House refuses to provide any documentary evidence that he actually used the shooting range at Camp David, since he claims he uses it “all the time,” or that a presidential friend has not come forward to confirm the president’s comments.

We live in suspicious times and the president lives in a media fishbowl. That’s the way it is. In the meantime, we do not have enough information to make a ruling one way or the other. We are eager to see a photograph, or hear from someone who saw him at the skeet range, to put this matter to rest.

UPDATE: A reader notes that because Obama said he does skeet shooting “all the time,” perhaps our standard of proof should be higher--such as several photographs. That’s a reasonable point. We have also been asked why we did not immediately award Pinocchios, such as when Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) made unproven claims about Mitt Romney’s taxes. We try to avoid using “verdict pending,” but in cases of self-aggrandizement, we are willing to be a bit more patient. Obviously, if the White House is not forthcoming with additional evidence, then the claim becomes increasingly doubtful.

UPDATE, Feb. 2: The White House released this photograph of the president at the Camp David skeet range on Aug. 4, 2012. We are pleased the White House has become more forthcoming about this matter, though it does not quite answer the questions concerning the president’s “all the time” language. What do readers think? (Also, given some of the controversy this column generated, we refer you to a negative critique that appeared on Mediaite, which certainly reflects the views of a number of readers who are upset that we thought this was even an issue.)

UPDATE: As one might expect, there is a vast divide on this, with some readers upset that we did not immediately change our ruling because the president released a photo, as we had requested in our original column. We try not to make snap judgements, but readers argued we had moved the goal posts. Well, a case could be made that we had. (See first update.)

We certainly appreciate all of the commentary we received on this column. Many readers initially were upset that we did not immediately award Pinocchios, but now a new wave of readers has condemned us for even thinking this was worthy of serious inquiry. On the last point, we respectively disagree. All statements by public figures are subject to scrutiny. The president made an unexpected claim, and for nearly a week the White House refused to back it up.

So we now have a photo, a news report quoting an anonymous source that the president participated in a Marine guard competition and a news report quoting Obama that he has practiced with the Secret Service. The issue is settled, and we award the president a Geppetto Checkmark.

Here’s the problem: Universal background checks are the most insidious of all the gun control measures pushed heretofore. They will rob of us of more freedom than an “assault weapons” ban and a “high capacity” magazine ban combined, all in the name of preventing another Sandy Hook shooting. Yet they will actually do nothing to prevent such a shooting. Nothing at all.

As David Kopel so ably put it in his Jan. 30 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, universal background checks necessitate a gun registry if they are to be enforceable.

Put simply, this means that once a universal background state statute is in place, the government will require you to register every gun you own–shotguns, rifles, and handguns–so that they can be sure you do not sell a gun privately.

Which brings us to our second point: universal background checks will end private sales, period. No more sales to neighbors, no more sales between a father and his son or a mother and her daughter. No more sales between friends.

Once guns are registered, and private sales have been ended, the door will be opened for taxes allocated per number of guns owned, forced liability insurance payable based on number of guns owned, and for outright gun confiscation.

The NRA has warned about the confiscation that usually follows registration, historically speaking, and the Democrats themselves are already promoting per-gun taxes and liability insurance.

The bottom line: Universal background checks represent the crest of the hill atop the slippery slope. We must contact our Reps. and Sens. and demand that they say no to this insidious gun control measure.

It has nothing to with Sandy Hook Elementary, but everything to do with helping Democrats realize their dreams of crushing the 2nd Amendment."

Responding to the blowback from skeptics who doubted Obama was telling the unvarnished truth (Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) challenged Obama to a skeet shooting contest), the White House not only released a photo of Obama shooting skeet, but White House press secretary Jay Carney also tried to water down Obama’s statement.

Carney claimed Obama had “never pretended to or suggested that he had grown up as a hunter or engaging in sports activities with weapons.” According to the White House spokesman, “[Obama] simply said that he had, and this is the truth, that he had enjoyed shooting at Camp David. That’s a fact.”

He went on to explain why the photo had been released while continuing to assert that Obama’s comments about shooting had been entirely unplanned:

The fact is the president was asked a question–did not volunteer, but was asked a question about whether or not he had ever shot a weapon. He answered with the truth, which is that he has enjoyed shooting competitively with friends at Camp David on multiple occasions… there were persistent questions about this, and we decided to release a photo of the president shooting at Camp David.

Obama told The New Republic that he was a skeet shooter, stating, “Yes, in fact, up at Camp David, we do skeet shooting all the time. Not the girls, but oftentimes guests of mine go up there.”

When asked whether Obama liked skeet or trap shooting better, Carney replied that Obama “has gotten better” at shooting."
http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/nra-goes-offensive-over-high-capacity-magazine-ban-162148044--politics.html,,[],NRA goes on offensive over high-capacity magazine ban,"

The same week President Barack Obama used his State of the Union to warn Congress that the victims of gun violence ""deserve a vote"" on gun legislation, the National Rifle Association has gone on the offensive against attempts to ban high-capacity magazines that carry more than 10 rounds of ammunition.

The NRA, the nation's largest gun rights lobby, released an ad on Thursday that suggested banning high-capacity magazines will turn the country into a crime-ridden nightmare where only the wealthy are protected from murderers and thieves.

The ad points out that Secret Service and other law enforcement officers will not be barred from using the high-capacity magazines, while criminals would still be able to purchase them on the black market. ""It's just the rest of us, the law-abiding people, who will have to defend our families with limited-capacity magazines,"" a narrator intones. ""Welcome to Barack Obama's middle class.""

High-capacity magazines and some semi-automatic weapons were banned for 10 years under a law signed by President Bill Clinton. It expired in 2004.

Meanwhile, the NRA's vice president, Wayne LaPierre, wrote an op-ed in the Daily Caller on Thursday warning that gun owners must ""stand and fight"" against any attempts at gun control. “Hurricanes. Tornadoes. Riots. Terrorists. Gangs. Lone criminals. These are perils we are sure to face—not just maybe. It's not paranoia to buy a gun. It's survival. It's responsible behavior, and it's time we encourage law-abiding Americans to do just that,"" he wrote.

Polls show a majority of Americans support banning high-capacity magazines, as well as closing loopholes that allow some gun buyers to evade federal background checks before purchasing a weapon. (The background checks screen out felons and people who have been declared mentally ill by a judge from purchasing weapons.)

The NRA has also taken a stand against the background checks.

""When it comes to the issue of background checks, let’s be honest—background checks will never be 'universal'—because criminals will never submit to them,"" LaPierre said at a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting last month.

A ban on certain semi-automatic weapons pushed by Obama and some Democrats in Congress enjoys less popular support than either the magazine ban or background checks.

Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to a magazine as a clip."

WASHINGTON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - American consumers' initial experience on the Obamacare website Healthcare.gov has been inadequate and unacceptable, a key administration official overseeing the troubled launch told a congressional panel on Tuesday.

Marilyn Tavenner, director of the agency in charge of setting up the online insurance exchanges, said the administration was determined to repair the glitches, but experts were still diagnosing the problems and have much work ahead.

""The initial consumer experience of Healthcare.gov has not lived up to the expectations of the American people and is not acceptable,"" Tavenner, a former nurse who heads the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in prepared testimony to the House Ways and Means Committee.

""We are committed to fixing these problems as soon as possible,"" she said.

It has been four weeks since the website at the center of President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law was switched on, but it has been plagued by error messages, delays and bugs, which information technology experts from both the government and private contractors have been scrambling to fix.

On Sunday, a data center outage prevented Americans from enrolling in the subsidized health insurance provided for under Obama's Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare. The site was back up on Monday.

Republicans have seized on the troubled website to further attack Obamacare and question whether administration officials hid problems before the launch. They are expected to press Tavenner on testimony she gave in August, when she said work was on track to roll out a tested website that would make it easy for Americans to enroll for insurance.

Tavenner said in her testimony for Tuesday that an ""initial wave of interest stressed the account service, resulting in many consumers experiencing difficulty signing up, while those who were able to sign up sometimes had problems logging in.""

She also placed some blame on the contractors helping to build and maintain the website, saying a subset of them ""have not met expectations."" She did not name the contractors.

A ""new infusion of talent"" has been brought in and experts are working aggressively to diagnose the parts that are still experiencing problems, Tavenner said. They are continuing to add capacity, and more people are creating accounts, she said.

""We are pleased with these quick improvements, but we know there is still significant, additional work to be done,"" she said.

Tavenner's testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee marks the second congressional hearing to examine the problems with the program's rollout. Last week, contractors who worked on the site told a different panel that the administration launched it after only a minimum of system-wide testing.

Tavenner, 62, was confirmed for her job by the Senate in May. She had been optimistic about the rollout when questioned by lawmakers about it in April and again in August.

She is appearing before Congress one day before her boss, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, testifies to Congress on the same subject.

With Obama adviser Jeffrey Zients saying Healthcare.gov should be fixed by the end of November, experts say the administration could lose the interest of healthy younger adults aged 18-35 for whom the website was seen as a major avenue for enrollment.

On Monday, the White House issued a report promoting the program for young people. Based partly on Census data, it said 46 percent of young adults who live alone in 34 states could get health coverage for $50 a month or less under Obamacare.

Republicans in Congress have introduced a flurry of legislation they say is aimed at protecting the public from the problem-plagued rollout.

Senators Marco Rubio and Jerry Moran have a bill to delay - until six months after the troubled Healthcare.gov is fully functioning - the mandate requiring most Americans to have health insurance in 2014 or pay a penalty.

Fred Upton, the Republican chair of the House, Energy and Commerce Committee, has also produced a bill allowing insurers to maintain existing health plans in 2014 outside the new online health insurance exchanges - even if they do not meet the benefit standards of Obamacare."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2013/10/08/stewart-destroys-sebelius-obamacare,2013-10-08 00:00:00,['Christian Toto'],Jon Stewart Destroys Kathleen Sebelius Over Obamacare Debacle,"Comedy Central’s Jon Stewart spent last week mocking the GOP for opposing Obamacare, ignoring legitimate concerns Republicans raised about both the health care legislation itself and its bungled launch.

Turns out the funny man did hear the GOP’s complaints.

Stewart interviewed Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on Monday’s edition of The Daily Show, and he proceeded to both mock and shred her attempt to talk up Obamacare. One almost could feel sorry for an Obama administration official forced to defend the president’s signature train wreck.

Stewart kept his clown nose on for the start of their chat to highlight Obamacare’s deeply flawed web component.

We’re going to do a challenge,” Stewart said at the start of the interview. “I’m going to try and download every movie ever made, and you are going to try to sign up for Obamacare — and we’ll see which happens first.

Ouch. It was almost as if Jay Leno were sitting in Stewart’s chair for a moment.

Stewart wasn’t finished.

If I’m an individual that doesn’t want [Obamacare], it would be hard for me to look at a big business getting a waiver and not having to do it and me having to,” Stewart said. “Because I would feel like … like you are favoring big business because they lobbied you this year, but you’re not allowing individuals that same courtesy.” Sebelius ducked the question and repeated her talking points. She did that a few more times on his follow-ups, prompting Stewart to say, “Am I a stupid man?

No, just a comedian who too often defends the president for partisan reasons and mocks the one cable news station–Fox News–which holds Obama’s feet to the fire on the latest headlines.

Sadly, many young Americans say they get their “news” from Stewart’s Daily Show. If true, Millennials got a dose of stone cold reality last night."
http://news.yahoo.com/president-obama-frustrating-rollout-signature-health-care-legislation-153719659.html,,[],"For President Obama, a frustrating rollout for his signature health care legislation","WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama is expected Monday to address the problem-plagued rollout of his signature health care legislation, which has suffered an embarrassing start with a cascade of computer problems plaguing online sign-ups for health insurance.

The rough rollout has been a black eye for Obama, who invested significant time and political capital in his first term getting the law passed, with the goal of insuring millions of Americans without coverage.

Administration officials say more than 476,000 health insurance applications have been filed through federal and state exchanges. The figures mark the most detailed measure yet of the problem-plagued rollout of the insurance marketplace.

However, the officials continue to refuse to say how many people have actually enrolled. And without enrolment figures, it's unclear whether the program is on track to reach the 7 million people projected to gain coverage during the six-month sign-up period.

Administration officials initially blamed a high volume of interest from ordinary Americans for the frozen screens that many people encountered. Since then, they have also acknowledged problems with software and some elements of the system's design.

The officials said technology experts from inside and outside the government are being brought in to work on the glitches, though they did not say how many workers were being added.

Officials did say staffing has been increased at call centres by about 50 per cent. As problems persist on the federally run website, the administration is encouraging more people to sign up for insurance over the phone.

The officials would not discuss the health insurance rollout by name and were granted anonymity.

Despite the widespread problems, the White House has yet to fully explain what went wrong with the online system consumers were supposed to use to sign up for coverage.

Interest in the insurance markets appears to continue to be high. Officials said about 19 million people have visited HealthCare.gov as of Friday night.

Story continues

Americans seeking health coverage through the legislation must fill out applications before selecting a specific plan. The forms require personal information, including income figures that are used to calculate any subsidies the applicant may qualify for. More than one person can be included on an application.

An internal memo obtained by The Associated Press showed that the administration projected nearly a half million people would enrol for the insurance markets during the first month.

Officials say they expect enrollments to be heavier toward the end of the six-month sign up window.

Problems with the rollout were largely overshadowed by Republican efforts to force changes to the health care law in exchange for funding the government. That effort failed and the government reopened last week with ""Obamacare"" intact.

They may find they're not insured after all.

HealthCare.gov, the federal online portal for health-insurance shopping in more than 30 states, has improved after more than a month of intense fixes, and enrollment is accelerating. But insurance companies are still getting information on their would-be customers that is garbled and incomplete, and in some cases they are getting no information at all. President Barack Obama's administration is scrambling to repair the faulty system, but scant time remains until the Dec. 23 deadline for consumers to choose a health plan that will be in place Jan. 1.

The result could be an untold number of consumers remaining uninsured despite completing the enrollment process -- another embarrassing chapter in the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature health care reform law.

The Obama administration insists the enrollment glitches will be fixed in time to prevent any troubles next month, but won't disclose the extent of the problem. Nor will it guarantee that any patients who fall victim to these problems won't be exposed to medical bills if they get sick or injured.

""I doubt very seriously the insurance company or the government is going to say, 'Oh, don't worry, We'll take care of it.' I think that's going to fall solely on the patient,"" said Reid Blackwelder, a doctor in Kingsport, Tenn., who is president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. ""I wouldn't count on anybody else jumping in and bailing everybody out.""

In an unusual joint press release on Wednesday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the largest national trade groups for insurers, America's Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, emphasized their collaboration in addressing the problem. “Ensuring that all Americans who need coverage are properly enrolled is a top priority for all of us. We are working together closely to resolve back-end issues between health plans and HealthCare.gov,"" the statement said. ""We will report on our progress.”

Insurance companies could smooth over difficulties during the first month of new coverage by paying the expenses of people who believed they were enrolled. But that would subject the companies to potentially big costs for patients who get expensive services without having yet paid a premium, or who may not be their customers at all.

Moreover, insurers may be reluctant to bear the brunt of another technical failure after having already shouldered responsibility for fixing other Obamacare problems.

""You'd be counting on the goodwill of the insurance company. I'm not sure how long that's going to last,"" said Leslie Norwalk, who was a senior official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President George W. Bush and is now strategic counsel at Epstein Becker Green in Washington.

Patients who show up at a doctor's office, hospital, pharmacy or elsewhere without insurance cards in hand will have to rely on the kindness of those providers, Timothy Jost, a professor at Washington & Lee University School of Law in Lexington, Va., wrote in an email.

""It is likely that there will be problems, probably a lot of them, with confirming coverage, but providers are used to dealing with insurer screw-ups and hopefully will be patient,"" Jost wrote.

HealthCare.gov users who go through the enrollment process to the end are prompted to connect with their new health insurance provider to make payments, which are due Dec. 31 for coverage that begins in January. Consumers who don't take action or believe they can wait for a bill from their insurance company could find themselves in the lurch next month, especially if the company has no record of their enrollment because of the technical problems.

The White House says it is incumbent on individuals to double-check that they have coverage.

""If consumers are not sure if they are enrolled, they should call our customer call center or the insurer of their choice so that they can be sure they’re covered by Jan. 1,"" White House press secretary Jay Carney said Monday. The administration is reaching out by telephone and email to consumers who have begun or submitted applications via HealthCare.gov, in order to advise them of the steps they must take to confirm their enrollments.

Insurance companies receive daily uploads of data about new enrollees. Despite progress since Obamacare marketplaces launched on Oct. 1, as many as one-third of enrollments submitted through the federal system contain errors, The Washington Post reported on Monday.

The administration says that error rate isn't accurate, but won't reveal how many of the submissions -- called 834 forms -- are incorrect. The White House maintains that most of the problems have already been fixed and that the rest will be resolved in time to prevent hardships next month.

The George W. Bush administration faced a similar dilemma in January 2006, when the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit launched. Enrollees across the country visited drugstores only to find their benefits weren't in place.

""That was a point of crisis because every one of those became a story,"" said Michael Leavitt, who was Bush's secretary of Health and Human Services at the time.

A frenzied effort to guarantee patients' access to medications followed, while the Bush administration worked to correct the technical bugs, said Leavitt, now chairman of Salt Lake City-based Leavitt Partners, a consulting firm that has advised states on ACA implementation. ""It became our problem with the system, not the consumer's problem,"" Leavitt said.

The Obama administration likewise needs to protect patients, Leavitt said.

""The federal government caused this, and they're the ones who are going to have to take responsibility for it,"" he said. ""There's an obligation to make certain that people have not been seriously disadvantaged in their health by this.""

Unlike during the Medicare Part D snafu, the Obama administration has no funding stream to tap to pay for medical expenses incurred by patients who encounter problems. Nevertheless, Leavitt predicted his successor, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, would take unilateral action to avoid a backlash, as the administration has on previous occasions.

""The secretary of health does not lack authority in this situation,"" he said. ""I can't tell you the exact authority with which she would act, but you just look at the number of things they've already deferred and the way they've found flexibility, they're going find the authority.""

Software and hardware upgrades put in place since late October have been effective, said Jeffrey Zients, the Obama aide overseeing the repair effort to the online portal for health insurance enrollment in more than 30 states.

""HealthCare.gov on Dec. 1 is night and day from where it was on Oct. 1,"" when the health insurance exchanges debuted, Zients said during a conference call with reporters Sunday. ""While we still have work to do, we've made significant progress with HealthCare.gov working smoothly for the vast majority of consumers."" The website can now handle 50,000 users at a time, which was the original goal, and 800,000 visitors a day, he said.

The early consumer experience of Obamacare's health insurance exchanges was characterized by crashes, error messages, long wait times and faulty information, threatening the rollout of Obama's signature domestic policy achievement.

A crush of consumers scrambling to get health insurance for the new year could test the rigor of the administration's fixes, and Zients said traffic to HealthCare.gov spiked over the Thanksgiving holiday compared a typical weekend, although he didn't provide figures.

Poor enrollment during the first month, when only about 106,000 people were able to enroll in private insurance via the exchanges, left the administration far from the 7 million projected to sign up by the end of the enrollment period on March 31. During that same time period, 1.5 million people had completed applications and more than 200,000 were pending, suggesting that demand for coverage is high.

Almost 20,000 people signed up using HealthCare.gov between Nov. 24 and Nov. 26, the most so far in a three-day stretch, The New York Times reported Friday. And enrollment in some state-run health insurance exchanges, such as those in California, Kentucky, New York and Washington state, accelerated during November.

Health insurance consumers who failed to get through the application and enrollment process during the first two months of the sign-up period will be the administration's first targets, Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said during the Sunday conference call.

""While we certainly want to and will invite new consumers into the site, our focus is on making sure that those who have tried to enroll in the past several weeks are able to successfully complete that process,"" Bataille said.

A large majority of visitors to HealthCare.gov should now be able to submit an application for health coverage and enroll into a plan online, Bataille said. ""About five weeks ago, we were seeing only about 30 percent of consumers with information on hand able to complete the application successfully online. Today, we're now more in the zone of about 80 percent of users being able to do that same process successfully,"" she said.

The remaining consumers can still use alternate methods to enroll, such as the health insurance exchanges' telephone hotline, Bataille said. And people can purchase health plans directly from insurers or from agents and brokers, although tax credits to cut the cost of coverage are available only via the exchanges in most cases. The administration is testing a system that would let people apply for tax credits directly through 16 insurers in Florida, Ohio and Texas, and the early results are ""encouraging,"" Bataille said.

In late October, the White House placed Zients in charge of the overhaul effort, and the Department of Health and Human Services appointed Quality Software Services Inc., a unit of the health insurance company UnitedHealth Group that is one of the exchanges' main architects, as lead contractor. Since that time, administration officials have maintained that HealthCare.gov would work for most users by the end of November.

Zients said that goal has been met and emphasized that work on improving the website and its underlying technology will continue through March. The team repairing HealthCare.gov made more than 400 software fixes and upgraded the hardware supporting the system using a ""punch list"" of identified problems.

""Over the last five weeks, we've made substantial progress working through the punch list. We've executed hundreds of software fixes and hardware upgrades and the site is now stable and operating at its intended capacity with greatly improved performance,"" Zients said.

HealthCare.gov's failure rate has dropped from about 6 percent in October to 0.75 percent as of Friday, according to a report issued by the Department of Health and Human Services on Sunday. The website was up and running 95 percent of the time as of Saturday, not counting scheduled maintenance, like an 11-hour period this weekend when applications and enrollments were offline -- an improvement from a low of 43 percent two months ago, the report says.

Some problems remain unresolved and consumers and health insurance companies will still face difficulties, Bataille said. ""With any web project, there is not a magic moment but a process of continual improvement over time and we will continue to make enhances in the days, weeks and months ahead,"" she said.

Health insurance companies have reported receiving incorrect information about their new customers since the beginning of the enrollment period and the administration is still working to fix these issues. Problems with the data HealthCare.gov sends to insurance issuers were a major part of the administration's push over recent says, Bataille said.

Whether these flaws have been adequately addressed -- and whether consumers can be confident their enrollments are complete and their coverage will be effective next month -- won't be fully clear until more people sign up, Bataille said.

""We need to see increased volumes of traffic and transactions, which we anticipate seeing over the course of the weekdays, to make sure that we get information from issuers and see the success rates they are having with the fixes put in place this week,"" Bataille said.

Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius will appear before House panel on Wednesday

Despite four tough weeks since ACA roll out%2C Sebelius maintains Obama%27s %22full confidence%22

Sebelius%27 allies say she is steeled for tough fight with GOP

WASHINGTON — Kathleen Sebelius is on the hot seat as the Obama administration battles to rebound from a problem-plagued rollout of the Affordable Care Act, but friends of the embattled Health and Human Services secretary say it's a mistake to count her out.

In recent days, Sebelius has been lampooned by Saturday Night Live and is facing calls from several Republicans to step down because of the bungled roll out of the online exchange.

Sebelius is no stranger to difficult fights. During her time as governor in the deep red state of Kansas, she had high-profile battles with state GOP lawmakers over her controversial decision to prevent the expansion of a coal plant and her halting of the merger of two of the region's largest health care providers.

Despite battles with Republicans on environmental issues, education and health policy during her two terms as governor and as Kansas insurance commissioner, she left office with an approval rating that hovered near 60%.

""She has been successful because she is level-headed,"" said Raj Goyle, a former Democratic lawmaker in the Kansas Legislature who worked closely with Sebelius when she was governor. ""She's unflappable.""

But as Sebelius prepares to appear before a House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday to discuss problems with the exchange, she faces the most difficult battle of her career.

Republicans have only stepped up their criticism of her in recent days, seizing on some of her missteps.

Last week, at an event to tout the Affordable Care Act in Phoenix, she set off a fresh round of GOP criticism after she said those calling for her resignation were ""people who I don't work for and who do not want this program to work in the first place.""

Earlier this month, she struggled in an interview on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart to explain the problems with the balky website, which the White House says will be running at full speed by the end of November. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., this week called Sebelius ""the laughingstock of America.""

Sen. Pat Roberts, a Republican from her home state of Kansas who stood by her side more than four years ago at a White House ceremony when President Obama announced her nomination, was the first lawmaker to call for her resignation.

Todd Tiahrt, a former GOP congressman from Kansas, said that the call for Sebelius' ouster is merited.

""Look at a parallel situation in the private sector of a CEO being hired by a board of directors to implement something that they have heavily invested in,"" Tiahrt said. ""If it comes to a disaster, I would venture to guess that the CEO would immediately be withdrawn and fired. ""

Obama, who will head to Boston on Wednesday to discuss the problems with health care implementation while she is being grilled, has stood by Sebelius. The two have long had a warm relationship dating back to his first presidential campaign, where she was an early backer of his run for the White House. Sebelius was also under consideration to be his running mate. White House spokesman Jay Carney has said that Sebelius maintains the president's ""full confidence.""

It's not the first time that Obama has stood by Sebelius at a tough moment. Earlier this year, the president appeared to publicly signal support for Sebelius after she drew Republican fire for asking health industry officials to make donations to help with the effort to implement the ACA.

Soon after reports of the solicitation became public, the president invited Sebelius to join him for one of his regular weekend golf outings — an invitation he has only extended to a handful of women during his presidency.

Lawmakers outside of Washington have also come to Sebelius' defense. Gov. Steve Beshear, the Democratic governor of Kentucky, has become one of her most impassioned defenders.

""It is so typical of Washington, D.C., that when something goes wrong the first thing that the critics do is yell for somebody's firing or yell for somebody's scalp,"" Beshear said.

Forgotten in all the criticism, Beshear said, is that there were also problems with the rollout of Medicare in 1960s and more recently with implementation of the prescription drug benefit known as Medicare Part D. In time, kinks were worked out and the programs remain popular.

During her time in Kansas, Sebelius earned a reputation nationally of being a consensus-builder, but she had her tough battles with Republicans, said Bob Beatty, a political scientist at the Washburn University in Kansas.

""In Kansas, for a Democrat to win, you have to have charisma,"" Beatty said. ""But her charisma was not loud in the (New Jersey Gov.) Chris Christie sense. Sebelius' charisma came from the ability to ensure voters that she was competent. Perhaps that quieter charisma doesn't play as well in the face of a national problem like this one.""

In 2007, while serving as governor of Kansas, she made the unprecedented decision to deny a permit for the expansion of a coal power plant based in part on concerns about climate change, kicking off a multiyear battle with the GOP-controlled legislature.

That same year she ruffled Republicans' feathers when she plainly stated after a devastating tornado all but destroyed the small town of Greensburg, Kan., that the recovery response was slow because vital National Guard equipment was tied up by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Perhaps the moment in her political career most analogous to the battle she now faces was one that dates back to her time as Kansas' insurance commissioner.

As the state's top insurance regulator in 2002, she blocked a controversial merger between two health-insurance providers. The for-profit company, Anthem, wanted to take over Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas, the state's non-profit entity that covered roughly 45% of Kansans.

For Anthem, the private company based in Indiana, the merger would have allowed them to spread its risk over a much broader pool of patients. For Blue Cross, the takeover would mean that it wouldn't have to insure everybody, including risky people with bad health, and could be more competitive.

Goyle said conventional wisdom at the time dictated that she approve the merger. But Sebelius, he said, ultimately looked past the political noise and led a deliberative process in which she followed the facts to the ultimate conclusion that the merger would be bad for Kansans.

The episode, Goyle said, underscores why he believes she will ultimately emerge from the controversy over the problems with the online exchange.

""The Blue Cross-Anthem situation is really Exhibit A of her ability to stay focused on the facts and the end goal,"" Goyle said. ""I do not believe for one second that she's worried about the politics or that she thinks about her own standing."""

Marilyn Tavenner, head of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, testified Tuesday before the House Ways and Means Committee. At the top of the hearing, she apologized for the failures of the main ObamaCare website and vowed to fix them.

But, raising more questions about the administration's transparency on the project, she declined to cite enrollment numbers. She did not claim, as Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius recently did, that officials simply do not have those numbers -- rather, she said a ""decision"" was made to release them in mid-November.

""We made the decision that we were not releasing the numbers until mid-November,"" she said.

Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., asked again whether she had any idea what the numbers are.

More On This...

Her answer was the same.

""I'll take that as you don't want to answer the question,"" Nunes said.

Earlier in the hearing, Tavenner tried to downplay expectations. Facing ongoing problems with the enrollment website, Tavenner told Congress that ""we expect the initial numbers to be small.""

An internal memo obtained by The Associated Press shows that the administration expected nearly 500,000 people to gain coverage just in October, the program's first month. If the administration is short of that target, it is unclear by how much.

Tavenner, though, vowed to fix the troubled exchange website by the end of November.

""To the millions who have attempted to use HealthCare.gov to shop and enroll in health care coverage, I want to apologize to you that the website has not worked as well as it should,"" she said. ""We know how desperately you need affordable coverage. I want to assure you that HealthCare.gov can and will be fixed.""

The apology would appear to be the first by an administration official.

Tavenner's testimony precedes that of Sebelius, who is expected to appear before a separate House committee on Wednesday. As Tavenner testified, calls were mounting from Republicans for Sebelius to resign.

Significantly, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., speaking on the Senate floor, called Tuesday for Sebelius' resignation. Alexander is the top Republican on the Senate health panel.

""Mr. President, at some point there has to be accountability. Expecting this secretary to be able to fix what she hasn't been able to fix during the last three-and-a-half years is unrealistic,"" he said. ""It's throwing good money after bad. It's time for her to resign -- someone else to take charge.""

In written testimony released ahead of Wednesday's hearing, Sebelius vowed to improve the website and said the consumer experience to date is ""not acceptable."" But she defended the law itself and said extensive work and testing is being done.

""We are working to ensure consumers' interaction with HealthCare.gov is a positive one, and that the Affordable Care Act fully delivers on its promise,"" she said in the prepared remarks.

Republicans were also voicing concern Tuesday about Americans being kicked off their current health plans, and newly uncovered documents that show the administration anticipated millions might lose their current coverage and be sent into different plans -- despite pledges to the contrary from the White House.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/14/insurance-cancellations-just-beginning,2013-11-14 00:00:00,['John Nolte'],CBO: Insurance Cancellations Just Beginning,"Dozens of times (that we know of) over his campaign to pass ObamaCare and to win re-election, President Obama lied to the American people about being able to keep the health insurance they like. But that lie has only been replaced with another: the lie that these cancellations will be limited to the 5% of Americans in the individual marketplace — when the truth is that these cancellations have only just begun.

Over at National Review, in a piece appropriately titled “Lying About Lies,” Michael Tanner reports that the same ObamaCare formula currently wiping out the individual market is about to rain hell on the employer-based market. The result will be that tens of millions of policies will be wiped out.

This is a secret that is and always has been hiding in plain sight.

As far back as last March, the media dutifully reported that the CBO reported that these cancellations were coming. So the media knew Obama was lying during the campaign but never said a word to spread this truth — oh, except to call Mitt Romney a liar for telling the truth.

All these Democrats and members of the elite media now pretending they don’t or didn’t know… Please.

Just as the media knew Obama was lying about people in the individual market being able to keep their insurance, the media also know that the same apocalypse looms for the employer-based market. It is not conservatives making this estimate, it is the Congressional Budget Office. [emphasis mine]

But the same conditions that are causing the cancellation of individual policies will eventually result in the cancellation of millions of employment-based policies as well. The only reason that hasn’t happened yet is that the employer mandate was postponed for a year, so employer plans don’t yet have to be ACA-compliant. But they will. Even the Congressional Budget Office estimates that as many as 20 million workers will lose their current employer-sponsored plans. Combine that with those losing individual plans, and more than 30 million Americans cannot keep their current insurance.

ObamaCare’s latest trick is the “junk plan hustle.” Over and over, we keep hearing about how our White House overlords are doing Americans a favor by canceling the insurance they like and replacing it with “appropriate” health plans. But most of those plans are not junk plans. That is just another lie the White House is telling, and the media are letting them get away with it.

The media know the White House is lying about this junk plan nonsense because the ObamaCare guidelines for what isn’t a “junk plan” only includes 2% of the policies currently in existence.

According to HealthPocket, a health-insurance consulting firm, fewer than 2 percent of individual plans on offer today meet all ACA requirements. The most frequent reason for noncompliance was not a failure to cover hospitalization, as the administration has suggested, but not providing pediatric care, including vision and dental care for children. A worthwhile benefit, perhaps, but if you are childless, it’s hard to see how lacking such a benefit makes your policy subpar.

This is why other serious think tanks believe that before this nightmare is over, up to 93 million people could lose the insurance Obama promised they could keep.

In order to buy time, Obama, Democrats, and the media are trying to con the American people into believing that the rolling ObamaCare catastrophe is compartmentalized to just 5% of the population. This conspiracy of silence is all about trying to contain through a lie of omission what is a legitimate reason for the public to panic as soon as they realize that … they are next.

Obama is not sorry for lying. And the media are not sorry for covering up that lie for three years.

The phase we are in now is nothing more than a 2.0 version of that exact same lie.

http://news.yahoo.com/gops-obamacare-dream-come-true-just-had-way-145200598.html,,[],"For the GOP's Obamacare Dream to Come True, It Just Had to Get Out of the Way","Obamacare has taken a sudden and spectacular dive in public opinion, according to a new poll from Gallup. Capitol Hill Democrats are splintering, regularly undermining President Obama's tacit demand that they stay united in the bill's defense. What the party wouldn't give for it to be one month ago.

On this day in October the roles were flipped. The Obamacare website was a mess and there were reports of people losing their existing coverage, but the big story was the shutdown. Democrats stood quietly, arm-in-arm, watching the Republican Party trip all over itself, Three Stooges-style. Now, the alliterative mantra of ""Democrats in disarray"" is back, and the Republicans are starting to lock arms.

The news from Gallup is particularly bad for the Affordable Care Act. Late last month, opinion of the bill was about evenly split, with 44 percent of Americans supporting it and 47 percent opposing — a 3-point difference. Since, that difference has quintupled, with only 40 percent of the country supporting the bill and 55 percent opposing. ""Currently, 73% of Democrats, 39% of independents, and 8% of Republicans approve of the healthcare law,"" Gallup writes, noting the particularly bad news: opinion has dropped among all parties, including Democrats. Meanwhile, the number of people saying that health care is the country's biggest problem has gone up 7 points since last month — though ""dissatisfaction with government"" continues to lead the way.

RELATED: How Democrats Are Trying to Fix, But Not Criticize, Obamacare

MSNBC's Benjy Sarlin points out that Obama has regularly seen stiff opposition to his policy proposals. But Obamacare, for several reasons, poses a much more severe risk.

This time the challenge is much more tangible. Either the exchange works or it doesn’t. Either people getting cancellation notices can find acceptable, affordable coverage or they can’t. There’s no messaging substitute for success on either front.

Story continues

So Democrats, who The Daily Beast' Michael Tomasky notes aren't exactly known for holding strong in the face of adversity, are starting to go sideways. Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu introduced a bill that would allow people to keep their existing health care plans. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin has announced his support for that bill, telling Morning Joe that Obamacare has ""more than a roll-out problem. There is a product problem."" Landrieu faces a difficult reelection challenge next year, and Manchin represents an increasingly conservative state, but they aren't the only ones to bail. Even party-line adherents like California Sen. Dianne Feinstein are calling for some sort of legislative response.

We noted earlier this week why such a fix is tricky, threatening the economics that are supposed to make Obamacare work for the private sector. At New York, Jonathan Chait outlines why such changes are tricky. But politics has a habit of getting in the way of (both parties') best-laid plans. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told participants in The Atlantic's Washington Ideas Forum on Thursday morning that she expected an announcement from the president in support of a fix at some point today.

RELATED: Some Democrats Back Delay of Obamacare Mandate, Enrollment May Be Extended

Michigan Rep. Fred Upton has introduced a bill in the House that, like Landrieu's, would allow people to keep their plans, but only for a period of two years. If both pass, there could be a conference committee to work out a compromise. The Republicans could say that they'd helped Americans worried about coverage — but, as The Atlantic's Molly Ball points out, inadvertently take ownership over the program, perhaps even saving it from political backlash. It's not a possibility Democrats are embracing: Pelosi called the Upton vote the 46th vote for repeal, and the administration opposes the Upton bill, saying that it undermines ""the central promise of the Affordable Care Act.""

In general, though, the Republicans are just trying to clear all of their members from the tracks as the Obamacare train rumbles haphazardly along. Politico suggests that the party found ""political gold"" in the issue — as long as it holds its natural inclination to overreach in check.

RELATED: How Real Live Young People Feel About the Obamacare Outreach Effort

They will pass Obamacare-related bills when opportunities arise — like [Upton's] this week — but Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio) neatly encapsulated the party’s emerging strategy: “We should be just like a doctor and do no harm.” “Obamacare is the gift that keeps on giving,” a senior House aide said on condition of anonymity. “We just need to keep out of the way.”

If that's the strategy, this bit of news from the Washington Examiner can't be welcome: ""Ted Cruz previews new plan to repeal and replace Obamacare."" Cruz, of course, initiated the government shutdown at the beginning of October that put the Republicans on defense for several weeks and deeply undermined their popularity. The party greatly prefers the position they're in this month.

• The Two Scenarios That Would Have Improved the Obamacare Launch"
http://news.yahoo.com/white-house-tech-expert-gets-subpoena-testify-healthcare-014234537.html,,[],White House tech expert gets subpoena to testify on HealthCare.gov,"By Roberta Rampton WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee issued a subpoena on Friday to compel Todd Park, the chief technology officer at the White House, to testify at a hearing next week about what went wrong with the Obamacare website. The White House called the subpoena ""unfortunate and unnecessary"" and said that Park was busy fixing the website. The White House earlier had said he was willing to appear voluntarily in December. ""We had hoped the committee would work with us to find an alternative date to give Todd time to focus on the immediate task at hand: getting the website fixed,"" said Rick Weiss, a spokesman for the White House Office of Science and Technology. ""We are reviewing the subpoena and will respond as appropriate,"" Weiss said. Darrell Issa, the California Republican who chairs the committee, told Park that he was the only administration witness at the November 13 hearing who was ""unwilling to appear voluntarily"" and noted that he had taken time out to give an interview to the New York Times in early October. ""Millions of Americans have lost their health insurance,"" Issa wrote in a letter to Park. ""They deserve your sworn testimony before their elected representatives about what went wrong - not simply the media outlets that White House officials have deemed an appropriate use of your time,"" he said. PARK: 'NOT GOING ANYWHERE' The HealthCare.gov website, which launched October 1, was meant to be an easy way for Americans to shop for health insurance and see whether they were eligible for subsidies under President Barack Obama's signature healthcare program. But it has been plagued by myriad technical woes, and contractors and outside experts have been working around the clock to try to make it work by the end of November so that Americans have enough time to sign up for insurance before deadlines in the law. On Friday, Jeffrey Zients, the White House official charged to oversee the fixes, said the website is improving but is still ""a long way from where it needs to be. A successful healthcare IT developer before joining the Obama administration, Park has been part of the scramble to repair the website. Earlier on Friday, the White House had scolded Issa for failing to justify why the hearing with Park could not be slated for December. ""There will be ample time to analyze why the technology behind the website did not perform well initially, and whether there are any lessons learned for federal IT acquisition policy that Congress may want to address,"" said Donna Pignatelli, assistant director for legislative affairs for the Office of Science and Technology Policy in a letter to Issa. ""Mr. Park is not going anywhere,"" Pigantelli had said. (Additional reporting By Karey Van Hall; Editing by Ken Wills)"
http://news.yahoo.com/builders-obamas-health-website-saw-red-flags-070429400.html,,[],Builders of Obama's health website saw red flags,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Crammed into conference rooms with pizza for dinner, some programmers building the Obama administration's showcase health insurance website were growing increasingly stressed. Some worked past 10 p.m., energy drinks in hand. Others rewrote computer code over and over to meet what they considered last-minute requests for changes from the government or other contractors.

As questions mount over the website's failure, insider interviews and a review of technical specifications by The Associated Press found a mind-numbingly complex system put together by harried programmers who pushed out a final product that congressional investigators said was tested by the government and not private developers with more expertise.

Meanwhile, the White House said that President Barack Obama's longtime adviser Jeffrey Zients will provide management advice to help fix the system. White House press secretary Jay Carney says Zients will be on a short-term assignment at the Health and Human Services Department before he's due to take over as director of Obama's National Economic Council Jan. 1.

Carney cited Zients' expertise as a longtime management consultant and his ""proven track record"" since coming to the White House in 2009, both as interim budget director and as chief performance officer, when he headed an effort to streamline government and cut costs. ""We're engaged in an all-out effort to improve the online experience,"" Carney said.

This is not the first time Obama has turned to Zients for help solving a major problem. In the 2009, after far more drivers than anticipated signed up for the Cash for Clunkers program that promised rebates to people who traded in their old cars for more fuel-efficient vehicles, Obama assigned Zients, his deputy budget director at the time, to help eliminate the backlog.

When the same thing happened with sign-ups for an updated version of the GI Bill, one designed to help the 9/11 generation of veterans get a college education, Obama again turned to Zients.

Story continues

""He's not going to be looking under the hood and tell you 'I can fix the coding, I can fix it,'"" Kenneth Baer, who was a senior adviser to Zients at the budget office, said of Zients' newest assignment. ""His skill is going to be how to identify challenges, prioritize what solutions need to be done next, assessing what talent is already available and then how to motivate them to do that job as quickly and as ably as possible.""

Aneesh Chopra, who was Obama's chief technology officer, said Zients is extremely skilled in figuring things out from a management perspective.

""If I was confident this issue would be resolved before his participation, I am doubly so now,"" said Chopra, who also worked with Zients at the Advisory Board Co., one of two business advisory firms where Zients held top posts. ""Jeff's track record is really a relentless focus on execution.""

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a post on HealthCare.gov that her agency is also bringing in more experts and specialists from government and industry, including top Silicon Valley companies.

""This new infusion of talent will bring a powerful array of subject matter expertise and skills, including extensive experience scaling major IT systems,"" she said. ""This effort is being marshaled as part of a cross-functional team that is working aggressively to diagnose parts of HealthCare.gov that are experiencing problems, learn from successful states, prioritize issues, and fix them.""

Project developers for the health care website who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity — because they feared they would otherwise be fired — said they raised doubts among themselves whether the website could be ready in time. They complained openly to each other about what they considered tight and unrealistic deadlines. One was nearly brought to tears over the stress of finishing on time, one developer said. Website builders saw red flags for months.

A review of internal architectural diagrams obtained by the AP revealed the system's complexity. Insurance applicants have a host of personal information verified, including income and immigration status. The system connects to other federal computer networks, including ones at the Social Security Administration, IRS, Veterans Administration, Office of Personnel Management and the Peace Corps.

Obama on Monday acknowledged technical problems that he described as ""kinks in the system."" But in remarks at a Rose Garden event, Obama offered no explanation for the failure except to note that high traffic to the website caused some of the slowdowns. He said it had been visited nearly 20 million times — fewer monthly visits so far than many commercial websites, such as PayPal, AOL, Wikipedia or Pinterest.

""The problem has been that the website that's supposed to make it easy to apply for and purchase the insurance is not working the way it should for everybody,"" Obama said. ""There's no sugarcoating it. The website has been too slow. People have been getting stuck during the application process. And I think it's fair to say that nobody is more frustrated by that than I am.""

The online system was envisioned as a simple way for people without health insurance to comparison-shop among competing plans offered in their state, pick their preferred level of coverage and cost and sign up. For many, it's not worked out that way so far.

Just weeks before the launch of HealthCare.gov on Oct. 1, one programmer said, colleagues huddled in conference rooms trying to patch ""bugs,"" or deficiencies in computer code. Unresolved problems led to visitors experiencing cryptic error messages or enduring long waits trying to sign up.

Congressional investigators have concluded that the government's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, not private software developers, tested the exchange's computer systems during the final weeks. That task, known as integration testing, is usually handled by software companies because it ferrets out problems before the public sees the final product.

The government spent at least $394 million in contracts to build the federal health care exchange and the data hub. Those contracts included major awards to Virginia-based CGI Federal Inc., Maryland-based Quality Software Services Inc. and Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.

CGI Federal said in a statement Monday it was working with the government and other contractors ""around the clock"" to improve the system, which it called ""complex, ambitious and unprecedented.""

The schematics from late 2012 show how officials designated a ""data services hub"" — a traffic cop for managing information — in lieu of a design that would have allowed state exchanges to connect directly to government servers when verifying an applicant's information. On Sunday, the Health and Human Services Department said the data hub was working but not meeting public expectations: ""We are committed to doing better.""

Administration officials so far have refused to say how many people actually have managed to enroll in insurance during the three weeks since the new marketplaces became available. Without enrollment numbers, it's impossible to know whether the program is on track to reach projections from the Congressional Budget Office that 7 million people would gain coverage during the first year the exchanges were available.

Instead, officials have selectively cited figures that put the insurance exchanges in a positive light. They say more than 19 million people have logged on to the federal website and nearly 500,000 have filled out applications for insurance through both the federal and state-run sites.

The flood of computer problems since the website went online has been deeply embarrassing for the White House. The snags have called into question whether the administration is capable of implementing the complex policy and why senior administration officials — including the president — appear to have been unaware of the scope of the problems when the exchange sites opened.

Even as the president spoke at the Rose Garden, more problems were coming to light. The administration acknowledged that a planned upgrade to the website had been postponed indefinitely and that online Spanish-language signups would remain unavailable, despite a promise to Hispanic groups that the capability would start this week. And the government tweaked the website's home page so visitors can now view phone numbers to apply the old-fashioned way or window-shop for insurance rates without registering first.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee was expected to conduct an oversight hearing Thursday, probably without Sebelius testifying. She could testify on Capitol Hill on the subject as early as next week.

Uninsured Americans have until about mid-February to sign up for coverage if they are to meet the law's requirement that they be insured by the end of March. If they don't, they will face a penalty. The administration says it's working to address the timing issue to provide more flexibility.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., plans to introduce legislation to delay that requirement because: ""It's not fair to punish people for not buying something that's not available,"" Rubio told ""CBS This Morning"" on Tuesday.

Citing the website problems, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., also urged the White House to extend the open enrollment period past March 31, 2014.

In a letter Tuesday to Obama, Shaheen suggested extending open enrollment to ""provide greater flexibility for the American people seeking to access health insurance,"" according to an emailed statement from her office. Shaheen also asked the White House to clarify how the ""individual responsibility penalty will be administered and enforced"" in light of the website's difficulties.

On Monday, the White House advised people frustrated by the online tangle that they can enroll by calling 1-800-318-2596 in a process that should take 25 minutes for an individual or 45 minutes for a family. Assistance is also available in communities from helpers who can be found at LocalHelp.HealthCare.gov.

He Left The Times In']","Janet Napolitano, Homeland Security chief, to head UC","Janet Napolitano, the U.S. secretary of Homeland Security and former governor of Arizona, is being named as the next president of the University of California system, in an unusual choice that brings a national-level politician to a position usually held by an academic, The Times has learned. Her appointment also means the 10-campus system will be headed by a woman for the first time in its 145-year history.

Napolitano’s nomination by a committee of UC regents came after a secretive process that insiders said focused on her early as a high-profile, although untraditional, candidate who has led large public agencies and shown a strong interest in improving education.

UC officials believe that her Cabinet experiences –- which include helping to lead responses to hurricanes and tornadoes and overseeing some anti-terrorism measures -- will help UC administer its federal energy and nuclear weapons labs and aid its federally funded research in medicine and other areas.

“While some may consider her to be an unconventional choice, Secretary Napolitano is without a doubt the right person at the right time to lead this incredible university,” Sherry Lansing, the regent and former film industry executive who headed the search committee, said in a statement being released Friday. “She will bring fresh eyes and a new sensibility -- not only to UC, but to all of California. She will stand as a vigorous advocate for faculty, students and staff at a time when great changes in our state, and across the globe, are presenting as many opportunities as challenges.”

Napolitano, who is a Democrat, was appointed by former President Clinton as the U.S. attorney in Arizona and then won elections as state attorney general and twice as governor, a position she held from 2003 to 2009. President Obama then named her to lead Homeland Security, an agency with an annual $60-billion budget and 240,000 employees.

She has been a strong voice in favor of immigration reform that would provide a path to citizenship for those in the country illegally, a stance that has angered some Republicans who contend she has not done enough to secure the nation’s borders.

TALK BACK: Is Janet Napolitano a good choice for UC president?

A source close to Napolitano, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said that Napolitano deliberated for a long time after the executive search firm hired by UC quietly contacted her.

“I think she loves working for President Obama and serving the American people, but at the same time, this is a unique opportunity,” he said. Napolitano knows “UC is probably the premier institution in the country. She is motivated by the fact that being a part of UC, she will be a part of educating future leaders of tomorrow and be part of a state that sets so much of the agenda nationally.”

Napolitano, 55, is no stranger to California colleges since she attended Santa Clara University and was its first woman valedictorian before earning her law degree at University of Virginia. Her father was dean of the University of New Mexico School of Medicine, a family connection that UC regents also liked since they oversee medical centers. In Arizona, she helped to enact plans to provide full-day kindergarten and to renovate university buildings, winning fans among educators.

The Napolitano friend insisted that nothing was pushing her out of Washington now, although the Senate’s recently approved compromise plan on immigration faces an uncertain fate in the Republican-controlled House.

REACTION: Obama lauds UC’s choice of Napolitano

The secretary faced some controversy in Congress when critics alleged the Boston Marathon bombings, reportedly perpetrated by ethnic Chechens from Russia who had been granted political asylum, exposed shortcomings in security.

The UC regents are expected to approve her nomination as UC’s 20th president on Thursday during a meeting in San Francisco. Napolitano is expected to take up the UC reins some time in September, officials said.

UC has an annual budget of $24 billion, 230,000 students, 191,000 faculty and staff, five medical centers and three national laboratories.

Her proposed salary has not been released, pending discussions among the regents. But since her Cabinet salary of about $200,000 is about a third of the annual $591,000 that current UC president Mark G. Yudof makes, the regents presumably will be able to avoid a potential furor and not feel pressured to give her a big pay raise over Yudof’s.

Yudof, a former top administrator at state universities in Texas and Minnesota, will step down after five years as UC president in late August, in part due to some health issues. Yudof, who plans to teach law at UC Berkeley, also has said it was a good time to leave as UC’s finances were improving and most tuitions are frozen, thanks to extra state tax revenues that are helping to reverse years of brutal budget cuts and fee hikes.

In an era of tight budgets, public universities are seeking leaders who can bargain as peers with governors and legislators and also impress alumni and parents. Napolitano will deal with Gov. Jerry Brown, who is a UC regent and has been pressing UC to move more quickly into online education and to improve graduation rates.

Robert Powell, the chairman of UC’s systemwide faculty Senate and who consulted on the UC search, said Napolitano stood out among the more than 300 potential candidates. She “has demonstrated an outstanding ability to deal with complex organizations under demanding circumstances,” he said.

Acknowledging that she will be a departure from UC’s traditions of having a president with strong records in campus administration or academic research, he stressed that her political skills will be important. “When she goes to Sacramento, clearly the conversations will be on a different plane,” he said.

As for any possible complaints that UC would be led by a Democratic politician, Powell noted that the regents’ search committee included Republicans who joined in the choice for Napolitano and that she won elections in a Republican state.

A switch from politics and the Cabinet to university leadership is not unheard of. Donna Shalala, secretary of Health and Human Services during the Clinton administration, became chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and is now president of the University of Miami. Former Indiana governor Mitch Daniels now heads Purdue University.

Napolitano, who is unmarried and has no children, underwent a mastectomy for breast cancer in 2000, just weeks before she addressed the Democratic National Convention. She has been mentioned as a possible nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court and as U.S. attorney general.

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-s-healthcare--fix--strictly-a-political-move-000041574.html,,[],"Obama's health care 'fix' strictly political move, experts say","At best, President Obama's proposed health care “fix” offers political protection for vulnerable lawmakers. That's because beyond giving insurance companies permission to continue offering individual health care plans that don't comply with the Affordable Care Act, the president's fix doesn't compel anyone to do anything.

So why even propose such a fix, and especially a remedy that, according insurance experts, could lead to more expensive premiums for the people the fix is supposed to help?

As Kaiser Family Foundation Vice President Larry Levitt explained to Yahoo News, the best ""fix"" supporters of the Affordable Care Act could offer is to simply let the current process play out.

""From the perspective of keeping the market stable and premiums down, a quicker transition to new coverage is the best approach,"" Levitt said. ""Any plan that allows individuals to keep their old policies will tend to raise costs and raise premiums.”

In other words, according to Levitt and other experts, Obama's proposed fix offers little in the way of actual help to consumers or even insurance providers.

What it does do is provide Obama (and by extension the Democrats in Congress) a scapegoat and a much-needed short-term political gain.

""This doesn't change anything other than force insurers to be the political flack jackets for the administration,"" an insurance industry insider told Buzzfeed. ""So now when we don't offer these policies the White House can say it's the insurers doing this and not being flexible.""

The president's proposal creates a number of challenges. For example, insurers are not actually required to restore canceled plans. And if consumers keep their less expensive plans, it will almost certainly drive up costs for those who are buying plans from the health care exchanges.

""If due to these changes fewer younger and healthier people choose to purchase coverage in the exchange, premiums will increase in the marketplace and there will be fewer choices for consumers,"" Karen Ignagni, chief executive of America's Health Insurance Plans, a leading organization of insurance providers, said in a statement.

Story continues

Levitt adds that it will be ""complex but not impossible"" for insurers to reverse course on canceled plans. But while that course is theoretically possible, the insurers have little incentive to reverse course and ""throw a wrench in the works in the bottom half of the 9th inning,"" as Levitt described it.

""It is unclear how, as a practical matter, the changes proposed today by the president can be put into effect,"" said Jim Donelon, president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and Louisiana Insurance commissioner. ""In many states, cancellation notices have already gone out to policyholders, and rates and plans have already been approved for 2014. Changing the rules through administrative action at this late date creates uncertainty and may not address the underlying issues.""

Regardless of whether the president's fix does anything to actually help consumers, you can almost certainly expect more political fixes to be offered before the January 2014 deadline for all Americans to be insured goes into effect.

Republicans in the House are gearing up to consider a bill by Fred Upton, R-Mich., that would allow insurers to continue to offer non-ACA compliant plans on a yearly basis, while a potential Democratic bill in the Senate would require insurers to continue these plans.

House Speaker John Boehner said he plans to go forward with a Friday vote on the Upton bill. When asked if Democrats in the House would propose their own legislative fix, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters, ""We'll do what we have to do.""

""My guess is that because the House and Senate proposals all go further in their own way, I would expect that they would stick around for awhile,"" Levitt said."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/26/even-in-hawaii-obama-cant-escape-troubled-state-health-insurance-exchanges/,2013-12-26 00:00:00,['Doug Mckelway'],"Even in Hawaii, Obama can't escape troubled state health insurance exchanges","The president may be vacationing in a tropical paradise, but there's no escaping the buffeting winds of troubled state health insurance exchanges, even in Hawaii.

For openers, the botched roll-out of the ObamaCare state exchange in Hawaii has hurt Democratic Gov. Neil Abercrombie's approval ratings: 51 percent of likely Democratic primary voters say they don't like the way he's doing his job.

Already out of a job is Coral Andrews, the executive director of Hawaii's state-run exchange. She submitted her resignation effective December 6 after only 257 people had signed up for health care a month into the roll out.

Hawaii's website contract was awarded to the same firm, CGI, that blew the national Healthcare.gov roll out. CGI won the Hawaii contract even after the state senate president warned the state exchange director not to hire the firm. CGI apparently also had botched Hawaii's tax website, costing Hawaiians $50 million to fix.

Hawaii is not alone. Oregon's website never has worked, despite that state receiving more exchange grant money than any others, except California and New York.

Oregon applicants are forced to fill out a 19-page paper form but that, too, has been problematic. Despite assurances that coverage would take effect January 1, late this month applicants began receiving robo-calls in which a voice told the applicant, ""If you have not heard from us by December 23rd, it is unlikely your application can be processed for January 1st insurance coverage.""

Oregonian Harold Stanton received one of those calls and is no longer sure whether his health care insurance is effective come January 1.

""The governor should have been apprised of the situation. If he wasn't apprised of the situation, then shame on his aides, and if he was, then shame on him for not listening to his aides,"" he says.

The director of Oregon’s exchange is now on medical leave.

Maryland, home to presumed Democratic presidential contender Gov. Martin O'Malley, also had a bad roll out.

Its exchange director is now gone, but lingering animosities remain. Gubernatorial hopeful Attorney General Doug Gansler fired off an intra-party salvo when he said the roll out was akin to a ""Saturday Night Live skit."" The object of his wrath is lieutenant governor and gubernatorial front-runner Anthony Brown, who is also the chairman of the state panel on the health care roll out.

California has been touted as a state exchange success story. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi recently said of her state’s exchange, ""In Covered California, we're moving along (the) largest state in the union, rolling along in a very positive way on it.""

But what she did not say was that the state’s enrollment among Latinos has been weak.

Only five percent of enrollees are Latino, even though they make up more than half of California's uninsured.

In a conference call with reporters Monday, Pelosi said the ""transformational"" nature of ObamaCare, much like Social Security, means that the law will take time to work out.

She added, ""It's going to be a glorious thing."""

In a speech before the National Academy of Sciences on Monday, Mr. Obama promised to keep science a sphere “not subject to politics” or “skewed by an agenda.”

On Wednesday, his administration betrayed both reproductive rights and science. The Justice Department announced that it would appeal a federal court ruling that would make morning-after pills available without a prescription for girls and women of all ages.

In 2011, the secretary of health and human services, Kathleen Sebelius, overruled the Food and Drug Administration, which had decided, based on scientific evidence, that the pills would be safe and appropriate “for all females of child-bearing potential.” Ms. Sebelius arbitrarily determined that only women 17 and older should have access to the drug.

Then, last month, citing the political nature of Ms. Sebelius’s intervention and finding no “coherent justification” for it, Judge Edward Korman of United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York ordered the F.D.A. to make emergency contraceptives available over the counter to all women, with no age restrictions."

What they are getting in the mail isn’t what they ordered.

Those responsible for saddling the country with this law, including the law’s chief salesman, President Obama, are scrambling to dodge the hammer of growing public resentment over the bill of goods that they have sold the American people. They are coming up with “fixes”, but I caution the buyer, beware.

The president, along with members of his party who are facing elections soon, are busy campaigning for proposals they say do what these architects of the law promised in the first place. But folks should think carefully about relying on the same people who repeatedly promised one thing and delivered something far different. Consumers who liked their health care plans are being forced to give them up. People who were told they would pay less for health care will be paying more. Even fans of Obamacare are upset with an archaic, ready-fire-aim website that took years and millions of dollars to develop, but, to put it mildly, is failing miserably. Will Americans again put their faith in the leaders who said the law had to be passed before it was understood? They shouldn’t.

In 2010 on the Senate floor, I warned that rules published in the Federal Register would guarantee that people who liked their health care would lose it. I warned that health care costs would go up. I warned that employers would be forced to cut back worker hours and jobs. I did more than warn this would happen, I offered senators a chance to prevent these calamities. Proponents of Obamacare rejected and ridiculed my legislation.

These same folks now, fighting for their political lives, are offering patches for their program and excuses for why it isn’t working. However, these folks are the same people who created the problems in the first place. They simply don’t want you to be able to choose the health insurance you want unless it’s health insurance they think you should have. They never did. Their plan was and is for policy makers in Washington to make what the experts believe are the best choices for you.

The Washington Post reported recently that the president said his administration could not in good faith allow people with inferior insurance plans to keep them. That’s not what he said dozens of times before the law passed and it doesn’t sound like a person ready to fix a problem. This isn’t about a fumbled roll-out or a computer glitch. This law’s problems are inherent within it. The way to get our country out of this bad situation is with the earnest help of people who recognize the benefit of individuals being able to make their own choices.

I’m a cosponsor of Senator Ron Johnson’s (R-Wis.) “If You Like Your Health Plan, You Can Keep it Act”. The House passed a bill that would allow insurers to continue offering policies that don’t meet the expensive Obamacare mandates. So far we haven’t received much positive feedback from the president or majority in the Senate. Instead, the president announced another exception to a law that is already riddled with them, while the Senate majority proposes more federal mandates to “fix” the mandates they already have imposed on America. But as the Wall Street Journal has pointed out, there is a real difference between letting people keep their plans by unshackling them from federal rules and working with state frameworks versus forcing insurers to comply with more new requirements.

My dad used to say that if you keep on doing what you’ve been doing you are going to end up with what you’ve got. I’ve heard the Senate majority leader say the definition of insanity is continuing to do the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. Unless people demand a new approach to health care — bona-fide inclusion of ideas from those who want a new approach — then we’re going to end up with what we have now: broken promises. We can do better."

Three days over the past few years have been especially meaningful (after, of course, Election Night '08 and the January 2009 inauguration): the day the PPACA law passed, the day the SCOTUS mostly upheld it, and this past Election Day (which seemed to seal its prospects against ever being repealed, though at the moment I'm less sure of that).

My wife works as a primary school special ed teacher. Her job provides decent insurance for her with no premium. To add me and our kids to the policy, though, would cost $577 a month out of a paycheck that right now is only $2400 a month, take home, and does not stretch super far as it is. This is just plain unaffordable for us. Yet the news is, we are shit out of luck.

Almost insulting are the paltry breadcrumbs found in the ""silver lining"":



Under the law, people who go without insurance will generally be subject to tax penalties. In a separate proposed regulation issued on Wednesday, the Internal Revenue Service said that the uninsured children and spouse of an employee would be exempt from the penalties if the cost of coverage for the entire family under an employer’s plan was more than 8 percent of household income.

So rather than helping me get my family covered, you just won't punish us because we can't afford it? Thank you Obama.

As someone pithily put it on the SDMB thread I coincidentally started the day before this news came out (because I was trying to figure out where we stood vis-a-vis the law):This will be comforting to Tea Party paranoiacs, I suppose. To me? Not so much.

The same commenter wrote:



Democrats had better be careful. It looks like the Pubs might be right on what a clusterfuck this will be.

Indeed. I am beyond livid here...despairing, really. How can this be happening?!?

Our total gross income is $46,000, about 200 percent of the FPL so no dice on the Medicaid expansion. The truly perverse part is that if my wife's job had no health insurance at all, we could all get on the exchange for just over $200 a month total.

I may actually have to consider divorcing her as my own income is less than the threshold to get the Medicaid expansion (if my reddish state joins that) or at least get a cheap policy from the federal exchange. Not exactly a pro-marriage policy though!

Anyone who might doubt me when I say, essentially, that if they are losing ME of all people, they are really screwing the pooch, just take a quick peek at this diary I wrote a year and a half ago:

She Is Native Of Minnesota', 'Holds Degrees Boston College', 'Uc Berkeley S Graduate School Of Journalism.', 'Christi Parsons Was The Los Angeles Times', 'White House Correspondent']",White House optimistic Obama will bounce back from healthcare glitches,"WASHINGTON — He’s vented, attacked, apologized and adjusted. Now, President Obama has one move left in his attempt to salvage the rollout of his healthcare law: hope the website works soon.

The White House, knowing a functional website is needed to calm its panicky allies, has now entered the wait-and-see period of its triage after the turmoil that has followed the Oct. 1 rollout. With the latest fix to the law unveiled, a bruising House vote behind them and experts working feverishly on the broken website, administration officials believe they may have weathered the worst.

Although Obama’s standing in polls and support within his party have dropped sharply, much like the downward trajectory of George W. Bush’s second term, White House officials believe he can still recover.

That optimistic assessment depends almost entirely on the administration’s ability to reboot healthcare.gov, the once-hyped online insurance marketplace now undergoing extensive repair. At stake are the future of the president’s signature domestic achievement, his political standing and reelection prospects for vulnerable Democrats in Congress.

If the administration meets its goal of a mostly glitch-free site by the end of November, the last two months may be remembered as just another near-death experience for a healthcare overhaul that has had many. Even though many insurance executives and congressional Democrats are angry at Obama for his handling of the healthcare law, both groups have strong incentives to help the Affordable Care Act succeed.

But if the White House fails, the recent setbacks could become the beginning of years of trouble for Democrats in office, as well as those seeking to get there, officials concede.

Administration officials privately acknowledge that no argument defending Obamacare will connect with Americans until they begin to see the effects of the law at work. No work-around or temporary fix will reach enough people to build a critical mass of support. The website has to function, admit edgy aides who sometimes spit the word “website” with the contempt familiar to anyone who has ever called a tech help desk.

Obama revealed his own frustrations Thursday, saying at a White House news conference that he has an obligation to show Americans that the law has made health insurance more affordable and accessible — “if we can just get the darn website working and smooth this thing out.”

Officials said Friday they were making progress on the site’s many glitches and bugs. It now takes less than one second, on average, to load a page, down from eight seconds in the weeks after the launch, said Jeffrey Zients, a former top administration official who was brought back to oversee the repairs. The site can “comfortably” handle 20,000 to 25,000 consumers at the same time and more capacity is being added, he said.

Still, problems persist in the system that sends consumer information to insurers, and as experts have ticked off 200 software problems, more continue to pop up. Zients said the officials expect to make the Nov. 30 goal, but added: “Not all consumers going on the website will have a seamless experience.”

While the tech team works, the president must convince his allies as well as his potential adversaries that, as he said Thursday, he’s a clutch player who knows how to recover from a fumble.

That group includes insurance executives who were called to the White House on Friday to discuss Obama’s answer to the millions of policy cancellation notices sent to surprised consumers. After announcing Thursday that he would allow insurers to rescind those cancellations and extend the policies for another year, the president sought to persuade the executives to take him up on the offer.

The group also includes Democrats on Capitol Hill, many of whom have gone from disgruntled to distrustful of the White House. On Friday, 39 House Democrats voted for the GOP alternative to Obama’s extension fix.

That sizable number of largely swing-district lawmakers was only the most visible sign of broader dissatisfaction that makes Obama’s current holding pattern a challenge. Even those who stuck with the White House on Friday’s vote have expressed frustration. In the wake of Obama’s announcement, lawmakers were left to figure out whether their state officials and insurers would go along with the plan. Skepticism was high.

“The message from the White House is, ‘OK, you can be mad, it’s frustrating. But be on the program,’” said one advisor to a House Democrat, who asked for anonymity while characterizing internal discussions. “But what program is that? The program where every five minutes there’s a different plan?”

Polling shows the public has similar doubts. For the first time in his presidency, fewer than half of Americans polled told Gallup that Obama was a “strong and decisive leader,” a 6-percentage-point drop since September. The perception of Obama as “honest and trustworthy” and public confidence in his ability to manage government took a similar tumble.

A continued slide, combined with continued technical glitches, could leave the White House little choice but to make additional changes to the law — mostly likely extending the enrollment period and delaying the penalties for people who don’t carry insurance. Senate Democrats already have urged such a move.

But in the face of ardent Republican opposition to the law — House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) on Friday repeated his hope to repeal “this train wreck” — the White House has resisted any fix that puts it at the mercy of House Republicans and pushes votes on the law well into an election year.

“That will always be an option of extreme last resort,” said Drew Altman, president and chief executive of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

The White House has long argued that the popularity of the healthcare law will hinge on the popularity of its benefits — an untested theory until the public can easily access the online marketplaces that showcase most of those benefits. Still, in the pileup of bad news for Obama, there was some reason to hope that the policy now largely locked behind the broken site might have a chance of winning over the public.

Though enrollment numbers in October were dismal, consumer interest was strong. Nationwide, more than 1.1 million people completed applications to get coverage; 106,000 actually selected a plan.

Data from several states operating their own marketplaces suggest demand for health plans may be accelerating.

In California, 35,000 people selected a health plan in October. Nearly the same number signed up in just the first two weeks of November, according to Covered California, the state’s marketplace. Kentucky has seen similar growth: 5,586 people signed up in October, and nearly 4,000 did in the first two weeks of November.

“We are feeling incredibly optimistic,” said Gwenda Bond, a spokeswoman for the state health agency that operates Kentucky’s marketplace, known as kynect.

The White House may have a long wait, Altman noted, before it knows how far that optimism will spread.

“In the long term, ultimately, the website will be working, this issue of cancellations will be in the rear-view mirror and the real question will be whether people who get coverage under the law like it or not,” Altman said. “The real story about whether the law works or not will unfold next year and the year after that.”

A number of states that use their own systems, including California, are on track to hit enrollment targets for 2014 because of a sharp increase in November, according to state officials.

“What we are seeing is incredible momentum,” said Peter Lee, director of Covered California, the nation’s largest state insurance marketplace, which accounted for a third of all enrollments nationally in October. California — which enrolled about 31,000 people in health plans last month — nearly doubled that in the first two weeks of this month.

Several other states, including Connecticut and Kentucky, are outpacing their enrollment estimates, even as states that depend on the federal website lag far behind. In Minnesota, enrollment in the second half of October ran at triple the rate of the first half, officials said. Washington state is also on track to easily exceed its October enrollment figure, officials said.

The growing enrollment in those states is a rare bit of good news for backers of the Affordable Care Act and suggests that the serious problems with the law’s rollout may not be fatal, despite critics’ renewed calls for repeal.

But the trend also emphasizes how widely experience with the new law varies by location.

Fourteen states and the District of Columbia, covering about one-third of the nation’s population, are operating their own Obamacare marketplaces and have their own enrollment websites. The others, including most states with Republican-led governments, have declined to do so, making their residents dependent on the malfunctioning federal site.

In addition to better-functioning websites, many states that are running their own marketplaces also have significantly more resources to help consumers sign up for coverage.

Many of the states that have declined to run their own websites have also refused to expand the joint federal-state Medicaid program, as the new law allows.

Overall enrollment totals in states using the federal site were dismal in October, according to figures released last week by the Health and Human Services Department.

For example, just 2,991 people successfully enrolled in health plans in Texas in October. That was fewer enrollees than in Kentucky, which has a sixth as many residents.

Altogether, 106,000 people enrolled in health coverage nationwide last month, a figure far below administration projections.

Nearly half of those who enrolled in October were in California or New York. Both states have continued to show growth in their numbers. In New York, enrollment has continued at roughly October’s rate and stands at 24,509, according to state officials.

Even with the growing consumer interest in health insurance in many states, the new marketplaces created by the health law need millions more enrollees. The Obama administration aims to get 7 million consumers into health insurance plans in 2014 to ensure that the marketplaces have enough people to be sustainable.

With fixes still being made to the federal website, it is unclear whether enrollment will catch up everywhere.

White House officials repeatedly have said they hope to have the healthcare.gov website working for the “vast majority” of users by the end of this month. But spokesman Jay Carney said Monday that the administration also is working with insurance companies to allow consumers to bypass the troubled site and enroll directly with insurers.

In California, Lee said Monday that the federal troubles have made enrollment more difficult even for states that use their own sites. State officials believe enrollment through Covered California has been depressed by media reports of problems with the federal site, Lee told reporters during a call organized by the consumer group Families USA.

Covered California has had to change its marketing strategy to remind Californians that the state website is different from healthcare.gov.

But while politicians in Washington, D.C., have been fixated on the website problems, many state officials are feeling considerably more optimistic about the law’s long-term prospects.

“We’re going to ride all this stuff out,” said Kevin Counihan, chief executive of Access Health CT, Connecticut’s marketplace.

Counihan, who worked for the marketplace that Massachusetts created after its trailblazing 2006 reforms, said he had been expecting even lower enrollment. Connecticut saw growing enrollment in November: 3,201 people signed up for health plans in the first two weeks of this month, nearing the 4,371 total for all of October.

Enrollment has been even stronger in many Medicaid programs.

About half the states have agreed to expand their Medicaid programs to most low-income residents in 2014. Under the law, the federal government picks up nearly the entire cost of that expansion for the first several years.

Nationwide, nearly 400,000 new people qualified for Medicaid coverage in October, according to federal data. In Oregon, whose marketplace has been one of the few trouble-plagued state sites, the state reported that it had already signed up 70,000 new people for Medicaid.

Officials nationwide cautioned that drawing firm conclusions about enrollment patterns was difficult at this early stage.

“It’s hard to know what normal looks like yet,” said Bethany Frey, a spokeswoman for Washington state’s marketplace, known as Washington Healthplanfinder.

Many state officials say they think the biggest enrollment surge will take place after Thanksgiving. Consumers face a Dec. 15 deadline to sign up if coverage is to be effective Jan. 1.

The open enrollment period under the law lasts until March 31, giving consumers an additional three months to select health plans in 2014.

Experts also expect more people to sign up for coverage through 2014 as their circumstances change in ways that make them eligible to enroll outside of the regular enrollment period.

“We are in the beginning of the first inning of a nine-inning game,” Lee said.

A majority of Americans say they believe the new health care law will increase their medical costs and taxes, according to an Aug. 8 Fox News poll. The survey found 57 percent of those polled felt the way ObamaCare was being rolled out was ""a joke.""

Overall, 63 percent of voters believe that the 2010 health care law needs to be changed. That number is up from 58 percent of those asked the question in July 2012.

The number of Republicans who think the law should be changed remained steady at 84 percent. According to the poll, more voters used negative terms to describe the health care overhaul -- with 39 percent calling it ""disastrous"" and 14 percent calling it ""a step backwards.""

The Fox News poll, which is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,007 randomly chosen registered voters, found 71 percent of voters believed ObamaCare will increase their taxes, while 62 percent believe it will increase the cost of their premiums. Sixty-five percent believe implementing the law will add to the federal deficit.

The confusion over what will happen with the Affordable Care Act seems to be growing as the Oct. 1 opening of ObamaCare exchanges draws near.

Major elements of the law have been met with strong opposition and the White House's plan to pump up support appears to be running into hardening perceptions.

Initially, the goal was to provide medical coverage for the country's 50 million uninsured and to restrain skyrocketing costs. Last month, Obama acknowledged glitches in implementing the law and announced a one-year delay in a major provision requiring companies to provide coverage for their workers.

In the latest development, the administration has also delayed for a year a cap on out-of-pocket medical costs. A partial cap will still go into effect, but the delay could lead to consumers paying more for out-of-pocket drug costs in the interim.

So far, 21 governors have opted out of the law's Medicaid expansion and even more refused to set up a health insurance marketplace -- those marketplaces are supposed to get off the ground at the beginning of 2014.

Labor unions have also ramped up their criticism of ObamaCare and its impact on union-run health plans. Many claim the law will drive up costs for plans that are managed jointly by small business owners and unions which could cause unionized employers to drop coverage to 20 million people.

Union officials also have been upset that the Obama administration listened to employer requests to delay a provision requiring bigger companies to provide insurance coverage or pay a penalty.

Laborers International Union of North America President Terry O'Sullivan sent Obama an email last month saying the law has ""destructive consequences."" O'Sullivan's letter echoed the sentiments written in a separate letter by the heads of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the United Food and Commercial Workers and Unite Here. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers went a step further and took out print ads raising concerns over the law.

The setbacks seem to be taking a toll on how Americans view the overhaul.

According to an Aug. 12 Rasmussen Reports poll, 53 percent of U.S. voters said they viewed Obama's health care law unfavorably. The national survey of 1,000 voters found 42 percent of that group having a ""very unfavorable"" opinion of the law.

Those numbers are in line with a Gallup poll that found more Americans to have a negative rather than a positive view about the health care law's future impact on their family and the country.

Fifty-two percent of Americans say they disapprove of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, while 44 percent approve. Last fall, 48 percent said they approved of the law and 45 percent disapproved. Americans have generally been divided in their views of the law since it was passed in 2010.

Obama defended the law at a press conference this past Friday, and blasted Republicans for continuing to speak ill of it.

""I think the really interesting question is why it is that my friends in the other party have made the idea of preventing these people from getting health care their holy grail, their No. 1 priority. The one unifying principle in the Republican Party at the moment is making sure that 30 million people don't have health care and, presumably, repealing all those benefits,"" Obama said.

He continued: ""There is no doubt that in implementing the Affordable Care Act, a program of this significance, there are going to be some glitches. No doubt about it.""

But he said the goal is to deliver ""high-quality, affordable health care for people and to reform the system so costs start going down and people start getting a better bang for the buck. And I make no apologies for that."""

If people refuse to sign up for ObamaCare, the program collapses. Nothing would be more satisfying than to see ObamaCare go the way of Prohibition (without the violence): as something else that pushed the wonderfully unruly American people too far.

Contrary to what the media are telling you, the shutdown is not helping ObamaCare. Again and again, conservatives have been taunted by the media with the cry of, “If you hadn’t shut down the government, we’d be covering the ObamaCare launch debacle.”

Huh?

The media are covering the ObamaCare launch debacle, and the coverage is the Obama administration’s worst nightmare because the shutdown has made it impossible for the White House to come up with a plan that would instruct the media in how to mitigate the damage.

You see, if there was no shutdown, the media coverage of the launch would not be anywhere as negative for the White House as it is now, and here is why…

1. The White House Can’t Do Damage Control – Right now the media and the White House are covering the ObamaCare launch debacle in stark, one-dimensional terms: It is an expensive, disappointing, big government debacle. Both are too overwhelmed to figure out a way to make it look less worse, which we all know would happen if they had the time and resources.

2. The White House Can’t Gameplan a Plan B – While the administration obviously bungled the launch, when it comes to cleaning up a mess, this White House can usually move pretty fast. This time the White House can’t. They and the media are too bogged down in the shutdown. With some breathing room, the White House might have been able to set up a massive call center staffed with volunteers — something, anything to get people signed up. But even if they do, there is just no media space available to spread the word.

3. White House Can’t Reassure Anyone – If the shutdown wasn’t gobbling up White House resources and media space, the administration could fan out its supporters to reassure those interested in signing up for ObamaCare that things are going to get better and that the problems are aggressively being worked on. Instead, all potential enrollees are seeing is error messages and all they are hearing is bad news.

4. White House Can’t Spin the Sticker Shock – If anything brings down ObamaCare, it will be sticker shock. For four years, Obama, Democrats, and the media have been lying to the American people about the cost of ObamaCare. On top of adding $2.6 trillion to our deficit, individuals are facing shockingly high premiums and premium increases. This, after being lied to again and again about cheaper premiums. I’m not sure how the White House and its media would spin their way out of this, but heaven knows if they had the time and resources, they would find a way. After all, this is the same media that turned Obama’s Libya debacle into a campaign problem for Mitt Romney.

—

The bottom line to ObamaCare’s success or failure is the number of enrollees paying into the system. In its first year, ObamaCare needs seven million enrollees, three million of them healthy and under age 35.

If those numbers aren’t met, the program is a failure, the disapproval ratings increase, and the chances of ObamaCare slowly being killed increase.

ObamaCare is the president’s baby, his only significant accomplishment, his only hope for a legacy — it is burning down before his eyes and he is helpless to do anything to shape the all-important first impression.

Throughout Obama’s time in the spotlight, this is the only time I have ever witnessed anything he has bungled receiving only harshly negative coverage. It’s a bloodbath because the shutdown is taking up all the space that would normally be used for spin and lies.
