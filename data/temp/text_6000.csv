(CNN) —

Even if the Senate backs President Barack Obama’s call for military action against Syria, a wall of outright opposition or skepticism from Democrats and Republicans in the House makes approval there very difficult.

House Speaker John Boehner, who backs Obama on the issue, welcomed news on Friday that the president would deliver a national address on Tuesday to try to sway public opinion, which now opposes such a step.

But Boehner’s spokesman signaled that the votes aren’t in the House for passing a resolution authorizing force against Syria and the GOP is placing the burden squarely on Obama’s shoulders.

“Only a president can convince the public that military action is required. We only hope this isn’t coming too late to make the difference,” Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said in a statement.

Still, senior House Republican aides find it difficult to see a path for passage.

Boehner’s top deputy, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, also supports the president and is talking to members and urging them to review classified materials that administration officials say bolsters their case for military action.

Cantor penned an editorial in his hometown Richmond paper explaining why he believes military action is needed.

“America has a compelling national security interest to prevent and respond to the use of weapons of mass destruction, especially by a terrorist state, and to prevent further instability in a region of vital interest to the United States,” he said.

’Constructive’ talks but little headway on crisis

But rank and file House GOP members have frequently ignored their leaders and the vote in favor of action is stalled in the single digits, including the support expressed by senior leadership, a CNN tally showed.

One senior GOP House aide said prospects for meaningful additional Republican support is “bad” and “momentum is with the ‘nay’ vote.”

Congress is ending its summer recess and members formally get back to work next week.

In a memo to House Republicans outlining the fall schedule, Cantor suggested the timetable for the vote, which Boehner initially planned for next week, could slip a week.

“Members should expect a robust debate and vote on an authorization of use of military force pertaining to Syria in the next two weeks” Cantor wrote.

But House GOP leaders are leaving open the possibility the House will not bring up the resolution if it fails in the Senate.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid predicted on Friday that the necessary votes were in the Democratic-led chamber to pass a resolution calling for limited force.

The House plans to wait to see if something passes the Senate before making final decisions on the language or timing of any House vote, according to multiple Republican sources.

One undecided GOP member, Rep Richard Hudson, a North Carolina Republican, returned for a briefing on Friday. He told CNN that he came back to hear details about the military objectives directly from the administration instead of through the media.

Obama to address American people on Tuesday

Although his constituents are “very opposed” to military action, Hudson said he would base his vote on what he thought was best for the country and “let the politics sort itself out later.”

The lack of GOP support places enormous pressure on House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who was one of the chief critics of the Iraq war, and Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer.

The two will need to persuade well over a majority of the 200 House Democrats to stand behind Obama, also a Democrat.

Top House Democratic aides counter that it’s too soon to predict defeat because most Democrats are reserving judgment until they hear details in a classified briefing on Monday evening.

The administration is dispatching top officials to make a final push before Obama’s speech.

Secretary of State John Kerry; Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Martin Dempsey will conduct the joint House-Senate session in the Capitol.

“We’re not going to know until our members get back into town. A lot of people haven’t had access to the briefings or the classified documents,” one of Democratic aide noted.

But for many House members who already have attended classified meetings on Syria this week, the sessions seem to raise more questions.

Syria’s rebels: 20 things you need to know

Hawaii Democratic Rep Tulsi Gabbard, a former Iraq war veteran, told reporters she was undecided and then ticked off remaining questions she had after a two-hour session with top administration officials.

“What are the unintended consequences? What are the outcomes? What are the next moves that could potentially occur that would involve U.S. interests, U.S military, costs - both in human lives, as well as in resources?” Gabbard asked.

A senior administration official told CNN that top officials reached out to more than 125 House members through a variety of conference calls and one-on-one conversations over the past two weeks.

But the “flood the zone” White House approach hasn’t prevented a steady list of members from voicing outright opposition or criticism that the case for military action is thin.

The fact that so many members in his own party remain undecided or publicly opposed illustrates that Obama’s political capital in Congress is quite low.

California Democratic Rep. Judy Chu participated in a conference call with White House chief of staff Denis McDonough on Wednesday and remains undecided.

While she said there’s no question that the al-Assad government used chemical weapons she outlined a laundry list of outstanding questions.

She wants details about contingency plans if Syria retaliates, the lack of international support, reasons why diplomatic efforts can’t be explored, and the direct cost to taxpayers.

Chu says her constituents “overwhelmingly … want me to vote ‘no’ on this.”

She described House Democrats as “war weary. We just came from Iraq and Afghanistan wars. We are war skeptical,” Chu said.

Rep Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat who remained undecided, highlighted the stakes for Obama to change minds or persuade Democrats to back him on Syria.

He called it “certainly one of the most important speeches in his career as the president of the United States.”"

The oil accords with Turkey, potentially worth billions of dollars, are part of a broader effort by Iraqi Kurds in recent years to cut their own energy deals — including exploration agreements with foreign companies like Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Gazprom — that sidelined the central government. The Kurds, and the Turks, say they will pay Baghdad its fair share. But officials in the capital have long claimed such arrangements are illegal.

The controversy is in part the unfinished business of the American occupation of Iraq. The failure of the Iraqi government to pass a national oil law, one of the benchmarks set by President George W. Bush when he announced the United States troop “surge” in 2007, has left Baghdad and Erbil, the Kurdish capital, in a perpetual feud over how to divide profits and who has the authority to make agreements with international oil companies.

Qasim Mishkhati, a Kurdish member of Parliament’s oil and gas committee, insisted that the wealth from the deals would be shared with the rest of Iraq, and that it was the responsibility of the regional government in the north to find international markets for its oil resources. “Kurdistan is working to increase the national income so that all Iraqis can enjoy better services and more wealth,” he said.

Although the mechanism for such payments has not been worked out, the Turks and the Kurds have indicated that they would adhere to the existing proportions for the division of national revenue, meaning Baghdad would receive 83 percent of the net profit and the Kurds would keep 17 percent."

Kerry and his Russian counterpart huddled Thursday in Geneva in a push to disarm Syria of chemical weapons, even as Syrian President Bashar Assad warned that he wouldn’t surrender his toxic arsenal unless the Obama administration stopped arming rebels battling to overthrow his government.

Assad’s comments suggested another hurdle for the hastily arranged talks, which were already fraught with considerable risk, and threatened a separate diplomatic process at the United Nations. They underscored the limits of Moscow’s leverage over the embattled Syrian ruler, who faces a mortal threat from insurgents in a bitter civil war.

Neither Kerry nor Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov directly responded to Assad’s demands when they met with reporters. Both sought to project optimism about resolving the crisis that erupted after the U.S. said that more than 1,000 Syrians were killed in poison gas attacks outside Damascus last month.

“We do believe there is a way to get this done,” Kerry said. But he repeated President Obama’s warning that if diplomacy failed, “force might be necessary to deter and degrade Assad’s capacity to deliver these weapons.”

“We proceed from the fact that the solution of this problem will make unnecessary” any U.S. airstrikes on Syria, Lavrov said.

Both diplomats brought teams of arms control experts, legal specialists and other aides to the talks, which are taking place in the Swiss city where the first ban on poison gas was signed nearly a century ago after the horrors of World War I.

In brief comments at the White House, Obama said he hoped the negotiations “can yield a concrete result.” He said Kerry would work hard “over the next several days to see what the possibilities are.”

The talks represent Moscow’s attempt to reclaim a dominant position on the world stage after years of decline, and have cast Russian President Vladimir Putin in the unlikely role of peacemaker. He vowed this week to force Assad’s government to let international monitors impound, safeguard and ultimately destroy Syria’s chemical weapons.

After weeks of insisting that America’s credibility was on the line in Syria, and months of tension and chilly relations with Moscow, the White House sought Thursday to shift the spotlight — and at least some of the responsibility — to the Russian leader.

“It is clear that President Putin has invested his credibility in transferring Assad’s chemical weapons to international control and ultimately destroying them,” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said. “This is significant. Russia is Assad’s patron and protector, and the world will note whether Russia can follow through on the commitments that it’s made.”

Kerry and Lavrov have met nearly a dozen times this year, and Kerry has called Russia a crucial partner in trying to end the Syrian conflict and resolve the chemical weapons crisis. But U.S. officials worry that Putin is simply trying to avert U.S. airstrikes and buy time for his ally in Damascus.

Many diplomats and analysts say the Obama administration holds a weak hand in the talks. On Tuesday, Obama said he was withdrawing his request for Congress to authorize military action in Syria to give diplomacy time. But it was clear by then that the House, and perhaps the Senate, was unlikely to support the president’s plea for use of force.

Christopher Chivvis, a Pentagon official during the first Obama term, said he viewed airstrikes without congressional support as “not impossible, but increasingly unlikely.” He said the diplomatic efforts “could lead backward” if they unraveled in the weeks ahead and Obama refrained from retaliatory strikes.

“Then you’re in a worse position, because Assad still has his weapons and the message to the world is that you can use them without punishment,” said Chivvis, who is now with the Rand Corp., a nonpartisan think tank.

In addition to the sit-down in Geneva, Syrian diplomats in New York gave U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon a document declaring Syria’s willingness to join the Chemical Weapons Convention, an international treaty that bans the production, storage or use of poison gas. Nearly 200 countries have already signed it.

The treaty, which went into force in 1997, would bring Syria’s disarmament under the supervision of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, an independent international organization based in The Hague. It has no military enforcement powers and thus is dependent on each country’s cooperation.

Both Russia and the United States, the two countries with the largest stockpiles of chemical arms, are still working to destroy their toxic arsenals under the treaty’s provisions.

Assad said in an interview with the Rossiya-24 Russian news network that he was willing to sign the treaty. But he said that under its provisions, Syria would have a month to begin handing over details of its stockpiles to international monitors. That time frame is considerably longer than U.S. officials seek, and it’s unclear if it will prove acceptable.

Assad also said Syria would not participate unless other countries made important concessions.

“These mechanisms will not be fulfilled unilaterally,” he said. “When we see that the United States really wants stability in our region, will stop their threats and attack plans, and stop their arms supplies to terrorists, then we will consider that we can go ahead and complete the necessary processes so that they can be valid and acceptable for Syria. There are no one-sided mechanisms.”

Assad also demanded that Israel give up its nuclear weapons before he will comply. Israel does not acknowledge possessing nuclear weapons.

Igor Korotchenko, editor of the Moscow journal National Defense, said the Syrian leader was speaking to his own supporters, as well as the international community, in his attempts to bargain.

“Assad is trying to get away with as many bonuses as he can get,” Korotchenko said. “To expect Washington to stop aiding the rebels is unrealistic, and the Syrian leader must understand it full well. He needs to avert a U.S. strike and he is bidding for time trying to get some tactical advantages.”

The U.S., French, British and other governments also are exploring the possibility of a U.N. Security Council resolution under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter. That could offer a legal mandate for the use of military force if Syria breaches its obligations under the treaty.

But Russia and China have made it clear they would veto such a resolution, citing their opposition to military action. Russia has suggested instead passing a nonbinding U.N. declaration called a “presidential statement.”

The options facing Obama “are just not that good,” said Michael Singh, a former national security aide to President George W. Bush who is now managing director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

(CNN) —

Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who spilled U.S. surveillance secrets to the world, is a “free man” biding his time in a Moscow airport, Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters Tuesday.

Putin said Snowden – who flew to Moscow from Hong Kong on Sunday – is in the “transit area” of Sheremetyevo International Airport, the zone between arrival gates and Russia’s passport control checkpoints. While he said Russia won’t hand Snowden over to the United States, he seemed eager to have the focus of international intrigue off his hands.

“The sooner he selects his final destination point, the better both for us and for himself,” Putin said from Finland of Snowden, who is wanted by U.S. officials on espionage charges for disclosing classified details of U.S. surveillance programs.

Putin’s comments end, for now at least, the international pastime of “Where’s Snowden?” There have been rumors for days that the former NSA contractor had perhaps duped the world into thinking he was in Moscow to throw pursuers off his trail as he seeks a safe haven from U.S. prosecution.

Kristinn Hrafnsson – a spokesman for WikiLeaks, an organization that facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information and has one of its members with Snowden in Russia – told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday only that Snowden “is in a safe place and is comfortable and possibly simply relaxing after a very stressful week.”

Noting the United States and Russia do not have an extradition agreement, Putin said Snowden can’t be turned over to U.S. authorities and has committed no crimes on Russian soil.

But he also said Russian security forces have not been “working with” Snowden and expressed hope that the incident would not “affect the cordial nature of our relations with the U.S.” Hrafnsson offered a similar story, saying there’s been “no cooperation or coordination with the Russian authority” before or since Snowden arrived in Moscow.

A senior Obama administration official called Putin’s comments “potentially positive” while reiterating hopes that Snowden would be expelled from Russia and returned to the United States.

U.S. officials believe Russian authorities have a “clear legal basis to expel Mr. Snowden, based on the status of his travel documents and the pending charges against him,” National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said.

Secretary of State John Kerry, speaking to reporters while traveling in Saudi Arabia, said the United States isn’t looking to Russia to enforce U.S. law, only to “allow him to be subject to the laws of our land and our Constitution.”

“We are not looking for confrontation, we’re not ordering anybody,” Kerry said. “We’re simply requesting under a very normal procedure for the transfer of somebody, just as we transferred to Russia seven people in the last two years that they requested, that we did without any clamor, without any rancor, without any argument and according to our sense of the appropriateness of meeting their request.”

Snowden left Hong Kong on Sunday after a couple of weeks spent doling out details of classified U.S. intelligence programs to journalists.

With his passport revoked by U.S. officials, Snowden traveled out of the semiautonomous Chinese territory on refugee papers issued by Ecuador, one of the countries from which he is seeking asylum.

International tiff

His travels have sparked international dust-ups, with U.S. officials accusing China of making a “deliberate choice” to let Snowden go free and criticizing Russia for failing to hand him over in a spirit of international cooperation.

Measured tones mask Washington’s fury with Hong Kong over Snowden

On Tuesday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman rejected the U.S. claims as “unreasonable,” according to the official Xinhua news service.

“The accusation that the U.S. side made against the Central Government of China fell short of proof. The Chinese side will absolutely not accept it,” spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.

Rimsky Yuen Kwok-keung, Hong Kong’s justice secretary, likewise denied that authorities there intentionally let Snowden leave before acting on U.S. requests.

“All along, we acted fully in accordance with the law and any suggestion that we have been deliberately letting Mr. Snowden go away or to do any other thing to obstruct the normal operation is totally untrue,” Yuen said Tuesday.

Authorities in Hong Kong were seeking answers from U.S. authorities around when Snowden left, the justice secretary added. Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-Ying said Monday that authorities acted independently from Beijing “to follow procedural fairness and procedural justice.”

In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the U.S. complaints “absolutely groundless and unacceptable.”

“I want to say, right away, that we have nothing to do with Mr. Snowden or his movements around the world,” Lavrov said.

The White House is eager to avoid a repeat of what happened in Hong Kong, where authorities let Snowden leave despite a U.S. request for his arrest and extradition. Washington has described that move as a “serious setback” to building trust between the United States and China.

Lawmakers say tenuous ties shaken further as Snowden lands in Russia

But the Obama administration doesn’t have much leverage with Moscow, said Matthew Rojansky, an expert on U.S. and Russian national security at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

“We really need Russian cooperation, I think, much more in most areas than the Russians need us,” he said.

4 options for the U.S. to get Snowden back

U.S. diplomatic headache

Washington is also telling other countries where Snowden might end up – notably Ecuador, which says it’s analyzing an asylum request from Snowden – that they should hand him over if he lands on their soil. They note that his U.S. passport has been revoked.

“The U.S. is advising these governments that Mr. Snowden is wanted on felony charges and as such should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel other than is necessary to return him here to the United States,” Carney said.

One rumored destination is Venezuela, whose leaders have been frequently at odds with Washington in recent years.

According to the AVN state news agency, President Nicolas Maduro said Tuesday his country has not received a formal request for political asylum from Snowden. But if it did, the government would consider it on humanitarian grounds, the agency reports.

In its quest to get Snowden, the United States has limited options. CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the issue now “is much more of a political and diplomatic matter than it is a legal matter.”

“In an ordinary case, sure, you need a passport to get around,” Toobin said. “But here, where this case is causing increasing embarrassment for the United States, governments that want the United States to be embarrassed are only too happy to waive some of the technical legal rules.”

The leak controversy

Snowden has acknowledged he leaked classified documents about the NSA’s surveillance programs to the Guardian newspaper in Britain and The Washington Post.

The documents revealed the existence of programs that collect records of domestic telephone calls in the United States and monitor the Internet activity of people overseas residents.

The disclosures shook the U.S. intelligence community and raised questions about whether the NSA is eroding American civil liberties.

Snowden worked as a Hawaii-based computer network administrator for Booz Allen Hamilton, an NSA contractor, before he fled to Hong Kong last month with laptops full of confidential information.

The South China Morning Post newspaper published a story Monday quoting Snowden as saying he took the job to gather evidence on U.S. surveillance programs.

He told the Guardian that he exposed the surveillance programs because they pose a threat to democracy, but administration officials said the programs are vital to preventing terrorist attacks and are overseen by all three branches of government.

Carney questioned Snowden’s assertion that he acted in defense of democratic transparency, saying his argument “is belied by the protectors he has potentially chosen – China, Russia, Ecuador.”

“His failures to criticize these regimes suggests that his true motive throughout has been to injure the national security of the United States, not to advance Internet freedom and free speech,” Carney told reporters.

Snowden’s search

Snowden is seeking asylum from Ecuador, Iceland and other, unspecified countries, a WikiLeaks attorney said Monday.

Interactive: En route with Snowden

Ecuador has already given WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange freedom if he can find a way out of the country’s embassy in London.

In his aslyum request read by Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo, Snowden compared himself to Pvt. Bradley Manning, the U.S. soldier accused of leaking classified information through WikiLeaks.

He said U.S. officials have treated Manning inhumanely by holding him in solitary confinement, and he predicted a similar “cruel and unusual” fate for himself if he falls into U.S. hands.

Snowden has come under some criticism for seeking out help from nations with questionable histories on free speech and press freedom.

For instance, The Committee to Protect Journalists has criticized Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa’s government for pushing legislation that would roll back press freedoms, calling its policies increasingly repressive.

Snowden isn’t looking for “political nirvana,” said Glenn Greenwald, the columnist for the Guardian who broke his revelations.

“He’s searching for a place where he can be safe and remain free and participate in the debate, and Ecuador seems to be the place he has chosen,” Greenwald told CNN’s “The Lead.”

Some have speculated Snowden has “doomsday insurance” in the form of even more top-secret U.S. documents that will go public if he’s ever detained by U.S. authorities.

Hrafnsson, the WikiLeaks spokesman, said he didn’t know about Snowden’s specific plans, but did suggest more secrets may be revealed.

“This is simply information that should be out in the public,” he said. “There is more to come.”

Although Mr. Obama claimed the power to attack Syria on his own, just as Mr. Clinton did with Iraq, he sought authorization from lawmakers anyway on the theory that a unified front would be stronger. Instead, he found that the more he argued for a strike, the more polls showed him losing public support and the more certain defeat on Capitol Hill became.

For the moment, aides say it is still Mr. Obama’s position to have Congress sign off on any military operation if the Russian-American disarmament agreement collapses. But senior lawmakers have told the White House that it cannot win such a vote, and some outside advisers said Mr. Obama should skip Congress if the Russian gambit fails.

“Plan B needs to be carrying out strikes” and “probably avoiding a vote on the Hill,” said Dennis B. Ross, a Middle East expert who has advised Mr. Obama. “To have the diplomatic initiative fail and not carry out strikes would certainly make it hard to convince anyone that our words mean anything.”

Colin Kahl, a former Pentagon official under Mr. Obama, said a “credible threat of military force needs to be left on the table” and suggested the president might seek a conditional measure authorizing action if Syria reneges. “If there was widespread support for that sort of contingent authorization, I think they would go ahead and move forward with it,” Mr. Kahl said. “But otherwise, I think there’s a possibility that they wouldn’t” go back to Congress.

Yet having asked Congress once to weigh in, Mr. Obama would be hard pressed to explain why he would now bypass it. The criteria he set for requesting a Congressional vote — a situation that was not an imminent or a direct threat to the United States — would still apply. Some allies believe that could leave him more politically isolated than if he had never asked in the first place.

Some Democrats said Mr. Obama might be bolstered in Congress if the Russian initiative did not work. “I would say that actually strengthens the president’s hand coming back to Congress because he’s able to say, ‘All right, I walked the extra mile you asked me to even though it was a little embarrassing. I did what you asked me to do,’ ” said Representative Gerald E. Connolly, a Virginia Democrat.

But lawmakers and aides in both parties said Mr. Obama has so little support for a strike that it might not make a difference. They said they saw no chance that Mr. Obama would prevail in the House, and he might even lose in the Senate, where Democrats have a majority. Yet it would be hard to “un-ring the bell,” as one Congressional aide put it, and act without Congress, having asked once."

She Writes About News', 'Politics', 'Culture. Her Columns Appear On Wednesday', 'Sunday.

But in a Facebook post called “Let Allah Sort it Out,” the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee-turned-Fox News personality let President Obama have it.

It was Obama, she said, who painted himself into a corner a year ago when he said that chemical weapons represented a “red line” that Syria’s president should not cross. (His actual statement was slightly more vague than what many people recall. But he did use the phrase “red line” and it did appear that Syria crossed it on Aug. 21, when some 1,400 Syrians died in Damascus suburbs as a result of chemical bombs.)

In nine typically antagonistic paragraphs, Palin managed to sum up the feelings of many Americans on both sides of the partisan divide who believe that Obama has not yet laid out a persuasive case for American military intervention in yet another strife-torn Middle Eastern nation.

“So we’re bombing Syria because Syria is bombing Syria? And I’m the idiot?” wrote Palin, apparently still stinging at some of the barbs directed at her intellect during the 2008 presidential campaign and after, when she became a heroine of the tea party wing of the GOP.

“We didn’t intervene when over 100,000 Syrians were tragically slaughtered by various means, but we’ll now intervene to avenge the tragic deaths of over 1,000 Syrians killed by chemical weapons, though according to the White House we’re not actually planning to take out the chemical weapons because doing so would require ‘too much of a commitment.’”

(She seems to be referring to Obama’s statement Friday during a meeting with Baltic leaders in which he spoke of the need to take a “limited, narrow act” against Syria. “Again, I repeat, we’re not considering any open-ended commitment. We’re not considering any boots on the ground approach.”)

In any case, like many Americans, Palin wondered what the ultimate American goal in Syria would be: “President Obama wants to do what, exactly? Punish evil acts in the form of a telegraphed air strike on Syria to serve as a deterrent? If our invasion of Iraq wasn’t enough of a deterrent to stop evil men from using chemical weapons on their own people, why do we think this will be?... Do we really think our actions help either side or stop them from hurting more civilians?”

On Saturday, bowing to pressure that included a letter signed by 200 bipartisan members of Congress, the president unexpectedly announced he would seek congressional approval before deciding whether to bomb Syria in retaliation for what Secretary of State John Kerry called a “crime against humanity.”

House Speaker John Boehner, the Ohio Republican, said that the House of Representatives would take up the matter the week of Sept. 9, after its summer recess.

Palin, whose statement on Facebook had garnered more than 77,000 “likes” by early Saturday evening, ended with a familiar snarky sentiment that she has expressed in the past:

“If we are dangerously uncertain of the outcome and are led into war by a Commander-in-chief who can’t recognize that this conflict is pitting Islamic extremists against an authoritarian regime with both sides shouting ‘Allah Akbar’ at each other,” wrote Palin, “then let Allah sort it out.”

That’s how Obama officials are explaining Secretary Kerry’s intense efforts to move Israel onto the front burner and shove over the bloody turmoil immediately affecting millions of Israel’s neighbors and the imminent catastrophe of an Iranian nuclear weapon.

Speaking to reporters on July 30, 2013, senior officials said the administration was seeking “to avoid a train wreck” at the United Nations. “Throughout the course of this year Palestinians have been making clear that if they couldn’t see progress on the peace front, their intention would be to seek other elevations of their status… at the UN.” They explained a “new dynamic vis-à-vis the United Nations,” was driving the immediacy for renewed talks.

The comments mirror Secretary Kerry’s remarks in June: “the Palestinians have said that they will go to the UN and seek to join more UN organizations… And the Palestinians have also threatened to take their case to the International Criminal Court.”

Now Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has generously promised to delay those moves during the next nine months of talks.

The claim that the United Nations – and more specifically, the Arab stranglehold over its output – is genuinely intimidating the President of the United States ought to ring major alarm bells for anyone under the impression that elected American representatives set American foreign policy.

So how true is it?

The new faux peace negotiations between Israel and a Palestinian leader who doesn’t control the land or the people he purports to represent follow months of hysterical pressure from UN quarters.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on June 3, 2013 in Washington: “We are approaching a point of no return in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict… This may well be the last chance for the two-State solution.” On June 18, 2013, Ban told a UN Palestinian committee meeting in Beijing: “I cannot stress enough the risk of missing the current window of opportunity.”

No doubt the UN’s goal has been to remove Arabs murdering other Arabs from the top spot on newswires around the world and replace it with stories about Jews constructing apartment buildings.

But the UN noise-making has been neatly dovetailing with the noises coming from Secretary Kerry, who told the Foreign Affairs Committee on April 17, 2013: “I believe the window for a two-state solution is shutting… We have… a year, a year and a half to two years–or it’s over.” On June 3, 2013, he said: “We’re running out of time… [I]f we do not succeed now, we may not get another chance.” Events, he said, “could literally slam the door on a two-state solution.”

As Kerry worked over Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, periodic announcements issued forth from the UN Secretary-General, such as: “We all need to support Secretary of State Kerry’s courageous initiative.”

From a UN perspective, the drumbeating makes perfect sense. Settled (and fatuous) UN policy has long been that “the Israeli-Palestinian conflict” lies at the heart of the failure to deliver world peace. And the nub of that conflict, as Ban Ki-moon repeated in June, was “the occupation, now nearing half a century.” Even the nomenclature of the “Arab-Israeli conflict,” alluding in part to 65 years of Arab rejection of the Jewish state, has been quietly retired.

But what about the American perspective?

When the Palestinians threaten to use the United Nations to act unilaterally, that is a violation of their obligations under the UN’s own Security Council-endorsed Middle East Road Map which demands a negotiated settlement. The supposed Palestinian “gift” of not using the UN to orchestrate another end run around negotiations is really not giving anything at all. It is reneging on the outcome of prior negotiations.

Actually, those prior agreements were already broken by the Palestinians last year. In the fall of 2012 the Palestinians stage-managed a UN spectacle in which they renamed themselves “the state of Palestine” and acquired the status of UN “non-member observer state.” Instead of a major negative response from President Obama, however, they achieved just the opposite.

The administration has been doing its damnedest to get Congress to annul the negative financial fallout experienced merely by the UN agency UNESCO. On every other front, U.S. dollars have just kept flowing, and it is diplomatic business as usual. In fact, the ransom floated before Palestinians grew. In April, Kerry gushed about an economic strategy for Palestinians that would “involve the U.S. Export-Import Bank, Overseas Private Investment Corp., and U.S. Agency for International Development, as well as American corporations.”

The Palestinians got the message: using the UN was a huge success. President Obama and Secretary Kerry were sufficiently cowed by the prospect of more unilateral UN undertakings that the only possible next step was to come down hard on Israel and force it to release convicted Palestinian murderers from Israeli prisons. A hundred are due to be set free in “exchange” for the Palestinians hitting the UN-pause button.

So let’s get this twisted tale straight. Palestinians have magnanimously agreed not to pursue unilateral UN actions – in direct contravention of their previous promises – and not to attempt to prosecute Israel at the “neutral” International Criminal Court (whose statute has a provision written specifically to target Israel). And the Obama administration pretends it is doing Israel a favor by bringing the Palestinians to the table because Washington’s hands are tied by the UN. That would be the same UN that is dependent on American taxpayer dollars for its next breath.

The reality looks more like this.

The UN and the Palestinians are doing exactly what the President of the United States and his Secretary of State want. Set aside crimes against humanity in Syria. Millions of Egyptians on the streets can wait. Iran’s next terror victims can forget about it.

Just like UN Israel-haters have always said, it turns out that this American administration also believes that Israel is the root cause of the world’s problems. Bludgeoning Israel is the UN’s – and President Obama’s – game.

Israel is asking the Obama administration not to arm Syrian rebels unless it can carefully screen them to ensure no weapons would fall into the hands of terrorists groups, the Israeli ambassador to the United States tells CNN.

""If it were decided to provide lethal assistance, we ask those groups be carefully vetted,"" Ambassador Michael Oren said Wednesday. He declined to offer specifics but broadly indicated the matter has come up in recent weeks - in the general time frame of visits to Israel by President Barack Obama, Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.

Neighboring Jordan and Turkey have expressed similar concerns.



U.S. officials believe that a number of militant groups - including the al-Nusra Front, an al Qaeda-linked group - as well as Iranian-backed militias and Hezbollah units are operating in Syria and have even infiltrated the opposition.

The Israelis are particularly concerned that al-Nusra now controls territory near the Israeli border, where it would pose a threat if it gained control of rockets and mortars that might be initially supplied to the opposition.

In making its case to the White House, Israel has also pointed out that after thousands of Libyan weapons went uncontrolled as that regime fell, many turned up in the Sinai and Gaza regions within days, posing a threat to Israel.

U.S. officials have maintained that all options for Syria are on the table but have privately indicated arming the rebels is not something likely to be decided upon soon, in part because of the opposition from neighboring countries.

A senior U.S. official tells CNN that U.S. intelligence personnel have been conducting some ""vetting"" of opposition forces in Jordan and Turkey, but that mainly is being to facilitate the receipt of non-lethal aid and to conduct some limited training."

USA TODAY

U.S. intelligence has vetted the rebel forces

NATO member Turkey has air bases and ports U.S. forces have used

U.S. presence in Syria will probably be very small

AMMAN, Jordan — Now that President Obama has decided to provide military assistance to Syrian rebels, the next step is not difficult, said a military analyst who's been studying the Syria conflict.

U.S. intelligence has vetted the rebel forces to determine who should get the arms, and it has a willing middleman in Turkey on Syria's northern border, said Christopher Harmer, an analyst with the Institute for the Study or War.

Turkey, a NATO member, has air bases and ports U.S. forces have used to move equipment and people to conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, he said.

Turkey's Incirlak Air Base, which is technically a NATO air base, is one likely hub for U.S.-supplied weapons intended for the rebels, Harmer said.

""The U.S. moves cargo through there all the time,"" Harmer said. Establishing a supply route to the rebels ""is not that hard.""

Tony Badran, an analyst with the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said Syrian troop movements toward the major rebel stronghold Aleppo could disrupt that well-worn supply route in Syria.

""It's a very important area for weapons supplies because it's close to the border with Turkey, and the countryside along the border with Turkey is really where all those weapons come in,"" Badran said.

The United States has been sending communication equipment to rebels of the Free Syrian Army through Turkey. Rebels have picked up shipments in Istanbul and driven them across the border into Syria along secure routes.

Turkey has sea ports for larger shipments. Most of the arms rebel leaders have requested are light weapons, chief among them shoulder-fired missiles. The missiles are wanted to shoot down Syrian aircraft or disable Syrian tanks.

If the United States agrees to provide such weapons, they can be delivered to Turkey by air, Harmer said. Arms could then travel by truck or rail to the Turkish border with Syria, and that's where U.S. control over the weapons will probably end, Harmer said.

The effort depends on Turkish cooperation. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has allowed weapons from Saudi Arabia and Qatar to move through his country, and he supports the toppling of Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime.

The Syrian rebels control at least 20 miles of Syrian territory south of the Turkish border, ""so there's really no mechanical way for the Syrian government to stop them,"" Harmer said.

There is a risk that Syria will directly attack Turkey over the shipments. Syria has fired missiles into Turkish territory along the border to target weapons shipments and rebel fighters seeking protection. Turkey has hosted about 1 million Syrian refugees, and rebels have camps there as well.

The U.S. presence in Syria will probably be very small, limited to CIA or Special Forces operators, and focused on identifying rebel groups they can trust, Harmer said.

""We don't want to provide weapons to al-Qaeda affiliates"" who are also fighting the government in Syria, he said.

When the conflict started, the rebels' identity and motivations were not well understood. Harmer said two years have changed that situation. The Institute for the Study of War and other independent groups have completed extensive studies on the various rebel groups.

""We know from open sources, YouTube videos and interviews who are secular freedom lovers and who are the extremist religious types,"" Harmer said.

Rebel leaders have reported Syrian government forces moving toward Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north and a hub for rebel operations and supplies and fighters coming from Turkey.

The massing of troops for a possible offensive on Aleppo has led to ""a major freakout"" among rebel supporters about whether the divided city will fall to a combined assault by government forces and fighters from Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shiite militia in Lebanon, Badran said.

Assad used a combination of total siege, artillery bombardment and hundreds of Hezbollah ground forces to overtake Qusair last week after a battle that lasted almost a month, but that approach will be much more difficult in Aleppo, Badran said.

Rebels control most of the countryside between Aleppo and Turkey to the north, and activists on the ground report that the Turks have secured all the border crossings, in preparation for weapons shipments to start flowing, he said.

The timing of Obama's announcement provides political cover to other U.S. allies, such as the British, French, Turks, Qatar and Saudi Arabia that are poised to start supplying rebels in earnest, he said.

""To lock down Aleppo like the regime did in Qusair is not going to be as easy,"" Badran said.

The Free Syrian Army has been complaining over a lack of weapons since last year. What they mainly have is small arms and grenades taken from regime forces or smuggled through from Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, sometimes paid for by Gulf states such as Qatar.

""A couple of countries have been doing that already through Turkey or Jordan,"" said Hozan Ibrahim, a Syrian opposition activist based in Berlin. ""It is not an obvious cooperation, but they are doing that underground, undercover, and that is totally OK with us. And of course, in Turkey, there is the headquarters of the Syrian army.""

Commanders say that as the conflict has dragged on, more regime soldiers have defected and foreign fighters have joined the battle, rebels' technical know-how has grown.

""At the beginning of the revolution, we used to buy arms from the regime's shabiha (thugs),"" said Abu Jarah, leader of Al al-Bait Battalions in Binish-Idlib, part of the opposition forces. ""The regime wanted to get rid of all its damaged arms, so they pushed them onto the streets.

""We used to buy them for high prices because our need to defend ourselves was urgent. Meanwhile, they used that money to buy advanced, more lethal weapons. After that, some traders in Aleppo assisted us through Turkey, Lebanon and the Jordanian borders near Daraa.

""Now, we've started to manufacture and develop our own weapons,"" he said. ""The Syrian people get the means to defend themselves any way they can.""

Still, shortages are everywhere, and the FSA needs help. Qatar money has been drying up, and as Hezbollah has become increasingly involved, fewer arms are flowing across the Lebanese border.

""First of all, we need some international coalition of the willing,"" Ibrahim said. ""If the U.S. openly starts arming, then the other countries will have more courage to start arming us, too. Otherwise, we will continue where we are: a situation where nobody is willing to act really and people continue to die while the radicals are gaining more and more ground.""

Pat Smith, whose son died in the Benghazi attack reacts to the hearings on ‘The Lead with Jake Tapper’ CNN today 4pm ET

(CNN) —

Late on the night of last September 11, U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens spoke to his deputy for the final time from the diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.

“Greg, we’re under attack,” Stevens told Gregory Hicks.

Within hours, Stevens and three other Americans were dead, victims of an armed terrorist assault that has since become a political and foreign policy flashpoint in Washington’s partisan wars.

The dramatic narrative recounted by Hicks at a six-hour Republican-led House hearing on Wednesday reflected the knowledge of a high-level insider who was in Libya that long night and was deeply involved in trying to react to events.

His efforts to determine the circumstances of the attack and muster help for those under siege in eastern Libya were later praised by his superiors and by President Barack Obama.

The step-by-step account riveted the Oversight Committee proceeding that was also marked by sharp partisan exchanges over the merits of continued congressional inquiries over the attack.

What the Obama administration has said about the Libya attack

Republicans once again accused the Obama administration of trying to cover up the fact that it was a well-orchestrated assault by militants, failing to adequately explain events to the public, and then refusing to cooperate with congressional investigators.

Democrats once again accused Republicans of using tragedy for political gain.

Hicks – praised by Republicans as a “whistleblower” but who says he has since been effectively demoted – was joined at the witness table by Eric Nordstrom, a former regional security officer in Libya, and Mark Thompson, the State Department’s acting deputy assistant secretary for counterterrorism.

Our goal “is to get answers, declared committee chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California. “The administration, however, has not been cooperative.”

Hicks described in personal detail how he missed Stevens’ initial call and then reached him by cell phone as the attack unfolded in phases.

“I got the ambassador on the other end and he said, ‘Greg, we’re under attack.’”

He recounted the efforts of a security response team on site that drove back the attackers, and “repeated attempts” by those on the ground to enter the burning compound to try and rescue Stevens and others.

He then said that Stevens was at a hospital that was controlled by a group that he said Twitter feeds identified as leading the attack. Was it a trap to lure more Americans?

Then the worst news about his boss.

“I received a call from the prime minister of Libya. I think it’s the saddest phone call I’ve ever had in my life. He told me that Ambassador Stevens had passed away,” Hicks said.

Mother of Benghazi victim: I blame Hillary

A slow-to-evolve explanation

Oversight committee Republicans continued to go after televised remarks by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice five days after the attack. In them, she insisted it was the result of a spontaneous demonstration over an anti-Islam film that turned violent.

GOP critics believe Rice was shielding Obama at the height of his re-election campaign during which there were times that he trumpeted U.S. successes in combating terrorism, including the death of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 2011.

Administration officials say Rice was using official talking points that relied on the best available information at the time.

Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-North Carolina, asked Hicks if there was any evidence early on that the attack was a protest.

“No, there was none,” Hicks said. “I’m confident Ambassador Stevens would have reported a protest immediately if one appeared on his door.”

Hicks also said an inflammatory anti-Muslim YouTube video initially cited as a cause of the alleged protest was “a non-event in Libya.”

He previously insisted administration officials immediately knew the culprit was al Qaeda.

“I think everybody in the mission thought it was a terrorist attack from the beginning,” Hicks told investigators in interviews before the hearings.

In fact, Hicks said during the hearing that he was told by the Libyan president soon afterward that elements with possible terror links were thought to be behind the assault.

The veteran diplomat said his “jaw dropped” and he was both “stunned” and “embarrassed” when Rice said the attack was a response to the YouTube video.

Boehner calls for White House to release Benghazi emails

Hicks also argued the U.S. military could have blunted the attack by scrambling intimidating military aircraft from Italy’s Aviano Air Base – an assertion denied by Joint Chiefs Chairman Martin Dempsey when he testified before Congress in February.

Dempsey told Congress it would take up to 20 hours to scramble the aircraft to get to Benghazi; Hicks said he believed it would take two to three hours.

“I was speaking from my perspective … on the ground in Tripoli based on what the defense attache told me,” Hicks said when asked by

Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Oversight panel, asked Hicks if he had any reason to question Dempsey’s assertion.

Finally, Hicks claimed four members of the military were ready to board a plane from Tripoli to Benghazi, but were prevented from doing so by their superiors.

“How did the personnel react at being told to stand down?” asked Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah.

“They were furious,” said Hicks. “I can only say, well, I will quote Lieutenant Colonel Gibson who said, ‘This is the first time in my career that a diplomat has more balls than somebody in the military.’”

Pentagon officials insist the members of the military in question were told not to go to Benghazi because they were not equipped for combat, and were needed in Tripoli to care for wounded headed their way.

Analysis: State Department failed to understand dangerous situation in Benghazi

Nordstrom said in written testimony it was “inexplicable” that a followup internal State Department review ignored “the role senior department leadership played before, during, and after” the attack.

In the run-up to the hearing, Issa trickled out testimony from the witnesses in an apparent attempt to build anticipation for the session, one of several that have occurred in Congress focusing on security at the compound and the administration’s response.

Committee Democrats accused Republicans of engaging in a “smear” campaign.

“What we have seen … is a full-scale media campaign that is not designed to investigate what happened in a responsible and bipartisan way but rather a launch of unfounded accusations to smear public officials,” Cummings said.

White House spokesman Jay Carney also weighed in, telling reporters that the Benghazi attack “is a subject that has from its beginning been subject to attempts to politicize it by Republicans.”

He defended defended the administration has “made extraordinary efforts to work with” Congress on multiple investigations.

Four Americans killed in Benghazi: Why?

Accusation of playing politics

For its part, the State Department also accused House Republicans of playing politics with the tragedy.

“This is not sort of a collaborative process where the committee is working directly with us in trying to establish facts that would help, you know, as we look to keep our people safe overseas in a very complex environment,” State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said on Monday.

Wednesday’s hearing is another chapter in what has become an epic back and forth between Democrats and Republicans on Benghazi, partly stemming from Rice’s televised comments. The comments are widely believed to have cost her a likely nomination to succeed Hillary Clinton as secretary of state.

Some congressional Republicans previously sharply questioned Clinton over the administration’s explanation of events and the state of security at the compound at the time of the attack.

Clinton has said that she accepted responsibility for the deaths, declaring that as secretary of state, she was “in charge of the State Department’s 60,000-plus people all over the world.”

In January, Clinton testified for more than five hours before the House and Senate Foreign Relations committees. In her testimony, she acknowledged a “systematic breakdown” on Benghazi and said her department was taking additional steps to increase U.S. security at diplomatic posts.

At one point at that hearing, Clinton barely controlled her anger as she responded to a lawmaker who pressed her on the administration’s post-attack storyline.

Critics have questioned the validity of continued congressional scrutiny, especially Democrats, who say Republicans are only interested in discrediting the administration and hurting Clinton’s chances if she were to run for president in 2016.

Former deputy chief of mission in Libya: U.S. military assets told to stand down

One Republican congressman, Ohio’s Jim Jordan, used the hearing to criticize top Clinton adviser Cheryl Mills.

Hicks said he received a call from Mills, who he added was not happy that a State Department lawyer – described by Republicans as a minder – was excluded from a briefing on Benghazi in Libya with Hicks, a Republican congressman and others.

Hicks has been “praised by everybody who counts, the president, the secretary, everyone above him,” Jordan said. “And yet now, they’re obstructing – because he won’t – he won’t help them cover this up.”

But former Clinton aide Philppe Reines disputed that characterization, saying the State Department took a cooperative approach with Congress. He said in a written statement that Mills had, in fact, called Hicks to support him.

“She wanted (people on the ground in Libya) to know that no matter how far away they were from home, they weren’t alone,” Reines said. “She was with them, and most importantly (Secretary Clinton) was with them.”

The president had hoped to use the meeting of the Group of 20 nations to build pressure on Congress as it considers whether to authorize missile strikes against Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government.

Before leaving for Washington, Obama said at a news conference that he would make his case in an address from the White House on Tuesday, an acknowledgment that his plans remain divisive both abroad and at home.

“This is not something that I think a lot of folks around the world, you know, find an appetizing set of choices,” he said. “But the question is, do these norms mean something? And if we’re not acting, what does that say?”

The president had to settle for a carefully worded statement backed by representatives of 10 countries that said Assad should be held accountable for an alleged nerve gas attack on Damascus suburbs two weeks ago, but did not explicitly support military action or promise participation. Among those who did not endorse the statement was the summit’s host, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Assad’s closest ally.

Obama and Putin pulled up two chairs in a corner and talked for more than 20 minutes Friday, almost entirely about Syria. The leaders have exchanged harsh words, but Putin called the talk “friendly” and Obama said it was “candid and constructive.” But it did not break their impasse over how to respond to the suspected chemical weapons attack or how to end the 21/2-year-old Syrian civil war.

“We both remained unconvinced by each other’s opinion,” Putin said at a news conference. “But there is a dialogue. We hear each other, we understand arguments, but we don’t agree with them.”

Putin added that Russia will continue to supply weapons to Assad in his battle against the rebel opposition. Local news reports said three Russian ships and possibly a fourth were headed to the eastern Mediterranean, where the United States has four guided missile destroyers and an amphibious ship with 300 Marines.

At a dinner that stretched into the morning hours Friday, world leaders vigorously debated Obama’s plan, with many saying the president should wait for the United Nations to complete a report on the Aug. 21 attack and sanction a response. Obama argued that the U.N. Security Council was paralyzed by disagreement. Russia and China, which have veto power, have blocked efforts at the Security Council to put pressure on Assad.

Obama’s plan for what he emphasizes would be “limited and not open-ended” strikes also remains unpopular in the United States. The statement and the heated discussion was a reminder of what Obama has called “a heavy lift” as he seeks to sell lawmakers and the American public on the need for a military response.

The Senate could take the first vote on the issue as soon as Wednesday, but the House should “expect a robust debate” and a vote in the “next two weeks,” Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) said.

The Obama administration had resisted intervention in the war, but switched course after the alleged chemical weapons attack, which U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded killed more than 1,400 people.

On Friday, Obama compared his bid for action to humanitarian intervention in Kosovo in 1999 and the U.S. failure to stop the genocide in Rwanda in 1994. He cast the international division as the result of war-weary leaders “rationalizing not making tough choices.” The United States alone, he said, shoulders the burden of enforcing international agreements on human rights and chemical warfare.

“There are times where we have to make hard choices if we’re going to stand up for the things that we care about. And I believe that this is one of those times,” Obama said.

But Obama did not persuade a single ally to endorse a specific action. Immediately after he spoke, the White House released the joint statement from Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Spain and Turkey, as well as the United States. It found that evidence “clearly points” to Assad’s government as responsible for the attack, called for a “strong international response to this grave violation of the world’s rules and conscience” and asserted that “the world cannot wait for endless failed processes.”

The statement did not specifically endorse military action, but concluded, “We support efforts undertaken by the United States and other countries to reinforce the prohibition on the use of chemical weapons.”

A White House official, however, said there was no question what that implied. “The president has been very clear about how he intends to do that with tailored military action,” a senior administration official said.

The president has insisted that he does not need congressional authorization, but reiterated Friday that it would make a U.S. response “more effective and stronger.”

Obama would not say whether he will launch missiles even if he loses the vote. Pressed on the issue, Obama was blunt. “You’re not getting a direct response,” he said. “I’m not going to engage in parlor games.”

In his absence from Washington on Friday, Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John F. Kerry and Chief of Staff Denis McDonough worked the phones; U.S. officials briefed members of Congress; and Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, gave a speech at a think tank, arguing, “The use of limited military force can strengthen our diplomacy and energize the efforts by the U.N. and others.”

But there is something else that goes without saying, but still needs to be said loudly: We, America, are not just hired lawyers negotiating a deal for Israel and the Sunni Gulf Arabs, which they alone get the final say on. We, America, have our own interests in not only seeing Iran’s nuclear weapons capability curtailed, but in ending the 34-year-old Iran-U.S. cold war, which has harmed our interests and those of our Israeli and Arab friends.

Hence, we must not be reluctant about articulating and asserting our interests in the face of Israeli and Arab efforts to block a deal that we think would be good for us and them. America’s interests today lie in an airtight interim nuclear deal with Iran that also opens the way for addressing a whole set of other issues between Washington and Tehran.

Some of our allies don’t share those “other” interests and believe the only acceptable outcome is bombing Iran’s nuclear facilities and keeping Iran an isolated, weak, pariah state. They don’t trust this Iranian regime — and not without reason. I don’t begrudge their skepticism. Without pressure from Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and the global sanctions on Iran they helped to spur, Iran would not be offering to scale back its nuclear program today."

Instead, this president’s extraordinary passivity in the face of crisis may have achieved its apotheosis this week. On Wednesday, as Egyptian security forces gunned down hundreds of civilians in the streets of Cairo, an unperturbed Obama shot another round of golf at Martha’s Vineyard. His deputy press secretary was left to explain to reporters that the administration remained firmly committed to not deciding whether what had happened in Egypt was a coup.

When the president finally deigned to address the crisis himself, on Thursday morning, the result was measured rhetoric — “deplorable” — accompanied by a classic half-measure: A biennial military exercise scheduled for next month will be canceled, sparing the White House some unseemly photo ops. But the deeper relationship with the Egyptian military, including $1.3 billion in annual aid, remains in place.

The crisis in Egypt has been distracting attention from the civil war in Syria, where Obama’s stubborn refusal to act has facilitated the emergence of the largest and potentially most dangerous incarnation of al-Qaeda since pre-2001 Afghanistan. Between them, Egypt and Syria prevent most people from thinking much about Yemen — except when an al-Qaeda plot to take over much of the country prompts the closure of the U.S. Embassy and a frantic-looking burst of drone strikes. And never mind Bahrain, another close U.S. ally where another autocratic regime is brutally suppressing protests this week without a peep of objection from Washington.

Obama looks like a president in full flight from a world that looks nothing like what he imagined when he took office. The president saw himself soothing U.S. relations with Muslim nations while gently extracting U.S. troops from Iraq and focusing his energy on other regions and issues: Asia; nuclear arms control; Israeli-Palestinian peace. What he got was an epochal upheaval in the very place from which he had hoped to disengage.

All presidents face the challenge of adapting to the problems they are presented with rather than those they expect. It could be argued that George W. Bush reacted to the attacks of Sept. 11 with a too-radical reshaping of his worldview and international ambitions. Obama’s response to the Arab revolutions has veered to the opposite extreme: a clinging to his overtaken priorities, coupled with a stubborn refusal to recognize that the Arab crises must be a top priority of his foreign policy.

In the last year, U.S. allies in the Middle East and Europe have marveled as Obama doggedly pursued a patently futile attempt to engage Russian strongman Vladi­mir Putin in another round of nuclear arms reduction talks even while tolerating toxic Russian intervention in Syria and rejecting his own national security team’s proposal for U.S. action. They have scratched their heads as Secretary of State John F. Kerry, with Obama’s blessing, has made the renewal of moribund Israeli-Palestinian talks his central focus while keeping a safe distance from Egypt.

Incredibly, some officials close to Kerry were arguing in recent weeks that one reason not to designate Egypt’s coup a coup was to avoid dampening the Mideast “peace process” — whose prospects for success are invisible to all outside the administration, including the Israelis and Palestinians themselves. Never mind the burning city, goes the logic; we’ve got our hands full building this Potemkin village.

The Arab revolutions demand bold initiatives from the United States and any other outside power seeking to influence their outcome. Airstrikes to break the Syrian military would have been one; a cutoff of military aid to Egypt would have been another. But in foreign policy, Obama is a president of half-measures, of endless internal debates followed by split-the-difference presidential decisions that serve no one’s strategy. Instead of an intervention in Syria that might make a difference, token shipments of arms are being sent to the rebels; instead of a decisive break with Egypt’s out-of-control generals, a pointless exercise is called off.

If there is any virtue to this record, it is that the reaction to it is reviving an internationalist wing of the Democratic Party that, by the end of the Bush administration, appeared nearly dead. Not just the usual neocons but Democratic senators such as Carl Levin and Robert Menendez are faulting Obama’s failure to act more forcefully in Syria. Not just Republicans John McCain and Lindsey Graham but the New York Times editorial board aredemanding a suspension of military aid to Egypt.

Obama may have meant to retire the doctrine of the United States as the world’s “indispensible nation.” Instead, the disastrous results of his persistent passivity may lead to its revival.

* Lawmakers have broad array of concerns

* Heated debate expected when Congress returns Sept. 9

* Kerry warns lawmakers of risk to Israel

By Matt Spetalnick and Patricia Zengerle

WASHINGTON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama and his top aides launched a full-scale political offensive on Sunday to persuade a skeptical Congress to approve a military strike against Syria, but faced an uphill struggle to win over many lawmakers and a war-weary American public.

Obama made a series of calls to members of the House of Representatives and Senate, with more scheduled for Monday, underscoring the task confronting the administration before it can go ahead with using force in response to a deadly chemical attack blamed on the Syrian government.

Dozens of lawmakers, some in tennis shirts or shirtsleeves, cut short their vacations and streamed into the corridors of the Capitol building for a Sunday afternoon intelligence briefing on Syria with Obama's national security team.

When they emerged nearly three hours later, there was no immediate sign that the many skeptics in Congress had changed their minds.

""I am very concerned about taking America into another war against a country that hasn't attacked us,"" said Representative Janice Hahn, a California Democrat. On the way out of the briefing, she said the participants appeared ""evenly divided"" on whether to give Obama approval.

None expressed doubts that Syria had engaged in chemical warfare. ""The searing image of babies lined up dead, that's what I can't get out of my mind right now,"" Democratic Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz said after the closed-door briefing.

But the credibility of the administration's intelligence is turning out to be a less important issue than the nature and usefulness of the response.

Earlier in the day, Secretary of State John Kerry invoked the crimes of Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein and warned of a potential threat to Israel a day after Obama's decision to delay an imminent attack on Syrian targets and allow Congress to vote on it first.

Even as Kerry took to the airwaves touting new evidence that deadly sarin gas was used in the Aug. 21 chemical attack near Damascus, the scope of the challenge confronting the administration became apparent.

Lawmakers raised a broad array of concerns, including the potential effectiveness of limited strikes, the possible unintended consequence of dragging the United States into another open-ended Middle East conflict, the wisdom of acting without broader international backing to share the burden and the war fatigue of the American public.

Many in Congress have been able to avoid taking a position on the merits of a military strike, focusing instead on demands that Obama consult them and seek their approval.

While Kerry predicted Obama would win the endorsement he wants, a growing cacophony of congressional critics - ranging from liberal Democratic doves to Republican Tea Party conservatives - illustrated just how hard that will be.

At the same time, Kerry, the administration's most impassioned voice for intervention in Syria's 2-1/2-year civil war, was left to publicly defend Obama's stunning reversal, a decision that puts any strike on hold for at least nine days.

""This is squarely now in the hands of Congress,"" Kerry told CNN, saying he had confidence ""they will do what is right because they understand the stakes.""

In a round of television appearances, Kerry declined to say whether Obama would go ahead with military action if Congress rejects the president's request, as Britain's parliament did last week to derail London's role in any Syria military operation.

But, echoing Obama's comments in the White House Rose Garden on Saturday, he insisted the president had the right to act on his own if he chooses that course.

Obama is taking a gamble by putting the brakes on the military assault that he considers essential to maintain U.S. credibility after Assad crossed the ""red line"" set against the use of chemical weapons.

MORE EVIDENCE

The consensus on Capitol Hill is that Obama has a good chance of winning approval in the Democratic-led Senate, but the vote appears too close to call in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, where the president's opponents rarely miss an opportunity to block him.

Acknowledging that the administration has its work cut out for it to persuade some lawmakers, Kerry insisted they could not ""have it both ways"" by demanding a voice in the matter and then abdicating responsibility to uphold the international bans on chemical weapons use.

Kerry used the television appearances to provide further evidence backing accusations against the Syrian government.

""I can share with you today that blood and hair samples that have come to us through an appropriate chain of custody, from east Damascus, from first responders, it has tested positive for signatures of sarin,"" Kerry told CNN's ""State of the Union.""

It was the first time the administration had pinpointed what kind of chemical was used in the attack on a rebel-held area, which U.S. intelligence agencies said killed more than 1,400 people, many of them children.

""So this case is building and this case will build,"" Kerry told CBS's ""Face the Nation.""

OBAMA'S DILEMMA

Obama's efforts are sure to be hampered by his dismal relations with congressional Republicans. Another bitter face-off on government spending is looming this autumn.

Lawmakers for the most part welcomed Obama's decision to consult them, but looked in no hurry to reconvene early from their summer recess, which lasts until Sept. 9.

Comments from leading Republicans and Democrats indicated how complex the debate will be - and raised doubts whether Obama would win their authorization.

Underscoring a sense of wariness even from Obama's traditional allies, a spokesman for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy said the Vermont Democrat believes that the use-of-force resolution offered by the White House is too broad and that new language will be written for consideration.

Mike Rogers, Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN: ""I think there are some real challenges. I think that at the end of the day, Congress will rise to the occasion. This is a national security issue.""

Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, speaking on NBC, took a more skeptical view.

While saying he was ""proud"" of Obama for coming to Congress for authority, Paul said, ""It's at least 50-50 whether the House will vote down the involvement in the Syrian war.""

""I think the Senate will rubber stamp what he wants,"" he said. ""The House will be a much closer vote."" The Senate is controlled by Obama's Democratic Party, the House is in the hands of the Republican Party.

Republican Senator John McCain said he was not sure Obama's request would pass, but made clear his view that tougher military action was needed than the limited cruise missile strikes that the Obama administration is preparing.

Republican Representative Peter King of New York said it was unclear if lawmakers would sign off on an attack on Syria, but he warned Obama may have to overcome ""the isolationist wing"" of the Republican Party to prevail.

Seeking to lay the groundwork for what is expected to be a heated congressional debate, Kerry tipped his hand on one tactic the administration will use - linking the congressional vote to safeguarding U.S. ally Israel from the Syrian chemical weapons threat.

""I don't think they will want to vote, ultimately, to put Israel at risk,"" Kerry said.

Lawmakers of both major political parties recognize how important it is to be seen as defenders of Israel, especially at election time, when they compete to show voters who is a better friend of the Jewish state.

“I’m not aware of any doubt that exists,” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters. “I think that maybe if you take Bashar al-Assad seriously on these matters, you might have some doubt, but there’s no evidence to suggest that he has any credibility when it come to his statements about the use of chemical weapons in Syria.”

Assad’s government has the rocket capability employed in the attack, Carney said. The Syrian government used chemical weapons earlier in the civil war, he said, and was engaged in an assault against the targeted suburbs of Damascus prior to last Wednesday’s attack.

“We see no evidence of any alternative scenario,” Carney said.

Obama’s top spokesman insisted the president has not yet made a decision about how to respond to last week’s attack, which rebels say killed hundreds of people.

Obama continued his round of phone calls to world leaders, speaking to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper about their shared opposition to the use of chemical weapons. Obama has spoken in recent days to leaders in Britain, France and Australia.

Vice President Joseph Biden and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel were also speaking with their foreign counterparts.

U.S. forces are ready to strike if Obama gives the order, Hagel told the BBC on Tuesday.

Carney declined to explain what the president meant when he said last week that an attack by one country on another without a United Nations mandate would raise “questions in terms of whether international law supports it.”

But he suggested that the other criteria the president stated in an interview last week with CNN – “clear evidence that can be presented” – has practically been met.

“The intelligence community is working on an assessment, and we will have conclusions that can be provided to the public available this week,” Carney said. “But I think it’s important to note that it is clear already that chemical weapons were used on a large scale, undeniable, and that the Assad regime is the only possible force that could have deployed them.”

“There has to be a response to that clear violation of international norms,” he said.

A department official acknowledged Sunday that the extradition process had broken down during discussions between the United States and Hong Kong.

Snowden was never detained in Hong Kong or “under any kind of police protection” while he was staying in Hong Kong, said a department official, speaking anonymously because of the delicate matter of dealing with a host of countries regarding Snowden. The official said that there were delays in getting a criminal warrant to that country and in trying to arrange an extradition hearing.

The former contractor for the National Security Agency flew to Sheremetyevo International Airport in Moscow, the official said. But rather than remaining at the airport “under some kind of asylum,” he was taken by car under some sort of official Russian protection. As he understands it, the official said, Snowden and the Russians can claim he is in a “comfort zone” until he departs, probably on Monday.

“We are nor sure about Cuba as his next stop,” the official cautioned. He said the United States was monitoring Iceland and Ecuador.

The department filed a sealed criminal complaint against Snowden on June 14 that included allegations under the Espionage Act. Department spokeswoman Nanda Chitre said the United States had contacted Hong Kong “based on the criminal complaint filed in the Eastern District of Virginia, and in accordance with the U.S.-Hong Kong Agreement for the Surrender of Fugitive Offenders.”

“We will continue to discuss this matter with Hong Kong and pursue relevant law enforcement cooperation with other countries where Mr. Snowden may be attempting to travel,” Chitre said.

Hong Kong apparently knew where Snowden was staying, said the department official who asked not to be identified, but there was still a delay in tracking and finding him before he suddenly left for Moscow.

There was also the matter of having top officials in Hong Kong brief the Chinese government in Beijing, and both U.S. and Hong Kong officials were still waiting for Beijing to approve his arrest.

“There was a lot of red tape, but we thought it would get done,” the official said.

He added that, while Hong Kong could have legally moved on its own against Snowden, it nevertheless apparently wanted to wait for a blessing from Beijing.

He said further that when the complaint was unsealed Friday evening, and Hong Kong and Beijing realized that two of the three charges fell under the Espionage Act, it suddenly “raised political concerns and put a new dimension into things.”

Gordon', 'Steven Lee Myers']",Obama Calls Russia Offer on Syria Possible ‘Breakthrough’,"Mr. Obama’s statements opening the door to the plan came as support for a resolution authorizing force on Capitol Hill seemed to be receding, with even some who had announced support for it now reversing course. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said Monday evening that he would not take the procedural steps to force an initial vote on authorization of force Wednesday, slowing Senate consideration of the resolution.

A senior Democratic aide said that the developments with the Russian proposal were a significant factor in the delay, which will allow members to consider the plan and also hear from the president, who is scheduled to meet with them at the Capitol on Tuesday in advance of his nationally televised speech to explain his rationale for military force.

Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, made the proposal that could avert a strike earlier in the day, seizing on a seemingly offhand remark by Secretary of State John F. Kerry. Traveling in Britain, Mr. Kerry said that Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, could avoid strikes by agreeing to give up his chemical weapons.

“He could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week — turn it over, all of it, without delay and allow the full and total accounting,” Mr. Kerry said.

Mr. Kerry’s remarks, especially the reference to the short window of time, underscored the urgency of the administration’s preparations for a strike, and it did not appear to signal a shift in policy. The State Department’s spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, later clarified in an e-mail to reporters that Mr. Kerry was simply “making a rhetorical argument about the impossibility and unlikelihood of Assad turning over chemical weapons he has denied using.”"
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/11/opinion/friedman-threaten-to-threaten.html,2013-09-11 00:00:00,['Thomas L. Friedman'],Threaten to Threaten - The New York Times,"If you’re an average American and are confused and worried about us getting embroiled in a no-win Syrian civil war, you’re right to be concerned. It means you’re paying attention. But if you’re a member of Congress or a senator who’s still wondering whether to grant President Obama the authority to use force to deter Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from again murdering hundreds of his people with poison gas, it now makes sense to take a timeout. That also means you’re paying attention.

A new situation has been created in the last two days by the Russian offer — embraced by Obama, all of our major allies and China, but still only vaguely accepted by Syria — for Syria to turn over its stockpiles of poison gas to international control. Let’s have no illusion. There’s still a real possibility that the Russians and Syrians are just stalling and will fudge in the end, and even if one or both are serious, there are formidable logistical and political obstacles to securing Syria’s chemical weapons swiftly and completely. Part of me wonders: Has anybody thought this through?

But all of me wants to acknowledge that if a Syrian surrender of poison gas were implemented — still a big if — it would be a good end to this near-term crisis. The global taboo on poison gas would be upheld, and America would not have to get embroiled in a shooting war in Syria.

In that context, I think it is worth Obama and Congress threatening to schedule a vote to endorse Obama’s threat of force — if the Syrians and Russians don’t act in good faith — but not schedule a vote right now. (That was essentially the president’s message in his speech Tuesday night.) By “threatening to threaten,” Obama retains leverage to keep the Syrians and Russians focused on implementing any agreement — but without having to test Congress’s real willingness to let him fulfill that threat. Because, if it failed to pass, the Russians and Syrians would have no incentive to move."

Will: Obama talks himself into trouble with Syria,"Barack Obama’s foreign policy dream — cordial relations with a Middle East tranquilized by “smart diplomacy” — is in a death grapple with reality. His rhetorical writhings illustrate the perils of loquacity. He has a glutton’s, rather than a gourmet’s, appetite for his own rhetorical cuisine, and he has talked America to the precipice of a fourth military intervention in the crescent that extends from Libya to Afghanistan.

Characterizing the 2011 Libyan project with weirdly passive syntax (“It is our military that is being volunteered by others to carry out missions”), he explained his sashay into Libya’s civil war as preemptive: “I refused to wait for the images of slaughter and mass graves before taking action.”

With characteristic self-satisfaction, Obama embraced the doctrine “R2P” — responsibility to protect civilians — and Libya looked like an opportunity for an inexpensive morality gesture using high explosives.

Last August, R2P reappeared when he startled his staff by offhandedly saying of Syria’s poison gas: “A red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized.” The interesting metric “whole bunch” made his principle mostly a loophole and advertised his reluctance to intervene, a reluctance more sensible than his words last week: Syria’s recidivism regarding gas is “going to require America’s attention and hopefully the entire international community’s attention.” Regarding that entirety: If “community” connotes substantial shared values and objectives, what community would encompass Denmark, Congo, Canada, North Korea, Portugal, Cuba, Norway, Iran, Britain, Saudi Arabia, Poland and Yemen?

Words, however, are so marvelously malleable in the Obama administration that the Oxford English Dictionary’s definition of “coup” (“a change in the government carried out violently or illegally”) somehow does not denote what happened in Egypt. Last week, an Obama spokesman said: “We have made the determination that making a decision about whether or not a coup occurred is not in the best interests of the United States.” So convinced is this White House of its own majesty and of the consequent magic of its words, it considers this a clever way of saying the law is a nuisance.

Section 508 of the Foreign Assistance Act forbids aid to “any country whose duly elected head of government is deposed by military coup” until the president determines that “a democratically elected government” has been restored. Secretary of State John Kerry was perhaps preparing to ignore this when he said something Egypt’s generals have not had the effrontery to claim — that the coup amounted to “restoring democracy.”

Perhaps Section 508 unwisely abridges presidential discretion in foreign policy, where presidents arguably deserve the almost unfettered discretion they, with increasing aggressiveness, assert everywhere. And perhaps if Obama were not compiling such a remarkable record of indifference to law, it would be sensible to ignore his ignoring of this one.

But remember Libya. Since the War Powers Resolution was passed over Richard Nixon’s veto in 1973, presidents have at least taken care to act “consistent with” its limits on unilateral presidential war-making. Regarding Libya, however, Obama was unprecedentedly cavalier, even though he had ample time to act consistent with the Constitution by involving a supportive Congress. As Yale Law School’s Bruce Ackerman then argued:

“Obama has overstepped even the dubious precedent set when President Bill Clinton bombed Kosovo in 1999. Then, the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel asserted that Congress had given its consent by appropriating funds for the Kosovo campaign. It was a big stretch, given the actual facts — but Obama can’t even take advantage of this same desperate expedient, since Congress has appropriated no funds for the Libyan war. The president is simply using money appropriated to the Pentagon for general purposes to conduct the current air campaign.”

Obama is as dismissive of “red lines” he draws as he is of laws others enact. Last week, a State Department spokeswoman said his red line regarding chemical weapons was first crossed “a couple of months ago” and “the president took action” — presumably, announcing (non-lethal) aid to Syrian rebels — although “we’re not going to outline the inventory of what we did.”

The administration now would do well to do something that the head of it has an irresistible urge not to do: Stop talking.

If a fourth military intervention is coming, it will not be to decisively alter events, which we cannot do, in a nation vital to U.S. interests, which Syria is not. Rather, its purpose will be to rescue Obama from his words.

For decades America had defined its interests in utilitarian terms: regional stability, countering terrorism and nuclear proliferation (and, in the cold war years, Soviet influence), defending Israel’s security, assuring the free flow of oil and other commerce. That often meant alliances of convenience with brutal authoritarians.

“But the events of the past six months show us that strategies of repression and strategies of diversion will not work anymore,” the president said. The uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia and Libya had affirmed “that we have a stake not just in the stability of nations, but in the self-determination of individuals. The status quo is not sustainable.” Without renouncing our commitment to those old interests, the president embraced a supplementary set of “core principles”: supporting universal rights, encouraging political and economic reforms, opposing violence and oppression.

“Our support for these principles is not a secondary interest,” he insisted. “Today I want to make it clear that it is a top priority that must be translated into concrete actions and supported by all of the diplomatic, economic and strategic tools at our disposal.”

In the excruciating test that Egypt has become, the president has largely failed to live up to his own eloquently articulated standard. In the two years since his speech — and most shamefully in the eight weeks since the army’s coup — America has seemed not just cautious (caution is good) but timid and indecisive, reactive and shortsighted, stranded between our professed commitment to change and our fear of chaos. One of the administration’s most acute critics, Vali Nasr of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, goes so far as to suggest that United States policy is, whether by design or inertia, coming full circle: back to a pre-Arab Spring, Islamophobic, order-at-all-costs policy that puts us in the cynical company of Saudi Arabia and Russia. Is it any wonder that the generals in Egypt feel they can get away with murder — or, for that matter, that Syria’s Assad thinks he can call our bluff and poison his people with impunity?"

Gordon', 'Eric Schmitt']",U.S. Sends Arms to Aid Iraq Fight With Extremists,"But the counterterrorism effort the United States is undertaking with Iraq has its limits.

Iraq’s foreign minister has floated the idea of having American-operated, armed Predator or Reaper drones respond to the expanding militant network. But Mr. Maliki, who is positioning himself to run for a third term as prime minister and who is sensitive to nationalist sentiment at home, has not formally requested such intervention.

The idea of carrying out such drone attacks, which might prompt the question of whether the Obama administration succeeded in bringing the Iraq war to what the president has called a “responsible end,” also appears to have no support in the White House.

“We have not received a formal request for U.S.-operated armed drones operating over Iraq, nor are we planning to divert armed I.S.R. over Iraq,” said Bernadette Meehan, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, referring to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions. For now, the new lethal aid from the United States, which Iraq is buying, includes a shipment of 75 Hellfire missiles, delivered to Iraq last week. The weapons are strapped beneath the wings of small Cessna turboprop planes, and fired at militant camps with the C.I.A. secretly providing targeting assistance.

In addition, 10 ScanEagle reconnaissance drones are expected to be delivered to Iraq by March. They are smaller cousins of the larger, more capable Predators that used to fly over Iraq.

American intelligence and counterterrorism officials say they have effectively mapped the locations and origins of the Qaeda network in Iraq and are sharing this information with the Iraqis.

Administration officials said the aid was significant because the Iraqis had virtually run out of Hellfire missiles. The Iraqi military, with no air force to speak of and limited reconnaissance of its own, has a very limited ability to locate and quickly strike Qaeda militants as they maneuver in western and northern Iraq. The combination of American-supplied Hellfire air-to-ground missiles, tactical drones and intelligence, supplied by the United States, is intended to augment that limited Iraqi ability.

The Obama administration has given three sensor-laden Aerostat balloons to the Iraqi government, provided three additional reconnaissance helicopters to the Iraqi military and is planning to send 48 Raven reconnaissance drones before the end of 2014. And the United States is planning to deliver next fall the first of the F-16 fighters Iraq has bought."

Pickering. She also briefed lawmakers behind closed doors on Capitol Hill. But the State Department now faces Congressional demands for an independent investigation of the attacks and any security failures that might have added to the death toll.

“In my judgment, which is informed by numerous briefings and discussions with experts, the attack in Benghazi was not a black swan,” Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said at a hearing on Wednesday, “but rather an attack that should have been anticipated, based on the previous attacks against Western targets, the proliferation of dangerous weapons in Libya, the presence of Al Qaeda in that country and the overall threat environment.”

Investigators and intelligence officials are now focusing on the possibility that the attackers were affiliated with, or possibly members of, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb — a branch that originated in Algeria — or at least in communication with it before or during the initial attack at the mission and the second one at the mission’s annex, a half-mile away.

One extremist now under scrutiny is a former detainee at the prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, Abu Sufian Ibrahim Ahmed Hamouda, a Libyan who is a prominent member of an extremist group called Ansar al-Sharia, which some have blamed for the attack. “It is safe to assume that any significant extremist in eastern Libya is going to be under a lot of scrutiny right now,” an American intelligence official said, adding that it was premature to draw any conclusions.

The most significant inconsistency between Libyan and American accounts is whether the attack that night began with a small protest over the trailer of “The Innocence of Muslims,” parts of which were broadcast on Egyptian television. American officials insist there was a protest that began peacefully, only to be hijacked by armed militants. But Libyan witnesses, including two guards at the building, say the area around the compound was quiet until the attackers arrived, firing their weapons and storming the compound from three sides, beginning at 9:30 p.m. on Sept. 11. A witness said that some of those attacking referred to the film’s insults to Islam.

Matthew G. Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, said at a Senate hearing on Wednesday that the authorities believe “this was an opportunistic attack” that “evolved and escalated over several hours.”

What is clear, however, is that those who arrived at the mission — not officially a consulate, though Libyans call it that informally — came intending to inflict maximum damage on the building. They quickly overwhelmed a small security detail that included three guards from a force called the 17th of February Brigade and five Libyans employed by a British security company called Blue Mountain."

Obama says Iran shouldn’t misinterpret U.S. response to Syria

President Obama declared that the United States is still prepared to act militarily to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons despite the decision to pursue a diplomatic deal and not strike Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons.

He also acknowledged that his approach to the Syria crisis has been uneven, but defended it as producing the right results.

Obama spoke in an interview broadcast Sunday on ABC’s “This Week With George Stephanopoulos,” taped Friday before the United States and Russia agreed on a plan to bring Syrian chemical weapons under international control in order to avoid military strikes.

But Obama said Iran should not interpret the diplomatic response — coming after he threatened to use strikes — as suggesting that the United States wouldn’t attack Iran to stop the development of nuclear weapons.

“I think what the Iranians understand is that the nuclear issue is a far larger issue for us than the chemical weapons issue, that the threat . . . against Israel that a nuclear Iran poses is much closer to our core interests,” Obama said. “My suspicion is that the Iranians recognize they shouldn’t draw a lesson that we haven’t struck [Syria] to think we won’t strike Iran.”

Washington Update: Summers bows out in bid for Fed Reserve chief

Obama said, however, that what the Iranians should draw from this episode is that it is possible to resolve this type of disagreement diplomatically.

“My view is that if you have both a credible threat of force, combined with a rigorous diplomatic effort, that, in fact you can . . . strike a deal,” he said, confirming that he had communicated with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani by letter.

Obama also defended his approach to the Syrian crisis, acknowledging that it has been turbulent, but insisting that it has achieved the right results.

The comments come after a number of lawmakers and foreign policy experts on both sides of the aisle have criticized Obama for first making the case to go to war in Syria, then deciding to ask Congress for approval, and then making the case for strikes to a prime-time audience while also announcing that he would first give a Russian diplomatic proposal a chance to work.

In response to those criticisms, Obama said he is less interested in style than results.

“I think that folks here in Washington like to grade on style. And so had we rolled out something that was very smooth and disciplined and linear, they would have graded it well, even if it was a disastrous policy. We know that, because that’s exactly how they graded the Iraq war,” Obama said.

He added, “I’m much more concerned about getting the policy right. . . . As a consequence of the steps that we’ve taken over the last two weeks to three weeks, we now have a situation in which Syria has acknowledged it has chemical weapons, has said it’s willing to join the convention on chemical weapons, and Russia, its primary sponsor, has said that it will pressure Syria to reach that agreement. That’s my goal. And if that goal is achieved, then it sounds to me like we did something right.”

Obama also played down differences with Russian President Vladi­mir Putin as Russia and the United States work together to resolve the Syria standoff.

“Mr. Putin and I have strong disagreements on a whole range of issues,” Obama said. “But I can talk to him. We have worked together on important issues. . . . This is not the Cold War. This is not a contest between the United States and Russia.”

Obama plans to pivot back to a focus on the economy this week ahead of major fiscal battles in Congress, and he said he could change the direction of the economy — including the upward path of inequality — if Congress would let him.

Asked if a president just couldn’t stop inequality, he responded, “I think the president can stop it. The problem is that there continues to be a major debate here in Washington.”

While he acknowledged that government can’t overcome every trend in the market, policy that invests in the economy “pushes against these trends. And the problem that we’ve got right now is you’ve got a portion of Congress whose policies don’t just want to you know, leave things alone; they actually want to accelerate these trends.”"

Ryan Christopher Fogle, the third secretary of the American Embassy in Moscow, was held overnight before being handed back to U.S. authorities Tuesday, according to the Federal Security Service, the Russian intelligence agency known as the FSB. He was carrying a large amount of money, technology, written instructions for the Russian recruit and appearance-changing equipment, the FSB website said.

The agency claimed that Fogle was working for the CIA. The CIA declined to comment, Associated Press reported.

Purported photographs of Fogle disguised in a blond wig and baseball hat were broadcast on the all-news Channel One. Equipment confiscated from him was said to include a recording device, blond and dark wigs, sunglasses, a knife and stacks of 500-euro notes.

The FSB released to Russian media a copy of a letter that Fogle was allegedly carrying. It is addressed “Dear friend” in Russian and offers instructions on how to make contact with the unidentified sender.

According to an AP translation, it says, in part: “We are prepared to offer you $100,000 and discuss your experience, expertise and cooperation, and your payment might be far greater if you are prepared to answer some specific questions. Additionally, for long-term cooperation we offer up to $1,000,000 a year with the promise of additional bonuses for information that will help us.”

An FSB official, speaking to The Times on condition of anonymity, said the agency had not initially intended to make a public incident of the matter.

“Under different circumstances we could have tried to avoid publicity on the episode not to embarrass our [U.S.] partners,” the official said. “But their man acted way too arrogantly and defiantly as if he was in a spy movie: The guy was loaded with money, sets of instructions, makeup kit and other giveaway stuff.”

The official refused to confirm or deny that the person Fogle was recruiting was part of an FSB trap.

The last big spy scandal involving the United States and Russia occurred in 2010, when Russian Anna Chapman was arrested along with nine other alleged sleeper agents in the United States.

Although there are risks that Fogle’s detention could worsen relations between Russia and the U.S., it probably will not, said Andrei Kortunov, president of the New Eurasia Foundation think tank. The 2010 spy scandal had little impact on relations between the two countries.

“Spy arrests are awkward for each country, and those involved probably won’t be getting promotions,” Kortunov said. “These things are inevitable. We just have to watch the reaction from the Kremlin and the U.S. for indication of what is to come.”

Michael McFaul, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, was summoned to the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the ministry’s website said. McFaul tweeted that he would not comment, and the U.S. Embassy in Moscow also declined to comment.

(CNN) —

Two years after bringing home U.S. troops from Iraq, the Obama administration is sending Hellfire rockets and ScanEagle surveillance drones to help government forces fight al Qaeda affiliates growing in influence, a State Department official confirmed to CNN on Thursday.

As first reported by The New York Times, a shipment of 75 Hellfire rockets bought by Iraq arrived last week. Plans call for 10 ScanEagle drones to be sent in the early months of 2014.

“The recent delivery of Hellfire missiles and an upcoming delivery of ScanEagles are standard FMS (foreign military sales) cases that we have with Iraq to strengthen their capabilities to combat this threat,” the State Department official said on condition of not being identified. “We remain committed to supporting the government of Iraq in meeting its defense needs in the face of these challenges.”

State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki recently noted that terrorists were “seeking to gain control of territory inside the borders of Iraq.”

Increasing violence in parts of Iraq has highlighted the security challenges facing the country since the departure of U.S. forces at the end of 2011.

On Christmas Day, two car bombs targeting Christians killed and injured more than 100 people in southern Baghdad.

One exploded outside a church just as worshipers were leaving a Christmas service, while another went off at an outdoor market where many Christians shop, police said.

At least 38 people died in the two bombings that wounded some 70 others, the Interior Ministry said, and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad condemned the attacks.

“The Christian community in Iraq has suffered deliberate and senseless targeting by terrorists for many years, as have many other innocent Iraqis,” an embassy statement said. “The United States abhors all such attacks and is committed to its partnership with the government of Iraq to combat the scourge of terrorism.”

Iraq has experienced an uptick in sectarian violence this year because of simmering tensions between the disaffected minority Sunni community and the dominant Shiites, who control the government.

President Obama, who announced Saturday that he would seek legislative backing for military action in response to Syria’s alleged use of chemical weapons, sought to raise the pressure on Congress as well as U.S. allies, warning that their reputations were at stake.

“My credibility’s not on the line. The international community’s credibility’s on the line. And America and Congress’ credibility’s on the line,” Obama said during a visit to Stockholm.

Administration officials have repeatedly compared Syrian President Bashar Assad to Saddam Hussein and Adolf Hitler, and said he needs to be deterred from using chemical weapons again.

On a 10-7 vote, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved a resolution to authorize U.S. missile strikes. The committee chairman, Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), said Congress should “make sure Assad understands he can’t just wait us out, use chemical weapons and face no consequences.”

TRANSCRIPT: Obama’s remarks on Syria

Several senators from both parties, including opponents of the resolution, predicted the Senate would approve it next week. Yet the Senate’s conflicted views were clear in the vote, which saw Democrats and Republicans on each side. Menendez and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) supported the resolution, while conservative Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) voted with liberal Tom Udall (D-N.M.) against it.

Serious doubts on U.S. military action were aired in a hearing in the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) and other lawmakers repeatedly asked about the risks of U.S. involvement in Syria’s civil war, while Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) questioned why the United States should side with Syrian rebels when “radical Islamists” make up most of their forces.

Obama, meanwhile, insisted he was not alone in demanding a response to the alleged use of chemical weapons in the suburbs of Damascus on Aug. 21, but was joined by nations that signed treaties banning chemical weapons and by Congress, which ratified them. “I didn’t set a red line; the world set a red line” he said. “That wasn’t something I just kind of made up.”

The Senate committee’s resolution limits any U.S. mission to 90 days and prohibits the use of ground troops.

The resolution was amended to include language from McCain and Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) directing that the strike be used to “change the momentum on the battlefield” away from the Syrian government, which has had the edge for much of this year. The amendment said that it was necessary to pressure Assad to negotiate an end to the war.

Supporters hope that language will capture the votes of centrist lawmakers, as well as hawks. But it could drive away antiwar Democrats and anti-interventionist Republicans in the House, who have been insisting the strikes should not pull the United States deeper into another war.

The difficulty of winning votes in the House — particularly among majority Republicans — was clear at the Foreign Affairs Committee hearing. Secretary of State John F. Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, faced mostly skeptical questions about their confidence in the intelligence about the use of chemical weapons, the nature of the Syrian opposition and the consequences of a strike.

The panel’s chairman, Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton), said the administration’s Syria policy “doesn’t build confidence” and that the House would make its own revisions to the authorization resolution.

In one combative exchange, Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) questioned why the administration had abandoned its caution on military action in Syria and was “pulling the trigger on a military response so quickly.” The administration, he said, has a credibility issue with the public “due to the unanswered questions surrounding the terrorist attack in Benghazi,” a reference to the attack on a U.S. diplomatic facility in that Libyan city last Sept. 11 that killed four Americans, including the ambassador.

“Let’s draw the proper distinction here,” Kerry sternly responded. “We don’t deserve to drag this into yet another Benghazi discussion when the real issue here is whether or not the Congress is going to stand up for international norms with respect to dictators that have only been broken twice until Assad: Hitler and Saddam Hussein. And if we give license to somebody to continue that, shame on us.”

DOCUMENT: U.S. chemical weapons intelligence report

Strong statements in support of a resolution came from Reps. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), both of whom served in the military. Kinzinger displayed a photo of Syrian children to warn about the risk of further inaction.

“The day the United States does not act is not just the day that Bashar al Assad knows it’s open season for chemical weapons, but also the day Kim Jong Un knows that and, most ominously, the day that Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, spins his centrifuges into overdrive,” Cotton said.

In an interview, Kinzinger estimated there was only a 40% chance the House would pass a resolution, “maybe 50 if we’re lucky.”

Given the divide among Republicans, White House lobbying efforts appear to be centered on Democrats. Administration officials held separate phone briefings with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Progressive Caucus. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) sent a letter to Democrats seeking “further suggestions or ideas you may have as to what you can support” in a resolution.

Dempsey acknowledged that the risk of escalation can never be ruled out entirely. The military intends to limit U.S. involvement “in time and commitment,” he said. “That’s not to say I discount the risk of escalation, which I can never discount. But we’ve mitigated it as much as possible.”

Kerry portrayed the intervention as an issue of conscience for the world. He suggested that if the U.S. does not act, that will tell Assad: “Nobody cares. Gas your people. You do what you need to to stay in office.”

He compared the alleged sarin gas attack on the Damascus suburbs, which U.S. intelligence agencies concluded killed more than 1,400 people, to the slaughter of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972.

Kerry also acknowledged that Arab countries had offered to pay for the U.S. military to oust Assad. “With respect to Arab countries offering to bears costs and to assess, the answer is profoundly yes,” he said. “That offer is on the table.”

Obama heads to St. Petersburg, Russia, on Thursday, where he will press world leaders to act. He did not say whether he would meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who remains an ally of Syria. “Do I hold out hope that Mr. Putin may change his position on some of these issues? I’m always hopeful,” he said.

Putin, in an interview with First Channel, a Russian federal television network, and the Associated Press, said he hoped to meet with Obama. He also said he had not ruled out backing a U.S.-led military operation in Syria if the Kremlin gets proof that Assad’s government carried out a poison gas attack.

But Putin also said it would be “completely ridiculous” for the Syrian army to use gas when it is winning on the battlefield. And he recalled erroneous American arguments about weapons of mass destruction that led to the Iraq war. “All these arguments turned out to be untenable,” he said. “Did we forget about that?”

Even supporters of military action say debate in Congress will be tough

Secretary of State Kerry says he does not believe Congress will vote %27no%27

WASHINGTON — Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday he does not believe Congress will reject military action against Syria, but lawmakers are making it clear that the vote will not be easy and the outcome is not assured.

President Obama announced Saturday that he believes the United States should launch a military attack on Syria in response to an alleged Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack outside Damascus. But he said he would first seek approval from Congress for use of military force.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press that he thinks the Senate ""will rubber-stamp what (Obama) wants, but I think the House will be a much closer vote."" Paul said he believes ""it's at least 50-50 whether the House will vote down involvement in the Syrian war.""

Paul, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said it's not clear whether American interests are at stake in Syria, or whether opponents of the Assad regime would be any more friendly to the United States.

Paul recalled that Kerry said during the Vietnam War, ""How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?""

""I would ask, 'How do you ask a man to be the first to die for a mistake?'"" Paul said. ""I'm not sending my son, your son or anybody else's son to fight for a stalemate.""

Paul said he was ""proud"" of Obama for following the Constitution and asking for congressional support. But he said the president made a ""grave mistake"" in setting a ""red line."" Obama's push for military action, he said, is an effort to ""save face and add bad policy to bad policy.""

Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the president may have trouble winning the backing of Congress.

King, appearing on Fox News Sunday, said, ""I think it is going to be difficult,"" noting that there is an ""isolationist"" tendency in the Republican Party.

Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said he believes ""at the end of the day, Congress will rise to the occasion,"" but he also said, ""it's going to take that healthy debate to get there.""

But Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., told Fox News Sunday that he didn't think Congress would approve a war resolution. He said budget cuts have rendered U.S. forces ""degraded and unready.""

Several lawmakers raised objections to military action in the hours after Obama announced he will ask Congress to approve the use of force.

Rep. Chris Gibson, R-N.Y., an Army veteran with multiple foreign deployments, said Saturday, ""I hope my colleagues will fully think through the weightiness of this decision and reject military action. The situation on the ground in Syria is tragic and deeply saddening, but escalating the conflict and Americanizing the Syrian civil war will not resolve the matter.""

Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said, ""The apparent chemical weapons attack by the Assad regime is an appalling, unconscionable act by a bloodthirsty tyrant. The 'limited' military response supported by President Obama, however, shows no clear goal, strategy, or any coherence whatsoever, and is supported neither by myself nor the American people.""

Opposition to the use of force is not limited to the Republican Party. Democrat Betty McCollum, D-Minn., said in a statement: ""Unilateral U.S. military action against the Syrian regime at this time would do nothing to advance American interests, but would certainly fuel extremist groups on both sides of the conflict that are determined to expand the bloodshed beyond Syria's borders.""

While Congress remains on recess, the White House has begun its campaign to sway opinions, holding a classified briefing for lawmakers Sunday to show them evidence against the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad.

""We're not going to lose this vote,"" Kerry said Sunday on ABC's This Week With George Stephanopoulos.

First, diplomacy takes work, and agreements rarely flow seamlessly from beginning to end. Second, if all those inveighing against any deal — namely members of Congress, Israel and Saudi Arabia — see the weekend results as a new opportunity to sabotage it, what is the alternative?

No one has proposed a better path than negotiations, and getting the best deal possible should remain the goal for Iran and the major powers — the United States, Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany — as they look to another round of talks later this month.

American, European and Iranian negotiators had raised expectations that an interim agreement — one that would temporarily freeze Iran’s nuclear program, while a longer-term agreement was worked on — could be reached. The 11th-hour arrival of Secretary of State John Kerry and other foreign ministers at the talks in Geneva added to a sense of a potential breakthrough.

On Monday, what prevented the deal was still in dispute. After Mr. Kerry placed responsibility on Iran for being unprepared to accept a proposed draft agreement, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran said Mr. Kerry’s “conflicting statements” had damaged confidence in a process that all sides had agreed would be conducted in secret. One primary obstacle involves Iran’s insistence that it has a right to enrich uranium (which can be used for nuclear power plants or weapons), something Washington is not ready to concede."
http://news.yahoo.com/ap-sources-intelligence-weapons-no-slam-dunk-070731192.html,,[],AP sources: Intelligence on weapons no 'slam dunk',"WASHINGTON (AP) — The intelligence linking Syrian President Bashar Assad or his inner circle to an alleged chemical weapons attack is no ""slam dunk,"" with questions remaining about who actually controls some of Syria's chemical weapons stores and doubts about whether Assad himself ordered the strike, U.S. intelligence officials say.

President Barack Obama declared unequivocally Wednesday that the Syrian government was responsible, while laying the groundwork for an expected U.S. military strike.

""We have concluded that the Syrian government in fact carried these out,"" Obama said in an interview with ""NewsHour"" on PBS. ""And if that's so, then there need to be international consequences.""

However, multiple U.S. officials used the phrase ""not a slam dunk"" to describe the intelligence picture — a reference to then-CIA Director George Tenet's insistence in 2002 that U.S. intelligence showing Iraq had weapons of mass destruction was a ""slam dunk"" — intelligence that turned out to be wrong.

A report by the Office of the Director for National Intelligence outlining that evidence against Syria includes a few key caveats — including acknowledging that the U.S. intelligence community no longer has the certainty it did six months ago of where the regime's chemical weapons are stored, nor does it have proof Assad ordered chemical weapons use, according to two intelligence officials and two more U.S. officials.

The humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders has said an Aug. 21 rocket strike killed 355 people.

A three-page report released Thursday by the British government said there was ""a limited but growing body of intelligence"" blaming the Syrian government for the attacks. And though the British were not sure why Assad would have carried out such an attack, the report said there was ""no credible intelligence"" that the rebels had obtained or used chemical weapons.

Quizzed by lawmakers in Britain's House of Commons, Prime Minister David Cameron gave various descriptions for his level of certainty to Assad's responsibility, ranging from ""beyond doubt"" to being ""as certain as possible.""

Story continues

""We have a regime that has used chemical weapons on 14 occasions, that is most likely responsible for this large-scale attack, that if nothing is done it will conclude that it can use these weapons again and again and on a larger scale and with impunity,"" he said.

Like the British report, the yet-to-be-released U.S. report assesses with ""high confidence"" that the Syrian government was responsible for the attacks that hit suburbs east and west of Damascus, filled with a chemical weapon, according to a senior U.S. official who read the report.

The official conceded there are caveats in the report and there is no proof saying Assad personally ordered the attack. There was no mention in the report of the possibility that a rogue element inside Assad's government or military could have been responsible, the senior official said.

All the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the intelligence report publicly.

Relevant congressional committees were to be briefed on that evidence by teleconference call on Thursday, U.S. officials and congressional aides said.

Administration officials said Wednesday that neither the U.N. Security Council, which is deciding whether to weigh in, nor allies' concerns would affect their plans. But the complicated intelligence picture raises questions about the White House's full-steam-ahead approach to the Aug. 21 attack on a rebel-held Damascus suburb, with worries that the attack could be tied to al-Qaida-backed rebels later.

Intelligence officials say they could not pinpoint the exact locations of Assad's supplies of chemical weapons, and Assad could have moved them in recent days as the U.S. rhetoric increased. But that lack of certainty means a possible series of U.S. cruise missile strikes aimed at crippling Assad's military infrastructure could hit newly hidden supplies of chemical weapons, accidentally triggering a deadly chemical attack.

Over the past six months, with shifting front lines in the 2½-year-old civil war and sketchy satellite and human intelligence coming out of Syria, U.S. and allied spies have lost track of who controls some of the country's chemical weapons supplies, according to the two intelligence officials and two other U.S. officials.

U.S. satellites have captured images of Syrian troops moving trucks into weapons storage areas and removing materials, but U.S. analysts have not been able to track what was moved or, in some cases, where it was relocated. They are also not certain that when they saw what looked like Assad's forces moving chemical supplies, those forces were able to remove everything before rebels took over an area where weapons had been stored.

In addition, an intercept of Syrian military officials discussing the strike was among low-level staff, with no direct evidence tying the attack back to an Assad insider or even a senior Syrian commander, the officials said.

So while Secretary of State John Kerry said Monday that it was ""undeniable,"" a chemical weapons attack had occurred, and that it was carried out by the Syrian military, U.S. intelligence officials are not so certain that the suspected chemical attack was carried out on Assad's orders. Some have even talked about the possibility that rebels could have carried out the attack in a callous and calculated attempt to draw the West into the war. That suspicion was not included in the official intelligence report, according to the official who described the report.

Ideally, the White House would prefer more clarity on all those points in the intelligence provided to it.

The U.S. has devoted only a few hundred operatives, between intelligence officers and soldiers, to the Syrian mission, with CIA and Pentagon resources already stretched by the counterterrorism missions in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, as well as the continuing missions in Afghanistan and Pakistan, officials said.

The quest for added intelligence to bolster the White House's case for a strike against Assad's military infrastructure was the issue that delayed the release of the U.S. intelligence community's report, which had been expected Tuesday.

The uncertainty calls into question the statements by Kerry and Vice President Joe Biden.

""We know that the Syrian regime maintains custody of these chemical weapons,"" Kerry said. ""We know that the Syrian regime has the capacity to do this with rockets. We know that the regime has been determined to clear the opposition from those very places where the attacks took place.""

The CIA, the Pentagon and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment, and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.

North Korea's nuclear test drew the usual reprimands from world leaders. President Obama promised swift and credible action. We know what this is likely to mean – more sanctions and greater isolation for Pyongyang.

But what if the answer should really be the opposite? What if the best way to change North Korea is more commerce and communication with it rather than less?

If you look at examples of how we deal with other countries, sanctions rarely work. In Cuba, 54 years of sanctions have kept the Castros in power while its citizens have suffered. They remain isolated with the lowest rate of Internet penetration in the entire western hemisphere.

In Iran, unprecedented sanctions have been in place for years, but there is no clear sign that the real powers that be, the Mullahs, are in peril. In Syria, no amount of pressure has had any impact on Bashar al-Assad's brutality.

More from GPS: North Korea dance begins again

Now, if you ask Asian diplomats, they will point to Myanmar as embodying the opposite approach. Asian countries traded with Myanmar, invited it to diplomatic gatherings and, over time, persuaded the military junta to open itself up, both domestically and to the world.

There's a pattern in the last two decades of negotiations with North Korea. First comes a missile test, closely followed by a nuclear test, global sanctions, then some talk of rapprochement and, then, back to square one – more provocations.

All the while, the people of North Korea have suffered. In the 1990s, an estimated 2 million people died in a nationwide famine. North Koreans have almost no contact with the outside world. Less than 10 percent of them even have mobile phones, and those are not allowed to call outside the country. Per capita income is estimated to be somewhere around $1,000 a year, about 1/20 of that in neighboring South Korea. The best path to open up with North Korea might be trade deals, travel programs. We could start with student exchange programs.

About a decade ago, Syracuse University started research collaboration with North Korea’s Kim Chaek University of Technology. The partnership has led to the creation of North Korea's first digital library. Technology from that partnership enabled the New York Philharmonic to broadcast its recent concert in Pyongyang.

We might need more of these partnerships, not fewer. Google's founder, Eric Schmidt, recently visited North Korea, and we may need more such trips by more entrepreneurs like him.

In the very short run, they do give the regime some credibility, but in the long run, capitalism and commerce are the assets of modernity that always wear down dictatorships."

In another sign of easing tension between their nations, Undersecretary of State Wendy Sherman and other Americans met for an hour with Iranians led by Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi at the U.N.'s Palais des Nations. It was only the second such U.S.-Iranian bilateral meeting in seven years of diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict over Iran’s nuclear program.

The meeting capped a day that began with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif laying out, in an hourlong English-language PowerPoint presentation, a plan to resolve the 2-decade-old dispute. Zarif’s title for the presentation suggested his goal: “Closing an Unnecessary Crisis — Opening New Horizons.”

U.S. officials said in a statement that the evening meeting was “useful” though “expected,” in light of Secretary of State John F. Kerry’s private meeting with Zarif last month on the sidelines of the U.N.'s annual meeting in New York.

The diplomacy began amid high expectations because of two months of overtures between the United States and Iran, which have stirred speculation that the two countries may be ready to solve the dispute and repair their relationship. On Sept. 27, President Obama broke three decades’ precedent by speaking to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani by telephone.

Yet though U.S. officials praised the Iranians for their willingness to delve into technical details, it was not clear that the Iranian delegation had given the Americans what they wanted to hear about curbing the nuclear program. Zarif and Araghchi spoke mostly in broad terms about their goals, diplomats said.

In the last decade of international meetings on the nuclear program, the Iranians have often not shown their hand until the final hours, analysts noted.

Iranian officials, who are eager to ease sanctions on their economy, have in recent days promised to present a broad “road map” that would chart the path to a resolution of the dispute over its program, which many nations fear is aimed at developing a nuclear weapons capability. Iranian officials have said in private meetings that they would agree to stop production of medium-enriched uranium, which is of special concern to the West because it is easily converted into nuclear bomb fuel, and to allow for international inspection of nuclear sites.

Iranian officials made no public comment Tuesday about the contents of their plan. But in interviews with his nation’s state-controlled media, Araghchi emphasized that Iran intends to maintain its vast nuclear complex, which is a source national pride.

In interviews with the Islamic Republic News Agency and the Iranian Students News Agency, Araghchi said Iran intends to continue operating the disputed Fordow and Natanz enrichment plants, and will insist that world powers recognize Iran’s “right” to enrichment.

He said Iran will cooperate with the United Nations on the nuclear program and other issues. But he didn’t mention a halt in the production of medium-enriched uranium, or a decision to send the existing stockpile of the material out of the country, as the West has urged.

He said that the Iranian religious directive, or fatwa, against the use of nuclear weapons would be sufficient to build the world’s confidence that Iran intended its nuclear activities to be peaceful.

Ray Takeyh, an Iran specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that, in the accounts, “I don’t see anything shutting or being shipped out. If that’s still our red line, then presumably this falls below it.” But he acknowledged that it was not possible to draw conclusions about Iran’s intentions based on the sketchy information on the talks available so far.

U.S. officials have sought to play down expectations for the meetings, saying that a breakthrough was unlikely to come quickly on such a complicated issue. In comments to reporters, Araghchi also was unwilling to say that progress had yet been made.

Negotiators for the seven countries — Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China, in addition to the U.S. and Iran — will meet again Wednesday. Iranian officials have suggested that they might meet several additional times at a more senior level in the weeks ahead.

Catherine Ashton, who is the European Union’s foreign policy chief and point person for the six major powers, met privately Tuesday evening with Zarif.

There are those who believe that the settlers have eliminated any chance of establishing a Palestinian state, because no one would be able to evacuate these politically motivated people from their homes, which is a necessary condition for any agreement with the Palestinians.

The settlers have not eliminated the chance for the establishment of a Palestinian state. The settlements today cover 2 percent of the entire area. The Palestinians have already accepted the Clinton parameters, which include leaving three blocs of Jewish settlements and exchanging other territory for them. In my opinion, many of the rest will leave of their own free will. The difficulty with us is similar to that of the man with a hammer who thinks every problem is a nail. Problems are not nails. If there is good will, they can all be overcome. This applies, for example, to the issue of water. Soon there will be a surplus of water in Israel, thanks to seawater desalination, and we will be able to make up the Palestinians’ shortage of potable water. Look, the whole world is in turmoil. The Palestinian problem isn’t the main problem in the Middle East. But there are a billion and a half Muslims. The Palestinian problem affects our entire relationship with them. If the Palestinian problem were to be solved, the Islamist extremists would be robbed of their pretext for their actions against us. Of course, this requires concessions. The problem in this case is not only the prime minister but also his coalition. I am not claiming that peace with the Palestinians will solve all the problems. People who think in sweeping terms are being superficial. There are two things that cannot be made without closing your eyes — love and peace. If you try to make them with open eyes, you won’t get anywhere. Peace is not an exciting thing, and it entails accepting many compromises and tedious details. A woman, too, can sometimes be exciting and sometimes less so. There’s no perfection. Making peace is complicated.

But what kind of peace are we talking about? Look how President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt sent you a personal letter in July and then denied writing it.

Why does that matter? President Morsi has to answer a great many questions inside his own party. I was surprised not by his denial but rather by the fact that he sent me the letter. The whole matter shows me that Morsi, like any leader taking office, faces tough dilemmas. It is very easy to play the role of the abiding Muslim when you are not in power, but things get complicated when you are. Take, for example, the Egyptian economy, which relies heavily on tourism. If they don’t allow tourists to come and spend their vacations the way they like, they won’t come. No bikini, no tourism.

What attitude should Israel adopt toward the Arab Spring?

You ask foolish questions. Israel is an island in an ocean. And when I ask myself, “What has a greater impact, the ocean on the island, or the island on the ocean?” I have to maintain a certain degree of humility. The important thing isn’t how we relate to it, but what is happening, why there is an Arab Spring. It isn’t a soccer match that we are refereeing. The young generation of the Arab world is suppressed and unemployed. That is what brought about the revolution and uprooted the dictatorships, not me and not you. The storm that has hit the Middle East obliges each state to choose whether to enter the scientific age or not. If it does not, it will have no growth. The great and intriguing debate in Egypt today is about the constitution, in effect about whether to give women freedom or not. It is here that the Arab Spring will be judged. President Obama asked me who I think is preventing democracy in the Middle East. I told him, “The husbands.” The husband does not want his wife to have equal rights. Without equal rights, it will be impossible to save Egypt, because if women are not educated, the children are not educated. People who cannot read and write can’t make a living. They are finished.

In Syria, the end of the Assad regime inches closer. Are you concerned about their arsenal of chemical weapons?

Assad knows that using chemical weapons will immediately invite an attack by outside elements. The whole world would mobilize against him. It would be a suicidal act. On the other hand, it’s obvious that his days are numbered. A situation in which, let’s say, his palace comes under fire, could put him in an irrational state and lead him to act out of despair. If the Syrians dare to touch their chemical weapons and aim them at us or at innocent civilians, I have no doubt that the world as well as Israel will take decisive and immediate action. No less important, Assad is liable to transfer the chemical weapons to Hezbollah, which from our point of view will constitute crossing a red line. It is incumbent upon Israel to prevent such a thing from happening, and it will take firm military action to do so.

During the several months

over which Peres and I spoke, the conflict between Israel and Hamas intensified. In response to rocket fire from Hamas forces in the Gaza Strip, Israel assassinated Hamas’s military commander and launched a bombing campaign that resulted in widespread international censure and ended in a cease-fire engineered by the United States and Morsi. In some cases in the past, Peres expressed opposition to Israel’s use of assassination as a weapon to achieve its goals. He opposed the killing of Khalil al-Wazir, the deputy of the P.L.O. leader Yasir Arafat, in Tunis in 1988, and the targeted elimination of the spiritual founder of Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, in Gaza in 2004. He also protected Arafat from plots to kill or deport him. This time, Peres expressed strong support for the Israeli operation. “This wasn’t a war or a military operation, but rather an educational lesson for Hamas,” he told me. “We acted in order to explain to Hamas that it has to decide on one or the other. You want to build houses? No problem. You want to build missile bases inside those houses? Then we’ll relate to those houses as targets for our aircraft.

But during the campaign, civilians were killed on both sides, many more in Gaza.

We made a supreme effort not to harm civilians in Gaza, although it was very difficult to distinguish between Hamas militiamen and innocent civilians. We have no desire to spill blood, not ours and not that of others. The operation was short, and the moment the lesson was conveyed and deterrence was established, it was stopped.

What lesson do you think Hamas learned?

Hamas will now start taking care. Even there, the understanding must penetrate that there’s no such thing as a cocktail of gunfire and peace."

Pollak'],Remember When Obama Promised to 'Eliminate North Korea's Nuclear Weapons Programs'?,"In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama promised that he would “eliminate North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.” His campaign manifesto, Change We Can Believe In, described Obama’s North Korea policy, and the philosophy behind it, in great detail:

North Korea is an example where direct, tough diplomacy that lays out clear choices to rogue regimes for good and bad behavior can lead to change. When the United States was engaged, the pace of Pyongyang’s development of nuclear weapons was slowed; when we were not, it quickened. While there has been some promising progress, it’s important that all of North Korea’s claims are verified. If they are not, we should move quickly to reimpose sanctions that have been waived, and consider new restrictions going forward. As President, Barack Obama will work with diligence and determination with our friends and allied to end the threat of North Korea and to secure a lasting peace on the Korean peninsula.

Obama’s pledge to use “tough diplomacy” to “end the threat of North Korea” followed his infamous pledge during a Democratic presidential primary debate in 2007 that he would meet the leaders of rogue regimes like North Korea “without preconditions.”

That thinking matches the pseudo-realist view expressed repeatedly by Obama’s new nominee for Secretary of Defense, former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE)–that the danger of regimes such as Iran and North Korea is amplified by, or even caused by, U.S. failure to “engage.” Obama’s extreme self-confidence emboldened his campaign promise not just to contain North Korea, but to convince it to abandon nuclear weapons entirely.

Obama did not just leave such talk on the campaign trail. In his 2010 State of the Union address, Obama boasted of the success of his policy on North Korea:

Now, these diplomatic efforts have also strengthened our hand in dealing with those nations that insist on violating international agreements in pursuit of nuclear weapons. That’s why North Korea now faces increased isolation, and stronger sanctions–sanctions that are being vigorously enforced.

He repeated the North Korea boast in his 2011 State of the Union address:

Because of a diplomatic effort to insist that Iran meet its obligations, the Iranian government now faces tougher sanctions, tighter sanctions than ever before. And on the Korean Peninsula, we stand with our ally South Korea, and insist that North Korea keeps its commitment to abandon nuclear weapons. (Applause.)

Yet today, on the day he is to give the first State of the Union address of his second term, North Korea has tested a nuclear bomb. Not only has Obama failed to “eliminate” the North Korean nuclear weapons program; he has also failed to discourage or deter it.

So much for “tough diplomacy” from the Obama administration."

Officials%3A He%27ll urge Iraqis to stop overflights of Iranian aircraft supporting Syrian government

Kerry flew into Baghdad on Saturday from Amman

BAGHDAD (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry says he's made it clear to Iraq that it shouldn't allow Iran to use its airspace to ship weapons and fighters to Syria.

Kerry told reporters Sunday during an unannounced trip to Baghdad that the Iranian overflights were a major point of discussion in his private talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. Kerry said he told Maliki that anything that supports President Bashar Assad and his regime was, quote, ""problematic.""

Kerry also said that U.S. lawmakers and the American people are watching what Iraq is doing and ""wondering how it is a partner.""

Kerry flew into Baghdad on Sunday from Amman after accompanying President Obama to Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Jordan.

A senior U.S. official said the sheer number of overflights, which occur ""close to daily,"" as well as overland shipments to Syria through Iraq from Iran was inconsistent with Iranian claims that they are only carrying humanitarian supplies. The official said it was in Iraq's interest to prevent the situation in Syria from deteriorating further, particularly as there are fears that Iranian-backed extremists may gain a foothold in the country.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to publicly preview Kerry's meetings, said there are clear links between al-Qaeda linked extremists operating in Syria and militants who are carrying out terrorist attacks in Iraqi territory with increasing regularity.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton secured a pledge from Iraq to inspect the flights last year, but the official said that since then only two aircraft have been checked by Iraqi authorities.

Kerry's visit if the first by a U.S. secretary of State since Clinton went in 2009. During Obama's first term, the Iraq portfolio was largely delegated to Vice President Joe Biden.

His arrival came just three days after the anniversary of the U.S.-led war that began on March 20 with an airstrike on Dora Farms in southern Baghdad in a failed attempt to kill Saddam Hussein."

Whereas these flagrant actions were in violation of international norms and the laws of war;

Archibold', 'Eric Schmitt']",U.S. Stepped In to Halt Mexican General’s Rise,"The devastating death toll has Mr. Peña Nieto, 46, a former governor, promising to move his country’s fight against organized crime in a different direction, focusing more on reducing violence than on detaining drug kingpins. But he has so far offered only vague details of his security plans, focusing instead on social and economic programs.

While Mr. Peña Nieto portrays himself as the leader of a new generation of reformers, he is also a scion of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which ruled Mexico for more than 70 years through a combination of corruption and coercion until it lost power in 2000. During its time in power, the party was known more for keeping the United States at arm’s length while attempting to strike deals with drug traffickers, rather than combating them head on.

Mr. Peña Nieto’s election has brought the PRI back to power, and since so many of those serving in his cabinet have one foot in the past, foreign policy experts who specialize in Mexico say it is not clear where the new government is headed.

“It could go either way,” said Eric L. Olson of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, speaking of future cooperation between Mexico and the United States. “Part of me says, ‘Let’s not assume it’s all going to go south.’ And there are things that are happening that give me hope. But the longer it goes without some clarity, the more doubts creep in.”

Those doubts have also crept to Capitol Hill. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said he was withholding nearly $230 million in security assistance to Mexico through the so-called Merida Initiative amid concerns about whether the fight against organized crime is doing more harm than good.

“Congress has been asked for a significant new investment, but it’s not clear what the Mexican government’s plans are,” Mr. Leahy said. “It’s premature to sign off on more of the same.”

General García Ochoa, 61, whose background is at once exemplary and enigmatic, personifies that quandary. On paper, he is a model officer. He earned two advanced degrees from Mexico’s most prestigious military academies, and founded the elite National Center for Counter-Narcotics Intelligence. He has been a student and an instructor in American military training programs. He has written three books, including one on the military’s role in the drug fight."
http://news.yahoo.com/reported-syria-attack-tests-us-hope-avoid-war-175903340.html,,[],Reported Syria attack tests US hope to avoid war,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Obama administration searched for answers Wednesday about a reported chemical weapons attack in Syria that would mark the most flagrant violation yet of the U.S. ""red line"" for potential military action. But the possibility of intervention seemed ever smaller after America's top general offered a starkly pessimistic assessment of options.

Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a letter this week to a congressman that the administration is opposed to even limited action in Syria because it believes rebels fighting the Assad government wouldn't support American interests if they seized power.

Dempsey said the U.S. military is clearly capable of taking out Assad's air force and shifting the balance of the war toward the armed opposition. But such an approach would plunge the U.S. into the war without offering any strategy for ending what has become a sectarian fight, he said.

On Wednesday, Syrian anti-Assad activists accused the government of carrying out a toxic gas attack in the eastern suburbs of Damascus, killing at least 100 people including children. The claims coincided with a visit by a U.N. chemical weapons team to three previous sites of alleged attacks. Syrian President Bashar Assad's government rejected the accusations, and U.S. officials said they were seeking details of what happened.

For the United States, the death toll and painful images again put a spotlight on President Barack Obama's pledge almost exactly a year ago to respond forcefully to any chemical weapons use by the Assad government. Since then, the administration has said it has confirmed that Syrian forces have committed such attacks, and the U.S. has ordered a lethal aid package of small arms to be sent to some rebel groups, though it's unclear what if any weapons have been delivered.

Yet up to now, Obama has refused all options of direct U.S. military intervention in a civil war that has killed more than 100,000 people and displaced millions.

Story continues

""The United States is deeply concerned by reports that hundreds of Syrian civilians have been killed in an attack by Syrian government forces, including by the use of chemical weapons,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Wednesday.

""We are working urgently to gather additional information,"" Earnest said, adding that Washington has asked for U.N. investigators to be granted access to the area of the fighting. He made no mention of possible consequences if chemical weapons use is confirmed.

Obama has stated that he doesn't want to be drawn into another Mideast conflict after a decade of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, and polling suggests he has the public's support on that.

Dempsey, in his letter, said, ""Syria today is not about choosing between two sides but rather about choosing one among many sides,"" In the Aug. 19 letter to Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., he said, ""It is my belief that the side we choose must be ready to promote their interests and ours when the balance shifts in their favor. Today, they are not.""

Despite Dempsey's assessment of the forces fighting Assad, Obama recognized the Syrian opposition coalition as ""the legitimate representative"" of the Syrian people more than eight months ago. And Secretary of State John Kerry has repeatedly backed the moderate vision promoted by Salim Idris, the rebel military chief.

But the more than 50 distinct rebel groups fighting to end the Assad family's four-decade dynasty range wildly in political beliefs and not all are interested in Western support.

As the conflict has dragged on, al-Qaida-linked rebels and other extremist groups have been responsible for some of the same types of massacres and ethnic attacks that the Assad government is accused of. On Tuesday, Kurdish militias battled against al-Qaida-linked fighters in the northeast in fighting that has fueled a mass exodus of refugees into Iraq and risks exploding into a full-blown side conflict.

Dempsey said Syria was experiencing ""a deeply rooted, long-term conflict among multiple factions and violent struggles for power"" that will continue after Assad's rule ends.

His letter to Engel was a follow-up to the sharp examination he faced in July from the Senate Armed Services Committee as part of his reconfirmation.

Dempsey sent a letter afterward saying the establishment of a no-fly zone to protect the Syrian rebels would require hundreds of U.S. aircraft, cost as much as $1 billion a month and offer no assurance of changing the war's momentum. He also discouraged training of rebel groups, limited strikes on Syria's air defenses or creating a buffer zone for the opposition, citing the high costs involved and risks such as lost U.S. aircraft.

Engel, an advocate of more forceful U.S. action, proposed the use of cruise missiles and other weapons against Syrian government-controlled air bases in an Aug. 5 letter to Dempsey. The congressman said strikes could ground Assad's air force and reduce weapons flow to his government from Iran and Russia, while costing less to U.S. taxpayers and requiring no American troops in Syrian territory or airspace.

Dempsey said this approach wouldn't tip the balance against Assad and wouldn't solve the deeper problems plaguing Syria.

""The loss of Assad's air force would negate his ability to attack opposition forces from the air, but it would also escalate and potentially further commit the United States to the conflict,"" Dempsey said. ""It would not be militarily decisive, but it would commit us decisively to the conflict.""

Instead, he spoke in favor of an expansion of the Obama administration's current policy.

The U.S. can provide far greater humanitarian assistance and, if asked, do more to bolster a moderate opposition in Syria. Such an approach ""represents the best framework for an effective U.S. strategy toward Syria,"" Dempsey said."

Rather than contradict its narrative of relentless moderation, the administration refused to see that the Benghazi attack symbolized the worst expression of rising anti-American Islamism and instead retreated into another reigning but flawed Washington concept: the West’s humiliation of Muslims must lie at the root of their rage.

Indeed, our acquiescence and outreach to Islamists for most of the last decade was calculated to drain the wellspring of animating Muslim rage against the West. Therefore, the administration argued the attack was a spontaneous protest born of humiliation provoked by an anti-Islam Internet video.

Sanger']",No Bunker-Buster Bomb in Israel’s U.S. Arms Deal,"Israel has asked the United States for weapons like the Massive Ordnance Penetrator in the past and has been turned down. American officials declined to say whether the yearlong negotiations with Israel that resulted in the new arms package had included a discussion of the new bomb.

Instead, they pointed to a decision by President Obama to send advanced refueling tanker planes to Israel that would make it possible for the country’s fighter aircraft to reach as far as Iran. A similar refueling capability was turned down during the administration of President George W. Bush.

George Little, the Pentagon press secretary, said the arms package to Israel was “unprecedented” and would “guarantee and augment our strong ally’s qualitative military edge for a generation to come.”

The debate is about more than just equipment. Israel’s position has been that Iran cannot be allowed to build up too large a stockpile of medium-enriched uranium that could allow it to then race for a bomb. When Mr. Netanyahu addressed the United Nations in New York last September, he drew a red line across a cartoon picture of a bomb, which aides later said indicated that Iran would not be allowed to amass enough medium-enriched uranium to get enough fuel to make a single weapon.

But most of Iran’s production of that uranium is occurring inside the mountain at Fordo. So far, Iran has stayed just below Mr. Netanyahu’s red line, converting some of the fuel to a metallic form that can be used in a nuclear reactor — but that would take significantly more time to further enrich it to bomb-grade material. To the United States, this has offered up more time for a diplomatic solution. To many Israeli officials, it is a ploy, intended to buy time as Iran installs a new generation of centrifuges that could speed its production.

“It’s all about timetables,” said Dore Gold, the president of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs and a member of Mr. Netanyahu’s inner circle of strategists. “If you say the goal is to halt Iran in the enrichment phase, you don’t have much time. If you are waiting for Iran to weaponize” — the position the Obama administration has taken — “maybe you can give it another year or more.”

Mr. Yaalon suggested that there was still time. “There are other tools to be used and to be exhausted, whether it is diplomacy, economic sanctions,” he said."

It was a clear sign from the Kremlin that it has tired of the international standoff over Snowden, the 30-year-old former National Security Agency contractor who disclosed classified information about widespread U.S. surveillance of worldwide telephone and Internet contacts.

“Venezuela is waiting for an answer from Snowden,” Alexei Pushkov, head of the Russian parliament’s international affairs committee, said on Twitter. “This, perhaps, is his last chance to receive political asylum.”

In a separate tweet, Pushkov noted that Snowden “shouldn’t live in Sheremetyevo,” Moscow’s main international airport where the fugitive has been stuck in a transit area for two weeks.

Snowden arrived to Moscow on a flight from Hong Kong on June 23. But his U.S. passport had been revoked after Justice Department officials brought espionage charges against him and sought his extradition. That has prevented him from proceeding through passport control and officially entering Russian territory. The airport corridors and holding areas between the arrival gates and the immigration booths staffed by border guards comprise a diplomatic no-man’s land from which an undocumented person can neither enter nor depart.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced Friday that his country was offering “humanitarian asylum” to Snowden so that he can live without “persecution from the empire,” a reference to the United States.

On Saturday, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Elias Jaua told reporters in Caracas that his office had not yet been in contact with Russian authorities but expected to be in touch Monday.

For Snowden to leave for Caracas, diplomats at the Venezuelan Embassy in Moscow would have to provide him with travel papers before he could board flights headed for South America. There are no scheduled direct Moscow-to-Caracas flights and most connections are through the United States, Spain or other countries that would put Snowden at risk of arrest during a stopover. However, Aeroflot and Cuba’s Avianca have direct flights from Moscow to Havana, from where he could easily travel on to Caracas.

Venezuela is one of three countries that have offered asylum to Snowden. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega announced at the same time as Maduro his country’s willingness to take in the fugitive “if conditions allow,” and Bolivian President Evo Morales extended an offer Saturday. Morales said the move was in retaliation for European countries’ denying his plane entry to their airspace last week as he traveled back to La Paz from Moscow. Spain, Italy, France and Portugal reportedly had been informed by unknown U.S. sources that Snowden was on board Morales’ plane.

Pushkov’s comments on Twitter and in an interview with Voice of Russia radio appeared to signal the Kremlin’s desire for Snowden to move on. President Vladimir Putin last week said that Snowden was welcome to settle in Russia but only if he ceased leaking classified information that was damaging to “our American partners.” That prompted Snowden to withdraw his application for asylum in Russia.

U.S. officials are believed to have informed the countries to which Snowden directed asylum appeals -- 27 in all, according to WikiLeaks -- that sheltering the fugitive from U.S. prosecution would damage their relations with Washington and imperil trade and other mutually advantageous agreements.

Pushkov observed that Venezuela already has “a sharp conflict” with the United States and “it won’t be worse” for defying the U.S. extradition request and providing a safe haven for Snowden.

USA TODAY

SANAA, Yemen — U.S. aircraft buzzed over the capital of Yemen on Tuesday after the State Department ordered all non-essential personnel out of the embassy and urged all Americans to leave due to to ""the continued potential for terrorist attacks.""

State has advised non-government U.S. citizens to stay away from Yemen since the country's political unrest erupted in 2011 but the warning was upgraded to urge all Americans to leave immediately because of an ""extremely high"" security threat level.

The U.S. Air Force transported State Department personnel out of Sanaa early Tuesday. Military personnel remain ""on the ground in Yemen to support the U.S. State Department and monitor the security situation,"" Pentagon press secretary George Little said.

A senior defense official told the Associated Press that 50 to 100 diplomatic personnel were flown out of Sanaa in a C-17 military transport at dawn Tuesday and were taken to Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The official was not authorized to discuss the information publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity.

U.S. surveillance planes circled the skies of the capital on Tuesday morning.

""As staff levels at the Embassy are restricted, our ability to assist U.S. citizens in an emergency and provide routine consular services remains limited and may be further constrained by the fluid security situation,"" the State Department travel warning said.

The British government also ordered its embassy evacuated ""temporarily"" and had its shipping in the region along the Red Sea on the highest possible alert.

The Yemen Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it had taken ""all necessary precautions"" to ensure the safety of foreign missions in Sana'a and suggested the embassy closures would hurt efforts to defeat terrorists.

""While the government of Yemen appreciates foreign governments' concern for the safety of their citizens, the evacuation of embassy staff serves the interests of the extremists and undermines the exceptional cooperation between Yemen and the international alliance against terrorism,"" the ministry said in a statement.

The shutdown of embassies was instigated by an intercepted secret message between al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahri and Nasser al-Wahishi, the leader of the Yemen-based al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, about plans for a major terror attack,according to The Associated Press. The officials who gave the information o the AP spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

The U.S. has pummeled terror leaders in Yemen with targeted drone strikes for at least two years. On Tuesday, Yemeni security officials said a suspected U.S. drone killed four alleged al-Qaeda militants in a volatile eastern province of the country.

The drone fired a missile at a car carrying the four men around 2 a.m. local time, setting it on fire and killing all of them, the officials said.

The U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, along with other Western delegations including the British Embassy, have been closed since Sunday due to the threats. Several foreign embassies have closed their doors in Yemen until at least Thursday in reaction to the threat that is perceived to be at its highest in the final days of the holy-month of Ramadan and going into the Muslim festival of Eid that begins Wednesday.

Despite the reaction among the international community to the apparent imminent al-Qaeda threat, in Sanaa there appeared little visible signs of tightened security across the capital other than the regular checkpoints that dot the city.

Yemen's President Abdo Rabu Mansour Hadi, who recently returned from a visit to Washington, has struggled to maintain security while implementing U.S.-backed military restructuring plans following Yemen's 2011 revolution that brought to an end 33 years of President Ali Abdullah Saleh's rule.

The reformation of Yemen's military, which divided in March 2011 during the uprising, and the removal of Saleh's family members who controlled several powerful units, has caused friction within the air force and army challenging Hadi's authority.

Assassinations of military and intelligence personnel have become widespread in Yemen over the last 18 months since the reorganization of the army and air force began. Improvised explosive devices have also been discovered with increasing regularity this year with a rising number of kidnappings and attacks on oil and electricity lines compounding a sense of lawlessness and highlighting Yemen's weak central government control.

The last known AQAP-linked attack in the capital came in September, when the minister of defense survived a car-bombing that left 12 dead -- one of multiple attempts made on his life.

Since June 2012 the militants have dispersed across several provinces resulting in unprecedented increase in U.S.-drone strikes being carried out across the country.

AQAP has been widely considered al-Qaeda's most dangerous affiliate for several years. The group is linked to the botched Christmas Day 2009 bombing of an airliner bound for Detroit and explosives-laden parcels intercepted aboard cargo flights a year later — both incidents involving al-Asiri's expertise.

President Obama and others have consistently alluded to the weakening of core al-Qaeda in Pakistan — particularly since a Navy SEAL team killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan two years ago. Obama frequently touts bin Laden's death in his speeches, and has declared that the terror group was ""on the path to defeat.""

On Monday, officials declined to be more specific about the latest threat.

""What we know is the threat emanates from, and may be focused on, occurring in the Arabian Peninsula,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. ""It could potentially be beyond that, or elsewhere.""

The State Department on Sunday closed a total of 19 diplomatic posts in the Middle East and Africa, including in Bangladesh, Madagascar, Burundi, Rwanda and Mauritius.

Thomas Sanderson, co-director of the Transnational Threats Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the balance between overreacting and underreacting is a difficult one to strike.

""Inducing such widespread embassy closings may constitute a public-relations victory for AQAP and the al-Qaeda network generally,"" Sanderson said.

According to these outlets, the spy agency has gone out of its way to keep the information from the public through intimidation of CIA personnel.

Four Americans were killed, including U.S. ambassador Christopher Stevens that evening in Benghazi almost one year ago.

In light of this new information, either the Congress’ “Gang of Eight” knew about the operation and misled the public about what they knew, or the Obama administration may have been conducting an unauthorized gun-running operation. Fox News reported in October of 2012 about a Libyan ship, reportedly containing weapons for Syrian Rebels that may have been tied into the attack against the consulate and the CIA annex:

Through shipping records, Fox News has confirmed that the Libyan-flagged vessel Al Entisar, which means “The Victory,” was received in the Turkish port of Iskenderun — 35 miles from the Syrian border — on Sept. 6, just five days before Ambassador Chris Stevens, information management officer Sean Smith and former Navy Seals Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty were killed during an extended assault by more than 100 Islamist militants. On the night of Sept. 11, in what would become his last known public meeting, Stevens met with the Turkish Consul General Ali Sait Akin, and escorted him out of the consulate front gate one hour before the assault began at approximately 9:35 p.m. local time. Although what was discussed at the meeting is not public, a source told Fox News that Stevens was in Benghazi to negotiate a weapons transfer, an effort to get SA-7 missiles out of the hands of Libya-based extremists. And although the negotiation said to have taken place may have had nothing to do with the attack on the consulate later that night or the Libyan mystery ship, it could explain why Stevens was travelling in such a volatile region on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.

According to section 503’s Presidential Approval and Reporting of Covert Actions in the 1947 National Security Act, the President may not authorize covert CIA actions without informing the intelligence committees of Congress.

Legislation implemented in 1980 gave the president the authority to limit advance notification of especially sensitive covert actions to eight Members of Congress–the “Gang of Eight”: the chairmen and ranking minority Members of the two congressional intelligence committees, the Speaker and minority leader of the House, and Senate majority and minority leaders. These members are: House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI), Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-MD), Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), Sen. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-GA).

By law, such a covert weapons operation in Benghazi should have been known by all eight members. The disastrous results from the events of September 11, 2012 have not made it easy to get answers from these lawmakers regarding this point.

Many remember when Pelosi, a “Gang of Eight” member, found herself at odds with the Democratic base in 2009 and ridiculed by Republicans, when it was revealed she was actually briefed in 2002 by the Bush White House about the administration’s tactic to water-board terrorism suspects during interrogations. Pelosi denied this fact previously.

Radio host Laura Ingraham asked Boehner on January 24 about Senator Rand Paul’s questioning to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. He asked if the secretary was aware of U.S. involvement in the procuring of weapons that were transferred, bought or sold to Turkey out of Libya. Clinton, seemingly confused, told Paul “nobody [had] ever raised” the issue with her before.

Boehner replied to Ingraham, “I’m somewhat familiar with the chatter about this and the fact that these arms were moving towards Turkey, but most of what I know about this came from a classified source and I really can’t elaborate on it.”

Boehner has refuses to appoint a House Select Committee to investigate the Benghazi attacks and previously refused to support a joint Select Committee to do the same late last year.

Four members of the “Gang of Eight” have told Breitbart News over the past six months they knew nothing about any CIA operation in Benghazi involving the smuggling of Libyan weapons into Turkey that may have been shipped to Syrian rebels, some of whom were affiliated to al-Qaeda groups.

“I get to see all of that stuff. I have seen nothing that would allow me to conclude that the U.S. government was in any way shape or form involved in gun running in Libya. I looked at it all,” said Congressman Rogers, Chairman of the House Select Intelligence Committee to Breitbart News in June.

“If it’s there, I have not seen it. I think I would have found it. I think there were some other things that were happening and people got confused, but the United States government was not running guns (from the annex).”

Senator Chambliss, ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, when asked in February if he knew anything about the gunrunning issue Senator Paul asked Clinton about a month earlier replied to Breitbart News, “I’m not familiar with that.”

Senator Feinstein, Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told Breitbart News in March she “didn’t know what” Senator Paul was talking about in regards to his questioning of Clinton and the Secretary’s knowledge about the gunrunning issue in Benghazi.

Ranking member of the House Intel Committee Rep. Ruppersberger claimed to Breitbart News in May he “didn’t know anything” about U.S. weapons smuggling or if Ambassador Stevens was involved in the operation in anyway, saying, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

Ruppersberger, added, “If I was [privy to such information], I couldn’t talk to you about it. But I have heard no information about what you’re talking about, as far as what [Ambassador Chris Stevens] was there for. I haven’t had briefings on it.”

Ruppersberger also said he knew “nothing about” any U.S. operation to smuggle weapons to Syrian rebels, explaining the secretive “Gang of Eight” briefings from the White House do not go into much detail sometimes.

“I’ve heard nothing about it. When [Stevens] was there. I don’t know. We don’t get to that minutia sometimes. Gang of 8, we get the most sensitive information, that even our own committees can’t [get.]

When asked if the White House would have had to inform the eight members of such an operation in order for it to be legal Ruppersberger responded, “No. The checks and balances is they give us information–very sensitive information. The check and balance issue, they don’t have to tell us everything or we’d be sitting having Gang of Eight briefings all day long. That’s the answer. I don’t know.”"

You know, right after Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping are meeting about the state of, among other things, a cyberwar going on underneath their noses.

The new report from Xinhua news agency adds that the drill, taking place on a large military training field and not some underground hack-a-thon bunker, ""will be the first time a PLA exercise has focused on combat forces including digitalized units, special operations forces, army aviation and electronic counter forces."" The terms ""digitalized unit"" and ""electronic counter forces"" don't make it at all clear what China's military has planned, but then again, no country is ever going to reveal its full cyberwarfare capabilities in detail — and it's not like it's the first time the Chinese have tested the military reaches of their digital warfare capabilities. Indeed, the U.S. was game to play along on more than one occasion. Last year it was reported that the U.S. and China had secretly engaged in at least two cyber war games in 2011, ""designed to help prevent a sudden military escalation between the two superpowers if either felt they were being targeted,"" as ZDNet's Emil Potralinski reported. ""In the first, both sides had to describe what they would do if they were attacked by a sophisticated computer virus, such as Stuxnet. In the second, they had to describe their reaction if the attack was known to have been launched from the other side."" The first went better than the second, apparently, but neither appears to have taken place on a training base in Mongolia, as this new test will be when it's conducted by two army corps and eight military academies in ""late June."" Obama and Xi are set to meet at an estate in California on June 7-8. Cybersecurity is on the list of talking points, the White House confirmed Tuesday as National Security Advisor Tom Donilon visited Beijing ahead of the summit. Defense Secretary's Chuck Hagel is visiting Southeast Asia this week, and it's on his agenda, too.

RELATED: China Says U.S. Is on Offense in Hacking Attacks on Defense Ministry

News of China's ""digitalized"" drill comes on the heels of Tuesday's big Washington Post scoop that Chinese hackers had stolen designs for nearly 40 of the U.S.'s most valuable weapons programs and 30 defense technologies — a move that could ""weaken the U.S. military advantage in a future conflict."" That article followed a Pentagon report earlier this month claiming that the Chinese government was directly connected to attacks on U.S. computer systems, which followed the cybersecurity firm Mandiant's report in February alleging that the PLA was connected to a number of cyberattacks on U.S. companies and infrastructure, and a 2012 assertion from national security veteran Richard Clarke that China has hacked every major U.S. company. Now, it appears, the secret training is out in the open."

The oil accords with Turkey, potentially worth billions of dollars, are part of a broader effort by Iraqi Kurds in recent years to cut their own energy deals — including exploration agreements with foreign companies like Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Gazprom — that sidelined the central government. The Kurds, and the Turks, say they will pay Baghdad its fair share. But officials in the capital have long claimed such arrangements are illegal.

The controversy is in part the unfinished business of the American occupation of Iraq. The failure of the Iraqi government to pass a national oil law, one of the benchmarks set by President George W. Bush when he announced the United States troop “surge” in 2007, has left Baghdad and Erbil, the Kurdish capital, in a perpetual feud over how to divide profits and who has the authority to make agreements with international oil companies.

Qasim Mishkhati, a Kurdish member of Parliament’s oil and gas committee, insisted that the wealth from the deals would be shared with the rest of Iraq, and that it was the responsibility of the regional government in the north to find international markets for its oil resources. “Kurdistan is working to increase the national income so that all Iraqis can enjoy better services and more wealth,” he said.

Although the mechanism for such payments has not been worked out, the Turks and the Kurds have indicated that they would adhere to the existing proportions for the division of national revenue, meaning Baghdad would receive 83 percent of the net profit and the Kurds would keep 17 percent."
http://news.yahoo.com/afghan-president-says-u-indulging-brinkmanship-over-security-101919449.html,,[],Afghan president says U.S. indulging in brinkmanship over security deal,"By Sanjeev Miglani NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai on Saturday shrugged off U.S. talk of a total military withdrawal from Afghanistan if he didn't sign a security agreement as brinkmanship and said he wouldn't back down on his conditions for the deal. Karzai was in New Delhi in a burst of regional diplomacy as his ties with Washington have come under renewed strain over his refusal to sign the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) that will shape U.S. military presence in Afghanistan beyond 2014 when most international troops will leave. He told reporters that the United States would have to stop the practice of raiding Afghan homes and help restart a peace process with the Taliban as necessary conditions for the security pact. ""We do believe that the BSA is in the interest of Afghanistan and the Afghan people have given their approval. But we also believe that protection of Afghan homes and the launch of a peace process are absolute pre-requisites,"" he said. If Karzai doesn't sign the deal, Washington says it will have to withdraw its entire force of some 44,500 troops by the end of 2014. Other NATO nations could follow suit leaving Afghan forces to fight the Taliban insurgency on their own. The complete withdrawal, called the ""zero option"", would be similar to the pull-out of U.S. troops from Iraq two years ago. Violence there is now at its highest level in at least five years, and more than 8,000 people have been killed this year, the United Nations says. ""I don't think America is thinking of the zero option , its brinkmanship they play with us, and even if they did, then come what may,"" the Afghan leader said. U.S. officials have appeared exasperated by Karzai's stance on the security agreement, which they say is needed to help them plan a future mission that will assist Afghan forces fight militants and that will allow for future aid crucial for the impoverished nation. U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, James Dobbins told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this week that the delay in finalizing the deal - which U.S. officials had hoped Karzai would sign weeks ago - would impose ""damages and costs"" on Afghans. But he added that the Obama administration was not on the verge of abandoning its effort to extend its troop presence in the country. The security agreement would allow for the presence of nearly 15,000 U.S. and other NATO troops at nine locations around the country, Karzai said. The agreement includes a provision allowing military raids on Afghan homes in exceptional circumstances - when an American life is directly under threat - but it would not take effect until 2015. The issue is particularly sensitive among Afghans after a dozen years of war between Afghan and foreign forces and Taliban militants. Karzai said he also wanted the United States to help him start an open and public peace process with the Taliban, rather than the secret diplomacy it had engaged in the past. ""Secret talks won't help. U.S. and Pakistan have enough influence over the Taliban to relaunch the peace process."" Karzai, who discussed the U.S. security deal with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, has also held talks with the leaders of Iran and Pakistan this month.

(CNN) —

The Israeli air force shot down a drone approaching the nation’s coast Thursday, the Israel Defense Forces said.

An Israeli F-16 shot the drone with air-to-air missiles, an Israeli military official told CNN. It went down five nautical miles off the coast of Haifa, and Israeli naval forces were searching the area while an investigation was initiated, the Israeli military said.

“I view with utmost gravity this attempt to violate our border,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a prepared statement. “We will continue to do everything necessary to safeguard the security of Israel’s citizens.”

By the numbers: Drones

Thursday’s incident marked the second time an unmanned aircraft had been intercepted in Israeli airspace within the past seven months, the IDF said.

In October 2012, Israeli warplanes tracked and eventually shot down a drone over the country’s northern Negev Desert.

That drone did not carry any weapons or explosives, Israeli officials said at the time. They declined to discuss the drone’s route or whether it had approached any sensitive facilities.

Hezbollah claimed responsibility for sending the drone, which Israeli officials at the time said appeared to have originated in Lebanon.

Hezbollah frequently flies drones over Israel, but the military rarely bothers to shoot them down, Michah Zenko of the Council on Foreign Relations said at the time.

CNN’s Sara Sidner contributed to this report."

Huntsman Jr.']",How to Play Well With China - The New York Times,"For instance, China won’t sharply reduce greenhouse gas emissions because it fears that slower production could put millions of Chinese workers on the streets. And it won’t play a major role in propping up the teetering euro zone if doing so requires them to work with governments other than Germany, whose stability it trusts. And it won’t change its position on Taiwan, Tibet or Tiananmen Square.

But there are things China can and will do if the United States offers some incentives that China wants and needs.

China would happily produce a document that Mr. Xi could brag about at home, while accepting responsibility for only a carefully negotiated set of mutually profitable projects. A new communiqué should therefore include negotiated agreements on the joint development of clean energy technologies, cooperation in scientific research and coordinated strategies to mitigate conflict in the developing world.

It’s not a sign of weakness that Washington can’t force China’s leaders to change course on issues they consider central to their national security. Naming and shaming can be an important foreign policy tool. But China will never change its approach on these core issues because of America’s objections, and we can’t allow criticism to drown out calls for cooperation in other areas.

So Mr. Obama shouldn’t expect much movement on issues like Tibet, territorial disputes between China and its neighbors in the East and South China Seas, and a range of human rights issues. Mr. Obama can commit the United States to a frank approach, one that acknowledges China’s core interests, and where appropriate, allows Washington to act as an honest broker.

America and China already enjoy an enormously profitable trade and investment relationship. In 1985, trade between the countries amounted to just $7.7 billion. By 2000, the total reached $116 billion, and in 2012, it surged to $536 billion, putting America and China on track to build the largest trade relationship in history. But certain moves by both sides have eroded trust.

The Obama administration has worked to build momentum behind the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a colossal trade deal involving a host of Pacific Rim countries. China sees the partnership as a move to isolate it and won’t join because it would force Beijing to open areas of its economy that are not ready to withstand competitive pressures. But this does not mean that China must see it as a threat. Those who join should continue to build new commercial ties with China to help assuage the fear that the partnership is designed specifically to isolate China."

Only hours later, Snowden released a statement railing against the U.S. government.

Russia was one of about 20 countries that the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, which has been assisting Snowden in exile, said it had approached for asylum on Snowden's behalf. Others included China, Cuba, France, Germany, Italy, India, Nicaragua and Spain.

Putin told reporters that Russia won't hand Snowden over to U.S. authorities, but he said there would be strings attached if he wants to remain in Moscow.

""If he likes to stay here, there is one condition: He should cease his work aimed at damaging our American partners. No matter how strange it will sound from me,"" Putin told reporters, adding that Snowden isn't working for Russian intelligence.

He said he doubted Snowden would curtail his activities and suggested that the former National Security Agency contractor should figure out which country he wants to wind up in and ""move there.""

Snowden left the U.S. for Hong Kong before he allegedly leaked top-secret details of U.S. surveillance programs and was charged with espionage. With the help of WikiLeaks, he traveled to Moscow eight days ago.

The U.S. does not have an extradition treaty with Russia, but President Barack Obama noted that Snowden traveled to Moscow without legal papers and referred to ""high-level"" discussions between the two countries about the case.

""We are hopeful that the Russian government makes decisions based on the normal procedures regarding international travel and the normal interactions that law enforcement have,"" Obama said.

It was thought that Snowden would eventually head for Ecuador, but the president of the South American country said this week that no asylum request was sent and suggested Russia would make the call on when Snowden could leave and where he would go.

And in a statement released late Monday through WikiLeaks, Snowden claimed the White House is pressuring other countries to deny him asylum.

""The Obama administration has now adopted the strategy of using citizenship as a weapon,"" his statement said.

""This kind of deception from a world leader is not justice, and neither is the extralegal penalty of exile. These are the old, bad tools of political aggression. Their purpose is to frighten, not me, but those who would come after me,"" he added.

""Although I am convicted of nothing, it has unilaterally revoked my passport, leaving me a stateless person. Without any judicial order, the administration now seeks to stop me exercising a basic right. A right that belongs to everybody. The right to seek asylum.""

While Snowden remains in legal limbo, new claims about U.S. surveillance based on his purported leaks continue to emerge.

Obama addressed reports that the NSA has bugged America's European allies with something of a shrug, saying it should not be a surprise that intelligence agencies seek ""additional insight beyond what's available through open sources.”

""If that weren't the case, then there'd be no use for an intelligence service,"" Obama told reporters while traveling in Africa.

“And I guarantee you that in European capitals there are people who are interested in, if not what I had for breakfast, at least what my talking points might be should I end up meeting with their leaders,” he added.

“That's how intelligence services operate.”

He said his team would look into the allegations and report back to European Union allies, who have expressed concern and, in some cases, outrage.

Secretary of State John Kerry, who is traveling in Brunei, echoed Obama's statement.

""I will say that every country in the world that is engaged in international affairs of national security undertakes lots of activities to protect its national security, and all kinds of information contributes to that, and all I know is that that is not unusual for lots of nations,"" he said.

""But beyond that, I'm not going to comment any further until I have all of the facts and find out precisely what the situation is.""

The Daily Beast first reported that, according to a U.S. senator and unnamed administration officials, the administration has temporarily suspended most of the $1.3 billion in military aid, as well as the delivery of weapons and economic aid amid a review of the financial support.

The office of Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., seemed to back up this claim. An aide to Leahy, in a statement to Fox News Radio, echoed what was reported in The Daily Beast -- that Leahy's subcommittee ""was told that the transfer of military aid was stopped, that this is current practice, not necessarily official policy, and there is no indication of how long it will last.""

But White House officials said Tuesday that no decisions have been made on whether to ""cut or postpone"" aid.

Daily politics news delivered to your inbox: sign up for our newsletter

Spokesman Josh Earnest said reports that suggest an aid cut-off are ""not accurate."" He confirmed that Obama planned to hold a Cabinet meeting Tuesday afternoon, though, to discuss Egypt aid.

Pentagon spokesman George Little also said ""no changes have been decided.""

""I am unaware of any de facto suspension of assistance. I don't know where that came from,"" he said of the reports of an aid cut-off.

However, if true, the move to temporarily suspend aid would be a significant step. To date, officials have said that aid is merely under review, and that they would not make a determination on whether the ouster of ex-President Mohammed Morsi qualifies as a coup -- because such a finding would, under U.S. law, require the administration to cut off aid.

The Daily Beast report indicates that the administration, for the short-term anyway, is treating the overthrow like a coup in all but name.

One administration official reportedly told the Daily Beast: ""The decision was we're going to avoid saying it was a coup, but to stay on the safe side of the law, we are going to act as if the designation has been made for now. By not announcing the decision, it gives the administration the flexibility to reverse it.""

The conflicting claims, and the possibility that the government has a distinct public and private approach to the crisis in Egypt, only add to the confusion over what the administration's policy actually is.

Violence exploded in Egypt, as the military and Muslim Brotherhood backers of Morsi clashed in the streets, while President Obama was on vacation in Martha's Vineyard. The president returned to find himself pulled in both directions by vocal members of Congress. Some, like Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., say the administration should clearly label the ouster a coup and suspend aid. Others argue the administration, despite misgivings about the military's handling of the situation, should nevertheless sustain aid in order to prevent the Brotherhood from taking power.

Yet the White House and State Department, in public, say their policy of not making a determination on whether a coup had taken place has not changed.

""We have determined that it is not in the best interest of the United States to make that determination,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday, adding that aid is under review.

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said a separate New York Times report that said economic aid programs are on hold is incorrect.

She acknowledged that roughly $585 million in military aid has not yet been obligated.

""But it would be inaccurate to say that a policy decision has been made with respect to the remaining assistance funding,"" she said.

One senior Capitol Hill staffer explained to Fox News that the remaining money in the Egypt aid pot for this year ""may not have been stopped yet, but we built in the ability to push it through fast or to slow the line down to get their attention. It's diplomacy.""

The money expires if it is not spent by Oct. 1."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/16/us/arizona-border-security.html,2013-03-16 00:00:00,['Julia Preston'],"Once a Battlefront, Arizona Border Quiets","As Congress debates a broad overhaul of the immigration laws, including a pathway to citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants in the country, skeptical lawmakers are asking if the Southwest border is secure enough to withstand any new wave of illegal crossings that might be spurred by a legalization program, or by new growth in the American economy.

Officers who guard the line say the border is more secure in most places than they have ever known it. They say they are in a strong position to hold off an illegal surge, and to show why they point to Arizona, once the busiest and most contentious border battlefront. To the east, in Texas, agents are still struggling to stop persistent migrants in hundreds of miles of varying and penetrable terrain. But in Arizona, every available measure shows steep declines in the number of people making it across, figures that border agents say demonstrate what they can accomplish.

In Congress, many Republicans recall that an amnesty in 1986, which was supposed to solve illegal migration, was followed by an even larger unauthorized influx. A bipartisan group in the Senate is working on a proposal that would require measurable gains in border security before immigrants would be allowed to proceed onto a path to full citizenship.

But to border officials here, Congress seems to be behind the times, failing to notice that they have already made many of the enforcement advances that lawmakers are seeking. Since 2005, the number of patrol agents in the Southwest has nearly doubled, to more than 18,000. Customs and Border Protection, the parent agency of the Border Patrol, has built its air wing to more than 260 aircraft. It acquired an array of technology, including ground sensors and aerial detection devices developed by the Defense Department in Iraq and Afghanistan, and created a military-style command structure with expanded intelligence operations to coordinate agents on the ground.

While tightening the border, officials also created a system of penalties for those who get past it, making it far more likely that migrants who were caught would be jailed, prosecuted as criminals, or expelled from the country far from the place where they tried to enter."

One day after President Obama’s top national security aides huddled at the White House, senior lawmakers appeared on television on Sunday with ominous warnings about intelligence “chatter,” first revealed on Thursday, similar to what American spy agencies picked up in the weeks before the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

Such is the strange, wait-and-see climate surrounding a threat that appears to be both specific and maddeningly vague. American officials say that they are confident they have intercepted electronic communications discussing attacks in the coming days, but that they have no clear information about where they should try to defend against them.

“The assumption is that it’s probably most likely to happen in the Middle East,” said Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, on the ABC News program “This Week.” “But there’s no guarantee of that at all.”"

Secretary of State John F. Kerry warned North Korea’s young leader Friday that his country would lose any military showdown with the United States, and sought to play down a U.S. intelligence report that North Korea is now capable of delivering a nuclear-armed missile.

The dual signals from Kerry were part of a broader effort by the Obama administration to force North Korea to back away from its increasingly bellicose rhetoric, while also assuaging the concerns of allies and the American public.

Speaking in the South Korean capital, Kerry pledged strong support for that country as well as Japan against threats from Pyongyang, saying that its leader, Kim Jong Un, “needs to understand, as I think he probably does, what the outcome of the conflict would be.”

The tone of that reference to U.S. military power seemed designed to reinforce a message the administration has also delivered more explicitly in recent weeks by repositioning U.S. missile defense equipment and sending nuclear-capable stealth bombers on conspicuous missions over South Korea.

At the same time, Kerry attempted to tamp down the significance of a recent U.S. intelligence report that concluded that North Korea is now capable of making a nuclear warhead that can be mounted on a ballistic missile and fired.

View Graphic How far could North Korean missiles actually go?

If true, it would mean that North Korea has crossed what many regard as the most difficult technical barrier to being able to launch a nuclear attack, even if limited in scope and range.

Kerry said that “it is inaccurate to suggest” that Pyongyang “has fully tested, developed or demonstrated capabilities that are articulated in that report.”

Kerry was referring to an assessment secretly circulated last month by the Defense Intelligence Agency, a spy service that gathers intelligence and produces analysis for the Pentagon. The finding was made public Thursday when it was mentioned by a Republican congressman during a hearing on Capitol Hill.

North Korea has previously tested stationary nuclear devices, as well as missiles with ranges that could reach parts of the United States. But it has not shown that it has mastered the technical challenge of making a nuclear warhead small and strong enough to be carried by missile to a distant target before detonating.

But Kerry’s use of the phrase “fully tested, developed or demonstrated” seemed to allow for some ambiguity on the question of whether North Korea is capable of making a nuclear warhead, even if it hasn’t exhibited that technology to the outside world.

Statements from the White House and the nation’s intelligence chief included similarly hedged terms.

What may seem like administration obfuscation is “a genuine issue,” said George Perkovich of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “As any of these guys will acknowledge, our intelligence on North Korea is very, very limited. We don’t know what we don’t know.

“A normal country in normal circumstances would not go down the road of relying on such a capability if they haven’t tested it numerous times,” Perkovich said. “When they say they haven’t demonstrated it, that’s true and meaningful . . . but they could have stuff that in desperation they could use. And it could work.”

U.S. officials with access to classified reports said that the DIA tends to go further than other U.S. spy agencies in its assessments of threats, including North Korea’s nuclear program, because of the spy agency’s unique mission.

The DIA is focused on missions that include identifying threats to U.S. forces overseas and making sure that Pentagon leaders are prepared for developments that require a U.S. military response.

Still, officials said that the DIA’s conclusion on North Korea, which it conveyed with “moderate confidence,” is not contradicted by findings from the CIA or other U.S. spy agencies.

“There are some differences [among agencies], but I don’t think they’re huge,” said a Republican member of Congress who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the subject. “There is a growing body of analytic product” on North Korea and its efforts to develop a warhead that suggest “that if they’re not there, they’re close.”

U.S. officials noted that the latest DIA language is consistent with earlier statements from the agency. In 2011, then-DIA Director Ronald Burgess testified that North Korea “may now have several plutonium-based nuclear warheads that it can deliver by ballistic missiles.”

The urgency of that question has been heightened by the menacing behavior of North Korea’s young and relatively untested leader. Last month, the North Korean news agency released pictures of Kim in a “war room” where a large map was marked with lines meant to depict missile flight paths to major cities in the United States.

U.S. officials have said that and other provocative moves seem aimed at bolstering Kim’s standing in North Korea and abroad.

The existence of the DIA’s latest report surfaced at a congressional hearing this week during questioning by Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.), who read an unclassified portion of what others described as a classified but routine update for policymakers on North Korea’s nuclear program.

South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok also sought to play down the significance of the new report in remarks he made during an appearance with Kerry. “Our military’s assessment is that North Korea has not yet miniaturized” a nuclear device, Kim said.

Kerry held crisis talks with officials in Seoul on Friday and heads to Beijing on Saturday to lobby for stronger efforts by China to rein in its reclusive ally. On Sunday, the chief U.S. diplomat is to visit Japan, which, like South Korea, is guaranteed U.S. military protection should North Korea launch an Asian war.

U.S. and Asian diplomats say they doubt North Korea will go that far but acknowledge that a launch of midrange missiles seems increasingly likely, as a show of force meant for U.S. consumption.

The intercepts and a subsequent analysis of them by American intelligence agencies prompted the United States to issue an unusual global travel alert to American citizens on Friday, warning of the potential for terrorist attacks by operatives of Al Qaeda and their associates beginning Sunday through the end of August. Intelligence officials said the threat focused on the Qaeda affiliate in Yemen, which has been tied to plots to blow up American-bound cargo and commercial flights.

The bulletin to travelers and expatriates, issued by the State Department, came less than a day after the department announced that it was closing nearly two dozen American diplomatic missions in the Middle East and North Africa, including facilities in Egypt, Iraq, Yemen, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Britain said Friday that it would close its embassy in Yemen on Monday and Tuesday because of “increased security concerns.”

It is unusual for the United States to come across discussions among senior Qaeda operatives about operational planning — through informants, intercepted e-mails or eavesdropping on cellphone calls. So when the high-level intercepts were collected and analyzed this week, senior officials at the C.I.A., State Department and White House immediately seized on their significance. Members of Congress have been provided classified briefings on the matter, officials said Friday."

Secretary of State says U.S. will defend its allies

Japan%2C South Korea may have to go nuclear%2C experts say

China could end it all%2C says former ambassador to U.N.

Secretary of State John Kerry 's insistence Friday that the United States ""would not accept"" a North Korea with nuclear weapons laid out no new policy on how to stop it from happening.

The long-standing U.S. demand that the North cease its nuclear activity predates the Obama administration and is no closer to being adhered to than it was two decades ago, analysts say.

Actions he did announce, such as President Obama's scaling back of military exercises with U.S. ally South Korea in the face of North Korean threats, are likely to embolden North Korea, says Bruce Klingner, a former director of the CIA's Korea Desk who's at the Heritage Foundation.

""With North Korea taking several steps forward and you take a step back, it only confirms in their mind that the United States will back down,"" Klingner said.

Kerry is on his first stop of a four-day visit to Asia, which is to include stops in China, the North's greatest ally, and Japan. It comes as the North's dictatorial regime led by Kim Jong Un, 30, prepared to celebrate the birthday of his grandfather, Kim Il Song, founder of the North Korean state.

The North has threatened to turn the capital of South Korea into ""a sea of fire"" and to launch nuclear weapons at the USA. The North does have nuclear weapons technology and has fired long-range missiles in tests.

This week, North Korea moved a missile into position that is capable of reaching U.S. forces in Guam. Japan's Kyodo news agency cited a Japanese defense official saying the North Korean Masudan missile launcher was seen in an upright position near the North Korean east coast.

The United States has said the North cannot reach the continental USA but is getting closer to producing an intercontinental missile capable of reaching the U.S. homeland.

Kerry said, ""We will defend our allies,"" South Korea and Japan, ""and we will defend ourselves.""

He said President Obama had ordered several military exercises ""not be undertaken,"" and ""we have lowered our rhetoric significantly"" in an effort to ""find a way for reasonableness to prevail here.""

Klingner says that kind of talk is counterproductive.

""North Korea will look back at its history and see that any time it attacked, the United States and South Korea tended to back down,"" he said. ""In the past, by not responding militarily to North Korean attacks, the United States and South Korea usually tried to get back to negotiations or offered benefits to reduce tensions that North Korea has raised.""

John Bolton, who served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush, says the only way to prevent North Korea from getting nuclear weapons it can use to threaten and blackmail the region is for the United States to work with China to bring about the collapse of the North Korean regime and reunification of the two Koreas.

China, which provides North Korea 90% of its fuel and much of its food and is its only ally except for Iran, has viewed North Korea as a useful buffer separating U.S. troops from the Chinese border.

It fears a collapse of the North Korean state would cause a flood of millions of hungry refugees into China. Yet recent articles in Chinese government-controlled media and think-tank publications have raised the idea of cutting off aid to North Korea, Bolton said.

U.S. diplomats should work with China to reassure it on security, promise aid for refugees and encourage civilians to stay in North Korea, Bolton said. It's in China's interests for the North Korean regime to collapse, he said.

""The difference now is a nuclear North Korea really does cause a problem for China,"" he said. ""It's said for years it doesn't want a nuclear North Korea because it causes instability on the peninsula and economic disruption in Northeast Asia. They're right. North Korea is ready to test a missile which the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency thinks is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead.""

Klingner said the United States should respond to the threats with a pledge to protect its allies and an expansion of more comprehensive sanctions to further damage and isolate the North Korean regime.

Lawmakers in South Korea and Japan are increasingly expressing an interest in developing their own nuclear defenses.

China does not want that, Bolton said. Once the North has nuclear weapons of its own, China's other neighbors may have no choice but to go nuclear, and the North will probably behave even worse.

North Korea has been ""lashing out,"" without nukes, Bolton said. ""Do you think they'll be better behaved with nuclear weapons?""

In Seoul, Kerry said calming the situation is his first priority.

""The greatest danger here, we all agree, is for a mistake,"" he said. ""The greatest danger is that something happens and there's a response to that something, and then things somehow inadvertently were to get out of control. ""

He called on Kim Jong Un ""to recognize that this is a moment for responsible leadership, and it's a moment to try to reach for the good possibilities, not try to guarantee the bad ones."""

Pollack'],"Short of a Deal, Containing Iran Is the Best Option - The New York Times","WASHINGTON — THIS week, Iran’s new president, Hassan Rouhani, will address the United Nations General Assembly. His message is likely to be a sharp change from the adolescent belligerence of his hard-line predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Mr. Rouhani is a genuine reformer — but his desire to move Iran in a new direction should not blind the United States to the difficulties of achieving a diplomatic solution.

Mr. Rouhani has hinted that he is willing to compromise on aspects of Iran’s nuclear program for the sake of repairing relations with the rest of the world and having economic sanctions on Iran removed. But he has also warned that he cannot hold off his hard-line rivals forever, and it is unclear whether the Iranians will be willing to make the kind of concessions that America and its allies want. Ultimately, it is the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, not Mr. Rouhani, who would make the final decision on a deal. He has shown little inclination for one, although recent statements from the leadership offer hope that their position may be softening.

If it cannot reach a diplomatic deal, America will face a choice between two alternatives: using force to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear arsenal or containing a nuclear Iran until its regime collapses from its own dysfunction.

It is going to be a difficult choice. For that reason, we need to start thinking about it now. We cannot afford to have our diplomatic efforts collapse suddenly and, as in Syria, be forced to lunge forward unprepared."

Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!” It fell two years later.

Mr. Obama’s address came 50 years after President John F. Kennedy, in another celebrated speech here, spoke outside a town hall to affirm support for Germans against the nuclear-armed Soviets. By contrast, Mr. Obama used his speech to propose that the United States and Russia reduce their nuclear arsenals by a third.

“Our fates and fortunes are linked like never before,” he said. “We may no longer live in fear of global annihilation, but so long as nuclear weapons exist, we are not truly safe.”

Officials said 4,500 people were present, fewer than the 6,000 tickets distributed — perhaps reflecting the scorching heat. Even so, that was far fewer than the 450,000 who saw Mr. Kennedy or the 200,000 who packed a park to hear Mr. Obama in 2008, when he was a presidential candidate. Then, Ms. Merkel had discouraged his use of the Brandenburg Gate site, saying it should not be used for politicking. This time she invited him to use it.

The anticipation of Mr. Obama’s address, though, was offset by attention to revelations of the breadth of the two United States surveillance programs — one a huge database logging American phone calls and the other, called Prism, to monitor foreign communications at Internet companies and through phone logs without individual warrants."

Obama to take Syria case to Congress

Assad warns strike could trigger Middle East %27powder keg%27

Britain rules out new vote on Syria

– Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and John McCain left a Labor Day meeting at the White House saying they had greater confidence in President Obama's strategy on Syria. Both said that they would support Obama's resolution for military action, if the president can clarify his plan for bolstering the Syrian opposition forces.

– In an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro, Syrian President Bashar Assad called the Middle East a ""powder keg"" and warned that Western military strikes on his country could spark a regional war. Assad also challenged the U.S. and France to present proof that his government was responsible for the Aug. 21 chemical attack in Damascus.

-- A French government report published Monday about Syria's chemical weapons program that found that at least 281 deaths could be attributed to the attack in areas outside Damascus. A French intelligence estimate alleges that the Syrian regime launched an attack Aug. 21 involving ""massive use of chemical agents,"" AP reported.

– Members of Congress in both parties said they would not be able to support the current draft of a resolution authorizing Obama to launch a military strike.

– Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, called U.S. information on the alleged chemical attack in Syria that may have killed 1,429, including at least 426 children, ""absolutl unconvincing."" Lavrov said: ""Yes, they showed us some findings but there was nothing specific there: no geographic coordinates, no names, no proof that the tests were carried out by the professionals.""

– Secretary of State John Kerry said on news programs Sunday that the U.S. has received hair and blood samples that have ""tested positive for signatures of sarin,"" a deadly nerve agent first developed in Germany in the 1930s.

– China said it is opposed to the U.S. acting alone in Syria and thinks any response must conform to the U.N. Charter and the basic principles underlying international relations.

– Britain's Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg ruled out another vote in Parliament over action in Syria. Speaking to the BBC on Monday, Clegg said he could not ""foresee any circumstances"" under which MPs could be asked to vote again after rejecting a motion for a military strike last week. Clegg's comments came after London Mayor Boris Johnson said a new vote could take place if new and ""better"" evidence emerged.

– Australia said it supports the U.S. taking action in Syria but didn't offer to provide military assistance.

– The United Nations said that around five million people inside Syria have now been displaced and two million have fled to neighboring countries as a result of the civil war.

– NATO's chief says he is convinced that the Syrian government used chemical weapons against its people and insists a strong reaction is needed to show dictators around the world that such weapons cannot be used with impunity.

Ryan Christopher Fogle, the third secretary of the American Embassy in Moscow, was held overnight before being handed back to U.S. authorities Tuesday, according to the Federal Security Service, the Russian intelligence agency known as the FSB. He was carrying a large amount of money, technology, written instructions for the Russian recruit and appearance-changing equipment, the FSB website said.

The agency claimed that Fogle was working for the CIA. The CIA declined to comment, Associated Press reported.

Purported photographs of Fogle disguised in a blond wig and baseball hat were broadcast on the all-news Channel One. Equipment confiscated from him was said to include a recording device, blond and dark wigs, sunglasses, a knife and stacks of 500-euro notes.

The FSB released to Russian media a copy of a letter that Fogle was allegedly carrying. It is addressed “Dear friend” in Russian and offers instructions on how to make contact with the unidentified sender.

According to an AP translation, it says, in part: “We are prepared to offer you $100,000 and discuss your experience, expertise and cooperation, and your payment might be far greater if you are prepared to answer some specific questions. Additionally, for long-term cooperation we offer up to $1,000,000 a year with the promise of additional bonuses for information that will help us.”

An FSB official, speaking to The Times on condition of anonymity, said the agency had not initially intended to make a public incident of the matter.

“Under different circumstances we could have tried to avoid publicity on the episode not to embarrass our [U.S.] partners,” the official said. “But their man acted way too arrogantly and defiantly as if he was in a spy movie: The guy was loaded with money, sets of instructions, makeup kit and other giveaway stuff.”

The official refused to confirm or deny that the person Fogle was recruiting was part of an FSB trap.

The last big spy scandal involving the United States and Russia occurred in 2010, when Russian Anna Chapman was arrested along with nine other alleged sleeper agents in the United States.

Although there are risks that Fogle’s detention could worsen relations between Russia and the U.S., it probably will not, said Andrei Kortunov, president of the New Eurasia Foundation think tank. The 2010 spy scandal had little impact on relations between the two countries.

“Spy arrests are awkward for each country, and those involved probably won’t be getting promotions,” Kortunov said. “These things are inevitable. We just have to watch the reaction from the Kremlin and the U.S. for indication of what is to come.”

Michael McFaul, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, was summoned to the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the ministry’s website said. McFaul tweeted that he would not comment, and the U.S. Embassy in Moscow also declined to comment.

[For the record, 1:35 p.m. May 14: An early version of this post said that the FSB posted on its website a digital copy of a letter it said was carried by the accused American. The agency released the copy to Russian media but did not post the letter on its website.]

http://news.yahoo.com/john-mccain-plays-poker-on-phone-during-syria-testimony-015345398.html,,[],John McCain plays poker on phone during Syria testimony,"

Critics of a possible U.S. military intervention in Syria say any potential campaign would be a serious gamble for American interests. But for John McCain, the high stakes were apparently centered on his iPhone after McCain was photographed playing a game of video poker during Tuesday’s Senate hearings on Syria.

“Scandal! Caught playing iPhone game at 3+ hour Senate hearing - worst of all I lost!” McCain wrote to his 1,822,263 Twitter followers after the photo, taken by the Washington Post, began making the rounds on social media.

Despite laughing off the incident, McCain’s poker moment has made him the target of criticism from war opponents and landed him front and center on the Drudge Report.

McCain has quickly become the most prominent supporter of President Barack Obama’s call for military action against the Syrian regime after the government of Bashar Assad allegedly used chemical weapons against civilians.

On Monday, McCain said a vote against Obama’s military proposal would be “catastrophic” for U.S. interests.

McCain is no stranger to card games. A 2008 report from The New York Times noted McCain’s long-standing ties to the gambling industry.

And with his support for a congressional resolution authorizing military action already a given, it’s perhaps understandable why McCain was easily distracted during Tuesday’s testimony from Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey.

It’s unclear exactly when McCain was caught playing the video poker game. But it wouldn’t be a shock if his attention were diverted during Hagel’s testimony. After all, Hagel and McCain publicly feuded in January when Hagel was confirmed to his post.

McCain's poker playing has already resulted in some humorous responses on social media, including a photo illustration placing the Arizona senator in one of the famous “dogs playing poker” paintings.

http://news.yahoo.com/analysis-kerrys-off-hand-remark-put-deal-syria-011440151.html,,[],Analysis: How Kerry's off-hand remark put a deal on Syria in play,"By Matt Spetalnick and Arshad Mohammed WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Whether deft diplomacy or a rhetorical stumble, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has managed to crack open the door to a possible solution to the Syrian crisis that could get President Barack Obama and U.S. lawmakers out of a bind, save Syria from a bombing and cast Russia as peacemaker. Kerry's seemingly off-hand suggestion on Monday that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad might avert a U.S. military strike if he surrendered all of his chemical weapons offered a potential escape hatch that no one had seriously proposed before - and that could end up leading nowhere. But in a sign of how desperate the United States, Russia, Syria and the United Nations are to defuse the international standoff over Assad's alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria's civil war last month, momentum for Kerry's suggestion seemed to build instantly. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov seized upon the idea, issuing a proposal for putting Syria's chemical stockpile under international control. Positive to lukewarm reaction flowed in from the White House, Assad's government and the United Nations. On Capitol Hill, lawmakers in both parties expressed hope that a diplomatic solution would help them avoid a vote to either attack Syria - a plan most Americans oppose - or go against Obama's plea for authorization to attack. By late afternoon, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton - a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2016 - was speaking out on the Syrian conflict for the first time, saying that a plan to rid Assad of his stock of chemical weapons had potential. Even as Obama used a half-dozen interviews with television networks to continue pressing his case for military action in Syria and made plans for a nationally broadcast speech to Americans on Tuesday night, the sudden prospect of a deal with Russia dominated the conversation in Washington. During an interview with NBC, Obama signaled that he might have to adjust his approach because of the Russian proposal. He told NBC that the proposal was ""potentially positive,"" but said that ""we have to be skeptical,"" a reflection of the many questions surrounding the plan. A 'WELCOME WRENCH' Obama and several lawmakers said it was important for Congress to move forward with its debate over authorizing U.S. military force in Syria. By all appearances, Obama has been losing that debate. Vote count estimates by The Washington Post and The New York Times, among others, indicate that far more members of Congress oppose military action in Syria than support it - a reflection of Americans' wariness of engagement in another conflict in the Middle East. The ongoing debate over military force could give the United States some leverage in any discussions of a deal with Russia, according to Obama and key lawmakers such as Arizona Senator John McCain. However, Middle East analysts said that the idea of sequestering Assad's chemical weapons almost certainly would complicate Obama's efforts to win Congress' approval for military force. ""It basically throws a bit of a wrench into the administration's approach, but it may be a welcome wrench,"" said Robert Danin, a Middle East specialist and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. A 'FANTASY' PROPOSAL? Monday's drama began when Kerry, after a meeting with British Foreign Secretary William Hague, was asked by a reporter how military strikes on Syria might be averted. Kerry said that Assad ""could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week …. But he isn't about to do it, and it can't be done."" Perhaps not. But by merely floating the idea in what the State Department said was just an attempt to make a rhetorical point, America's top diplomat suddenly gave it credence. After Lavrov responded with his proposal, Kerry called him and said that U.S. officials were ""not going to play games,"" but that if the Russian proposal was serious, ""we will take a look,"" a senior State Department official said. White House officials also expressed doubts about Assad's credibility in such a deal, but acknowledged that the idea was in play. Clinton - who had met with Obama earlier in the day - then used a speech on wildlife preservation to suggest that the United States was interested in a solution that would rid Syria of chemical weapons. To some analysts, it all sounded far-fetched. A senior European security official deemed it a ""fantasy"" and said it would be ""impossible to verify"" whether Syria would give up its chemical weapons. A former senior U.S. intelligence expert said there was no full accounting of Assad's stockpile and where it is stored. NO MASTER PLAN BY KERRY For Obama, however, a deal brokered by Russia could mean at least a temporary way out of a crisis that he helped to create. Last year, Obama declared that Assad would cross a ""red line"" for U.S. action if the Syrian president used chemical weapons in a civil war that now has gone on for 2 1/2 years and killed an estimated 100,000 people. For Assad, such a deal could be a chance to delay or prevent a U.S.-led missile strike that could weaken Assad's loyalists in their fight against rebel forces. Assad would, however, be under extreme pressure to make good on any pledge to identify and relinquish his chemical weapons. And even though its Syrian ally is accused of using chemical weapons, Russia would have a chance to be seen as a peace-enabler while continuing to shield Syria from U.S. retribution for last month's gas attack. If Russia's proposal leads to a deal, Kerry's utterance that inspired the proposal could become a historic moment in U.S. diplomacy - and an ironic symbol of how his spontaneous comments sometimes have complicated the Obama administration's efforts to sell the notion that military action in Syria is necessary. Kerry, a former senator who joined the administration in February and became its most forceful voice for tougher action against Assad, faced criticism last week for initially refusing to rule out American ""boots on the ground"" in Syria before backtracking and accepting that restriction. A senior U.S. official said that Kerry's remarks Monday about Assad giving up chemical weapons were not part of some carefully crafted diplomatic strategy aimed at finding a way out of the Syria impasse. Kerry, the official said, was simply emphasizing what he saw as the unlikely possibility that Assad would give up such weapons. ""Then,"" the official said, ""it kind of took off.""

Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem accused the Obama administration of engaging in a “double standard,” pledging support for a political solution while helping to bankroll the Syrian insurgency.

“We know that the United States is important and has a role, [and] if it wanted, it actually can halt the violence and bloodshed in Syria,” Moallem said during a visit to Iran.

The Syrian diplomat repeated his government’s stated willingness to negotiate with armed rebels, even though it labels its adversaries “terrorists” in daily communiques.

“Even those who took up arms can play a role in building Syria’s future,” Moallem said at a news conference in Tehran.

The Iranian foreign minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, told reporters at the conference that Bashar Assad would remain Syria’s “legitimate president” until his fate is decided by voters in national elections scheduled next year.

The comments come during a week in which the conflict to oust Assad has generated intense diplomatic debate but no clear path to stopping the bloodshed that has left almost 70,000 dead, according to the United Nations.

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, representing the U.N. and the Arab League, said Saturday that the U.N. would be willing to “facilitate a dialogue” between opposition and government representatives. The pair voiced regret that both sides had become “increasingly reckless with human life,” the U.N. said.

A day earlier, the White House said President Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin had spoken by telephone about Syria and “agreed on the need to advance a political transition to end the violence as soon as possible.”

But also Friday, Russia — Syria’s other key ally — accused the United States of promoting “extremists” who are determined to seize power by force.

The barrage of criticism of the U.S. from several fronts was set off by Secretary of State John F. Kerry’s announcement Thursday in Rome that Washington would provide tens of millions of dollars in nonlethal aid to the Syrian opposition, including medical supplies and food for rebel fighters.

Kerry rejected dissident requests for weapons or other direct military aid. However, rebel forces have reportedly been receiving arms with the help of various U.S. allies, including Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Turkey and Qatar.

Throughout his trip, his first abroad as secretary of State, Kerry has repeatedly emphasized that Washington favors a “political solution” to the Syrian crisis. But he has not endorsed Russian-led efforts to broker peace talks between the opposition and the government in Damascus.

The sticking point remains the future of Assad. The opposition, backed by Washington and allied governments, says any talks must lead to the ouster of Assad and his security apparatus. Damascus rejects “preconditions” that require Assad’s removal from power.

While assailing U.S. support for Syrian rebels, both Russia and Iran have provided substantial aid to Assad’s government, though the amount of military assistance remains unclear.

Washington has accused Iran of providing arms and training for the Syrian military, a role it denies. Russia says it provides only “defensive” weapons to Syria. Last year, however, a ship carrying three refurbished attack helicopters to Syria was forced to return to Russia after its British insurer canceled coverage.

In Syria, both sides reported fierce fighting Saturday in various battle zones, including the suburbs of Damascus and the provinces of Homs in central Syria, Dara in the south, Aleppo and Idlib in the north and Dair Alzour in the east.

Opposition activists said scores had been killed in intense battles in the north-central city of Raqqah, which is under rebel siege. The city, situated along the Euphrates, is home to more than 200,000 residents but has seen its population swell with people displaced by fighting in other areas.

The government responded to the insurgent attack on Raqqah with airstrikes, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based pro-opposition group.

The group also reported that a rebel battalion had executed two civilians accused of collaborating with Syrian authorities in the Damascus suburb of Yarmouk, home to many Palestinian refugees. A photo on the group’s Facebook page showed what appeared to be the bodies of two men dangling from ropes, apparently having been lynched.

The two were accused of “placing chips that directed regime bombardment,” the observatory said. Human rights groups have accused both sides in the conflict of carrying out extrajudicial executions.

The Afghan government, meanwhile, abruptly canceled a ceremony scheduled for Saturday that had been meant to show that Kabul and Washington had finally reached a deal for the handover of a U.S. military prison. At the last minute, Afghan President Hamid Karzai balked at the proposed terms of the handover of the Parwan Detention Facility, Afghan and U.S. officials said, dashing hopes that a resolution of a contentious issue that has poisoned the relationship between the two countries was in sight.

“There is frustration when it comes to the issue of Afghan sovereignty in the prison transfer, and when we see that what we asked for is not respected,” said Aimal Faizi, Karzai’s spokesman. “Whenever it happens again, our position will be the same.”

Afghan officials say they will not extend veto power to the United States when it comes to the release of detainees, even a small group of high-profile prisoners of particular concern to U.S. officials. That issue has long appeared to be intractable, given U.S. concern that dangerous insurgents would promptly return to the battlefield upon being released.

On Saturday night, Karzai issued a statement saying the prison handover would occur in the coming week, but it was not clear whether it reflected an aspiration or an actual resolution.

Hagel’s first full day in Kabul as defense chief started ominously, as a suicide bomber riding a bicycle detonated explosives outside the main gate of the Defense Ministry, a rare security breach in one of the capital’s most heavily policed areas. Nine people were killed and 10 were wounded, Mohammed Daud Amin, the deputy police commander of Kabul, said. The majority of the victims were civilians.

Less than an hour later, a man detonated a vest loaded with explosives near the capital of the eastern Khost province, killing eight children and one police officer, said Mobarez Zadran, a provincial spokesman. Afghan officials said the man was targeting a joint U.S.-Afghan military patrol when he was stopped by the police officer, which led him to trigger the explosive device. The slain children were playing in the area at the time, officials said.

“We’re at war,” Hagel said later, speaking to reporters at a military base in Jalalabad, also in the east, where he traveled to meet with U.S. troops. “War didn’t stop. That’s just the reality.”

A Taliban spokesman said the group had carried out Saturday’s attack in Kabul in an effort to prevent Hagel from “spreading lies” about the insurgency’s weakness.

Violence was not the only disappointment of the day.

U.S. and Afghan officials have been at odds for more than a year over the fate of detainees in American custody in Afghanistan. Karzai wants the Americans to cease detention operations entirely, but U.S. officials have insisted on a phased handover of their detention system, arguing that an abrupt handover would be dangerous.

Karzai balked on Friday to a few of the terms Afghan and American negotiators had reached in the latest round of talks, prompting the Afghan government to hastily scrap the ceremony at the Parwan facility, which would have presented an image of synergy between Washington and Kabul during Hagel’s visit.

“The Parwan deal has been a long time in the making,” a senior defense official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the dispute. “There have been a few hiccups at the end.”

The official said the terms Karzai has not agreed to are “not terribly substantial,” adding that these disputes have become part and parcel of the U.S.-Afghan relationship. “This happens frequently, especially with the Afghans,” the official said.

Aside from the issue of veto power, Karzai raised concerns about the importance of sharing U.S. intelligence about Afghan detainees. Although some of that intelligence could be declassified and given to Afghans, much of it will remain restricted in accordance with American national security policy.

If U.S. officials want to interrogate a detainee more than 96 hours after his capture, Faizi said, Karzai has stipulated that those officials must submit a formal request to an Afghan review board before gaining access to the prison.

“When the final draft was presented to the president, he decided several changes needed to be made at the last minute,” Faizi said. “He worried that the language used raised questions about sovereignty.”

Beyond the detention issue, Karzai has sought to curb U.S. military authority by calling for the expulsion of special forces from a key eastern province that serves as a gateway to the capital. Karzai called for U.S. elite troops to leave Wardak province by Sunday after accusing them two weeks ago of committing abuses. But a coalition official told reporters Saturday that that deadline is not firm and officials are holding out hope that the Afghan government will reconsider that position.

“There’s a little bit of space in terms of the exact date,” said the official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity. The official said that a probe into the Wardak allegations has “found no evidence of misconduct by our forces.”

Hagel said he was hopeful a resolution would be reached, but he offered no details."

The blast reflected the deep insecurity in the North African nation, where multiple armed militias run rampant -- many of them dominated by Islamic militants -- and the central government is too weak to rein them in.

The violence is particularly sharp in Benghazi, the country's second largest city, which has seen frequent killings of Libyan security officials and a string of attacks on diplomatic facilities, most notably the Sept. 11, 2012 storming of a U.S. diplomatic post that killed the ambassador and three other Americans.

The attack comes in the wake of a U.S. special forces raid last weekend that snatched an al Qaeda suspect from the streets of the Libyan capital, Tripoli, spiriting him off to custody in a U.S. warship. Many militiamen and Islamic militants were angered by the raid, blaming the Libyan government -- and on Thursday, gunmen briefly kidnapped the country's prime minister.

Some militiamen have hinted of retaliation against Americans -- or other foreigners -- but there was no immediate sign Friday's bombing was linked to the raid.

The Swedish and Finnish consulates are among the few foreign diplomatic posts still operating in Benghazi.

A Libyan security official said the car bomb was detonated by remote control on Friday in the upscale neighborhood of Benghazi. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media.

The morning blast heavily damaged the windows and facade of the building, but there were no reports of injuries, Ursula Ahlen of the Swedish Foreign Ministry in Stockholm said. The facility was closed for business since Friday is a weekend day in Libya.

""All the doors were ripped up by the blast. When I walked out to the stair case it had been blackened by soot,"" the former honorary consul, Anders Nilsson -- who still lives at the site with his sister, the current honorary consul, told Swedish broadcaster SVT by telephone from Benghazi. Nilsson said he had just returned from morning shopping and was in the kitchen when the blast went off. He said eight or nine people were in the building at the time.

Finland's honorary consul was also in the building at the time but was not hurt, the Foreign Ministry in Helsinki said.

The consulates perform diplomatic functions like issuing visas and citizen services, but they are headed by ""honorary consuls"" -- nationals who were already residing in the city and were named by their home governments to represent the nations, as opposed to members of the diplomatic corps assigned there.

Foreign diplomats have been repeatedly targeted amid Libya's continuous instability, particularly in Benghazi, where Islamic militants are particularly strong among militias. The 2012 attack on the American diplomatic post has been blamed on militants believed to be linked to al Qaeda.

In January, militants opened fire on the car of the Italian consul in Benghazi. He was not hurt in the attack. In June 2012, the British ambassador's vehicle was attacked with rocket-propelled grenades, injuring two of his bodyguards, as he visited the city.

Last week, a mob attacked the Russian Embassy in the capital, Tripoli, climbing over its walls, pulling down a gate and firing in the air, prompting Moscow to evacuate its diplomats and their families. The attack was sparked when a Russian woman was arrested for allegedly killing a Libyan air force officer and his mother.

Libya's central government has struggled to impose its authority over the country since the 2011 ouster of autocrat Muammar Qaddafi. It has been helpless to rein in militias, which originated as rebel brigades against Qaddafi but have mushroomed into powerful forces of their own while the army and police remain weak, under-equipped and under-paid.

Militiamen abducted Prime Minister Ali Zidan from his residence in a Tripoli hotel before dawn on Thursday. He was freed hours later by another militia.

But outrage against Zidan continues among many Islamists over Saturday's U.S. raid that captured al Qaeda suspect Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai, known by his alias Abu Anas al-Libi. Many militiamen and militants accuse Zidan of cooperating with the Americans in the operation, though the government has denied having any prior knowledge of the raid.

Al-Libi is accused by the U.S. in connection with the 1998 bombings of its embassies in Tanzania and Kenya."

Obama said Tuesday he needs more evidence of chemical weapons use in Syria

%22Obama will never be obliged to do anything%2C%22 Syrian rebel supporter says

Obama said in August that a %22red line%22 for the U.S. would be chemical weapons use

BERLIN — Supporters of rebels fighting to topple Syrian President Bashar Assad expressed disappointment Tuesday at President Obama's insistence that the United States needs more facts about Assad's use of chemical weapons before ordering American response.

""Obama will never get the concrete evidence he wants unless there's a full U.N. investigation, to which Assad will not agree,"" said Abdulwahab Omar, a Syrian anti-Assad activist based in London.

""That means Obama will never be obliged to do anything,"" he said. ""You can call it a bluff. He tried to show that the United States would be prepared to intervene when things get serious, when in reality, the U.S. is not prepared to intervene unless its own interests are directly affected.""

At a news conference Tuesday at the White House, Obama said the United States has evidence chemical weapons were used in Syria but does not know who used them. Until that is clear, the U.S. would not make any decisions on how to respond, he said.

When reports surfaced last year that the Syrian army had deployed chemical weapons, Obama was pressed on whether the use of such weapons would prompt him to order some form of U.S. military intervention to stop it. Syrian rebels have been asking Western nations to enforce a no-fly zone over Syria as they did in Libya to prevent the slaughter of opposition forces there in 2011.

Obama said in August that a ""red line"" for the United States would be if ""we see a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around, or being utilized. That would change my calculus.""

The Syrian regime denies using weapons and says the rebels have used them.

Reports surfaced again last month that Syria has used chemical weapons against the rebels. Last week, the chief of intelligence for the Israeli Defense Forces said Israel had determined that Assad had used a form of nerve gas on civilians in rebel strongholds.

In response to questions from Congress, the White House said last week that it believed ""with varying degrees of confidence"" that the Syrian government used a small quantity of sarin gas in its battles with rebels.

On Tuesday, reporters asked Obama whether he would respond militarily if he were satisfied that Syria crossed his ""red line.""

""We would have to rethink the range of options before us,"" he said, and added that the use of chemical weapons is worrying because they could fall into the hands of anti-American factions.

Abdulwahab Omar believes that is the only red line Obama is concerned about.

""What he really meant is if chemical weapons are used in such a way that they might be considered a threat to U.S. interests,"" he said. ""The chemical attacks that have (been carried out) by the Assad regime are small-scale and only against Syrians — they did not have international consequences. As a result, Obama will not do anything.""

The Obama administration has said it supports an investigation by the United Nations to determine how the chemical weapons were used. But the U.N. has already initiated an investigation that stalled when Assad refused permission for investigators to enter the country.

""Proof can only be achieved through full, impartial investigations,"" Omar said. ""This is something that you cannot do in the war zone. The Assad regime will not allow it to happen.""

Omar says Obama is saving face and that if the United States had any real interest in aiding the fall of the Assad regime, it would have done so by now.

The U.N. says about 80,000 Syrians have been killed in the conflict that began in March 2011.

""We are two years into this conflict. Pretty much every atrocity the regime can do, it has done. Mass killings, executions, the use of scud missiles, chemical weapons,"" he said. ""There's not much left for the regime to do that would bring the Obama administration's conscience out."""

In a nationally televised prime-time address from the East Room of the White House, Obama cautiously embraced a Russian proposal that the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad give up its stockpile of chemical weapons, signaling that he would drop his call for an assault on the regime if Assad complies.

But with little guarantee that diplomacy would prevail, Obama spent the bulk of his 17-minute speech trying to directly address the concerns that have moved public opinion and Congress against him over the past week.

The president argued that a military response is in the national interest, although he conceded that Syria poses no direct threat to the United States. Obama said that not responding to Assad’s alleged use of chemical weapons in an Aug. 21 attack that killed more than 1,400 outside Damascus would allow him to use them again and would embolden other regimes hostile to the United States, including Iran.

At the same time, Obama made an emotional appeal to Americans’ basic sense of right and wrong, invoking the use of gas in World War I and the Holocaust in arguing that the United States has the “exceptional” responsibility to use its military power to punish nations that use weapons of mass destruction. Obama went so far as to urge Americans to watch graphic videos of the aftermath of the attack in Syria.

“What kind of world will we live in if the United States of America sees a dictator brazenly violate international law with poison gas and we choose to look the other way?” Obama said. “Our ideals and principles, as well as our national security, are at stake in Syria, along with our leadership of a world where we seek to ensure that the worst weapons will never be used.”

(Read the transcript of President Obama’s speech.)

The speech was an unusual plea from a president who had risked his and his nation’s credibility on whether he could get Congress to support him, even as he has put off the possibility of a military strike for the moment and has maintained that as commander in chief he doesn’t need congressional approval to launch one in any case.

As it became clear this week that lawmakers probably would oppose the use of force, perhaps overwhelmingly, the Russian proposal offered Obama a potential way out. At his request, Congress has postponed votes on whether to authorize a strike.

The address Tuesday followed an extraordinary, fast-moving and unpredictable two days in American politics and international diplomacy.

Obama began the week planning to make a clear-cut case for attacking the Assad regime. But on Monday morning, an offhand remark by Secretary of State John F. Kerry prompted the Russians to propose that Syria, an ally, surrender its chemical weapons to avoid strikes.

That set off a flurry of negotiations by American, European, Russian and United Nations officials in search of a diplomatic deal. The talks gained steam on Tuesday when the Assad government said it was open to the proposal, for the first time acknowledging that it possesses chemical weapons, and agreed to sign an international pact banning their use.

But by late afternoon, momentum behind a diplomatic solution was beginning to wane. Western and Russian diplomats clashed over whether the United Nations would authorize military action to degrade Syria’s chemical weapons programs if a diplomatic agreement were violated.

Western diplomats insisted that the threat of strikes was a critical ingredient that would ensure Syrian compliance. But Russian officials said that a diplomatic route would work only if the United States and its allies renounced the use of force.

And experts questioned whether it would be possible to transfer stockpiles of chemical weapons to an international monitor amid a civil war that has killed more than 100,000 people.

Still, Obama said Tuesday night that he wants to give the process more time, and he dispatched Kerry to meetings in Europe to work out the details of a potential U.N. agreement.

The president said he turned to Congress for authorization because he thinks that any action would be stronger if backed by lawmakers, especially after more than a decade of war.

Obama’s speech did not immediately appear to change minds on Capitol Hill. A number of Democratic senators expressed support afterward for his diplomatic approach, while remaining wary of military action. Most Senate Republicans who were on the fence remained unconvinced.

“I don’t think the case for military action has been made,” said Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa). But, he added, “the Russian proposal to force Assad to turn over chemical weapons to international monitors presents a possible alternative.”

Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said they regret that Obama “did not speak more forcefully” about providing military assistance to moderate opposition groups in Syria and for not laying out “a clearer plan to test the seriousness” of the Russian proposal.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) argued that the administration’s threat of force has already yielded benefits.

“The president using the credible threat of American military action to bring diplomatic solutions back to the table demonstrates the strength of his leadership and his willingness to exhaust every remedy before the use of force,” she said.

Obama had previously taken his argument to Capitol Hill to lobby lawmakers, saying that he would pursue the diplomatic option but that the United States must be prepared to strike if it failed.

Lawmakers emerging from the meetings agreed that the diplomatic route should be given a chance.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), one of the few members of either party in the House who backs a military strike, said he suspects the new proposal is a stalling tactic.

“Clearly, diplomacy is always a better outcome than military action,” he said. But, he added, “I’m somewhat skeptical of those that are involved in the diplomatic discussion today. . . . I’m skeptical of it because of the actors that are involved — simple as that.”

Lawmakers predicted that it could take until next week, or longer, before a decision is made in Congress.

“I don’t think we need to rush out right now with our hair on fire,” said Sen. Bob Corker (Tenn.), the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “Our best course of action is to pause.”

Obama’s address came after his administration has struggled to sell his case to the public and Congress, offering muddled messages about the reasons for intervention and the nature of a potential attack.

The president and aides have alternatively argued that a strike would constitute a significant intervention that could help undermine Assad’s stance in the Syrian civil war, and that it would be an extremely limited intervention that would leave Assad in power. Obama has made clear that he will not put U.S. troops on the ground.

About a year ago, he set a “red line” against the use of chemical weapons. When he concluded that the Syrian regime had launched a sarin attack, he prepared to unilaterally order strikes — only to change his mind and seek congressional support.

National security experts said it made sense for Obama to delay action given that his hand may be strengthened even if the diplomatic solution fails.

“It gets him out of his disastrous political mess,” said Rosa Brooks, a former defense official in the Obama administration and Georgetown professor. Obama will be able to say he made every effort to avoid a military conflict, making it “a lot easier for him to make the case for force.”

But others said that even a deal would have downsides.

“You can be seduced into thinking you’re working the problem,” said Jon Alterman, a former State Department official now at the Center for Strategic & International Studies.” The problem is the broader consequences of a longer-term insurgency in Syria which attracts jihadis, brings in neighboring countries and destabilizes the region.”

In another sign of easing tension between their nations, Undersecretary of State Wendy Sherman and other Americans met for an hour with Iranians led by Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi at the U.N.'s Palais des Nations. It was only the second such U.S.-Iranian bilateral meeting in seven years of diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict over Iran’s nuclear program.

The meeting capped a day that began with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif laying out, in an hourlong English-language PowerPoint presentation, a plan to resolve the 2-decade-old dispute. Zarif’s title for the presentation suggested his goal: “Closing an Unnecessary Crisis — Opening New Horizons.”

U.S. officials said in a statement that the evening meeting was “useful” though “expected,” in light of Secretary of State John F. Kerry’s private meeting with Zarif last month on the sidelines of the U.N.'s annual meeting in New York.

The diplomacy began amid high expectations because of two months of overtures between the United States and Iran, which have stirred speculation that the two countries may be ready to solve the dispute and repair their relationship. On Sept. 27, President Obama broke three decades’ precedent by speaking to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani by telephone.

Yet though U.S. officials praised the Iranians for their willingness to delve into technical details, it was not clear that the Iranian delegation had given the Americans what they wanted to hear about curbing the nuclear program. Zarif and Araghchi spoke mostly in broad terms about their goals, diplomats said.

In the last decade of international meetings on the nuclear program, the Iranians have often not shown their hand until the final hours, analysts noted.

Iranian officials, who are eager to ease sanctions on their economy, have in recent days promised to present a broad “road map” that would chart the path to a resolution of the dispute over its program, which many nations fear is aimed at developing a nuclear weapons capability. Iranian officials have said in private meetings that they would agree to stop production of medium-enriched uranium, which is of special concern to the West because it is easily converted into nuclear bomb fuel, and to allow for international inspection of nuclear sites.

Iranian officials made no public comment Tuesday about the contents of their plan. But in interviews with his nation’s state-controlled media, Araghchi emphasized that Iran intends to maintain its vast nuclear complex, which is a source national pride.

In interviews with the Islamic Republic News Agency and the Iranian Students News Agency, Araghchi said Iran intends to continue operating the disputed Fordow and Natanz enrichment plants, and will insist that world powers recognize Iran’s “right” to enrichment.

He said Iran will cooperate with the United Nations on the nuclear program and other issues. But he didn’t mention a halt in the production of medium-enriched uranium, or a decision to send the existing stockpile of the material out of the country, as the West has urged.

He said that the Iranian religious directive, or fatwa, against the use of nuclear weapons would be sufficient to build the world’s confidence that Iran intended its nuclear activities to be peaceful.

Ray Takeyh, an Iran specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that, in the accounts, “I don’t see anything shutting or being shipped out. If that’s still our red line, then presumably this falls below it.” But he acknowledged that it was not possible to draw conclusions about Iran’s intentions based on the sketchy information on the talks available so far.

U.S. officials have sought to play down expectations for the meetings, saying that a breakthrough was unlikely to come quickly on such a complicated issue. In comments to reporters, Araghchi also was unwilling to say that progress had yet been made.

Negotiators for the seven countries — Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China, in addition to the U.S. and Iran — will meet again Wednesday. Iranian officials have suggested that they might meet several additional times at a more senior level in the weeks ahead.

Catherine Ashton, who is the European Union’s foreign policy chief and point person for the six major powers, met privately Tuesday evening with Zarif.

The National Intelligence Estimate, which includes input from the country’s 16 intelligence agencies, predicts that the Taliban and other power brokers will become increasingly influential as the United States winds down its longest war in history, according to officials who have read the classified report or received briefings on its conclusions. The grim outlook is fueling a policy debate inside the Obama administration about the steps it should take over the next year as the U.S. military draws down its remaining troops.

The report predicts that Afghanistan would likely descend into chaos quickly if Washington and Kabul don’t sign a security pact that would keep an international military contingent there beyond 2014 — a precondition for the delivery of billions of dollars in aid that the United States and its allies have pledged to spend in Afghanistan over the coming years.

“In the absence of a continuing presence and continuing financial support,” the intelligence assessment “suggests the situation would deteriorate very rapidly,” said one U.S. official familiar with the report.

That conclusion is widely shared among U.S. officials working on Afghanistan, said the official, who was among five people familiar with the report who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss the assessment.

Some officials have taken umbrage at the underlying pessimism in the report, arguing that it does not adequately reflect how strong Afghanistan’s security forces have become. One American official, who described the NIE as “more dark” than past intelligence assessments on the war, said there are too many uncertainties to make an educated prediction on how the conflict will unfold between now and 2017, chief among them the outcome of next year’s presidential election.

“I think what we’re going to see is a recalibration of political power, territory and that kind of thing,” said one U.S. official who felt the assessment was unfairly negative. “It’s not going to be an inevitable rise of the Taliban.”

A senior administration official said that the intelligence community has long underestimated Afghanistan’s security forces.

“An assessment that says things are going to be gloomy no matter what you do, that you’re just delaying the inevitable, that’s just a view,” said the official. “I would not think it would be the determining view.”

U.S. intelligence analysts did not provide a detailed mapping of areas they believe are likely to become controlled by specific groups or warlords in coming years, said one of the officials. But the analysts anticipate that the central government in Kabul is all but certain to become increasingly irrelevant as it loses “purchase” over parts of the country, the official said.

Some have interpreted the intelligence assessment as an implicit indictment of the 2009 troop surge, which President Obama authorized under heavy pressure from the U.S. military in a bid to strengthen Afghan institutions and weaken the insurgency. The senior administration official said the surge enabled the development of a credible and increasingly proficient Afghan army and made it unlikely that al-Qaeda could reestablish a foothold in the country where the Sept. 11 attacks were plotted.

“By no means has the surge defeated the Taliban,” the official said, but its stated goal was to “reverse the Taliban’s momentum and give the government more of an edge. I think we achieved that.”

A spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which issues intelligence estimates, declined to comment. Officials at the White House declined to speak about the NIE’s findings. In an e-mailed statement, a senior administration official said intelligence assessments are “only one tool in our policy analysis toolbox.”

“One of the intelligence community’s principal duties is to warn about potential upsides and downsides to U.S. policy, and we frequently use their assessments to identify vulnerabilities and take steps to correct them,” the statement said. “We will be weighing inputs from the [intelligence community] alongside those of the military, our diplomats and development experts as we look at the consequential decisions ahead of us, including making a decision on whether to leave troops in Afghanistan after the end of 2014.”

The Obama administration has sought to get permission from Kabul to keep troops that would carry out counterterrorism and training missions beyond 2014. Afghan President Hamid Karzai has so far refused to sign a bilateral security agreement with the United States and has made demands that Washington calls unrealistic.

Karzai’s intransigence has emboldened those in the administration and Congress who favor a quick drawdown. The latest intelligence assessment, some U.S. officials noted, has provided those inclined to abandon Afghanistan with strong fodder.

NIEs are issued periodically, normally ahead of a major policy decisions. One issued in 2008 was seen by international diplomats as having presented an “unrelentingly gloomy” picture of the state of affairs in Afghanistan, according to a U.S. diplomatic cable that was released by WikiLeaks.

Another one issued in 2010, when the U.S. troop surge was at its peak, also offered a decidedly grim assessment. U.S. war commanders have submitted rebuttal letters to make note of their disagreements or highlight success stories they felt were not being taken into account.

The issue came to a head when Gen. David E. Petraeus left command of the international coalition in Kabul to take the helm of the CIA in 2011. He instructed analysts at the agency, which plays the dominant role in shaping NIEs, to consult more closely with commanders on the ground as they put together future war zone intelligence estimates. The directive was seen by some as an affront to the agency’s mandate to provide policymakers with independent, fact-based analysis.

Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, the commander of international troops in Afghanistan, chose not to submit a rebuttal to the latest NIE, according to two U.S. officials. A spokesman for the general said he would not comment on the report.

Stephen Biddle, a defense policy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, said Afghanistan experts in and out of government have a range of outlooks. The optimists see Afghan security forces expanding their territorial control until the Taliban is forced into a peace deal. Pessimists fear the government could eventually lose control of the capital and other big cities. Biddle said he predicts a stalemate for years to come.

“Whether it’s a worse or better stalemate depends on the rate at which Congress defunds the war,” he said."

He Left The Times In']",Iran nuclear deal foes rein in criticism,"WASHINGTON — As they prepare for battle over the new deal to limit Iran’s nuclear program, the accord’s supporters and foes are calibrating strategies based on their reading of Americans’ conflicted views about the Islamic Republic.

American war-weariness forms a big part of the Obama administration’s campaign for the accord, a preliminary agreement to curb Iran’s disputed nuclear program. Administration officials have said that without a diplomatic deal, the country would be on a “march to war.”

For now, the administration appears to have the upper hand. Many skeptics of the deal, who issued sharp criticism shortly after its announcement, have since muted their words.

Instead of attacking the agreement directly, opponents have pinned their hopes on continued American suspicion of Iran and its leaders. They expect the government in Tehran to fail to meet its obligations under the agreement and are poised to go on the offensive if that happens.

“Critics of the deal are reluctant to attack it too frontally because they realize how popular it is,” said Dylan Williams, legislative director for J Street, a liberal pro-Israel group that supports the deal.

Polls suggest that support for the deal is strong now but could easily decline. Americans are deeply reluctant to embark on a new Middle East war. At the same time, however, Americans have consistently held negative views of Iran since the hostage crisis during the Carter administration.

For years, many Americans have said in surveys that they would support military action if that was necessary to prevent Tehran from obtaining a nuclear bomb. A June poll by the Pew Research Center found 64% support among Americans for such intervention.

Now, however, a Reuters-Ipsos survey released Tuesday showed 44% of respondents supported the new accord; 22% opposed it. If the deal failed, 49% would favor more sanctions, 31% wanted more diplomacy, and 20% wanted to turn to military force.

“The appetite for military engagement anywhere is very low,” said pollster Julia Clark of Ipsos. After two wars that were far longer and costlier than expected, “we in the public feel burned.”

Even so, Clark said, opinions on the deal could change because Americans are uncertain about its complexity and have negative views about Iran, which has been at odds with the United States since the 1979 revolution. She noted that about one-third of the poll’s respondents weren’t sure how they felt.

“There’s real hesitation here,” she said.

The preliminary agreement between Iran and six world powers, including the U.S., was announced Sunday in Geneva. It would temporarily ease some of the sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy in return for a halt to key aspects of the country’s nuclear program.

The deal is intended to allow time to negotiate a comprehensive agreement on the nuclear program. Iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but officials of many countries believe the effort is aimed at developing at least the capability to build a nuclear weapon.

Opponents of the deal have called for new sanctions, saying that greater pressure could force Iran to yield more. The Obama administration calls that unrealistic and says new sanctions could derail any chance for diplomacy to succeed.

In a videotaped message designed to sell the deal to Congress, Secretary of State John F. Kerry said the negotiators had moved to prevent Iran from acquiring a bomb “in the most effective way: We did it through diplomacy.”

A number of key lawmakers who have criticized the agreement have said they support additional sanctions but are ready to hold off unless signs emerge of Iran not holding up its part of the deal.

Sens. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), ranking minority member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called for deferred sanctions.

Israeli officials have strenuously opposed the accord, and lawmakers who support Israel have been prominent among the deal’s critics. But statements from major pro-Israel organizations in the United States have been relatively mild.

The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the leading pro-Israel lobby, cited “serious concerns” that Iran could still develop a bomb even if the two sides reached a final deal. But AIPAC said new sanctions should be imposed only if Iran violated the agreement or failed to agree to an acceptable final deal.

Another major American Jewish group, the Anti-Defamation League, said it was “deeply concerned” about the “flaws” in the deal. But instead of calling for sanctions, it committed itself to “work to promote a final agreement which ensures Iran is incapable of building a nuclear weapon.”

An official of another pro-Israel group, who declined to be identified, citing the sensitivity of the issue, said many in the organization were reluctant to be seen as trying to block the deal, especially at a time when the issue was straining relations between Israel and the Obama administration.

Mark Wallace, chief executive of the advocacy group United Against Nuclear Iran, acknowledged that the deal had support, but predicted that the backing would fade “when people begin to digest and understand the agreement.”

Clark, of Ipsos, said that could happen. The Reuters-Ipsos survey found “some hedging” in reactions because of the uncertainty about the details of the deal, she said.

But the uncertainty of public opinion creates risks for both supporters and opponents, she said. “If there’s a sudden great surge of confidence, people may not want to be on the record as being against it.”

A department official acknowledged Sunday that the extradition process had broken down during discussions between the United States and Hong Kong.

Snowden was never detained in Hong Kong or “under any kind of police protection” while he was staying in Hong Kong, said a department official, speaking anonymously because of the delicate matter of dealing with a host of countries regarding Snowden. The official said that there were delays in getting a criminal warrant to that country and in trying to arrange an extradition hearing.

The former contractor for the National Security Agency flew to Sheremetyevo International Airport in Moscow, the official said. But rather than remaining at the airport “under some kind of asylum,” he was taken by car under some sort of official Russian protection. As he understands it, the official said, Snowden and the Russians can claim he is in a “comfort zone” until he departs, probably on Monday.

“We are nor sure about Cuba as his next stop,” the official cautioned. He said the United States was monitoring Iceland and Ecuador.

The department filed a sealed criminal complaint against Snowden on June 14 that included allegations under the Espionage Act. Department spokeswoman Nanda Chitre said the United States had contacted Hong Kong “based on the criminal complaint filed in the Eastern District of Virginia, and in accordance with the U.S.-Hong Kong Agreement for the Surrender of Fugitive Offenders.”

“We will continue to discuss this matter with Hong Kong and pursue relevant law enforcement cooperation with other countries where Mr. Snowden may be attempting to travel,” Chitre said.

Hong Kong apparently knew where Snowden was staying, said the department official who asked not to be identified, but there was still a delay in tracking and finding him before he suddenly left for Moscow.

There was also the matter of having top officials in Hong Kong brief the Chinese government in Beijing, and both U.S. and Hong Kong officials were still waiting for Beijing to approve his arrest.

“There was a lot of red tape, but we thought it would get done,” the official said.

He added that, while Hong Kong could have legally moved on its own against Snowden, it nevertheless apparently wanted to wait for a blessing from Beijing.

He said further that when the complaint was unsealed Friday evening, and Hong Kong and Beijing realized that two of the three charges fell under the Espionage Act, it suddenly “raised political concerns and put a new dimension into things.”

http://news.yahoo.com/china-military-sends-air-patrols-defense-zone-033423305.html,,[],"China scrambles jets to new defense zone, eyes U.S., Japan flights","By Ben Blanchard and Roberta Rampton BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China scrambled jets on Friday in response to two U.S. spy planes and 10 Japanese aircraft, including F-15 fighters, entering its new air defense zone over the East China Sea, state news agency Xinhua said, raising the stakes in a standoff with the United States, Japan and South Korea. The jets were scrambled for effective monitoring, Xinhua cited air force spokesman Shen Jinke as saying. The report gave no further details. Japan and South Korea flew military aircraft through the zone, which includes the skies over islands at the heart of a territorial dispute between Japan and China, the two countries said on Thursday. Washington sent two unarmed B-52 bombers into the airspace earlier this week and U.S. officials confirmed on Friday that U.S. flights were ""routinely"" transiting the zone. ""These flights are consistent with long standing and well known U.S. freedom of navigation policies,"" Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steve Warren said. ""I can confirm that the U.S. has and will continue to operate in the area as normal."" One U.S. defense official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said the routine operations included reconnaissance and surveillance flights. Xinhua earlier said China had sent several fighter jets and an early warning aircraft into the new air defense zone. China last week announced that foreign aircraft passing through it - including passenger planes - would have to identify themselves to Chinese authorities. The Chinese patrol mission, conducted on Thursday, was ""a defensive measure and in line with international common practices"", Xinhua reported Shen as saying. The aircraft, including Russian-designed Su-30 fighter jets, conducted routine patrols and monitored targets in the zone, Shen said. ""China's air force is on high alert and will take measures to deal with diverse air threats to firmly protect the security of the country's airspace,"" he said. However, Defence Ministry spokesman Yang Yujun said it was ""incorrect"" to suggest China would shoot down aircraft which entered the zone without first identifying themselves. He did not elaborate. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Friday he did not know if Chinese planes were in the zone but added there was no change to Japan's sense of alertness. Ties between China and Japan have been strained for months by the dispute over the islands in the East China Sea, called the Diaoyu by China and the Senkaku by Japan. Washington takes no position on the sovereignty of the islands but recognizes Tokyo's administrative control and says the U.S.-Japan security pact applies to them. Europe's top diplomat, Catherine Ashton, said the European Union was concerned about China's decision to establish the new air defense zone as well as its announcement of ""emergency defense measures"" if other parties did not comply. ""This development heightens the risk of escalation and contributes to raising tensions in the region,"" Ashton said. ""The EU calls on all sides to exercise caution and restraint."" CRITICISM China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang criticized Ashton's remarks, saying China hoped the EU could treat the situation ""objectively and rationally"". ""Actually, Madam Ashton should know that some European countries also have air defense identification zones,"" Qin said. ""I don't know if this leads to tensions in the European regional situation. European countries can have air defense identification zones. Why can't China?"" Asked to clarify China's expectations for what information airlines were expected to report, Qin said: ""International law does not have clear rules on what kind of flight or airplane should apply"", adding that each country made its own rules. ""Therefore, China's method does not violate international law and accords with international practice,"" he said. China's Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that since the zone had come into force there had been no impact on the safe operation of international civilian flights, although it added that China ""hoped"" airlines would cooperate. Japan's two biggest airlines have defied the identification order since Wednesday at the request of the Japanese government. Although there are risks of a confrontation in the zone, U.S. and Chinese military officials have stepped up communication with each other in recent years and are in regular contact to avoid accidental clashes. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden will visit China, Japan and South Korea next week, and will try to ease tensions over the issue, senior U.S. officials said. ""We decline to comment on Chinese flights, but the United States will continue to partner with our allies and operate in the area as normal,"" a Pentagon spokesman said. China's Defence Ministry has said that it was aware of the U.S., Japanese and South Korean military aircraft in the zone and had tracked them all. Ties between China and Japan, often tense, have increasingly been frayed in recent years by regional rivalry, mutual mistrust over military intentions and what China feels is Japan's lack of contrition over its brutal occupation of parts of China before and during World War Two. In a show of support for the military, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited a base in Jinan in eastern China, where he said ""military training is critical to beef up the PLA's (People's Liberation Army) war capacities"", according to the Xinhau news agency. Xi did not make direct mention of the East China Sea air defense zone. ""Though life is becoming better, history can't be forgotten and those who made sacrifices for (the) new China's founding must be remembered,"" Xinhua quoted Xi as saying in a separate report. The Global Times, an influential tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily newspaper, praised the government for its calm response in the face of ""provocations"", saying China would not target the United States in the zone as long as it ""does not go too far"". But it warned Japan it could expect a robust response if it continued to fly military aircraft in the zone. ""If the trend continues, there will likely be frictions and confrontations and even a collision in the air ... It is therefore an urgent task for China to further train its air force to make full preparation for potential conflicts,"" it wrote in an editorial on Friday.

Sanger']",U.S. Helps Allies Trying to Battle Iranian Hackers,"A directive signed by the president that surfaced Friday — the third in a series of leaked documents published by the newspapers The Guardian and The Washington Post — underscored how the Obama administration is trying to prepare itself and its allies. The leaks also revealed how the Obama administration has put in place a large Internet surveillance operation to identify terrorism threats.

The presidential directive included the declaration that the United States reserved the right to take “anticipatory action” against “imminent threats,” a reference, it seemed, to the kind of crippling infrastructure attacks that Iran appears to be working on against American and allied targets.

The new help for strengthening computer-network defenses for allies, which has not been publicly announced, closely parallels earlier efforts by the Obama administration in two volatile parts of the world. In recent years it has helped install advanced missile-defense systems and early-warning radars in Persian Gulf nations to counter Iran’s missile ability, and it has done something similar in Asia in response to North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.

But deterring cyberattacks is a far more complex problem, and American officials concede that this effort, which will include providing computer hardware and software and training to allies, is an experiment. It has been propelled by two high-profile attacks in the past year. One was against Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s largest, state-run oil producer, and according to American officials it was carried out by Iran. That attack crippled 30,000 computers but did not succeed in halting production. The other, an attack on South Korea’s banking and media companies this spring, was later attributed to North Korea. It froze the ability of several banks to operate for days.

“The Iranian attack on the Saudis was a real wake-up call in the region,” said one senior administration official, who would not speak on the record about the American efforts to counter Iran. “It made everyone realize that while the Iranians might think twice about launching a missile attack in the region, they see cyber as a potent way to lash out in response to sanctions.”"

(CNN) —

It has long been said that in war, “truth is the first casualty.”

It is generally accepted, however, that the United States, the world’s leading democracy, should try to make truth-telling a common practice when it goes to war.

When Gen. David Petraeus was U.S. commander in Afghanistan in 2010 he issued guidance to his troops, one of the key points of which was to “be first with the truth.” The guidance explained, “Avoid spinning, and don’t try to ‘dress up’ an ugly situation. Acknowledge setbacks and failures, including civilian casualties, and then state how we’ll respond and what we’ve learned.”

Yet, in Yemen where the U.S. has been fighting a small, undeclared war for the past four years, we have now arrived at the ironic point where America’s main enemy there, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, is doing a better job of truth telling than the U.S.

In a video message released on Sunday, a leader of al Qaeda in Yemen apologized for an attack on a hospital in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa earlier this month in which civilians were killed.

According to the al Qaeda leader, the attackers were targeting the Yemeni Ministry of Defense, but one fighter made a mistake and attacked a hospital inside the defense ministry: “We confess to this mistake and fault. We offer our apologies and condolences to the families of the victims,” said the al Qaeda leader.

While al Qaeda has publicly – and, no doubt, self-servingly – apologized for killing civilians at the Yemeni hospital during the attack in Sanaa on December 5, at the same time American officials have said nothing publicly about a U.S. drone strike that took place a week later on a suspected convoy of militants in western Yemen on December 12.

The target of this strike turned out to be a wedding party and at least a half dozen civilians are reliably reported to have died.

This gets to a key problem of the secretive American drone program. Its clandestine and unaccountable nature means that when the U.S. does make a mistake, as it inevitably will, instead of apologizing and making some kind of compensation to the civilian victims of a botched strike – a common practice when the U.S. military inadvertently kills civilians in wartime – American officials instead say … nothing.

Or worse, they make claims that the program is somehow perfect and never kills civilians as Obama’s then top counterterrorism adviser, John O. Brennan, improbably claimed of the drone program in June 2011 when he said that for almost a year, “there hasn’t been a single collateral death because of the exceptional proficiency, precision of the capabilities we’ve been able to develop.” Brennan is now the CIA director.

Seeking to redress some of the problems in the drone program, on May 23 President Barack Obama gave a major speech about his counterterrorism policies in Washington in which he said, “Before any strike is taken, there must be near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured – the highest standard we can set.”

Did Obama’s speech and the new policy it sought to inaugurate make any difference to the drone program? Short answer: Yes.

Since that speech the Obama administration has dramatically cut the number of CIA drone strikes in Pakistan and has slightly slowed the number of strikes in Yemen.

There were 14 drone strikes in Pakistan during the past seven months; an average of one strike every 15 days. In the year before Obama’s speech, drone strikes happened every eight days. And there have been no reliably reported civilian casualties in Pakistan from drone strikes since Obama’s May speech, according to an analysis of the drone program by the New America Foundation.

The pace of drone strikes fell in Yemen after Obama’s speech, too, but not as much as it did in Pakistan. Since May 23, there have been 16, an average of about one strike every 13 days. During the previous year, a strike occurred about once every 10 days.

It’s worth noting that the civilian death rate has fallen steadily overall in both Pakistan and Yemen over the past several years, but the strike on December 12 in Yemen and the civilian casualties it caused is a reminder that there is definitely room for improvement.

What can be done?

One idea to make the drone program as accountable as possible is to set up an internal U.S. government body that is independent of the CIA and Pentagon that would conduct reviews of the drone strikes after they have occurred.

One could imagine, for instance, that a small, nonpartisan group of experts on security and law, similar to the group that Obama appointed to analyze the activities of the NSA, could review the aftermath of drone strikes to examine whether the victims of the strikes were in fact militants who posed some kind of threat to the United States. Such additional oversight would make CIA targeters and drone operators all the more diligent to avoid mistakes.

(CNN) —

There have been Christians in the Middle East since the time of, well, Christ.

Now that two millennium-long history could be in danger.

Islamist thugs have attacked dozens of churches across Egypt in the past few days, burning many of them down.

Tim Hetherington for CNN Peter Bergen

The attacks seemed to be protests against the brutal military government crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood that killed many hundreds of Egyptian Islamists over the past week.

Pope Tawadros II, the leader of Egypt’s Christian Copts, met publicly with top military officers as they announced the coup that removed President Mohamed Morsy and his Muslim Brotherhood government from power in early July.

Christians, who make up 10% of the population, and other minorities had complained that a new constitution that had been passed by the Morsy government infringed on their rights.

For some Islamist militants, now it’s payback time. According to one report, 52 churches across Egypt were attacked in 24 hours last week. The Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights has counted at least 30 churches attacked, along with other Christian facilities.

After Morsy was removed from power, a mob armed with axes hacked a Christian businessman to death near Luxor in southern Egypt and then continued their rampage in the village of Nagaa Hassan, burning dozens of Christian homes and killing three other Christians.

Today there are more than 10 million Christians in the Middle East and they make up an estimated 5% of the Middle East’s population.

A century ago they made up an estimated 20%.

Much of this fall can be attributed to factors such as emigration and the high birth rates of many Arab Muslims, but some of it is also attributable to the increasing marginalization and targeting of Christians; a worrying trend being seen not just in Egypt but also in other Arab countries.

Take Syria. Many Syrian Christians have tacitly supported the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, which draws much of its strength from the small Shia Alawite sect and therefore has historically favored and protected Syria’s other religious minorities.

As a result, the jihadists who have come to dominate a significant portion of the Syrian rebel movement have supplemented their war against the government with attacks that target Christians. On June 27, a suicide bombing in a Christian area of Damascus killed at least four people.

Al Qaeda-affiliated rebels are suspected of killing an Italian priest who had spent most of his life rehabilitating a monastery north of the Syrian capital of Damascus and who disappeared last month. The Rev. Paolo Dall’Oglio had reportedly been trying to secure the release of several hostages in the custody of an al Qaeda-aligned group.

Meanwhile, in March in Benghazi, Libya, where a militant attack on a U.S. government complex left four Americans dead in September 2012, around 60 Christians were rounded up by extremists and handed over to the government on suspicion of immigrating from Egypt illegally. The militants tortured several of their captives, killing one of them.

That bout of vigilantism followed the arrest in February of four Christians accused of proselytizing to Muslim Libyans.

The consequence of such attacks and harassment has been an exodus of Christians from the region.

Residents of northeastern Syria, where Christians have historically been concentrated, estimate that one-third of the Christians there have fled the country during the past two years.

Similarly in Iraq, since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, the Christian Iraqi population may have dropped by as much as 50%, according to a CIA assessment.

And despite making up only about 3% of the Iraqi population, Christians accounted for half the Iraqis who fled the country in 2010, about 200,000 people.

Egypt’s religious tensions have a longer history than the recent clashes between Muslim Brotherhood supporters and Christians. Although then-President Hosni Mubarak kept a tight lid on the country’s Islamist extremists, clashes between Muslims and Christians erupted sporadically throughout the ‘90s.

But since Mubarak’s fall, extremist violence against Christians has picked up in Egypt. In early October 2011, Egypt saw its worst instance of sectarian violence in 60 years, when two-dozen Christians died in clashes with the military.

As a result of these kinds of attacks, by one estimate, around 100,000 Christians left Egypt in 2011.

This kind of homogenization has happened before in the Middle East, which boasted a sizable Jewish population in the ‘50s. But with the creation of the state of Israel and the rise of Arab nationalism and then Islamism, the region has become more hostile to non-Muslims.

Around World War II there were 100,000 Jews in Egypt, a community that had existed in Egypt since the time of the pharaohs.

Now, there are a handful of synagogues operating in Cairo. They are heavily guarded and generally empty as they cater only to the few dozen elderly Jews who are still left in Egypt.

One can only hope that this is not to be the fate of the Christians of the Middle East.

Kerry might be wishing he had one of those old red hotline phones to Moscow after it took six days for Russia’s foreign minister to return a call.

Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke for nearly 30 minutes Sunday about the civil war in Syria and North Korea’s recent nuclear test, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said. The two agreed to look for a date in the next several weeks for their first meeting since Kerry took over as the top U.S. diplomat, Nuland added.

Kerry had called Lavrov on Feb. 11, hours after North Korea conducted an underground nuclear test in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions approved by Russia, the United States and other nations. Lavrov, who was traveling in Africa, didn’t call back that day, nor the next, nor for several more days in which State Department reporters had fun ribbing Nuland about the snub.

On Thursday, Nuland insisted Kerry was “relaxed” about the unusual silence from Russia, a difficult partner whose cooperation Kerry will need on numerous international diplomatic problems.

“From our perspective, the secretary would like to talk to him. It’s up to him whether he wants to take that opportunity,” she said.

On Friday, one reporter asked Nuland whether Kerry had found his “missing in action” counterpart.

“They have not connected,” Nuland replied.

“This is getting kind of ridiculous, isn’t it?” another reporter asked.

“As I’ve been saying all week, we’re making it clear that we would like to talk if they want to. If they are too busy or otherwise engaged, the offer stands, and we’ll continue to do other diplomacy,” Nuland responded.

Kerry and Lavrov had spoken once during Kerry’s first week on the job, a courtesy call during which both men agreed to keep lines of communication open, Nuland said at the time.

Lavrov is famously prickly and has a history of needling American counterparts of both political parties. His relationship with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, a Republican, was cordial on the surface, but her face turned stony when Lavrov lectured her during joint public appearances. Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton laughed off Lavrov’s sometimes condescending tone, but took the opportunity on the day of their last meeting to criticize what she said was a Russian effort to “re-Sovietize” its neighbors.

The Obama administration has sought Russian help on Syria for more than a year, with little to show for it. Russia remains Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s most influential ally and arms merchant, and Russia has refused to back stiffer international sanctions or condemnations at the U.N. Security Council. Russia has also apparently refused to intercede with Assad to persuade him to cut a deal with the increasingly powerful rebels trying to unseat him.

“They discussed the importance of the U.S. and Russia using their respective influence on the parties in support of a viable political transition process” in Syria, Nuland said Sunday."

On Wednesday, he told the House Government Oversight Committee that the State Department went out of its way to keep Hicks from communicating with Congressman Jason Chaffetz and Oversight Committee staff without a State Department lawyer.

The State Department seemingly made Hicks unavailable to the media, as the State Department switchboard had no information on Hicks’ whereabouts or contact information when Breitbart News asked for it in December and January.

“I was instructed not to allow the RSO, the acting Deputy Chief of Mission, and myself to be interviewed by Congressman Chaffetz,” Hicks told Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH).

Chaffetz, along with a congressional delegation, visited the U.S. embassy in Tripoli following the attacks.

“You had several Congressional delegations come to you from various places around the world. Has that ever happened, when lawyers get on the phone to you prior a congressional delegation, coming to investigate a time when we’ve had four Americans lose their lives?” Jordan questioned. “Have you ever had anyone tell you, ‘Don’t talk with the people from Congress coming to find out what’s at play?'”

“Never,” Hicks responded. He said that it was the first time such an incident ever occurred.

According to Hicks, one of the State lawyers on the phone call tried to accompany the members of the delegation and staff from the Oversight Committee to every meeting Hicks attended.

The State Department lawyers were excluded from a classified briefing Hicks attended with the delegation because the attorneys did not have clearance to attend. The incident provoked a phone call from then-Sec. Clinton’s State Department Counsel, Cheryl Mills.

“You had another conversation on the phone with Cheryl Mills. She’s the counselor for the Department of State. She’s the staff counsel to Secretary Clinton,” Jordan clarified. He asked, “Is that a pretty important position?” Hicks responded affirmatively on both accounts.

“She is the fixer for the Secretary of State. She’s as close as you can get to Secretary Clinton?” Jordan asked.

Hicks agreed, saying Mills was “very upset” about State lawyers being excluded from the classified briefing with Chaffetz and the rest of the delegation.

“She demanded a report on the visit,” Hicks said. Mills served as the Counselor and Chief of Staff to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton since January of 2009."

USA TODAY

Russia%2C U.S. have been at odds over Syria%2C Snowden and other issues

Obama canceled a meeting with Putin in Moscow%3B their personal relationship continues to deteriorate

G-20 summit officially focuses on economic matters%2C but Obama will also try to rally support for Syria strike

WASHINGTON — With the U.S.-Russia relationship already strained, President Obama's decision to delay a possible military strike against Syria adds an unexpected twist to what was already shaping up to be an awkward G-20 summit hosted by Russian President Vladimir Putin this week in St. Petersburg.

Obama leaves Tuesday for Sweden, a stop added to his itinerary after he canceled a one-on-one meeting with Putin in Moscow ahead of the G-20, which begins Thursday.

The U.S. and Russia have long been at odds over the conflict in Syria as Russia, the only major patron of Syrian President Bashar Assad, has blocked any possibility of the United Nations Security Council mandating action against him in the 2½-year-old civil war.

Russia's blocking of the United Nations on Syria, along with the decision to grant former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden temporary asylum and a lack of recent progress between the two countries on other issues, led Obama last month to cancel the long-anticipated Moscow visit.

Obama announced over the weekend that he wants to take military action against the Assad regime in response to an alleged chemical attack Aug. 21, but first he wants congressional authorization. The G-20 meeting will offer him what is likely his last chance to muster international support from leaders of member countries for a potential strike, and the four-day overseas trip will come after a several-days-long blitz by Obama to persuade skeptical lawmakers at home to give him congressional authority to carry out a strike against Syria.

He called several lawmakers, who are away from Washington for their summer recess, over the weekend to make his case. And Obama met with Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., at the White House on Monday. He's also scheduled to meet with the 12 top-ranking lawmakers representing congressional national security committees on Tuesday.

Secretary of State John Kerry and others on Obama's national security team will continue the White House's lobbying efforts while the president is away. Canceling his trip to Sweden and St. Petersburg was not considered, according to a White House official who was not authorized to comment and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Officially, the G-20 summit's focus is geared toward talks on a slew of global economic issues important to member countries. But Obama is likely to use sideline meetings with leaders to try to build a broader political coalition of countries willing to support U.S. military action in Syria, even if they aren't contributing militarily.

The White House says there are no plans for a one-on-one meeting between Obama and Putin on the sidelines of the summit, but the two will inevitably have some interaction during the course of the meetings.

In the days since Obama announced his desire to take military action against Syria, the chasm between the United States and Russia — at least rhetorically — has widened.

Over the weekend, the Obama administration and Putin traded barbs after Obama declared he wants to carry out a military strike.

Putin called it ""nonsense"" that Assad would authorize a chemical attack and urged Obama to consider whether a strike would have any impact to end the internecine violence or be worth the civilian casualties an American strike potentially could cost.

Secretary of State John Kerry expressed frustration that the Russians have turned a blind eye to evidence the United States has provided to demonstrate that the Syrian regime was responsible for chemical attacks against Syrian opposition this year, first confirmed by the U.S. intelligence community in June.

""They chose – I literally mean chose – not to believe it or to at least acknowledge publicly. I think this evidence is going to be overwhelming,"" Kerry said in an interview on ABC's This Week. ""If the president of Russia chooses yet again to ignore it, that's his choice.""

For the past two years, the Obama-Putin relationship has been ""like watching a slow-moving train wreck,"" says Andrew Kuchins, a Russia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

The two leaders held glum expressions when they appeared for the cameras after their last meeting, the G-8 summit in Northern Ireland in June.

Last month, Obama described Putin as looking like the ""bored kid in the back of the classroom"" while acknowledging that the two have differences of opinion on some matters ""and we're not going to be able to completely disguise them.""

In perhaps Obama's most stinging rebuke, which came in a recent interview with The Tonight Show's Jay Leno, Obama lamented that Putin had a ""Cold War mentality.""

""One thing is clear to me, that this is the worst personal relationship between U.S. and Russian — perhaps even U.S. and Soviet — leaders in history,"" Kuchins said.

Despite the differences, Kerry said that the administration is looking at ways to internationalize efforts to secure Syria's chemical weapons cache and that he hopes Russia could play a role in that effort.

Though the relationship is undergoing particular strain because of differences on the Syria crisis and Russia granting asylum to Snowden, the White House notes that cooperation with Russia has not halted.

In recent weeks, Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel held meetings in Washington with their Russian counterparts, and the two countries have held high-level meetings on the sticky issue of missile defense.

By delaying any military action until he has congressional approval, Obama has avoided having to defend the aftermath of a strike in a summit setting, notes Angela Stent, a Russia analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington.

""Syria might still come up, but it won't dominate the G-20 agenda as it might have had there been a military strike,"" Stent said."
http://news.yahoo.com/iran-nuclear-talks-said-down-fine-print-stage-204200490.html,,[],Iran nuclear talks said down to fine print stage,"GENEVA (AP) — Talks between Iran and six world powers seeking to curb Tehran's nuclear program bogged down early Sunday despite the personal intervention by Secretary of State John Kerry and other foreign ministers whose presence had raised hopes for a breakthrough.

Diplomats refused to spell out details of the talks, which dragged on past midnight into a fifth day. But both sides suggested negotiations focused on detailed wording that could be key in shaping an agreement that both sides could live with.

Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described the talks as being in ""their 11th hour,"" with most issues resolved but an agreement still elusive.

""We have agreed to 98 percent of the draft ... but the remaining 2 percent is very important to us,"" he told reporters.

While he did not specify what was missing, Araghchi said Iran would never accept an agreement that did not in some way acknowledge his country's right to enrich uranium — a key international concern because enrichment can create both reactor fuel and the fissile core of warheads.

The goal is to hammer out an agreement to freeze Iran's nuclear program for six months, while offering the Iranians limited relief from crippling economic sanctions. If the interim deal holds, the parties would negotiate final-stage agreements to ensure Iran does not build nuclear weapons.

Only then would the most crippling sanctions on Iranian oil sales and financial transactions be rolled back.

""There are narrow gaps, but they are important gaps,"" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said about the drafting process, without offering specifics.

An agreement would cap nearly a decade of inconclusive international efforts to halt Iran's expanding nuclear program. Iran insists its program is for peaceful purposes and not aimed at building nuclear weapons.

A deal would build on the momentum of the historic dialogue opened during September's annual U.N. gathering, which included a 15-minute phone conversation between President Barack Obama and Iran's new president, Hassan Rouhani, after three decades of U.S.-Iranian estrangement.

Story continues

For the U.S. and its five partners, the chief concern is uranium enrichment.

Since it was revealed in 2003, Iran's enrichment program has grown from a few dozen enriching centrifuges to more than 18,000 installed and over 10,000 operating. From uranium ore obtained from South Africa in the 1980s and some locally mined ore, the machines have produced tons of low-enriched uranium, which can be turned into weapons grade material.

Iran also has stockpiled almost 200 kilograms (440 pounds) of higher-enriched uranium in a form that can be converted in six to nine weeks to fissile warhead material — almost twice as fast as the low-enriched uranium. Its supply is nearly enough for one bomb.

While saying they are ready for compromise, the Iranians are mindful of criticism from hard-liners back home who oppose dealings with the United States.

Statements on Saturday by senior Iranian negotiators appeared to be an attempt to defuse domestic opposition to a deal that skeptics see as surrendering their country's nuclear sovereignty.

""I assure Iranians enrichment will never stop,"" Iran's state TV quoted Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as saying. ""Iran opposes any demands restricting its rights.'""

The Iranians also are holding out for maximum relief from economic sanctions. The United States and its partners want to relax sanctions in small, incremental steps during the six months of an interim agreement but not remove them entirely pending a final-stage deal.

Issues were believed to include the level of sanctions relief and the future of a plutonium reactor under construction at Arak that the six powers want closed. Plutonium can also be used to make nuclear weapons.

With the talks already running two days over schedule, it was unclear whether the negotiations would continue Sunday. Kerry's spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said he still planned to travel to London on Sunday for meetings on other Middle East issues.

Kerry and his counterparts from Russia, Britain, France, China and Germany joined the Geneva talks after Zarif and top European Union diplomat Catherine Ashton reported progress on enrichment and other issues Friday.

Their participation raised speculation that an agreement was close — an interpretation that the foreign ministers themselves sought to discourage.

""We're not here because things are necessarily finished,"" Britain's Hague told reporters. ""We're here because they're difficult, and they remain difficult.""

The U.S. administration has not confirmed details of what concessions on economic sanctions it might offer. But a member of Congress and legislative aides have said the White House was considering releasing about $3 billion to $5 billion in Iranian funds frozen in foreign banks.

Another $3 billion to $5 billion in revenues could come from sales of petrochemicals and from the revival of the auto industry through supplies of car parts. The aides and the member of Congress demanded anonymity because they weren't authorized to divulge the estimate publicly.

A senior U.S. official told reporters last week that Iran is losing $5 billion a month in lost oil sales alone and $120 billion in total from all sanctions since their imposition, although he did not give a time frame. The official demanded anonymity in keeping with rules established by the U.S. administration.

The U.S. administration is keen to keep rollbacks limited to placate influential members of U.S. Congress who argue that pressure has brought Iran to the negotiating table and cannot be relaxed until Tehran offers significant concessions.

Some military and Congressional critics question whether the command is up to dealing with its dual mission, and some influential lawmakers warn that Africom, with its headquarters in Germany, is understaffed and poorly financed for challenges that include countering Al Qaeda’s fighters in Mali, Islamic extremists in Libya, drug traffickers in West Africa and armed rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The leader of the command, Gen. Carter F. Ham, must straddle the new and the old missions, as he demonstrated one day last month when he flew to the northern reaches of this largely desert nation to watch United States troops train Niger’s fledgling border corps in basic skills to help combat Al Qaeda’s branch in North and West Africa. Then, within hours, he was back here in the capital for an urgent secure phone call from Washington to weigh what kind of advanced military support or surveillance the Pentagon could provide a French-led operation to blunt an Islamist offensive in neighboring Mali.

“The command is searching to find the right balance between the press of current military operations and the vision of longer-term engagement, helping Africans develop greater capacity for themselves,” said Christopher W. Dell, a former United States ambassador to Angola and Zimbabwe, who is General Ham’s deputy for civil-military activities."

As the Obama administration and the U.S. military plot military action against Syria, they should be spending just as much time — and arguably more — considering what happens next. Once Washington crosses the threshold of action, there’s no retreating from blame for anything that follows, whether through action or inaction. And in the weeks and months to come, dangers will only deepen.

First, quick hits rarely achieve enduring political goals — and often produce more costs or unintended consequences than benefits. I’ve seen it so often before.

I lived in Lebanon in the fall of 1983 when the Reagan administration ordered the Marine peacekeepers deployed in Beirut to open fire on a Muslim militia. The commander bluntly warned Washington that a strike would have dire consequences for U.S. policy and his troops. “We’ll get slaughtered down here,” he predicted. Nonetheless, the cruiser Virginia stationed offshore fired 70 deafening rounds on the Lebanese fighters.

It was supposed to be a quick hit. It was supposed to send a warning.

But 34 days later, on Oct. 23, a yellow Mercedes truck carrying the equivalent of 6 tons of explosives drove into the Marine barracks as the peacekeepers slept. In my head, I can still hear the thundering bomb blast. It was the single largest nonnuclear explosion anywhere since World War II. It produced the largest loss of American military life in a single incident since Iwo Jima.

Four months later, the world’s mightiest military was ordered to leave Lebanon, its mission incomplete. The embryo of what became Hezbollah, backed by Iran and Syria, had forced the retreat of American, French, Italian and British troops.

This time in Syria, Washington may again consider its action limited and specifically targeted. But Syria and its allies, notably Hezbollah, surely won’t. And they can respond in many ways.

The last five presidents have tried limited strikes with specific messages in various crisis spots, many in the Middle East. The track record is pretty sorry for both Republican and Democratic administrations.

Again during the Reagan administration, I reported on the 1986 U.S. airstrikes against Libya for bombing a Berlin disco, a hangout for American troops. Three had been killed and more than 200 injured in the blast, not all Americans. Ten days later, U.S. airstrikes sent a kinetic message to Moammar Kadafi about the costs of terrorism.

Operation El Dorado Canyon hit Kadafi’s military headquarters and other military targets in Tripoli and Benghazi, although several bombs missed their targets and hit civilian areas. The strikes did little to end the outrages. Two years later, Libya masterminded the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 that killed 270 people. And Kadafi remained in power another quarter-century.

In 1998, I covered Operation Desert Fox, when the Clinton administration launched four days of cruise missile and bombing strikes against Iraq. Saddam Hussein’s regime had failed to comply with United Nations resolutions and weapons inspectors for a year. The goal was to “degrade” Baghdad’s ability to manufacture weapons of mass destruction and to destabilize Hussein’s hold on power.

The impact was negligible. Hussein held on for five more years, until the George W. Bush administration launched a ground invasion that cost hundreds of billions of dollars and nearly 4,500 American lives over the next eight years.

And in the end, the United States discovered that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction anymore.

I also covered Operation Infinite Reach, when the Clinton administration ordered cruise missile strikes on terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan in 1998. It was a response to twin bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Twelve Americans had been among the 224 killed.

But a year later, I was in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden’s camps were still thriving. The U.S. strikes had made him even more popular and powerful on the terrorist circuit. And he skillfully adapted Al Qaeda’s tactics. In 2000, a suicide dinghy struck the U.S. destroyer Cole docked in Yemen, killing 17 sailors. And then the 9/11 suicide planes, the most successful attack against the United States since Pearl Harbor. Bin Laden may be dead, but the franchises born of his movement are thriving from North Africa to the Persian Gulf.

So the idea of quick hits or short campaigns is often an illusion. The one notable success was the 2011 air campaign that helped oust Kadafi. But it had the full endorsement of the Arab League, the United Nations and , NATO, which ran the international mission. Thousands of Libyans actually did the fighting, while the Transitional National Council provided a viable alternative government from inside the country. And still Operation Unified Protector lasted 222 days.

In the case of Syria, a few days of strikes against military targets may assuage moral outrage over its heinous use of chemical weapons. But they also carry the danger of widening the war by legitimizing or deepening involvement by other foreign powers, notably Iranian and Russian support for Damascus.

I lived in Beirut during Israel’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon to evict the Palestine Liberation Organization. It achieved the immediate goal, yet Operation Peace for Galilee also backfired: Iran deployed Revolutionary Guards to Lebanon and created Hezbollah, which ultimately drove out both Israeli troops and American peacekeepers. It was Israel’s first retreat — made voluntarily due to inexorable costs — in the long Arab-Israeli dispute.

So, as the U.S. and its allies take on Syria, they need to ensure that the costs do not ultimately outweigh the benefits, and that another military mission doesn’t backfire.

Pollak'],This Iran Deal's Getting Worse All the Time,"The Obama administration has been forced to admit that the nuclear deal to which Iran agreed last weekend in Geneva, Switzlerland has not actually been finalized. In the interim, Iran is continuing its enrichment of uranium, as well as continuing construction on the Arak nuclear plant it is meant to suspend. And the White House is being criticized for misleading the public about the terms of the Iran deal, which keep getting worse.

The Washington Post noted, in an editorial otherwise supportive of the deal, that the Obama administration had not told the whole truth: “What the White House didn’t report is that the text of the accord makes several major concessions to Tehran on the terms of a planned second-stage agreement…the United States and its partners have already agreed that Iranian enrichment activity will continue indefinitely. In contrast, a long-standing U.S. demand that an underground enrichment facility be closed is not mentioned.”

Iran clearly expects that the deal will eventually lead to the end of all sanctions against the regime for its repeated violations of UN Security Council resolutions that ban any nuclear enrichment, and that it will see its so-called “right” to enrich uranium recognized either explicitly or de facto, without restrictions–and not in 15-20 years, as the administration has implied, but in a mere five years from the signing of the deal.

No one is quite sure when the deal begins, and when the six-month window contemplated under the terms will be over. So Iran continues to play for time, and the Obama administration, having accepted Iran’s nuclear enrichment in principle, is forced to accept interpretations of the deal that favor Iran, having lost the leverage sanctions once provided. As the line from The Empire Strikes Back goes: this deal’s getting worse all the time."

White House is considering canceling a planned meeting in Moscow

Granting of temporary asylum latest in a string of slights

MOSCOW — Russia's granting of temporary asylum for NSA leaker Edward Snowden is the latest in a string of slights against President Obama by Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose actions have brought U.S.-Russian relations to their lowest point in decades, experts say.

""His presence here creates additional problems in Russia-U.S. relations,"" said Alexander Konovalov, president of the Moscow-based Institute of Strategic Studies and Analysis.

""As long as Snowden is here, we won't be able to achieve agreement on any bilateral issues,"" Konovalov said.

The Snowden affair has become so toxic that the White House is considering canceling a planned meeting between Putin and President Obama in September.

""It's pretty bad,"" says Ariel Cohen, a Russia expert at the Heritage Foundation. ""U.S.-Russia relations are at their nadir, rock bottom since the end of the Cold War.""

Despite demands in the U.S. Congress for actions against Russia, the Kremlin portrayed Snowden's stay as a small affair.

""This issue is not important enough to affect political relations,"" RIA Novosti quoted Putin's aide, Yury Ushakov, as saying Thursday.

Russia's hospitality to a man wanted by the United States on charges of espionage is only one of several instances in which Russia has emerged as an adversary, frustrating U.S. aims globally.

Since Obama has been president, Russia has used its veto power in the U.N. Security Council to frustrate U.S.-backed measures against Iran's nuclear program. Putin has also supplied weapons to Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, a dictator whom Obama has said he wants removed from power.

And for more than a year Putin has been executing a campaign to repress and jail political opponents who have appealed to the West for help.

All this comes after Obama's vow early in office to hit a ""reset"" button in U.S.-Russian relations by listening more to Russian concerns. Obama suspended longtime efforts to deploy a defensive missile shield in Eastern Europe at Russia's request, and then backed its permanent membership in the World Trade Organization.

Obama also acquiesced to Putin's position of nuclear arms reductions, and famously told former prime minister Dmitri Medvedev in 2012 that he would have ""more flexibility"" on U.S-Russia issues if elected to a second term.

Putin's foreign relations appear focused on his oft-stated goal of returning his nation to the superpower status it held before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.

Putin says he is arming Assad because he is concerned a Sunni Islamist victory there will spill over into Russia's Caucasus region, where Russia has fought a decades-long war against an Islamist insurgency, Cohen said.

He opposed the Western-backed military alliance that helped to topple dictator Moammar Gadhafi, claiming the onetime Soviet client state of Libya should not be meddled with.

In other differences with the United States, he accuses the U.S. of fomenting rebellion in his country when it stands up for the democratic rights of his political opponents. Russia under Putin has banned U.S. organizations that promote political participation and free speech overseas.

Russian ""policy is to blame the United States for everything that is going on in the world and in Russia and attempt to consolidate popular support of the regime by manufacturing an external threat,"" Cohen said. ""Communist Russia used to do the same thing.""

The freeze has enormous consequences in the Middle East. Islamist terror movements have yet to be defeated there and revolutionary forces threaten to turn out U.S. allies in Jordan, Bahrain and Yemen.

Russia can be a force for cooperation or agitation, Russia analysts say.

""The question is what kind of relationship can we have with the Putin government the way it's behaving (now),"" says Andrew Weiss, a Russia expert in the Clinton White House who's now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""The answer is not much.""

The last time Putin and Obama met, at the G-8 summit in Northern Ireland, they disagreed over Syria and both appeared unhappy in each other's presence. Other high-level meetings between U.S. and Russian diplomats and ministers in Moscow and Washington have pushed the two sides even further apart, Weiss says.

Relations between the two countries were worse during the 2008 Russian invasion of the Republic of Georgia, which caused a breakdown of senior-level contacts between U.S. and Russian leaders, prompting Obama to seek to ""reset"" the relationship, Weiss says. But lately, ""the Russians are stonewalling (U.S. efforts) every step of the way.""

The White House has signaled that it may skip a planned two-day visit to Moscow before the planned St. Petersburg G-20 summit of the world's wealthiest nations in September.

""Putin has never been responsive to efforts to get him engaged in U.S.-Russian relations, going back to January 2009,"" Weiss says. ""His current motivation for wanting to host Obama is to show the Russian people that he's one of the big boys, that Obama is just one more of a parade of international visitors seeking an audience with him, and that no one questions his legitimacy.""

Rather than ""chase after Putin"" and hope the Russians have a change of heart, Weiss says it would be better to cool it with the Russians and ""have a period of disengagement for the next few months.""

John Bolton, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush, says Russian anti-American policies show the failure of Obama's ""appeasement policy"" toward Russia.

As long as U.S. policy is conciliatory toward Russia, the more concessions Russian leaders will push to deny the U.S. national missile defense capability, to expand Russian influence in nations of the former Soviet Union and to counter U.S. intent in the Middle East and Iran, Bolton says.

""They're advancing their interests at our expense,"" Bolton says. ""We're pressing the reset button and they're pressing us.""

Konovalov says that Snowden is a liability to Russia and that Putin will likely use his influence to have him taken by one of the Latin American countries, such as Venezuela or Ecuador, that have said they may be willing to take him in.

""Political asylum, with a chance for citizenship, that's a bad scenario,"" he said.

Russian rights activists said Snowden may regret his decision to remain in Russia.

""I can say that I certainly have sympathy for him because he has performed a deed for the sake of the freedom of information,"" Lyudmila Alexeyeva, head of the Moscow Helsinki Group, said. ""But because of this deed, he got out of the United States into Russia, where freedom of information is being infringed upon to an immeasurably greater extent than in America.""

The new steps came a day after the administration issued sanctions against a top aide of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and more than 50 other Iranian officials for what it called their efforts to repress dissent and free speech in Iran, where presidential elections are scheduled in two weeks.

Under the increasingly strict sanctions on Iran, the United States freezes any American assets of blacklisted companies and individuals and bans them from doing business with any American companies or citizens. In addition, companies and individuals in other countries who help Iran evade sanctions can be cut off from the American financial system and face other restrictions.

“We are committed to intensifying the pressure against Iran, not only by adopting new sanctions, but also by actively enforcing our sanctions and preventing sanctions evasion,” David S. Cohen, the Treasury Department under secretary whose office oversees the sanctions effort, said in a statement. “Today’s actions take aim at revenues from Iran’s petrochemical sector, as well as deceptive schemes Iran has employed in an effort to evade sanctions on its oil sales and its airlines.”"

The Obama administration has said Iran is probably a year away from having enough enriched uranium to make a bomb

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has said his country has no interest in nuclear weapons

U.N. inspectors have found evidence of a weapons program

Iran could produce enough weapons-grade uranium to build a nuclear bomb in as little as a month, according to a new estimate by one of the USA's top nuclear experts.

The new assessment comes as the White House invited Senate staffers to a briefing on negotiations with Iran as it is trying to persuade Congress not to go ahead with a bill to stiffen sanctions against Iran.

""Shortening breakout times have implications for any negotiation with Iran,"" stated the report by the Institute for Science and International Security. ""An essential finding is that they are currently too short and shortening further.""

David Albright, president of the institute and a former inspector for the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency, said the estimate means that Iran would have to eliminate more than half of its 19,000 centrifuges to extend the time it would take to build a bomb to six months.

The Obama administration has said Iran is probably a year away from having enough enriched uranium to make a bomb.

Bernadette Meehan, an NSC spokeswoman for President Obama's National Security Council, said the intelligence community maintains ""a number of assessments"" regarding potential time frames for Iran to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for one weapon or a testable nuclear device.hi

""We continue to closely monitor the Iranian nuclear program and its stockpile of enriched uranium,"" Meehan said.

World powers are seeking an agreement ""that ultimately resolves all of the international community's concerns about Iran's nuclear program,"" she said. ""The ultimate goal is a comprehensive agreement that is credible, transparent, and verifiable.""

In the report, Albright said negotiations with Iran should focus on so-called ""breakout"" times, or the time required to convert low-enriched uranium to weapons-grade.

Albright, who has testified before Congress, said the negotiators should try to find ways to lengthen the breakout times and shorten the time that inspectors could detect breakout. ISIS' analysis is based on the latest Iranian and United Nations reports on Iran's centrifuge equipment for producing nuclear fuel and its nuclear fuel stockpiles.

Iran's stockpile of medium-enriched uranium has nearly doubled in a year's time and its number of centrifuges has expanded from 12,000 in 2012 to 19,000 today.

Sen. Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican whose Senate Banking Committee is considering legislation to tighten Iran sanctions, said the report shows that Iran is expanding its nuclear capabilities under the cover of negotiations.

""The Senate should move forward immediately with a new round of sanctions to prevent Iran from acquiring an undetectable breakout capability,"" he said.

The White House has said new sanctions legislation should wait while current negotiations — scheduled to resume officially in Geneva next month — are moving forward.

The White House said Thursday it will continue consulting with Congress ""so that any congressional action is aligned with our negotiating strategy as we move forward,"" said Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for President Obama's National Security Council.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has said his country has no interest in nuclear weapons but that producing nuclear fuel is Iran's right. His foreign minister, Javad Zarif, has said Iran will not ship its nuclear stockpile to a third country.

However, Iran has blocked international inspectors from some suspected nuclear facilities to verify they are being used for peaceful purposes, access required under international agreements it has signed.

United Nations inspectors have found evidence of a weapons program in violation of Iran's commitment under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The USA and the U.N. Security Council have implemented crippling economic sanctions on Iran to sway it to take steps to assure the world it is not developing a bomb.

Israel, which sees an Iranian nuclear bomb as a threat to its very existence, has said it will take military action to prevent Iran from getting a bomb.

ISIS estimated in October 2012 that Iran could produce enough highly-enriched uranium for a bomb within two to four months. The new estimate is based on an analysis of the latest reports by Iran and the the IAEA.

ISIS considered various scenarios, including if Iran decided to build a covert enrichment plant like it has under a mountain in Fordow, near the city of Qom, that was designed for optimal efficiency and minimal time to enrich enough uranium for bomb making. Such a facility built with current Iranian technology could produce enough material for a bomb in a week, according to the ISIS report.

""If they did that and they were caught it would be a smoking gun of a nuclear weapons program,"" Albright said.

If Iran moves ahead with installation of its more efficient, second generation centrifuges, it would be able to produce enough nuclear fuel for a bomb with so few of them, between 2,000 and 3,300 centrifuges, that they could fit in a small warehouse, Albright said."

Washington (CNN) - As President Barack Obama weighs launching a military strike against Syria for its alleged use of chemical weapons, American public opinion over whether the U.S. should get involved appears conflicted.

The most recent national polling over the past few months suggests that most Americans, weary after more than a decade of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, don't favor getting its military involved in the bloody fighting in Syria. But some surveys also indicate that the public feels that Washington would be justified in using military action against Damascus if there was proof the Syrian regime used chemical weapons against their own people.



Sixty-one percent of those questioned in a Quinnipiac survey conducted in late June and early July said that it was not in the national interest for the U.S. to be involved in the war in Syria. And nearly six in 10 said they opposed the U.S. sending military arms or supplies to the rebel forces fighting the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Those findings were consistent with earlier surveys from Gallup, Pew Research Center, and CBS News/New York Times that were conducted in June.

""In past foreign crises, polls have shown that support for U.S. action changes depending on three things: whether ground troops might become involved, whether the U.S. is acting alone or as part of an international coalition, and whether there is a specific reason to use U.S. force. The reason may be forward-looking or in retaliation for something that already happened, but the public doesn't like writing blank checks,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.

But factor in chemical weapons, and public opinion shifts.

In May, a CNN/ORC Poll asked, ""If the United States were able to present evidence that convinced you that the Syrian government has chemical weapons and has used them to kill civilians in that country, do you think the U.S. would or would not be justified in using military action against the Syrian government?""

Two thirds of those questioned answered yes, with three in 10 saying no.

An ABC News/Washington Post poll from last December had similar results, with more than six in 10 supporting military action Syria if it used chemical weapons against its people.

The United States has concluded Syria carried out chemical weapons attacks against its people, Obama said Wednesday, a claim that comes amid a looming diplomatic showdown over whether to strike against al-Assad's government.

""We do not believe that, given the delivery systems, using rockets, that the opposition could have carried out these attacks. We have concluded that the Syrian government in fact carried these out,"" Obama told ""PBS NewsHour.""

""If, in fact, we can take limited, tailored approaches, not getting drawn into a long conflict, not a repetition of, you know, Iraq, which I know a lot of people are worried about – but if we are saying in a clear and decisive but very limited way, we send a shot across the bow saying, stop doing this, that can have a positive impact on our national security over the long term,"" the president added.

One limited military option is cruise missile attacks against Syrian government and military targets.

According to the Quinnipiac poll, Americans by a 49%-38% plurality said the U.S. should use weapons that don't risk the lives of American forces, such as cruise missiles or drones, to attack Syrian government targets.

""After the Vietnam war, Americans were much less likely to support the use of U.S. force, a phenomenon often referred to as the Vietnam syndrome,"" Holland added. ""Will Americans suffer from an Iraq syndrome in future conflicts? We may get an answer to that question in the next few weeks."""

But after weeks of internal debate across the Obama administration over how to respond to the ongoing struggle between the president and the generals, Mrs. Clinton touched on it only lightly, saying she looked forward to working “to support the military’s return to a purely national security role.”

State Department officials said the meeting itself sent a historic message. Seated in an ornate room in the presidential palace, Mrs. Clinton smiled for cameras and traded pleasantries with President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist jailed more than once by the American-backed autocracy overthrown 18 months ago. She became the highest ranking United States official to meet Mr. Morsi since he was sworn in two weeks ago as Egypt’s first democratically elected president.

But her outreach to the new president appeared constrained by evident reluctance to address his struggle to pry power from the generals. Her muted tone, State Department officials said, reflected a growing sense that American attempts to intercede may be futile in a contest where the outcome remains uncertain, all the players are deeply suspicious of American motives, and almost any statement could elicit a popular backlash.

Instead of calling for an immediate handover of power as American officials have in the past, Mrs. Clinton instead emphasized only the need for “building consensus across the Egyptian political spectrum.” In brief remarks after the meeting with Mr. Morsi, her sole reference to the military decrees dissolving the Islamist-led Parliament and eviscerating his powers was a call for “consensus” among all sides in order “to work on a new constitution and Parliament, to protect civil society, to draft a new constitution that will be respected by all, and to assert the full authority of the presidency.”

A senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in a briefing to reporters, said Mrs. Clinton planned to deliver virtually the same message in a private meeting with Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, Egypt’s top military commander, as she did in public remarks on Saturday."

Although there is no evidence that al-Qaeda has forced a drone crash or interfered with flight operations, U.S. intelligence officials have closely tracked the group’s persistent efforts to develop a counterdrone strategy since 2010, the documents show.

Al-Qaeda commanders are hoping a technological breakthrough can curb the U.S. drone campaign, which has killed an estimated 3,000 people over the past decade. The airstrikes have forced ­al-Qaeda operatives and other militants to take extreme measures to limit their movements in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia and other places. But the drone attacks have also taken a heavy toll on civilians, generating a bitter popular backlash against U.S. policies toward those countries.

Details of al-Qaeda’s attempts to fight back against the drone campaign are contained in a classified intelligence report provided to The Washington Post by Edward Snowden, the fugitive former National Security Agency contractor. The top-secret report, titled “Threats to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,” is a summary of dozens of intelligence assessments posted by U.S. spy agencies since 2006.

U.S. intelligence analysts noted in their assessments that information about drone operational systems is available in the public realm. But The Post is withholding some detailed portions of the classified material that could shed light on specific weaknesses of certain aircraft.

Under President Obama and his predecessor, George W. Bush, drones have revolutionized warfare and become a pillar of the U.S. government’s counterterrorism strategy, enabling the CIA and the military to track down enemies in some of the remotest parts of the planet. Drone strikes have left al-Qaeda’s core leadership in Pakistan scrambling to survive.

U.S. spy agencies have concluded that al-Qaeda faces “substantial” challenges in devising an effective way to attack drones, according to the top-secret report disclosed by Snowden. Still, U.S. officials and aviation experts acknowledge that unmanned aircraft have a weak spot: the satellite links and remote controls that enable pilots to fly them from thousands of miles away.

In July 2010, a U.S. spy agency intercepted electronic communications indicating that senior al-Qaeda leaders had distributed a “strategy guide” to operatives around the world advising them how “to anticipate and defeat” unmanned aircraft. The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) reported that al-Qaeda was sponsoring simultaneous research projects to develop jammers to interfere with GPS signals and infrared tags that drone operators rely on to pinpoint missile targets.

Other projects in the works included the development of observation balloons and small radio-controlled aircraft, or hobby planes, which insurgents apparently saw as having potential for monitoring the flight patterns of U.S. drones, according to the report.

Al-Qaeda cell leaders in the tribal areas of northwestern Pakistan were “determining the practical application of technologies being developed for battlefield applications,” analysts from the DIA wrote. The analysts added that they believed al-Qaeda “cell leadership is tracking the progress of each project and can redirect components from one project to another.”

The technological vulnerabilities of drones are no secret. The U.S. Air Force Scientific Advisory Board issued an unclassified report two years ago warning that “increasingly capable adversaries” in countries such as Afghanistan could threaten drone operations by inventing inexpensive countermeasures.

The board said insurgents might try to use “lasers and dazzlers” to render a drone ineffective by blinding its cameras and sensors. It also predicted that insurgents might use rudimentary acoustic receivers to detect drones and “simple jammer techniques” to interfere with navigation and communications.

Researchers have since proved that the threat is not just theoretical. Last year, a research team from the University of Texas at Austin demonstrated to the Department of Homeland Security that it was possible to commandeer a small civilian drone by “spoofing” its GPS signal with a ground transmitter and charting a different navigational course.

Trained engineers

Al-Qaeda has a long history of attracting trained engineers and others with a scientific background. Khalid Sheik Mohammed, the self-proclaimed architect of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, holds a mechanical-engineering degree and is such an inveterate tinkerer that the CIA allowed him to fiddle around with new designs for a vacuum cleaner after he was captured a decade ago.

In 2010, the CIA noted in a secret report that al-Qaeda was placing special emphasis on the recruitment of technicians and that “the skills most in demand” included expertise in drones and missile technology. In July of that year, Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, an al-Qaeda operations chief, told a jihadist Web site that the network did not need “ordinary fighters” and that it was looking instead for “specialist staff” to join the organization.

That same year, authorities in Turkey said they arrested an al-Qaeda member who was developing plans to shoot down small NATO surveillance drones in Afghanistan. The suspect, a 23-year-old mathematics student, was using software to conduct ballistics research for drone attacks, according to Turkish officials.

Al-Qaeda leaders have become increasingly open about their ­anti-drone efforts. In March, a new English-language online jihadist magazine called Azan published a story titled “The Drone Chain.” The article derided drone armaments as “evil missiles designed by the devils of the world” but reassured readers that jihadists had been working on “various technologies” to hack, manipulate and destroy unmanned aircraft.

At the same time, the magazine indicated that those efforts needed a boost, and it issued an emergency plea for scientific help: “Any opinions, thoughts, ideas and practical implementations to defeat this drone technology must be communicated to us as early as possible because these would aid greatly . . . against the crusader- zionist enemy.”

In the absence of a high-tech silver bullet, al-Qaeda affiliates around the world have taken to sharing hard-earned lessons about the importance of basic defensive measures.

Islamist extremists in North Africa this year distributed a photocopied tipsheet with 22 recommendations for avoiding drone strikes. Among the suggestions are several ideas for camouflage as well as dubious advice on using radio or microwave transmitters to “confuse the frequencies used to control the drone.”

The Associated Press in February found a copy of the tipsheet in Mali, left behind by Islamist fighters fleeing the city of Timbuktu. It was written by a jihadist in Yemen two years earlier and has circulated among al-Qaeda franchises since then.

‘GPS jamming capability’

In January 2011, U.S. intelligence agencies detected an unusual electronic signal emanating from near Miran Shah, a jihadist haven in North Waziristan, Pakistan. The DIA called the signal “the first observed test of a new terrorist GPS jamming capability.”

The test apparently did not pose a threat to military GPS frequencies or encrypted communications links. In addition, whoever was beaming the mysterious signal mistakenly thought that jamming ground-based GPS receivers would interfere with drones’ ability to aim missiles or munitions at fixed targets, according to the DIA report.

Despite such missteps, ­al-Qaeda has been undeterred. In a separate 2011 report, the DIA stated that affiliates in Miran Shah and the Pakistani city of Karachi were pursuing other “R&D projects,” including one effort to shoot down drones with portable shoulder-fired missiles, known as manpads.

Army intelligence analysts uncovered similar projects, including attempts to develop laser detectors that could give warning whenever a U.S. Predator drone was about to fire a laser-guided Hellfire missile, according to a summary of a classified Army report.

In 2011, the DIA concluded that an “al-Qaeda-affiliated research and development cell currently lacks the technical knowledge to successfully integrate and deploy a counterdrone strike system.” DIA analysts added, however, that if al-Qaeda engineers were to “overcome these substantial design challenges, we believe such a system probably would be highly disruptive for U.S. operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan.”

The Air Force and CIA rely heavily on Predator and Reaper drones to hunt for al-Qaeda targets and other insurgents in several countries. Both aircraft can stay aloft for more than 20 hours to conduct surveillance missions and can be armed with Hellfire missiles.

The drones are flown by remote control via satellite data links, usually by pilots and sensor operators stationed thousands of miles away at bases in the United States. Those satellite links are encrypted, which makes the connections extremely difficult to hack.

It is only slightly less of a challenge for al-Qaeda fighters to spot a high-flying drone with the naked eye. Predators and Reapers loiter at altitudes above 20,000 feet, and their powerful cameras focus on objects several miles over the horizon, so their presence is hard to detect.

The satellite links, however, are the Achilles’ heel of drone operations. “Lost link” incidents — triggered when a satellite moves out of range or a drone drops a signal — are relatively common. The connections are usually reestablished within seconds or minutes. The aircraft are programmed to fly in a loop pattern or return to their launching spot during prolonged disruptions.

On several occasions, however, lost links have led to crashes. In September, an Air Force Predator slammed into mountainous terrain along the Iraq-Turkey border after the satellite data links were lost and the drone crew could no longer communicate with the aircraft.

In December 2011, a stealth U.S. spy drone operated by the CIA crashed in Iranian territory. Iran said it downed the advanced RQ-170 drone in an “electronic ambush.” U.S. officials said they did not believe that the drone had been hacked or jammed. They said a technical malfunction was probably to blame.

Although the navigational satellite links are encrypted, other drone transmissions are sometimes left unprotected.

In 2009, the U.S. military discovered that Iraqi insurgents had hacked into video feeds from Predator and Shadow drones using off-the-shelf software. The drones had been transmitting full-motion video to U.S. troops on the ground, but the Air Force had not encrypted those data links, leaving them vulnerable.

Air Force officials acknowledged the flaw and said they would work to encrypt all video feeds from its fleet of Predator drones by 2014. In their classified assessments, U.S. intelligence agencies sought to play down the insurgents’ hacking handiwork. Although analysts were concerned about the interceptions of the video feeds, they said there was no sign that insurgents had been able to seize control of the drone itself.

“While the ability of insurgent forces to view unencrypted or to break into encrypted data streams has been a concern for some time, indications to date are that insurgents have not been able to wrest [drone] control from its mission control ground station,” a 2010 report concluded.

The report went on to suggest that allowing insurgents to intercept video feeds might actually have “a deterrent effect” by demonstrating the extent to which U.S. forces were able to watch their movements.

Growing unease

Still, summaries of the classified reports indicate a growing unease among U.S. agencies about al-Qaeda’s determination to find a way to neutralize drones.

“Al-Qaida Engineers in Pakistan Continue Development of Laser-Warning Systems in Effort To Counter UAV Strikes,” read the headline of one report in 2011, using the military acronym for unmanned aerial vehicles.

Beyond the threat that ­al-Qaeda might figure out how to hack or shoot down a drone, however, U.S. spy agencies worried that their drone campaign was becoming increasingly vulnerable to public opposition.

Intelligence analysts took careful note of al-Qaeda’s efforts to portray drone strikes as cowardly or immoral, beginning in January 2011 with a report titled “Al-Qa’ida Explores Manipulating Public Opinion to Curb CT Pressure.”

Analysts also questioned whether they were losing the rhetorical battle in the media, the courts and even among “citizens with legitimate social agendas.” One 2010 report predicted that drone operations “could be brought under increased scrutiny, perceived to be illegitimate, openly resisted or undermined.”

In response, intelligence agencies floated their own ideas to influence public perceptions. One unclassified report said the phrase “drone strike” should never be uttered, calling it “a loaded term.”

“Drones connote mindless automatons with no capability for independent thought or action,” the report said. “Strikes connote a first attack, which leaves the victim unable to respond. Other phrases employed to evoke an emotional response include ‘Kill List,’ ‘Hit Squads,’ ‘Robot Warfare,’ or ‘Aerial Assassins.’ ”

Instead, the report advised referring to “lethal UAV operations.” It also suggested “elevating the conversation” to more-abstract issues, such as the “Inherent Right of Self-Defense” and “Pre-emptive and Preventive Military Action.”

(CNN) —

President Barack Obama said Wednesday that the world set a red line against chemical weapons use that he now seeks to apply to Syria, while a Senate committee approved a resolution authorizing the U.S. military attack that he is planning.

By a 10-7 vote, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed the resolution that authorizes a limited military response, giving Obama an initial victory in his push to win congressional approval.

The measure now goes to the full Senate for debate next week. The Democratic-led chamber is expected to pass it, but the outcome is less clear in the Republican-led House where top diplomatic and military officials made their case on Wednesday for action.

Liberal Democrats, tea party libertarians and moderates from both sides questioned Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey about whether limited military attacks can change anything and if they will lead to U.S. involvement in another war.

“What are the chances of escalation? Are different scenarios accounted for? If our credibility is on the line now as is argued what about if Assad retaliates?” asked GOP Rep. Ed Royce of California, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

In Sweden on the first of a three-day overseas trip that includes the G-20 summit in Russia, Obama told reporters that the red line he spoke of last year regarding Syria’s use of chemical weapons came from international treaties and past congressional action, rather than something he “made up.”

Obama also insisted he had the authority to order attacks – expected to be cruise missile strikes on Syrian military command targets – even if Congress rejects his request for authorization.

America “recognizes that if the international community fails to maintain certain norms, standards, laws, governing how countries interact and how people are treated, that over time this world becomes less safe,” Obama said. “It becomes more dangerous not only for those people who are subjected to these horrible crimes, but to all of humanity.”

He cited World War II as an example, saying “the people of Europe are certainly familiar with what happens when the international community finds excuses not to act.” At the same time, “as commander in chief, I always preserve the right and the responsibility to act on behalf of America’s national security,” Obama said.

Conservative critics have said Obama painted himself into a corner with his statement last year that Syria’s use of chemical weapons was a red line that would change his approach to its civil war.

Obama: It is the world’s red line

“A red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized,” Obama said in August 2012. “That would change my calculus.”

Now, critics on the right say, he must respond to an alleged chemical weapons attack outside Damascus by the Syrian regime that Kerry said killed more than 1,400 people or lose credibility.

The administration and top congressional leaders attempted to blunt that criticism on Tuesday during debate on Capitol Hill. Even House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, the chamber’s No. 2 Republican, said any president would have drawn that red line based on international norms.

Obama made that same argument on Wednesday, saying: “I didn’t set a red line. The world set a red line.”

“The world set a red line when governments representing 98 percent of the world’s population said the use of chemical weapons are abhorrent and passed a treaty forbidding their use, even when countries are engaged in war,” he said at a joint news conference with Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt on the first day of a four-day trip that includes the G-20 summit in Russia.

“Congress set a red line when it ratified that treaty,” Obama continued. “Congress set a red line when it indicated that in a piece of legislation entitled the ‘Syria Accountability Act’ that some of the horrendous things that are happening on the ground there need to be answered for.”

Sounding exasperated, Obama added: “That wasn’t something I just kind of made up. I didn’t pluck it out of thin air. There’s a reason for it.”

Obama prods international community to act

Asked about whether he was seeking to save face, Obama insisted that “my credibility is not on the line – the international community’s credibility is on the line.”

He framed the question for the United Nations and the global community at large as: “Are we going to try to find a reason not to act? And if that’s the case, then I think the (world) community should admit it.”

Opposition by Russia, a Syrian ally, has scuttled U.S. and British efforts to get the U.N. Security Council to authorize a military response against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.

U.N. inspectors returned from Syria last week from their mission to confirm if chemical weapons were used, but Kerry said Wednesday it would take three weeks for samples collected to analyzed and results announced.

“I respect the U.N. process,” Obama said while standing next to Reinfeldt, who opposes military intervention without U.N. approval.

“We agree that the international community cannot be silent,” Obama added, saying also that the U.N. investigators had done “heroic work.”

Noting the U.N. team’s mandate was only to determine the use of chemical weapons, and not identify who used them, Obama repeated past statements that U.S. intelligence has confirmed chemical weapons use beyond any reasonable doubt and has further confirmed that al-Assad’s regime “was the source.”

“I do think that we have to act, because if we don’t, we are effectively saying that even though we may condemn it and issue resolutions and so forth and so on, somebody who is not shamed by resolutions can continue to act with impunity,” Obama said.

International norms then “begin to erode,” he added, and “other despots and authoritarian regimes can start looking and say, ‘that’s something we can get away with.’”

He described the intended U.S. response as “limited in time and in scope, targeted at the specific task of degrading (al-Assad’s) capabilities, and deterring the use of those weapons, again.”

More than 100,000 killed in Syrian conflict

The United Nations has said more than 100,000 people – including many civilians – have been killed since the popular uprising spiraled into a civil war in 2011.

In Washington, the resolution passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee set a 60-day deadline for use of force in Syria, with an option for an additional 30 days.

An amendment accepted by the panel from Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Christopher Coons of Delaware added language to say the military response was intended to reverse Assad’s battlefield momentum, a stronger objective than degrading the Syrian regime’s chemical weapons capabilities as Hagel told the committee on Tuesday.

If Assad “remains in an advantageous position, he will never leave Syria,” said McCain, who has been pushing for a more robust U.S. response. “He has to know that he is losing and that way you get a negotiated settlement for his departure.”

The resolution also makes clear there would be no U.S. boots on the ground as part of a response in Syria.

A White House statement welcomed the panel’s vote, saying “the military action authorized in the resolution would uphold America’s national security interests by degrading Assad’s chemical weapons capability and deterring the future use of these weapons, even as we pursue a broader strategy of strengthening the opposition to hasten a political transition in Syria.”

After the vote, senators on the panel made statements that explained their thinking, with some calling for more efforts to build an international coalition before any attack takes place.

“Vietnam started with U.S. advisers and a limited Naval presence. It led to an all-out war,” noted Democratic Sen. Tom Udall of New Mexico, who opposed the resolution.

Kerry, Hagel and Dempsey appeared before the Senate panel on Tuesday to press for approval of authorization.

Tough questioning by House panel

The same trio then faced questions on Wednesday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, with Royce saying the administration’s Syria policy had been adrift for two years.

At the same time, Royce acknowledged there were “no easy answers” on Syria, and attempting to deter chemical weapons use was worth considering despite public skepticism for U.S. military involvement.

Kerry said Obama sought authorization for a response to the use of banned weapons, not a full military intervention.

“We are not asking America to go to war,” he said. “We all agree, there will be no American boots on the ground.”

In response to a question, Hagel put the cost of the limited response under consideration at “tens of millions” of dollars.

Most of the focus of administration lobbying has been on the House, where opposition by liberal Democrats and libertarian conservatives, as well as the bitterly partisan political environment of the Republican-led chamber, make passage of Obama’s authorization proposal uncertain.

House Speaker John Boehner and Cantor, the No. 2 Republican, both have endorsed a U.S. military response, but Wednesday’s hearing showed widespread concerns and outside opposition from across the political spectrum.

Polls also show that a majority of Americans oppose a U.S. military strike on Syria.

In the Senate, a Democratic source familiar with Majority Leader Harry Reid’s thinking told CNN that Reid is confident any authorization measure will pass his chamber. The source said it is likely 60 votes will be needed to overcome a filibuster, and Reid thinks the votes are there.

Before that, however, lawmakers will hear from the Russian government, which is moving ahead with its efforts to lobby Congress in an attempt to undercut Obama on Syria. Moscow has sent an official request to congressional leaders to meet with them.

“We’re planning the visit,” a Russian Embassy spokesman told CNN, “We can’t tell you the exact time but it will be next week.”

Boehner will not meet with the Russians, his spokesman said.

It's possible. At next month's NATO summit here, Afghan President Hamid Karzai and global leaders will discuss an exit strategy for foreign troops fighting the Taliban, a task no doubt complicated by the news last week that U.S. soldiers posed for photos with dead insurgents. The war, which began after the Sept. 11 attacks, will soon become the longest in U.S. history. Here are 10 facts onAfghanistan's war:

1 The U.S. has authorized $557 billion to fund the war in Afghanistan — enough for every man, woman and child in Chicago to buy 20 iPads, 30 Kindle Fires, Bulls season tickets, a campaign fundraiser photo with Michelle Obama and dinner at Alinea every night for a year.

2 CIA operatives have occasionally offered Viagra to elderly tribal chieftains to secure their cooperation.

3 Very little is known about the elusive Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar — except that he has one eye. According to Abdul Salam Zaeef, a former high-ranking member of the Taliban, Omar lost his eye fighting the Soviets in vicious, hand-to-hand street fighting in the 1980s. Zaeef wrote that the next day, Omar had to be persuaded to get treatment rather than continue the fight.

4 The story of Pat Tillman, who quit a $3.6 million NFL contract to join the U.S. Army, was often obscured after his death in Afghanistan. The military covered up the fact that he died from friendly fire, and speakers at his memorial service invoked the deity even though Tillman was either an agnostic or atheist and had requested no chaplain at his funeral. Also little publicized after his death was the fact that he was opposed to the war in Iraq. Writing about Iraq in his diary, he declared that ""we have little or no justification other than our imperial whim.""

5 More than four dozen countries have committed troops to the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. But while the United States has deployed 90,000 service personnel in ISAF, others are less invested: Austria has kicked in 3 troops, compared withIceland's4,Ireland's7,Luxembourg's11 andEl Salvador's24.

6 Afghanistan lost two popular leaders at a crucial time. Two days before the Sept. 11 attacks, anti-Taliban guerrilla leader Ahmad Shah Massoud was killed by assassins posing as journalists. Sept. 9 is a now Massoud Day, a national holiday in Afghanistan. Seven weeks after Massoud's death, another admired leader, Abdul Haq, was captured and executed by the Taliban after riding into the country on horseback to lead a popular revolt without U.S. support.

7 A ""jingle truck"" or a ""jingly"" is a vehicle used by Afghans to deliver goods to Western troops. Often brightly painted, they have trinkets or tassels hung from the truck frame so that they jingle. Some troops also use the term ""jinglies"" to refer to the Afghans themselves.

8 John Walker Lindh, the ""American Taliban"" captured in Afghanistan, is imprisoned near Terre Haute, Ind., in the same federal correctional complex where terrorist Timothy McVeigh was executed and where former Illinois Gov. George Ryan is held. (The ex-governor is in a low-security camp separate from Lindh's facility.)

9 The Javelin missile is so expensive ($75,000, by one account) that British soldiers in Afghanistan refer to firing a Javelin as ""throwing a Porsche at them.""

10 Afghan President Hamid Karzai's signature headwear, the karakul hat, has been praised as stylish and denounced as a product of animal cruelty. The karakul is made from the pelt of a newborn lamb or — in the case of the more expensive ones — a lamb fetus that is removed when a pregnant ewe is cut open.

Updated 10:25 a.m. ET, 11/24/14

(CNN) – Secretary of State John Kerry insisted Sunday that the interim agreement to halt Iran’s nuclear program makes Israel safer - though Israel says the agreement has exactly the opposite effect.

“We believe very strongly that because the Iranian nuclear program is actually set backwards and is actually locked into place in critical places, that that is better for Israel than if you were just continuing to go down the road and they rush towards a nuclear weapon,” Kerry said in an interview that aired Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” - just hours after world powers and Iran reached the historic agreement.

Nuclear deal with Iran breaks 3-decade gridlock

Kerry cautioned that strong verification tactics will be needed in order to hold Iran accountable to the deal.

“When you're dealing with nuclear weapons, it's not an issue of trust,” Kerry said. “Verification is the key.”

20 questions about the Iran nuclear deal: What it says, what's at stake, what's next

The initial six-month deal slows Iran’s nuclear development program in exchange for lifting some sanctions, while a more formal agreement is worked out.

More specifically, Iran will be required to dilute its stockpile of uranium that had been enriched to 20%. Its stockpiles should be diluted below 5%, the level needed for nuclear power plants. Iran will also have to cut back on constructing new centrifuges and enrichment facilities, and freeze essential work on its heavy-water reactor under development at Arak.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters that the agreement is far from acceptable, citing the easing of sanctions as major point of contention.

""What was concluded in Geneva last night is not a historic agreement, it's a historic mistake,"" Netanyahu said. ""It's not made the world a safer place. Like the agreement with North Korea in 2005, this agreement has made the world a much more dangerous place.""

Israeli PM Netanyahu: Iran nuclear deal 'historic mistake'

But Kerry argued the sanctions part of the agreement is hardly a boost for Iran. The deal says that the U.S. will provide $6 billion to $7 billion in sanction relief — just a drop in the bucket compared to the roughly $100 billion in foreign exchange holdings that are inaccessible to Iran because of sanctions, the White House says.

“The basic architecture of the sanctions is staying in place. There is very little relief. We are convinced over the next few months, we will really be able to put to the test what Iran's intentions are,” Kerry told CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley.

White House issues synopsis on Iran nuclear deal

In a separate interview with ABC's ""This Week,"" Kerry acknowledged that the agreement doesn't dismantle Iran's nuclear program. But he said that strategy is ""the next step"" in negotiations. He also hit back against criticism that the agreement failed to completely tear down Iran's nuclear program.

""While we go through these next six months, we will be negotiating the dismantling,"" he said. ""But you can't always start where you want to wind up.""

""You cannot sit there and pretend that you're just going to get the thing you want, while they (Iran) continue to move towards the program that they've been chasing,"" he said.

Asked whether the agreement signals a new relationship between the U.S. and Iran, Kerry said it marks a step forward, but Iran still has a long way to go.

""We have no illusions. This is not going to change in one fell swoop overnight. We have a long building process to engage in here. We need to put to test Iran's words and intentions without any cobwebs, without any false assumptions, without any illusions. This is a hard road,"" he said. And, he added, ""We will stand by Israel 100%.""

Several Republican lawmakers in Congress have already come out against the agreement, siding with Israel. But Kerry said on ABC he feels confident ""Congress will recognize that this deal actually has a great deal of benefit in it.""

""And of course, (Obama) always has every other option available to him as commander in chief,"" Kerry said, answering a question about whether the President would veto a congressional vote for new sanctions or whether he would bypass Congress altogether.

A group called the Katibat Moulathamine, or the Masked Brigade, called a Mauritanian news outlet to say one of its subsidiaries had carried out the operation on the Ain Amenas gas field, taking 41 hostages from nine or 10 different nationalities. They claim they are holding seven Americans.

The group's claim could not be independently substantiated and typically there would be fewer than 20 foreign staff members on site on a typical day, along with hundreds of Algerian employees.

The group said the attack was in revenge for Algeria's support of France's operation against Al Qaeda-linked Malian rebels groups far to the southeast.

The caller to the Nouakchott Information Agency, which often carries announcements from extremist groups, did not give any further details, except to say that the kidnapping was carried out by ""Those Who Signed in Blood,"" a group created to attack the countries participating in the ongoing offensive in Mali. The group is demanding an end to the offensive, Reuters reports, citing Mauritanian media.

Algeria's Interior Minister, Daho Ould Kablia said on television that ""Algeria will not respond to terrorist demands and rejects all negotiations."" He denied that the militants were from Mali or Libya, possibly suggesting they were from Algeria itself.

In a statement BP said the site was ""attacked and occupied by a group of unidentified armed people,"" and some of its personnel are believed to be ""held by the occupiers.""

The number and identities of the hostages was still unclear, but Ireland announced that a 36-year-old married Irish man was among them, while Japan and Britain said their citizens were involved as well. A Norwegian woman said her husband called her saying he had been taken hostage.

Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stotlenberg said in a news conference that 13 of the hostages are Norwegian employees of the energy firm Statoil, Reuters reported.

""We've asked the Algerian authorities to put the life and health of the hostages above all,"" Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said.

In addition to two foreigners being killed -- one of them a Briton -- six others were wounded in the attack, including two foreigners, two police officers and two security agents, Algeria's state news agency reported.

The Masked Brigade was formed by Al Qaeda's longtime strongman in the Sahara region, Moktar Belmoktar, a one-eyed Algerian who recently declared he was leaving the terror network's Algerian branch, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb for his own group.

He said at the time he would still maintain ties with the central organization based out of Afghanistan and Pakistan.

In Mali, French President Francois Hollande launched the surprise operation in its former West African colony on Friday, with hopes of stopping Al Qaeda-linked and other Islamist extremists he believes pose a danger to the world.

Wednesday's attack began with the ambush of a bus carrying employees from the gas plant to the nearby airport but the attackers were driven off, according to the Algerian government, which said three vehicles of heavily armed men were involved.

""After their failed attempt, the terrorist group headed to the complex's living quarters and took a number of workers with foreign nationalities hostage,"" said the statement, adding that authorities were following the situation very closely.

Attacks on oil-rich Algeria's hydrocarbon facilities are very rare, despite decades of fighting an Islamist insurgency, mostly in the north of the country.

In the last several years, however, Al Qaeda's influence in the poorly patrolled desert wastes of southern Algeria and northern Mali and Niger has grown and it operates smuggling and kidnapping networks throughout the area. Militant groups that seized control of northern Mali already hold seven French hostages as well as four Algerian diplomats.

The natural gas field where the attack occurred, however, is more than 600 miles from the Mali border, though it is just 60 miles from Libya's deserts.

BP, together with Norwegian company Statoil and the Algerian state oil company, Sonatrach, operate the gas field. A Japanese company, JGC Corp, provides services for the facility as well.

Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the kidnapped foreigners possibly include Japanese employees of JGC.

""We are certain that JGC is the one affected,"" Suga said, adding that the government is now negotiating with local officials through diplomatic channels, asking for safety first to protect the lives of the Japanese nationals.

Japan's Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida told Algerian counterpart, Mourad Medelci, during telephone talks late Wednesday that he was gravely concerned about the development, and called the abductions ""unacceptable.""

""I asked (Algeria) to place top priority on the lives of the Japanese and others who have been captured,"" he said.

Statoil said that it has 20 employees in the facility. The Norwegian Foreign Ministry said it could not confirm that any Norwegian citizens had been abducted. The Norwegian Newspaper Bergens Tidende, however, said a 55-year-old Norwegian working on the site called his wife to say he had been abducted.

Algeria had long warned against military intervention against the rebels in northern Mali, fearing the violence could spill over its own long and porous border. Though its position softened slightly after Hollande visited Algiers in December, Algerian authorities remain skeptical about the operation and worried about its consequences on the region.

Algeria is Africa's biggest country, and has been an ally of the U.S. and France in fighting terrorism for years. But its relationship with France has been fraught with lingering resentment over colonialism and the bloody war for independence that left Algeria a free country 50 years ago.

Algeria's strong security forces have struggled for years against Islamist extremists, and have in recent years managed to nearly snuff out violence by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb around its home base in northern Algeria. In the meantime, AQIM moved its focus southward.

AQIM has made tens of millions of dollars off kidnapping in the region, abducting Algerian businessmen or political figures for ransom and sometimes foreigners.

Although U.S. experts believe that North Korea cannot hit the U.S. mainland with its missiles, a significant improvement in Pyongyang’s weapons technology would be deeply disconcerting for U.S. policymakers. It would also help explain American measures -- including an emphasis on the U.S. ability to respond with nuclear weapons -- after weeks of warlike rhetoric from Pyongyang.

Regional intelligence officials and analysts say North Korea is poised to launch as many as five missiles from its east coast, but that they did not appear to be in preparation for war. They said the launches were likely to only be part of a military exercise and would not pose a threat to the United States or its allies, Japan and South Korea.

Analysts said the exercise would probably be part of festivities planned to mark the birthday Monday of the country’s late founder, Kim Il Sung, grandfather of the current leader.

Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.) read from what he said was an unclassified portion of a classified Defense Intelligence Agency study. “DIA assesses with moderate confidence the North currently has nuclear weapons capable of delivery by ballistic missiles. However, the reliability will be low,” it says.

Lamborn said the DIA study was completed last month, but that the conclusion had not been made public.

Pentagon spokesman George Little said he could not address the details of a classified report. However, he added, “It would be inaccurate to suggest that the North Korean regime has fully tested, developed, or demonstrated the kinds of nuclear capabilities referenced in the passage.”

James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, said in a statement that the DIA view is not a formal assessment shared by all U.S. intelligence agencies.

The DIA tends to be more aggressive in its intelligence assessments than the CIA, according to Bruce Klingner, a former CIA analyst on North Korea. He said the DIA has hinted in the past that Pyongyang could mount warheads on its missiles.

The Pentagon announced last month that it plans to augment missile defense systems in Alaska in response to the North Korean threat. The Defense Department also said it will deploy another antimissile system to Guam, which is within range of North Korean missiles.

The Pentagon also sent two long-range B-2 bombers from their base in Missouri last month on a round-trip flight to South Korea as part of a military exercise.

North Korea claimed after its most recent nuclear test in February that its objective was to develop a smaller and lighter warhead with “diverse materials.”

Analysts said the statement indicated that Pyongyang was stepping up its development of a miniaturized warhead that could fit atop one of its long-range missiles, and that the device used enriched uranium as a trigger, rather than the plutonium previously used.

North Korea’s official news agency said the nuclear test was successful. Seismic monitoring systems measured a resulting earthquake of magnitude 5.1, slightly higher than in past tests. But U.S. officials said yield estimates were uncertain.

At a Pentagon news conference last month to announce expansion of the U.S. missile defense systems, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel did not answer directly when he was asked when North Korea would have intercontinental ballistic missiles armed with nuclear warheads. He said the U.S. goal was to stay ahead of the development of North Korea’s weapons.

David Albright, a nuclear weapons expert with the Institute for Science and International Security, said in February that he believed North Korea has had the capability to mount a plutonium-based warhead on its shorter-range Rodong missiles “for some time,” and was making progress on developing a warhead for an intercontinental ballistic missile.

He said that the U.S. intelligence community has not “been of one opinion” on North Korea’s ability to produce miniaturized warheads. “Key members” of the intelligence community have credited Pyongyang with the ability to produce smaller warheads “for many years,” he said but that conclusion was based on assessment and “not concrete evidence.”

At a different congressional hearing Thursday, Clapper sought to downplay the recent tensions with North Korea. He said tensions were worse in previous episodes in his career, but he underscored how uncertain the intelligence is about North Korea’s new leader, Kim Jong Un.

“We don’t have good detail on the inner sanctum,” he said. “There’s no telling how he’s going to behave. He impresses me as impetuous, [and] not as inhibited as his father became about taking aggressive action.”

Xu Guangyu, a senior military analyst in Beijing, said there was no threat from the missiles likely to be launched in coming days by North Korea. “The grandson is using the missiles to salute his grandfather and celebrate his power,” Xu said.

Nevertheless, Japan and South Korea said they will use Patriot antimissile systems to shoot down any North Korean projectiles that threaten their territory.

Among the missiles that might be launched is a new, as-yet-untested Musudan with an estimated range of up to 2,400 miles, enough to reach the Pacific island of Guam.

South Korean intelligence sources were quoted Thursday as saying satellites had detected two of the missiles and launchers being moved in and out of a shed near the coastal city of Wonsan.

“There are signs the North could fire off Musudan missiles any time soon,” an unidentified intelligence source in Seoul told the state-run Yonhap news agency.

The South Korean officials also predicted possible launches of short-range Scud missiles and medium-range Rodong missiles.

Trying to defuse the tension, the South Korean government suggested negotiations over a jointly run industrial park in Kaesong, just north of the demilitarized zone. North Korea pulled out its 53,000 workers this week, threatening a project that had been one of the crowning achievements of inter-Korean cooperation.

Officials in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, have been issuing daily predictions about the imminent outbreak of war.

On Thursday, the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland said that Pyongyang had “powerful striking means” on standby for a launch that would “turn the stronghold of the enemies into a sea of fire.”

But tourists, who flew out Thursday after a two-week trip, said they saw no signs of war preparations or anxiety among the North Korean population.

“Soldiers are working in the fields, planting trees, or just hanging around,” said Kees Wielinga, a Dutch businessman who had returned through Beijing. “There were no civil defense preparations, no mobilization at all.”

Military analysts said the planned launches did not appear to be in preparation for war.

“I worry as much about North Korea unleashing a full-scale war as I do about an asteroid hitting my house,” said Daniel Pinkston, a Seoul-based analyst for the International Crisis Group, a think tank.

“We expect these missiles will fall in the ocean and give the intel people a chance to study their weapons systems.”

Shin In-kyun, who heads an alliance of defense experts based in Seoul, added that North Korea’s leader wants to show his people that he is taking a “bold stance” against the United States and Japan.

In London, meanwhile, foreign ministers from eight of the world’s leading economies denounced North Korea’s bellicose rhetoric “in the strongest possible terms” and warned that they would step up sanctions if the isolated nation conducts another missile launch or nuclear test.

She Writes About News', 'Politics', 'Culture. Her Columns Appear On Wednesday', 'Sunday. Twitter']","Edward Snowden desperately seeking asylum: <i>Habla espa&ntilde;ol</i>, Edward?","I used to be intrigued by Edward Snowden, the NSA leaker who did the country a favor by revealing proof of the government’s intrusive domestic spying program.

Now, I am starting to feel a little sorry for the guy, a fugitive who has become a kind of worldwide reject, as his quest for political asylum has begun to look like the geopolitical equivalent of “Let’s Make a Deal.” He’s asked 21 countries so far to accept him. So far, no one has said “Come on down!”

In a statement posted on the WikiLeaks site this week, Snowden angrily denounced the U.S. for annulling his passport. “The Obama administration has now adopted the strategy of using citizenship as a weapon,” he wrote. “Although I am convicted of nothing, it has unilaterally revoked my passport, leaving me a stateless person. Without any judicial order, the administration now seeks to stop me exercising a basic right. A right that belongs to everybody. The right to seek asylum.”

That accusation seems specious to me, actually. An invalid passport is not a revocation of citizenship, nor has it stopped him from seeking asylum. He is more than welcome to return to his motherland, and the U.S. has offered safe passage all the way home.

Advertisement

But Snowden has suggested that he will not return to the U.S. unless the Justice Department agrees to let him to remain free before trial, citing the disturbing treatment of Bradley Manning, the soldier who was kept in solitary confinement for months awaiting his trial, which began last month, for disseminating classified information to WikiLeaks. A U.N. investigation found the conditions under which Manning was kept “cruel, inhuman and degrading.”

A little over a week ago, in a fascinating conference call with reporters on June 24, Snowden’s spirit guide Julian Assange, the prickly WikiLeaks founder who is holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in London, refused to divulge Snowden’s location. “He is in a safe place and his spirits are high,” Assange said.

But that was then.

One week later, Russian President Vladimir Putin made it clear that Snowden would be welcome in Russia only if he “stopped his work aimed at bringing harm” to the United States. A day later, the Kremlin announced that Snowden had withdrawn his asylum request.

On the same day, The Times reported that Snowden, who is presumed to be staying in a transit zone in Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport, had met with Russian diplomatic officials and handed them appeals for asylum in 15 countries. A Russian Foreign Ministry official told my colleague Sergei Loiko that it was “a desperate measure.”

The WikiLeaks website has reported that Snowden, in fact, has asked more than 20 countries to consider giving him political asylum.

Ecuador may have rolled up the welcome mat, but the presidents of Venezuela and Bolivia, who were in Russia this week meeting with leaders of other gas-exporting countries, seemed to offer Snowden some hope.

Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro told Russian news agencies that Snowden deserved protection, and Bolivia’s Evo Morales said his country would consider granting asylum.

“The world cannot be governed by the imperialist elite of the United States,” Maduro told reporters.

But Snowden, in his first long interviews with Glenn Greenwald, one of the reporters who broke the original story for The Guardian, said he felt certain that if the U.S. wanted to bring him home, the country would find a way to do so.

This week in Senegal, President Obama, who has done a magnificent job talking from both sides of his mouth on this issue – declaring his support of a frank public discussion on the issues raised by Snowden’s disclosures while doing his best to keep the massive and potentially unconstitutional privacy invasions secret – pooh-poohed that idea.

“I’m not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker,” he told reporters. He also said he would not “start doing wheeling and dealing and trading on a whole host of other issues simply to get a guy extradited.”

Advertisement

But, he said, “My continued expectation is that Russia or other countries that have talked about potentially providing Mr. Snowden asylum recognize that they are part of an international community, and that they should be abiding by international law. And we’ll continue to press them as hard as we can to make sure that they do so.”

I’m just guessing here, but I think Snowden should start brushing up on his Spanish.

(CNN) —

The United States and other countries are “getting close” to an interim deal with Iran that would prevent its nuclear program “from advancing, and roll it back” in key areas, a senior administration official said Friday.

Such a deal would “extend the breakout time” that Iran would need to achieve a nuclear weapon and “shorten the time to notice if they tried,” the official told reporters on the condition of not being identified.

The proposed deal – covering every aspect of Iran’s nuclear program, including uranium enrichment, uranium stockpiles and all nuclear facilities including military ones – would be completed during the next round of talks in Geneva, Switzerland, though difficult issues remain, the official said.

“We are going to work very hard next week, the official said. “I don’t know if we’ll reach an agreement. I think it is quite possible that we can. But there’s still tough issues to negotiate.”

The United States, along with the four other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany – the so-called P5+1 – came close to a deal during talks with Iran last week in Geneva, but the discussions ended with both sides blaming each other for the lack of an agreement.

The P5+1 is “completely and totally unified” on the current outlines of the proposed deal, the official said.

The official warned against the imposition of further sanctions, which members of Congress have suggested.

“Further sanctions now threaten our good faith not just for Iran but for our P5+1 partners,” the official said.

Under the plan, sanctions relief “way south” of one proposed figure of $10 billion would be “metered out over the six months of an interim agreement to ensure compliance.”

Israel and the United States “may not see eye to eye on this tactically but are absolutely in agreement that Iran will not have a nuclear weapon,” the official said.

News of the development came a day after President Barack Obama said additional sanctions targeting Iran’s disputed nuclear program could undermine international progress already made on the issue.

“If we’re serious about pursuing diplomacy, then there’s no need for us to add new sanctions on top of the sanctions that are already very effective, and that brought them to the table in the first place,” Obama told reporters Thursday at the White House.

He said he would like to see if a “short-term, phase-one deal” with Iran can be put in place in the near term that requires Tehran to freeze aspects of its nuclear program while the international community negotiates a more comprehensive long-term deal.

U.S. renews ‘79 state of emergency with Iran

His remarks came amid a growing call in Congress for tighter sanctions to get Iran to agree to a deal that would stop what U.S. officials have said is its march toward a nuclear weapon.

“If it turns out six months from now that they’re not serious” about the agreement, “we can dial those sanctions right back up,” Obama said, noting that the economic penalties have hurt Iran’s economy.

Obama’s comments came the same day the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, released a report saying Iran had halted the expansion of a majority of its uranium enrichment capacity.

Russia’s foreign minister said Saturday that a deal with Iran on its nuclear program is close, warning the opportunity to bring about an end to a decade-long standoff must not be passed up.

USA TODAY

Obama to hold first bilateral meeting with China%27s Xi Jingping

Obama hasn%27t yet addressed the disclosures of data-mining programs

National Intelligence director calls media reports on NSA programs %22reprehensible%22 and inaccurate

LOS ANGELES — Fresh disclosures that the U.S. government has been secretly collecting data on Americans' phone calls and Internet activity are threatening to overshadow President Obama's weekend summit with China's President Xi Jinping.

The summit, a two-day meeting at the Sunnylands estate in Southern California, was billed by the White House as an opportunity for Obama to build rapport with Xi and raise questions about Chinese cyberhacking, currency manipulation and other thorny issues in the U.S.-China relationship.

While the U.S.-China relationship remains as complicated as ever, the Obama administration has been cautiously optimistic about the ascension of Xi, who they believe is more open to building a substantive dialogue with the U.S. than any of his recent predecessors.

But now Obama's conversations with Xi are in danger of becoming a side note to the revelations that the National Security Agency was collecting mountains of data on Americans' communications with people in the U.S. and overseas.

Obama addressed the disclosures of the programs for the first time during an appearance in San Jose Friday and argued that the programs help prevent terrorist attacks.

""It's important to recognize that you can't have 100% security and also then have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience,"" Obama said.

He also denounced the leak of the programs to the media. ""If every step that we're taking to try to prevent a terrorist act is on the front page of the newspapers or on television, then presumably the people who are trying to do us harm are going to be able to get around our preventive measures,"" he said.

The president's scheduled to take questions again from reporters Friday evening at the conclusion of his first bilateral meeting with Xi, and it seems almost certain that he'll be pressed on the issue again.

The first in two bombshell revelations came late Wednesday, when Britain's The Guardian newspaper first reported that the NSA was able to get Verizon Communications to turn over information on all domestic and international calls for three months. The data collected by the NSA included the phone numbers, the length of the calls and other identifying information, but not the content of the conversations.

On Thursday, The Washington Post and The Guardian were reported that the NSA and FBI have for six years received information from the central servers of nine leading U.S. Internet companies, including Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook and YouTube. That program, code-named PRISM, lets the government track people's movements and contacts through audio, video, photographs, e-mail, documents and connection logs.

The administration's initial response to the reports about the PRISM program was outrage.

James Clapper, director of National Intelligence, acknowledged existence of the program Thursday night but blasted the reports as ""reprehensible"" and inaccurate.

Clapper said the program does not allow the targeting of U.S. citizens or any person in the U.S. He also ordered information about the program declassified so that the public can understand what information is being collected.

""I believe it is important for the American people to understand the limits of this targeted counterterrorism program and the principles that govern its use,'' he said.

It is too early to predict the extent of the fallout from the revelations of the two surveillance programs for Obama.

But the controversy comes at an undoubtedly inopportune time for the White House, which has been basking in the afterglow of getting the Chinese to agree to such an informal meeting for Xi's first visit to the U.S.

The controversy also creates a potentially awkward moment for Obama, when talking to Xi about the China's heavy-handed treatment—including closely monitoring internet of activity—of its people.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest on Friday dismissed the notion that the existence of the programs will undercut Obama's message to Xi.

""This is a pretty good illustration of type of conversation we want to have about respecting civil liberties and protecting the constitutional rights of the people that you govern,"" Earnest said. ""What the president did, was he put in place a very strict oversight regime, one that he strengthened when he took office…one that constrained his own ability, constrained his own authority. I think that is a testament to the strength of our system of government.""

Regardless, Obama will be forced to juggle making what he hopes is a historic breakthrough in the U.S.-China relationship and dealing with the fallout of what could be one of the most controversial moments of his presidency."

Chivers', 'Eric Schmitt']","Taking Outsize Role in Syria, Qatar Funnels Arms to Rebels","The Obama administration quietly blessed the shipments to Libya of machine guns, automatic rifles, mortars and ammunition, but American officials later grew concerned as evidence grew that Qatar was giving the weapons to Islamic militants there.

American and Arab officials have expressed worry about something similar happening in Syria, where Islamists in the north have turned into the most capable section of the opposition, in part because of the weapons from Qatar. Saudi Arabia recently has tried to wrest control from Qatar and take a greater role in managing the weapons shipments to Syrian rebels, but officials and outside experts said the Qatari shipments continue. The greatest worry is over the shoulder-fired missiles — called man-portable air-defense systems — that Qatar has sent to Syria since the beginning of the year. Videos posted online show rebels in Syria with the weapons, including the Chinese FN-6 models provided by Qatar, and occasionally using them in battle.

The first videos surfaced in February and showed rebels wielding the Chinese missiles, which had not been seen in the conflict previously and were not known to be in Syrian government possession. .

Western officials and rebels alike say these missiles were provided by Qatar, which bought them from an unknown seller and brought them to Turkey. The shipment was at least the second antiaircraft transfer under the Qataris’ hand, they said. A previous shipment of Eastern bloc missiles had come from former Qaddafi stockpiles.

The shipments were small, the Western officials and rebels said, amounting to no more than a few dozen missiles. And rebels said the Chinese shipments have been plagued with technical problems, and sometimes fail to fire. The first FN-6s were seen in the custody of groups under the Free Syrian Army banner, suggesting that they were being distributed, at least initially, to fighters backed by the United States and not directly to extremists or groups with ties to Al Qaeda.

American and Arab officials said that Qatar’s strategy was a mixture of ideology — the ruling family’s belief in a prominent role for Islam in political life — and more hard-nosed calculations.

“They like to back winners,” one Middle Eastern official said.

In meetings with Mr. Obama, the leaders of Jordan and the United Arab Emirates have expressed a host of grievances about the Qatari shipments and have complained that Qatar is pursuing a reckless strategy."

Snowden, the fugitive American security contractor granted temporary asylum by Russia, has appealed to Washington to stop treating him like a traitor for revealing that the United States has been eavesdropping on its allies, a German politician who met with Mr. Snowden said on Friday.

Mr. Snowden made his appeal in a letter that was carried to Berlin by Hans-Christian Ströbele, a veteran member of the Green Party in the German Parliament. Mr. Ströbele said he and two journalists for German news outlets met with Mr. Snowden and a person described as his assistant — probably his British aide, Sarah Harrison — at an undisclosed location in or near Moscow on Thursday for almost three hours.

Mr. Ströbele had gone to Moscow to explore whether Mr. Snowden could or would testify before a planned parliamentary inquiry into the eavesdropping. Any arrangements for Mr. Snowden to testify would require significant legal maneuvering, as it seemed unlikely that he would travel to Germany for fear of extradition to the United States.

In his letter, Mr. Snowden, 30, also appealed for clemency. He said his disclosures about American intelligence activity at home and abroad, which he called “systematic violations of law by my government that created a moral duty to act,” have had positive effects."

Obama says no decision yet on retaliation%2C but limited response is under consideration

Public release of intelligence report meant to bolster case for possible military action

Administration careful to show difference from Iraq war

WASHINGTON--President Obama said Friday that the U.S. has determined with high confidence the Syrian government used chemical weapons against its own people, as the White House released a four-page report summarizing their case against the Bashar Assad regime.

""This kind of attack is a challenge to the world,"" Obama said. ""We cannot accept a world where women and children and innocent civilians are gassed on a terrible scale.""

Obama repeated on Friday that he has still not made a final determination on whether the U.S. will carry out a punitive military strike against Syria, but a senior defense official told USA TODAY that military leaders are preparing for an imminent strike.

The U.S. military is ready to execute a strike immediately on the president's order, said the official.

In a brief appearance before reporters, Obama emphasized that he is only considering a ""limited, narrow act"" against Syria.

""We're not considering any open ended commitment,"" Obama said. ""We're not considering any boots on the ground approach.""

In laying out their intelligence report publicly, the Obama administration hoped prove that they have a preponderance evidence that would justify a potential military strike on Syria. Obama tapped Secretary of State John Kerry to detail the intelligence community's findings and announce the release of the report before he made his own comments.

""I'm not asking you to take my word for it,"" Kerry told reporters at the State Department. ""Read for yourselves the verdict reached by our intelligence community"" that the government of Syria was responsible for the attack.

The intelligence community believes with ""high confidence"" that the Assad government used chemical weapons in the Damascus suburbs based on human sources as well as intercepts of conversations by senior Syrian officials, according to the report and Kerry. Assad is the ultimate decision maker for the chemical weapons program, the report asserts, but stops short of concluding that Assad ordered the attack.

""We know that for three days before the attack, the Syrian regime's chemical weapons personnel were on the ground in the area, making preparations,"" said Kerry, referring to intercepts of conversations of Syrian officials. ""And we know that the Syrian regime elements were told to prepare for the attack by putting on gas masks and taking precautions associated with chemical weapons.""

Kerry added, ""We know that a senior regime official who knew about the attack confirmed that chemical weapons were used by the regime, reviewed the impact, and actually was afraid that they would be discovered.""

The Syrian regime has the types of munitions that were used to carry out the attack on Aug. 21, that left more than 1,400 dead, including 429 children, according to the report. The regime also has the ability to strike simultaneously in multiple locations.

The U.S. intelligence community has discounted the possibility that Syrian rebel groups could have been behind the attack, noting that it doesn't have the rocket and artillery capability that was used in the most recent attack.

""We assess that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons over the last year primarily to gain the upper hand or break a stalemate in areas where it has struggled to seize and hold strategically valuable territory,"" the report said. ""In this regard, we continue to judge that the Syrian regime views chemical weapons as one of many tools in its arsenal, including air power and ballistic missiles, which they indiscriminately use against the opposition.""

With the release of the intelligence report and a telephone briefing for lawmakers on Thursday evening, the White House looked to bolster the case for taking action against Assad even as objections to a strike continue to mount in the U.S. and with the nation's closest ally, Britain, against taking military action.

Obama was also given a bolt of international backing on Friday, when President François Hollande of France announced his support for international military action against the Syrian government.

On Thursday, the British parliament voted to reject taking military action in Syria, even as the government published an intelligence document that detailed how it concluded the Syrian government was responsible for the chemical attacks on the outskirts of Damascus last week.

Skepticism about a potential strike among the American public and lawmakers also remains an issue that Obama has yet to overcome. Nearly 80% of Americans say Obama should seek congressional approval before taking any military action in Syria, according to an NBC News poll published Friday.

Kerry also acknowledged the specter of the long U.S. war in Iraq weighs heavy in the minds of the Obama administration and the public.

As a candidate for the White House in 2008, Obama ran as an anti-war candidate. Kerry also was highly critical of President George W. Bush in his unsuccessful 2004 run for the White House.

""The American people are tired of war,"" Kerry said. ""But fatigue does not absolve us of our responsibility."" He said that ""history would judge us all extraordinarily harshly"" if the United States does not respond to the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government.""

The president had long expressed skepticism about the merits of American involvement in the Syrian civil war that has left more than 100,000 dead. But Obama stated publicly just over a year ago that movement or deployment of chemical weapons was a ""red line"" that must not be crossed.

The White House had determined earlier this summer that Assad's regime had previously used chemical weapons against rebels and civilians on a small scale, but had resisted taking action or offering any significant new military aid to the rebel groups.

But after last week's suspected chemical attack in a rebel-controlled suburb of Damascus, Obama has appeared to inch toward a stronger response."

UNITED NATIONS, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff on Tuesday criticized the United States for spying, using the opening speech at the U.N. General Assembly to announce Brazil would adopt legislation and technology to protect it from illegal interception of communications.

Rousseff last week called off a high-profile state visit to the United States scheduled for October over reports that the U.S. National Security Agency had been spying on Brazil and Rousseff's email.

After opening with diplomatic pleasantries and a condemnation of the shopping mall attack in Kenya, Rousseff launched into a blistering attack on U.S. spying, calling espionage among friendly nations ""totally unacceptable.""

""Meddling in such a manner in the lives and affairs of other countries is a breach of international law and, as such, it is an affront to the principles that should otherwise govern relations among countries, especially among friendly nations,"" Rousseff told the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations.

U.S. President Barack Obama was en route to the United Nations while Rousseff spoke. He then followed Rousseff on the podium as the first and second national leaders to address the General Assembly.

Postponing the state visit, which as to have included a dinner at the White House, was a rare and diplomatically severe snub by Brazil. No new date has been set.

The report by Brazil Globo's news program Fantastico on National Security Agency spying was based on documents that journalist Glenn Greenwald obtained from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Greenwald, who lives in Rio de Janeiro, was one of the journalists to first report Snowden's leaks of classified information on previously secret U.S. telephone and internet surveillance efforts.

Rousseff's state visit was conceived to highlight cooperation between the two biggest economies in the Americas and Brazil's emergence over the past decade as a regional power.

Brinley Bruton', 'Nbc News']",Venezuela: Snowden has until Monday to respond to asylum offer,"Venezuelan officials say they have not heard from Edward Snowden since the country offered the professed NSA leaker asylum, but would wait until Monday to hear if he would take up the offer.

“There has not been any type of communication,'' Foreign Minster Elias Jaua said on state television late on Saturday. “We are waiting until Monday to know whether he confirms his wish to take asylum in Venezuela.”

News of the apparent deadline followed the announcement by the president of Bolivia that it was joining Venezuela and Nicaragua in indicating that they would offer asylum to fugitive, who is believed to be hiding inside the transit zone of Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport as the United States continues efforts to have him extradited.

Bolivia’s Evo Morales made his offer Saturday, three days after a plane carrying the leftist leader over Europe was rerouted amid reports that Snowden was aboard. The change in flight plan set off a diplomatic storm that heightened tensions between the United States and the South American nation.

President Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela both condemned the U.S. spy programs that Snowden revealed and said he deserved protection.

“Who is the guilty one? A young man ... who denounces war plans, or the U.S. government which launches bombs and arms the terrorist Syrian opposition against the people and legitimate President Bashar al-Assad?'' Maduro asked, to applause and cheers from military officers at a parade on Saturday.

Venezuela ""decided to offer humanitarian asylum to the young American Edward Snowden"" so he can live without ""persecution from the empire,"" Maduro said, referring to the U.S. He extended the invitation to Snowden during a speech Friday commemorating the anniversary of Venezuela's independence, according to the Associated Press.

Since winning a presidential vote in April that followed leader Hugo Chavez's death from cancer, Maduro has often criticized the United States, and accused it of plotting to kill him.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers told CNN on Sunday that he “absolutely” thinks one of the South American countries will provide Snowden with travel documents.

Rogers (R-MI) said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that the U.S. should “send a very clear message” to the nations offering Snowden asylum “that we won’t put up with this kind of behavior.”

Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey told CNN on Sunday that Snowden’s revelations have hurt U.S. diplomatic relationships and “the importance of trust.”

Bolivian President Evo Morales%27 plane was rerouted to Austria

France%2C Portugal and Spain refused to let it cross their airspace

Morales is now on his way back to Bolivia after Snowden was not found

Bolivia has called a decision by European authorities to force a jet carrying President Evo Morales to land in Austria and undergo a search for former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden an ""act of aggression.""

The plane carrying Morales departed Europe for Bolivia on Wednesday after being diverted to Vienna over suspicions it was carrying NSA leaker Snowden, but Austria's deputy chancellor confirmed Wednesday that Snowden was not on the plane.

Morales had been flying back to Bolivia from Moscow, where he was attending a summit on gas. Snowden is thought to be at Moscow's international airport.

Bolivia said it would file a complaint to the United Nations over a blockade by France, Spain and Italy that saw them deny airspace to the presidential jet, Bolivia's ambassador to the United Nations said Wednesday.

Sacha Llorentty Soliz told reporters he had no doubt that the orders to divert Morales' plane came from the United States, and said the search was a ""violation of international law"" as well as an aggressive act.

In a midnight press conference in La Paz, Bolivian Vice President Alvaro Garcia described Morales as being ""kidnapped by imperialism"" in Europe.

There was no immediate U.S. or European response.

Bolivia said Spain agreed to allow the plane to refuel in the Canary Islands on its way back home Wednesday — but only if Bolivian authorities agreed to allow it to be inspected.

EU Transport spokeswoman Helen Kearns said it is up to national governments to allow or refuse planes entry into their airspace. She said it's unclear what happened with the Bolivian plane and whether or not it was refused access and why.

Earlier, Russian news agencies quoted Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Snowden, unhappy with the conditions Russia has set, had taken back his application for asylum there.

Of the list of 21 countries where Snowden has applied for asylum, at least 10 have either turned him down flatly or said his request was invalid because he was not physically on their territory. The rest are pending.

Separately, the French government wants major trade negotiations between the U.S. and the European Union suspended for two weeks amid anger over alleged U.S. eavesdropping on European allies.

The 2009 document, a memorandum of understanding between the NSA and its Israeli counterpart, says the U.S. government regularly hands over intercepted communications that have not first been reviewed by U.S. analysts and therefore may contain phone calls and emails of American citizens.

The agreement allows for the possibility that intercepts given to Israel might include the communications of U.S. government officials, in which case Israel is supposed to destroy them immediately. Other data on U.S. citizens who aren’t in the government, however, can be kept by Israel for up to a year, according to the document, first published Wednesday by Britain’s Guardian newspaper.

NSA officials declined to answer questions but issued a statement saying, “Whenever we share intelligence information, we comply with all applicable rules, including the rules to protect U.S. person information.”

It’s no secret that the U.S. and Israel cooperate closely against intelligence targets of mutual interest, such as Syria and Iran. But providing Israel unfiltered electronic intelligence feeds raises questions about why American officials would trust Israel to respect the privacy of U.S. citizens.

The practice also raises the specter of Israel using U.S. intelligence to carry out operations of which the U.S. disapproves. The Obama administration has condemned, for example, the assassinations of several Iranian nuclear scientists that many analysts believe Israel had a hand in.

“One of the biggest concerns in all intelligence-sharing relationships is that the partner would use the data to take action that would result in killing somebody or doing something outside the scope of what our government might consider appropriate,” said a former senior NSA official, who, like others interviewed, asked not to be named in discussing classified information. “The worry is they might go off and bomb somebody and assassinate somebody.”

A second former senior U.S. intelligence official said the sort of intercepts shared with Israel would focus on communications in the Middle East and would not include many Americans. But almost any eavesdropping anywhere in the world tends to capture at least some American communication, the former official said. The former officials requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of discussing intelligence.

The implications are unsettling, said Jameel Jaffer, deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union. “You can imagine a scenario in which somebody tries to get on a plane and is told by some foreign airline, ‘We have you on a list,’” or you try to get a visa and you’re told, ‘Unfortunately we can’t give you one,’” he said.

The agreement requires Israel to consult an NSA liaison officer when it comes across data on Americans, and to adhere to U.S. rules for handling U.S. citizen information that are designed to protect privacy, a process known as “minimization.” That would include, for example, blacking out the names of any Americans in intelligence reports derived from the intercepts. But it’s unclear how that requirement is monitored or enforced because the agreement expressly states that it is not legally binding.

The sharing of raw intercepts with Israel is particularly notable because U.S. officials say Israel aggressively seeks to spy on the U.S. government, unlike Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, allies who are part of a long-standing agreement to share signals intelligence with the United States.

Jonathan Pollard, a former U.S. naval intelligence analyst, is serving a life sentence in prison after being caught spying for Israel in the 1980s. Secret U.S. intelligence budget documents revealed last month by Snowden list Israel as one of the most aggressive countries seeking to spy on the U.S., alongside China, Russia, Iran and Cuba.

The Guardian quoted from other NSA documents it did not publish in which U.S. officials expressed concern about the intelligence-sharing arrangement, citing their worry about trusting Israel.

“One of NSA’s biggest threats is actually from friendly intelligence services, like Israel,” an unnamed NSA official is quoted as writing in one document. “There are parameters on what NSA shares with them, but the exchange is so robust, we sometimes share more than we intended.”

Advertisement

The reason that risks are taken with Israel, the second former official said, is because Israel and the U.S. have many mutual foreign policy interests, and Israel in some cases has greater expertise in Middle Eastern languages and cultures.

“Managing the intel-sharing relationship is always kind of a quid pro quo,” the official said. “One country may have access to certain communications that we can’t otherwise get, so there are decisions made at fairly high levels whether or not it’s worth it to share.”

Israeli Prime MInister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to end Iran%27s ability to make a nuclear bomb

Friction between U.S. and Israel is high

Economic sanctions are also at issue

JERUSALEM — The United States vowed Monday it would not cave to Iran in negotiations over the Islamic republic's nuclear program despite charges from Israel and France that negotiators were proposing to let Iran maintain its nuclear capacity.

U.S. Ambassador to Israel Daniel Shapiro vowed Monday that President Obama would not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons and that the United States would not sign on to a ""bad deal"" at negotiations with Iran tipped to restart later this month.

Speaking at the Jewish Federations of North American General Assembly in Jerusalem, Shapiro drove home his point by repeating it in Hebrew, according to the Jerusalem Post.

He said that the U.S. would not ""squander"" the leverage of Western economic sanctions on Iran, which wants those sanctions removed. Shapiro said that no deal on Iran's atomic program would be better than a bad deal.

His comments came as the United Nations' nuclear chief reached a deal Monday to allow expanded monitoring of Iran's nuclear sites, including at a planned reactor, but not an agreement to dismantle its ability to make material for nuclear weapons as the U.N. Security Council has demanded.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Monday again defended U.S. efforts with Iran, saying that the major powers were unified on an Iran nuclear deal during weekend talks in Geneva but the Iranians did not accept it.

Speaking to reporters in Abu Dhabi, Kerry lashed out at opponents to the proposal. Among them are Israeli Prime MInister Benjamin Netanyahu, who told Kerry on Friday that the proposed deal gave Iran all it wants on sanctions and did nothing to end Iran's ability to make a nuclear bomb.

""The time to oppose it is when you see what it is, not to oppose the effort to find out what is possible,"" Kerry said. ""We are confident that what we are doing can actually protect Israel more effectively and provide greater security.""

Kerry's statement appeared to contradict the stance of French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, who told France Inter radio that Paris would not accept what he called a ""sucker's deal."" France announced over the weekend that it did not support the proposal backed by the United States because it did not adequately address security concerns of Iran's neighbor

That was the reason given by Netanyahu for his opposition to the proposal. Not waiting for the proposal to be announced by Kerry as a done deal, Netanyahu, apparently aware of the contours of the proposal, came out publicly to say it would imperil its very existence because it did not guarantee the end of Iran's nuclear bomb capabilities.

Analysts say it was unusual for the allies to be so public with their complaints about one another and it shows relations with Israel have never been more frayed in recent memory.

""If there were a synoptic map for diplomatic storms, the National Weather Service would be putting out a hurricane warning right now,"" said Haaretz diplomatic correspondent Chemi Shalev. ""And given that the turbulence is being caused by an issue long deemed to be critical to Israel's very existence, we may actually be facing a rare Category 5 flare-up, a 'superstorm' of U.S.-Israeli relations.""

Aaron David Miller, a former U.S. peace negotiator who has advised Democratic and Republican secretaries of State, said the rift may cause problems for the United States on multiple fronts, including a risk of dragging the United States into war with Iran.

""How this will play out is not clear,"" Miller said. ""I find it almost unimaginable this administration would conclude even an interim agreement with (Iranian President Hassan) Rouhani that left Israel angry and aggrieved and the relationship in even worse shape.""

Miller said Israeli frustration with the United States may have been greater at points in the past but he'd never seen Israeli ire expressed as publicly as has been done in recent days by Netanyahu. Headlines in the Israeli press seem to agree.

The United States has been pushing for a deal in talks in Geneva to end a standoff between Iran and the West over a nuclear program that the U.S. suspects is aimed at making an atomic bomb, a possibility that Israel considers a threat to its existence.

The Iranian question is just the latest issue to severely fray relations between Israel and the United States in recent months, along with the U.S. decision to tackle Syria's chemical weapons with diplomacy, and Obama's emphasis on the Israeli-Palestinian standoff as being the major problem facing the Middle East.

Israel complains that an increasingly radicalized Syria, the spread of Islamist ideology in Egypt and elsewhere, and a nuclear bomb in the hands of what Netanyahu has called ""Islamofascist fanatics"" in Iran are the real problems for the world in the Middle East.

Jonathan Rynhold, a senior researcher at Bar Ilan University's Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies, said the ""crisis of trust"" isn't just between Israel and the U.S. Most Middle East countries, he said, believe that a nuclear-armed Iran ""would undermine the balance of power that has served everyone so well over the years.""

If Iran becomes ""a nuclear threshold"" state, ""Saudi Arabia will quickly obtain nuclear weapons from Pakistan,"" which reportedly developed its own nuclear weapons with help from the Saudis, Rynhold said.

""Egypt is already looking to Russia to supply it with conventional weapons and will, no doubt, seek to obtain nuclear capability, as will Turkey.""

The breakdown over Iran came amid the extraordinary public barbs between the two longtime allies.

After meeting with Netanyahu on Friday, Kerry also told Israel's Channel 2 TV that Israel faced possible international isolation and violence with the Palestinians if his attempt to broker a peace deal for a Palestinian state failed.

An agitated Netanyahu lashed back that ""no amount of pressure"" would make Israel compromise on its basic security and national interests. He said the world had ignored Palestinian incitement and a refusal to accept Israel as a Jewish state, and that the West has acquiesced half-hearted Palestinian attempts to fight violence.

""It's time that the international community, certainly the serious members of the international community, understand this is a two-way street, because peace is not a one-way street and it won't be,"" he said.

On Sunday it continued, with Netanyahu disclosing to his Cabinet he told Kerry in private that Israel would not wait to see what deal emerged with Iran and would continue to lobby European leaders to stop it unless it ended Iran's program.

His stance had already prompted a personal call from Obama on Friday, and a high-ranking delegation of U.S. officials led by Wendy Sherman, U.S. undersecretary for political affairs arrived in Israel, on Sunday to talk to Netanyahu on the negotiations, according to Israel's Haaretz newspaper.

Israel says it's mystified by the foreign policy of the United States.

Netanyahu on Sunday said he was telling Western leaders that the proposed deal was dangerous for the world and the USA, not just Israel. He insisted to CBS' Face the Nation that the purpose of the Geneva negotiations is to get Iran to bend to the will of the U.N. Security Council demand that it remove the technology and material used for making a possible bomb.

""I'm expressing not only the concerns of Israel but the concerns of many in the region,"" he said. ""I asked the leaders, what is the rush?""

Naftali Bennett, a member of Netanyahu's security Cabinet, said Sunday that the way forward is to not lessen economic sanctions on Iran as the U.S-backed proposal would do, but to strengthen them. He suggested the Obama administration was backing off its original stand just so Iran will sign on to any agreement, and he praised other nations for opposing it.

""The deal needs to be the original deal which dismantles Iran's entire war machine,"" he told Fox News. ""Fortunately, France and other countries stopped this train.""

Netanyahu said he was actively lobbying leaders of Russia, France, Britain and Germany not reach a hasty deal, as well as the United States.

Iran state TV lashed out at opponents, describing France as being Israel's ""representative"" at the talks. Reuters reported Sunday that a Twitter account believed run by the office of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said: ""French officials have been openly hostile towards the Iranian nation over the past few years; this is an imprudent and inept move.""

The sticking points, say European negotiators such as France, is whether to demand a shutdown of a reactor that could produce weapons-grade nuclear fuel, what to do about Iran's stockpile of higher-enriched uranium, and how much relief from economic sanctions to give to Tehran before it does anything to its program.

Israel has made it clear that the world will only be safe if the West insists that Iran eradicate, not stall, its ability to develop nuclear weapons.

""We need to keep up the pressure on Iran to avoid a physical attack on Iran,"" Bennett said, referring to a possible military strike to stop Iran's nuclear program. ""Now is the time to prevent a nuclear 9/11.""

Former U.S. negotiator Miller agrees that the rift between the United States and Israel may have serious consequences, and soon. The frayed relationship makes it harder to gain Israeli backing for a final deal with Iran and to prevent a unilateral Israeli military strike.

Such a strike, with or without Obama's approval, would hike oil prices and threaten the U.S. economy, Miller said. And with the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet based in the Persian Gulf, it could cause the USA to be ""dragged in and required to respond"" to an Iranian counterattack, he said.

Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., warned that the president's Israel policies – allowing Iran to dominate in Syria, insisting on a Palestinian state while the region is in turmoil, and offering Iran a deal that Israel clearly opposes – shows Obama and Kerry to be unsympathetic to Israeli security needs.

Iran's nuclear capability ""is truly an existential threat to Israel,"" and Obama ""has ignored Israel's realities,"" Franks said.

Answering questions by CNN’s Wolf Blitzer before an audience at the Aspen Security Forum, Mattis said he found it inexplicable that the plot was dealt with as a law enforcement matter with no clear diplomatic or military response.

Iran was under Mattis’ purview at Central Command. Asked afterward whether he presented military options to the White House that were rejected, he said his advice would remain confidential.

In May, Manssor Arbabsiar, an Iranian American used-car salesman from Texas, was sentenced to 25 years in prison after pleading guilty to plotting to hire assassins from a Mexican drug cartel to murder Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to the U.S. at the behest of a cousin in Iran. The cousin, Gholam Shakuri, was a high-ranking member of the Quds Force, which is part of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.

Mattis said the plot was orchestrated “at the highest levels” of the Iranian government.

He criticized the fact that the U.S. announced the plot to the public by having Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. detail criminal charges. “Why wasn’t the secretary of State, secretary of Defense up at the microphone, not making any threats, just saying, we’ll be back?” he said.

The response was not adequate, he said. “I don’t know why [it] wasn’t dealt with more strongly.”

An Obama administration spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-pledges-swift-reaction-nkorea-nuke-test-190205244--politics.html,,[],Obama pledges swift reaction to NKorea nuke test,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama reacted sharply to North Korea's nuclear test Tuesday, promising swift international action to bring the rogue communist regime in line. The detonation came hours before the president's State of the Union address, where he was expected to touch on U.S. plans to reduce its nuclear arsenal.

In a statement, Obama called Pyongyang's third nuclear test in seven years a ""highly provocative act"" that threatens U.S. security and international peace. The reaction from the White House was significantly stronger than it was after North Korea's long-range missile test in December, when the administration only promised ""appropriate action"" alongside America's allies.

""The danger posed by North Korea's threatening activities warrants further swift and credible action by the international community,"" Obama said in a statement early Tuesday. ""The United States will also continue to take steps necessary to defend ourselves and our allies.""

Secretary of State John Kerry spoke by telephone with the foreign ministers of South Korea and Japan after the test, as well as China, and Obama called South Korean President Lee Myung-bak to assure him the U.S. would help defend his country.

North Korea said it successfully detonated a miniaturized nuclear device at a northeastern test site Tuesday. South Korean, U.S. and Japanese seismic monitoring agencies said they detected an earthquake in North Korea with a magnitude between 4.9 and 5.2.

North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said the test was conducted safely but with ""great explosive power."" The test counters the ""ferocious"" U.S. hostility that undermines the North's peaceful, sovereign right to launch satellites, it argued. Last month, North Korea's National Defense Commission said the United States was its prime target for a nuclear test and long-range rocket launches.

""These provocations do not make North Korea more secure,"" Obama said. ""Far from achieving its stated goal of becoming a strong and prosperous nation, North Korea has instead increasingly isolated and impoverished its people through its ill-advised pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.""

Story continues

The Obama administration's options for a response are limited — even though it is committed to protecting America's key Asian allies, South Korea and Japan.

The U.S. already maintains severe unilateral sanctions against North Korea, and commerce between the two countries is nearly nonexistent. Tougher global sanctions are dependent on the participation of China, Pyongyang's primary trading partner, but Beijing has resisted measures that would cut off North Korea's economy completely.

At the U.N., the Security Council opened an emergency meeting Tuesday and condemned North Korea's action. But any new, binding international sanctions will now have to be worked out.

More forceful U.S. consequences, in the form of a military response, are highly unlikely even though the United States remains technically at war with the notoriously unpredictable North Koreans, whose opaque leadership has confounded successive American administrations. Only the 1953 armistice ending the Korean War keeps the U.S. and the North from hostilities, and some 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea to deter potential aggression.

But with the South Korean capital of Seoul just 40 miles south of the nuclear-armed North's border and its million-man army, the risks involved in any military action are great. And just raising the rhetoric can even serve as a reward to North Korea's attention-seeking government, which starves its citizens while seeking to leverage any military advance it makes into much-needed aid.

The test occurred hours before Obama was to deliver his prime-time address to the nation. While the bulk of the speech will focus on the economy and job creation, the administration had sought to emphasize that it wants to work with Russia on further reducing the amount of deployable nuclear weapons each power maintains, building on the U.S.-Russian New START accord that took effect in 2011.

It's unclear how North Korea's test would affect the planning. Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for the White House's National Security Council, said Obama would make the case Tuesday evening that the ""only way North Korea will rejoin the world community is if they stop these threats and live up to their international obligations.""

State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland added that North Korea's test was unrelated to the president's position that the U.S. has ""more nuclear weapons than we need.""

""We're obviously talking about apples and oranges in the context of the U.S. having almost 1,700 nuclear weapons and we are working to prevent (North Korea) from having the effective ability to launch a far smaller amount,"" she said.

Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, in remarks Tuesday morning to Pentagon workers gathered in the building's courtyard, said the U.S. is going to have to continue to deal with rogue states like North Korea.

""We just saw what North Korea has done in these last few weeks, a missile test and now a nuclear test,"" he said. ""They represent a serious threat to the United States of America, and we've got to be prepared to deal with that. ""

The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, California Republican Ed Royce, called for even tougher sanctions and demanded that the administration ""replace its failed North Korea policy.""

""Otherwise, the grave North Korean threat to the region and the United States will only grow,"" Royce said.

And House Intelligence Committee chairman Mike Rogers, R-Mich., added that the U.S. must take a new approach to dealing with North Korea. ""The key to stemming North Korea's cycle of provocation is to seriously engage the Chinese in exercising leverage over their neighbor,"" he said.

On Tuesday, China expressed firm opposition to the test but called for a calm response by all sides.

The aftermath

In the days and weeks following the raid, more details would be released about how it all went down. How did the U.S. know bin Laden was there? Who took part in the mission, and who knew about it? Why was bin Laden killed instead of taken prisoner? Over time, some of the details initially put out by the White House were clarified or changed . Some are still disputed today.

There were several other headaches for U.S. officials to deal with.

There was a full-throated debate about whether to release grisly photos of bin Laden's body to the public. But in the end, Obama, not wanting to incite further violence, chose to keep the photos classified . ""We don't need to spike the football,"" he told CBS News.

The killing also created tension that needed to be smoothed over with Pakistan, which was outraged that the United States chose to carry out the bin Laden mission there without first informing its leaders.

And then there was the downed helicopter U.S. officials hoped to retrieve from bin Laden's compound because of security concerns over the stealth technology of its unusual tail assembly

A few days after the raid, U.S. officials unveiled videos of bin Laden that were recovered in the raid. You can watch all of them here . Perhaps the most well-known video of this stash shows a hunched-over bin Laden, draped in a blanket, using a remote control to watch television.

Also taken in the raid were documents, disks, thumb drives, computers and other intelligence that would be pored over for evidence of further terrorist plots.

Years later

After bin Laden's death, much praise was heaped on the elite Navy SEALs who carried out the raid: the anonymous ""quiet professionals"" who live by a code to keep their sensitive missions secret.

But one former member of the team, Matt Bissonnette, detailed the mission in his 2012 best-seller ""No Easy Day."" The book started a debate about honor, ethics and cultural values in the military ; the Pentagon said Bissonnette included classified material in the book and didn't follow protocol for pre-publication review.

The raid was also portrayed in the film ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" which focuses on the bin Laden manhunt and was nominated for five Academy Awards. Three U.S. senators -- Dianne Feinstein, Carl Levin and John McCain -- called the film ""grossly inaccurate and misleading,"" especially the movie's suggestion that harsh interrogations helped find bin Laden. The filmmakers responded by saying the film condensed 10 years of intelligence work into a 2½ hour film.

This year, Esquire magazine published a profile on a Navy SEAL who said he was the one who shot bin Laden. His account contradicted some of the details in Bissonnette's book.

Another SEAL, however, told Peter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst, that the Esquire story is ""complete BS."""

http://news.yahoo.com/us-taliban-start-talks-ending-afghan-war-170247308.html,,[],"US, Taliban to start talks on ending Afghan war","KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — The Taliban and the U.S. said Tuesday they will hold talks on finding a political solution to ending nearly 12 years of war in Afghanistan, as the international coalition formally handed over control of the country's security to the Afghan army and police.

The Taliban met a key U.S. demand by pledging not to use Afghanistan as a base to threaten other countries, although the Americans said they must also denounce al-Qaida.

But President Barack Obama cautioned that the process won't be quick or easy. He described the opening of a Taliban political office in the Gulf nation of Qatar as an ""important first step toward reconciliation"" between the Islamic militants and the government of Afghanistan, and predicted there will be bumps along the way.

Obama, who was attending the G-8 summit in Northern Ireland, praised Afghan President Hamid Karzai for taking a courageous step by sending representatives to discuss peace with the Taliban.

""It's good news. We're very pleased with what has taken place,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in Washington. British Prime Minister David Cameron, whose country has the second-largest contingent of troops in Afghanistan after the U.S., called opening the office ""the right thing to do.""

As the handover occurred, four U.S. troops were killed Tuesday at or near Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, U.S. defense officials said. The officials said the four were killed by indirect fire, likely a mortar or rocket, but they had no other details. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to provide details on the deaths.

Officials with the Obama administration said the office in the Qatari capital of Doha was the first step toward the ultimate U.S.-Afghan goal of a full Taliban renunciation of links with al-Qaida, the reason why America invaded the country on Oct. 7, 2001, shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks against the United States.

Story continues

The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record, said U.S. representatives will begin formal meetings with the Taliban in Qatar in a few days.

The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, said the only way to end the war was through a political solution.

""My perspective has always been that this war is going to have to end with political reconciliation, and so I frankly would be supportive of any positive movement in terms of reconciliation, particularly an Afghan-led and an Afghan-owned process that would bring reconciliation between the Afghan people and the Taliban in the context of the Afghan constitution,"" he said.

Dunford added that he was no longer responsible for the security of the country now that Afghan forces had taken the lead.

""Last week I was responsible for security here in Afghanistan,"" he said, adding that now it was Karzai's job. ""It's not just a statement of intent — it's a statement of fact.""

The transition to Afghan-led security means U.S. and other foreign combat troops will not be directly carrying the fight to the insurgency, but will advise and back up as needed with air support and medical evacuations.

The handover paves the way for the departure of coalition forces — currently numbering about 100,000 troops from 48 countries, including 66,000 Americans. By the end of the year, the NATO force will be halved. At the end of 2014, all combat troops will have left and will replaced, if approved by the Afghan government, by a much smaller force that will only train and advise.

Obama has not yet said how many soldiers he will leave in Afghanistan along with NATO forces, but it is thought that it would be about 9,000 U.S. troops and about 6,000 from its allies.

It is uncertain if the Afghan forces are good enough to fight the insurgents. The force numbered less than 40,000 six years ago and has grown to about 352,000 today.

In some of the most restive parts of the country, it may still take a ""few months"" to hand over security completely to the Afghans, Dunford said.

The transition comes at a time when violence is at levels matching the worst in 12 years, further fueling some Afghans' concerns that their forces aren't ready.

The decision to open the Taliban office was a reversal of months of failed efforts to start peace talks while the militants intensified a campaign targeting urban centers and government installations.

Experts warned that it would be a mistake to expect too much.

""The keys are to keep expectations low, to remember that a compromise is unlikely because no one can say what it would consist of,"" said Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution. He added that in his opinion, the Taliban wrongly ""expect to win the war once NATO is largely gone come 2015.""

""All that said, it's a potentially useful step if we don't confuse ourselves or wind up in polarizing debates within the coalition,"" O'Hanlon said.

In Doha, Ali Bin Fahad Al-Hajri, the assistant to the foreign minister of Qatar, said the Emir of the Gulf state had given the go-ahead for the office to open.

""Negotiations are the only way for peace in Afghanistan,"" Al-Hajri said.

The Taliban emerged from the Pakistani-trained mujahedeen, or holy warriors, who battled the Soviet Union's occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s with secret backing by the CIA. Civil war broke out when the pro-Soviet Afghan government collapsed following the departure of Moscow's troops. The U.S. took an arms-length position of neutrality as rival warlords shelled Kabul into ruins.

By 1994, the Taliban had evolved into a united military and political force and in 1996, the group took control of Afghanistan. Led by Mullah Mohammed Omar, the Afghan Taliban sheltered Osama bin Laden in the years leading up to the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001, but the group was toppled shortly after the U.S. and allied invasion one month later.

The U.S.-led invasion leveraged the firepower of factions, such as the Northern Alliance, who had held out against the Taliban after it seized power in 1996. CIA and U.S. special operations support for anti-Taliban forces enabled the U.S. to oust the Islamists by December 2001 without committing large numbers of U.S. ground troops, and the group appeared to have been defeated as a military threat.

However, by 2005, the Taliban was beginning to make a comeback, showing signs of improved training and equipment, while using territory inside Pakistan as a sanctuary.

On Monday, Taliban spokesman Mohammad Naim said the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, as the Taliban were known when they ruled the country, was willing to use all legal means to end what they called the occupation of Afghanistan. But he did not say they would immediately stop fighting.

""The jihad continues to end the occupation and establish an Islamic emirate. To achieve this goal, we will follow every legitimate means,"" he said. ""The emirate of the Taliban, with its military effort, has a strategic goal related to the future of Afghanistan. The movement is not intending to harm any other parties and will not allow anybody to use Afghan territory to threaten other countries.""

The Obama administration officials said the U.S. and Taliban representatives will hold bilateral meetings. Karzai's High Peace Council is expected to follow up with its own talks with the Taliban a few days later.

But in making their announcement in Doha, the Taliban did not specifically mention talks with Karzai or his representatives.

""We don't recognize the Afghan government and the government of Karzai. The talks will be with the Americans only in Doha under the patronage of Qatar,"" he said. ""We represent the people of Afghanistan. We don't represent the Karzai government.""

The administration officials acknowledged the process will be ""complex, long and messy"" because of the ongoing level of distrust between the parties.

The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record, vowed to continue to push the Taliban further, saying that the Taliban ultimately must also break ties with al-Qaida, end violence and accept Afghanistan's constitution — including protections for women and minorities.

They said the U.S. had long demanded that the Taliban make a statement distancing the group from international terrorism, but had said that they did not expect them to break ties with al-Qaida immediately. That would be one of the outcomes of the negotiating process, they added.

The U.S. will hold its first formal meetings with the Taliban in Doha within a few days, senior officials said, with the expectation that it will be followed up days later by a meeting between representatives of the Taliban and the High Peace Council. The first meeting will focus on an exchange of agendas and consultations on next steps.

Naim did not give a schedule for talks.

The Taliban office is in one of the diplomatic areas in Doha. Its sign reads: ""The Political Bureau of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in Doha.""

Despite Karzai's stated hope that the process will move almost immediately to Afghanistan, U.S. officials do not expect that to be possible in the near future.

The Taliban have for years refused to speak to the government or the High Peace Council, set up by Karzai three years ago, because they considered them to be U.S. ""puppets."" Taliban representatives have instead talked to American and other Western officials in Doha and other places, mostly in Europe.

Officials said Obama was personally involved in working with Karzai to enable the opening of the office, and that Kerry had also played a major role. Obama briefed other leaders at the summit meeting, which included the countries of Britain, Russia, Germany, Japan, Canada, France and Italy.

James Dobbins, the U.S. special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, was scheduled to leave Washington on Tuesday to visit Turkey, Qatar, Afghanistan and Pakistan, focusing primarily on ""reconciliation efforts,"" according to State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/17/edward-snowden-spy-chinese_n_3455078.html,2013-06-17 00:00:00,['Ap The Huffington Post'],Edward Snowden: I'm Not A Spy For The Chinese,"WASHINGTON -- NSA leaker Edward Snowden is defending his disclosure of top-secret U.S. spying programs in an online chat Monday with The Guardian, in which he rejected allegations that he is spying for the Chinese and attacked U.S. officials for calling him a traitor.

""No. I have had no contact with the Chinese government. Just like with the Guardian and the Washington Post, I only work with journalists,"" he said in response to a question from The Guardian's Spencer Ackerman.

Responding to a similar query, Snowden painted the spy allegations as an attempt to destroy his character:

This is a predictable smear that I anticipated before going public, as the US media has a knee-jerk ""RED CHINA!"" reaction to anything involving HK or the PRC, and is intended to distract from the issue of US government misconduct. Ask yourself: if I were a Chinese spy, why wouldn't I have flown directly into Beijing? I could be living in a palace petting a phoenix by now.

Snowden also appeared defiant in the face of calls for his prosecution.

""The U.S. government is not going to be able to cover this up by jailing or murdering me. Truth is coming, and it cannot be stopped,"" he said. He added the government ""immediately and predictably destroyed any possibility of a fair trial at home,"" by labeling him a traitor, and indicated he would not return to the U.S. voluntarily.

Congressional leaders have called Snowden a traitor for revealing once-secret surveillance programs two weeks ago in the Guardian and The Washington Post. The National Security Agency programs collect records of millions of Americans' telephone calls and Internet usage as a counterterror tool. The disclosures revealed the scope of the collections, which surprised many Americans and have sparked debate about how much privacy the government can take away in the name of national security.

""It would be foolish to volunteer yourself to"" possible arrest and criminal charges ""if you can do more good outside of prison than in it,"" he said.

The Guardian announced its website was hosting an online chat with Snowden, in hiding in Hong Kong, with reporter Glenn Greenwald receiving and posting his questions. The Associated Press couldn't independently verify that the man answering the questions was indeed Snowden.

Snowden was working as a contractor for NSA at the time he had access to the then-secret programs. He defended his actions and said he considered what to reveal and what not to, saying he did not reveal any U.S. operations against what he called legitimate military targets, but instead showed the NSA is hacking civilian infrastructure like universities and private businesses.

""These nakedly, aggressively criminal acts are wrong no matter the target. Not only that, when NSA makes a technical mistake during an exploitation operation, critical systems crash,"" he said, though he gave no examples of what systems have crashed or in which countries.

""Congress hasn't declared war on the countries – the majority of them are our allies – but without asking for public permission, NSA is running network operations against them that affect millions of innocent people,"" he said. ""And for what? So we can have secret access to a computer in a country we're not even fighting?""

Snowden was referring to PRISM, one of the programs he disclosed. The program sweeps up Internet usage data from all over the world that goes through nine major U.S.-based Internet providers. The NSA can look at foreign usage without any warrants, and says the program doesn't target Americans.

U.S. officials say the data-gathering programs are legal and operated under secret court supervision.

Snowden explained his claim that from his desk, he could ""wiretap"" any phone call or email – a claim top intelligence officials have denied. ""If an NSA, FBI, CIA, DIA, etc. analyst has access to query raw SIGINT (signals intelligence) databases, they can enter and get results for anything they want,"" he wrote in the answer posted on the Guardian site. ""Phone number, email, user id, cell phone handset id (IMEI), and so on – it's all the same.""

The NSA did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. But Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has said that the kind of data that can be accessed and who can access it is severely limited.

Snowden said the restrictions on what could be seen by an individual analyst vary according to policy changes, which can happen ""at any time,"" and said that a technical ""filter"" on NSA data gathering meant to filter out U.S. communications is ""weak,"" such that U.S. communications often get ingested.

Snowden defended U.S. Army Private Bradley Manning for his disclosures of documents to Wikileaks, which he called a ""legitimate journalistic outlet,"" which ""carefully redacted all of their releases in accordance with a judgment of public interest."" He said the Wikileaks release of unredacted material was ""due to the failure of a partner journalist to control a passphrase,"" which led to the charge against Manning that he dumped the documents, which Snowden called an attempt to smear Manning.

Manning is currently on trial at Fort Meade – the same Army base where the NSA is headquartered – on charges of aiding the enemy for releasing documents to Wikileaks.

Snowden defended his description of his salary as being $200,000 a year, calling that a ""career high,"" but saying he did take a pay cut to take the job at Booz Allen Hamilton, where he worked as a contractor at an NSA facility in Hawaii. When Booz Allen fired him, they said his salary was $122,000.

1. SYRIA CIVIL WAR

Tick tock tick talk: Congress goes back in session September 9. Which means the White House has the rest of this week to talk lawmakers into green-lighting an attack on Syria. The maneuverings began over the weekend, when President Barack Obama asked Congress to approve the attack, saying it's the right thing to do after the regime allegedly used chemical weapons. Obama said he doesn’t need Congress’ blessing – but he’d like it. Lawmakers, in turn, are saying: Convince us. Here's a quick Q&A to get you up to date.

Now is the time for Pres. Obama to reshape public opinion. Why does Syria matter? American people won't/don't follow an uncertain trumpet. — Lindsey Graham (@GrahamBlog) September 2, 2013

Meanwhile, there's more bad news out of Syria. This morning, the U.N. refugee agency offered up this grim stat: The number of Syrians who've fled the country has now risen above 2 million. Put another way, every 15 seconds, a Syrian becomes a refugee.

The U.S. may release more info on the controversial electronic surveillance programs today, trying to beat the tech giants who're thinking of releasing info of their own. Meanwhile, add Brazil and Mexico to the 'We're not gonna take it' club, after media reports that the U.S. spied on their presidents.

4. FUKUSHIMA RADIATION

Drip, drip, drip of bad news: The Fukushima nuclear plant meltdown two years ago ruined a lot, including the power company that runs it. Japanese taxpayers had to bail TEPCO out. And now they'll have to fork over $470 million to take care of the radioactive mess that the company's been unable to. Look for some folks to be seriously upset about this.

Rodman's back in Pyongyang today. Will he dare to bring up Bae? This is Rodman last week to the Huffington Post: ""I will definitely ask for Kenneth Bae's release. I will say, 'Marshal, why is this guy held hostage?'"" This is Rodman yesterday to Reuters: ""I'm not going to North Korea to discuss freeing Kenneth Bae.

The retired general, who ruled Pakistan for nine years, has unsuccessfully sought bail in a showdown with an increasingly assertive judiciary determined to bring him to account for his autocratic actions before relinquishing power under pressure in 2008.

If convicted, he would be the first former army chief to go to prison in Pakistan’s 65-year history, which includes long stretches of military rule and coups such as the one Musharraf launched to gain power in 1999. That prospect has raised fears of a backlash by a powerful military leadership that considers Musharraf one of its own, even if he is no longer well liked among the brass.

In an uneventful hearing, the anti-terrorism court continued the case — which essentially portrays Musharraf as an enemy of the state — until May 4. He left under heavy security, offering the occasional salute, to spend the next two weeks in custody.

There was an element of irony to his appearance in that court: Musharraf famously allied Pakistan with the United States in its counterterrorism operations and war against al-Qaeda and the Taliban after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

Musharraf, 69, calls the charges against him baseless and politically motivated, but he began bowing to the law Friday after dramatically fleeing a courthouse Thursday to avoid detention.

It was unclear whether he will spend the next two weeks under house arrest at his villa on the capital’s outskirts, as his lawyers are seeking, or have to remain at an officers’ club attached to central police headquarters in the capital.

While some political analysts have predicted a destabilizing battle between the courts and the army if the retired four-star general is put on trial, others hope for a clean and quick resolution — preferably one that avoids further humiliating Musharraf, whose return to Pakistan last month to run for prime minister has proved disastrous.

A smooth exit would ease tensions in the tumultuous nation as it heads into elections on May 11 that will bring an unprecedented handoff of power between elected governments.

On Friday, Pakistan’s Senate, sitting in a limited session, passed a resolution demanding that Musharraf be tried for abrogating the constitution. All major contenders for prime minister in the upcoming elections have piled on, urging punishment."

The American announcement came on the same day that Chinese state news media said that China sent jets aloft and that they identified two American surveillance planes and 10 Japanese aircraft in the air defense zone the country declared last weekend.

Although there was no indication that China’s air force showed any hostile intent, the move raised tensions. The Chinese had also sent jets on patrol into the contested airspace the day before, but Xinhua, the state-run news agency, indicated that the planes on Friday were scrambled specifically to respond to foreign jets in the area.

Image Credit... The New York Times

Earlier in the week, the United States sent unarmed B-52s into the area, and they proceeded unimpeded. China then appeared to back down somewhat from its initial declaration that planes must file advance flight plans or face possible military action.

The administration’s decision on Friday underscored the delicate position President Obama finds himself in, drawn into a geopolitical dispute that will test how far he is willing to go to contain China’s rising regional ambitions.

China’s move thrust the United States into the middle of the already prickly territorial clash between Beijing and Tokyo, a position the administration had avoided for months even while reiterating that the mutual defense treaty with Japan covers the islands. After the Chinese declaration last weekend, American officials feared that, if left unchallenged, the Chinese action would lead to ever greater claims elsewhere in the Pacific region.

But with planes flying so fast and in such proximity, the administration’s worries grew that an accident or an unintended confrontation could spiral out of control. A midair collision between a Chinese fighter jet and an American spy plane off the coast of China in 2001 killed the fighter pilot and forced the spy plane to make an emergency landing on Hainan Island, setting off a diplomatic episode until Beijing released the American crew and sent the plane back, broken into parts."

http://news.yahoo.com/european-officials-slam-us-over-bugging-report-135703554.html,,[],European officials slam US over bugging report,"BERLIN (AP) — Senior European officials expressed concern Sunday at reports that U.S. intelligence agents bugged EU offices on both sides of the Atlantic, with some leftist lawmakers calling for concrete sanctions against Washington.

The president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, said he was ""deeply worried and shocked about the allegations of U.S. authorities spying on EU offices"" made in a report published Sunday by German news weekly Der Spiegel.

The magazine said the surveillance was carried out by the U.S. National Security Agency, which has recently been the subject of leaks claiming it scanned vast amounts of foreign Internet traffic. The U.S. government has defended its efforts to intercept electronic communications overseas by arguing that this has helped prevent terror attacks at home and abroad.

Schulz said that if the allegations that the NSA bugged European Union offices were confirmed ""it would be an extremely serious matter which will have a severe impact on EU-US relations.""

Green Party leaders in the European Parliament, Rebecca Harms and Daniel Cohn-Bendit, called for an immediate investigation into the claims and suggested that recently launched negotiations on a trans-Atlantic trade treaty should be put on hold.

They also called for existing U.S.-EU agreements on the exchange of bank transfer and passenger record information to be canceled. Both programs have been labeled as unwarranted infringements of citizens' privacy by left-wing and libertarian lawmakers in Europe.

In Germany, where criticism of the NSA's surveillance programs has been particularly vocal, a senior government official accused the United States on Sunday of using Cold War methods against its allies by targeting EU offices in Washington, New York and Brussels.

""If the media reports are accurate, then this recalls the methods used by enemies during the Cold War,"" German Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger. ""It is beyond comprehension that our friends in the United States see Europeans as enemies.""

Story continues

Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger called for an ""immediate and comprehensive"" response from the U.S. government to the claims in the Spiegel report, which cited classified U.S. documents taken by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden that the magazine said it had partly seen.

Spokespeople for the NSA and the office for the national intelligence director in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday.

According to Der Spiegel, the NSA planted bugs in the EU's diplomatic offices in Washington and infiltrated the building's computer network. Similar measures were taken at the EU's mission to the United Nations in New York, the magazine said.

Der Spiegel didn't publish the alleged NSA documents it cited nor say how it obtained access to them. But one of the report's authors is Laura Poitras, an award-winning documentary filmmaker who interviewed Snowden while he was holed up in Hong Kong.

The U.S. has been trying to track down Snowden, who is believed to currently be at Moscow's main airport with plans to travel to Ecuador to seek asylum.

The magazine also didn't specify how it learned of the NSA's alleged eavesdropping efforts at a key EU office in Brussels. There, the NSA used secure facilities at NATO headquarters nearby to dial into telephone maintenance systems that would have allowed it to intercept senior EU officials' calls and Internet traffic, the Spiegel report said.

Also Sunday, German federal prosecutors said they were examining whether the reported U.S. electronic surveillance programs broke German laws. In a statement, the Federal Prosecutors' Office said it was probing the claims so as to ""achieve a reliable factual basis"" before considering whether a formal investigation was warranted.

It said private citizens were likely to file criminal complaints on the matter, but didn't comment on the possible legal merits of such complaints.

Der Spiegel reported that at least one such complaint was lodged with prosecutors in the state of Hesse last week.

MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin bluntly rejected U.S. pleas to extradite National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden on Tuesday, saying Snowden is free to travel wherever he wants and insisting that Russian security agencies haven't contacted him.

Snowden is in the transit zone of a Moscow airport and has not passed through Russian immigration, Putin said, meaning he is not technically in Russia.

After arriving Sunday on a flight from Hong Kong, Snowden booked a seat on a Havana-bound flight from Moscow on Monday en route to Venezuela and then possible asylum in Ecuador, but he didn't board the plane.

Snowden's whereabouts since then have been a mystery, and Putin's comments were the first time Russia has made clear it knows where he is.

Speculation has been rife that Russian security agencies might want to keep Snowden in Russia for a more thorough debriefing, but Putin denied that.

""Our special services never worked with Mr. Snowden and aren't working with him today,"" Putin said at a news conference during a visit to Finland.

Putin said that because there is no extradition agreement with the U.S., it couldn't meet the U.S. request.

""Mr. Snowden is a free man, and the sooner he chooses his final destination the better it is for us and for him,"" Putin said. ""I hope it will not affect the business-like character of our relations with the U.S. and I hope that our partners will understand that.""

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Tuesday that though the United States does not have an extradition treaty with Russia, it wants Moscow to comply with common law practices between countries where fugitives are concerned.

Putin's staunch refusal to consider Snowden's extradition reflects the Russian president's readiness to further challenge Washington at a time when U.S.-Russian relations are already strained over Syria and a Russian ban on adoptions by Americans.

A Kremlin decision to provide even temporary shelter and safe transit to Snowden would embarrass Washington. And despite Putin's denial, analysts believe Russian special services wouldn't miss the chance to question the man who is believed to hold reams of classified U.S. documents.

Russia also relished using Snowden's revelations to try to turn the tables on U.S. criticism of Russia's rights record.

Putin compared Snowden to WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, who has been provided asylum in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, saying that both men were labeled criminals but consider themselves rights activists and champions of freedom of information.

""Ask yourself a question: should people like that be extradited so that they put them in prison or not?"" he said. ""In any case, I would prefer not to deal with such issues. It's like shearing a piglet: a lot of squealing and little wool.""

In an apparent reference to claims that Moscow could have played a role in Snowden's exit from Hong Kong, he said that his arrival was a ""complete surprise"" and dismissed accusations against Russia as ""ravings and sheer nonsense.""

""He doesn't need a visa or any other documents, and as a transit passenger he has the right to buy a ticket and fly wherever he wants,"" Putin said.

Russian news media had reported Snowden remained in a transit zone of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, but journalists there haven't seen him.

Legally, an arriving air passenger ""crosses the border"" after clearing immigration checks.

Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov rejected the U.S. push for Snowden's extradition earlier Tuesday, but wouldn't specify his whereabouts, saying only that he hasn't crossed the Russian border.

""We consider the attempts to accuse Russia of violating U.S. laws and even some sort of conspiracy, which on top of all that are accompanied by threats, as absolutely ungrounded and unacceptable,"" Lavrov said. ""There are no legal grounds for such conduct by U.S. officials.""

U.S. and Ecuadorean officials had said they believed Snowden was still in Russia.

Kerry called for ""calm and reasonableness.""

""We would hope that Russia would not side with someone who is `a fugitive' from justice,' "" Kerry said at a news conference in Saudi Arabia.

The U.S. has revoked Snowden's passport.

A representative of WikiLeaks has been traveling with Snowden, and the organization is believed to be assisting him in arranging asylum. Assange, the group's founder, said Monday that Snowden was only passing through Russia and had applied for asylum in Ecuador, Iceland and possibly other countries.

A high-ranking Ecuadorean official told The Associated Press that Russia and Ecuador were discussing where Snowden could go, saying the process could take days. He also said Ecuador's ambassador to Moscow had not seen or spoken to Snowden. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case publicly.

Ecuador's foreign minister, Ricardo Patino, hailed Snowden on Monday as ""a man attempting to bring light and transparency to facts that affect everyone's fundamental liberties.""

""We're following all the appropriate legal channels and working with various other countries to make sure that the rule of law is observed,"" President Barack Obama told reporters.

The Kremlin has previously said Russia would be ready to consider Snowden's request for asylum.

Snowden is a former CIA employee who later was hired as a contractor for the NSA. In that job, he gained access to documents that he gave to newspapers the Guardian and The Washington Post to expose what he contends are privacy violations by an authoritarian government.

Snowden also told the South China Morning Post newspaper in Hong Kong that ""the NSA does all kinds of things like hack Chinese cellphone companies to steal all of your SMS data."" He is believed to have more than 200 additional sensitive documents in laptops he is carrying.

Some observers said in addition to the sensitive data, Snowden's revelations have provided the Kremlin with propaganda arguments to counter the U.S. criticism of Russia's crackdown on opposition and civil activists under Putin.

""They would use Snowden to demonstrate that the U.S. government doesn't sympathize with the ideals of freedom of information, conceals key information from the public and stands ready to open criminal proceedings against those who oppose it,"" Konstantin Remchukov, the editor of independent daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta, said on Ekho Moskvy radio.

Putin has accused the U.S. State Department of instigating protests in Moscow against his re-election for a third term in March and has taken an anti-American posture that plays well with his core support base of industrial workers and state employees.

In the National Defense Commission’s “important statement” carried on its state-run Korea Central Television, Pyongyang said that if the U.S. is “sincerely interested in keeping the peace and security in the region, including the mainland United States,” the two countries should hold high-level talks.

Proposing the two countries meet at a venue and date of Washington’s choice, Pyongyang said they could discuss issues such as “easing the military tension” and denuclearization. The communist state also emphasized that there shouldn’t be any precondition to the talks, and that how the situation unfolds depends solely on the U.S.

“We assert, internally and externally, that denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is our people’s unchanging will,” the statement said, adding that it is the task for the party and its people as it is “the legacy of the late leader and the general.”

“The special statement seems to reflect Kim Jong Un’s will to deal with the U.S.,” said professor Yang Moo-jin of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. “Kim Jong Un’s special envoy to China, Choi Ryong-hae, has expressed that Pyongyang will resolve the current tension through talks and negotiations. The suggestion this time seems to be on the same line as that.”

North Korea has been globally criticized and seen sanctions expand in the wake of its long-range rocket launch in December, which they claimed to be for scientific purposes only. The hard-line communist state also carried out a nuclear test in early February, saying that it was in response to Washington’s “hostile policy.”

But earlier this month North Korea changed its war-like attitude and called for rare working-level talks with Seoul ahead of President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping’s meeting in California. However, what would have been the first high-level talks in more than two years between the two Koreas never took place because the North shelved the meeting, expressing dissatisfaction over the South’s choice of its delegates early last week.

Obama and Xi agreed to push for the denuclearization of North Korea, while Seoul announced that President Park Geun-hye will discuss denuclearization with Xi at their meeting this month.

The last high-level talks between the U.S. and North Korea were in February 2012. First Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Kim Kye-gwan of North Korea met with U.S. State Department special representative Glyn Davis in Beijing, and reached an agreement calling for Pyongyang to halt its nuclear tests in return for U.S. aid.

In the statement, however, Pyongyang officials confirmed that they will “keep their nuclear-state status, whether others acknowledge it or not,” until the “external nuclear threats completely come to an end.”

“Now the ball is on the U.S. side,” said professor Yang. “If Pyongyang and Washington had some discussion beforehand through a New York channel, there are higher chances of the talk being actualized. But if this is just North Korea insisting the two come together, there is less chance of the U.S. agreeing.”"

USA TODAY

President wanted to address %22where we go from here%22

Obama spoke as Russia offered a diplomatic proposal

Polls show public and congressional opposition to military action

WASHINGTON — President Obama told the nation Tuesday he is exploring a Russian diplomatic plan to end a chemical weapons dispute in Syria, but reserves the right to take military action if necessary.

""It's too early to tell whether this offer will succeed,"" Obama said during a White House address, but it is worth pursuing because of ""the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force.""

During his nationally televised speech from the White House, Obama also said:

• He wanted to talk to the country ""about Syria, why it matters and where we go from here.""

• He resisted any intervention in Syria's civil war for months until Bashar Assad's government used chemical weapons against anti-government rebels on Aug. 21, killing numerous children.

• Use of these banned weapons increase the possibility of other chemical attacks in other parts of the world, perhaps even the United States.

• A lack of action would erode prohibitions on other weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons.

• ""I know that after the terrible toll of Iraq and Afghanistan, the idea of any military action, no matter how limited, is not going to be popular;"" but any action in Syria would be specifically targeted on its chemical weapons programs.

• Syria does not have the ability to retaliate against the United States.

• He is encouraged by Russia's proposal to have Syria give up its chemical weapons, but added: ""I've ordered our military to maintain their current posture to keep the pressure on Assad and to be in a position to respond if diplomacy fails.""

• Americans should review videos of the Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack now posted on the White House website, particularly the pictures of dead and dying children.

""Terrible things happen across the globe, and it is beyond our means to right every wrong,"" Obama said. ""But when with modest effort and risk we can stop children from being gassed to death and thereby make our own children safer over the long run, I believe we should act.""

Obama's speech capped a flurry of diplomatic activity, as American, British and French officials spoke with Russian counterparts about their idea to have Syria turn over their chemical weapons to international control for dismantling.

So far, they are at odds on the details.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said he would only support a Syrian turnover if the Obama administration renounced the possible of use of force against Assad's government.

Obama declined to do that. In meetings with U.S. senators on Tuesday, and during his prime time speech, Obama said it's the potential for force that pressured Syria into negotiations about releasing its chemical weapons stockpile.

Officials said Secretary of State John Kerry would fly to Geneva, Switzerland, for a Thursday negotiation session with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

Syria announced Tuesday it would accept Russia's offer, and said it is willing to join a global ban on chemical weapons.

Members of Congress, divided over a resolution authorizing military action against Syria, began exploring alternatives in light of the new diplomatic moves. The use-of-force resolution faces uphill battles in both the Democratic-controlled Senate and the Republican-run House.

Earlier on Tuesday, Obama attended separate meetings with Senate Democrats and Republicans in which he previewed his speech.

A bipartisan group of senators -- some of whom support intervention -- are working on an alternative that would require Syria to allow a United Nations team to remove chemical weapons within a certain time period, perhaps 45 to 60 days. If Syria doesn't comply, Obama would have the authority to launch military strikes.

Obama also spoke amid rising opposition in the public and in Congress to idea of a military strike against Syria.

An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Tuesday finds that nearly 60% of Americans want their member of Congress to oppose the use of military force in Syria."

Washington (CNN) - As North Korea increases its alarming threats against South Korea and the United States the past few weeks, a new national survey suggests that Americans are listening.

And a CNN/ORC International poll also indicates that for the first time, a majority of the public is pessimistic that the situation involving North Korea's missile program can be solved by diplomatic and economic means alone.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

According to the survey, 41% of Americans now characterize North Korea an immediate threat to the United States, an all-time high for that measure.

""If North Korean leader Kim Jong Un wanted to get the attention of the American public, his strategy is starting to work,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""The 41% who now consider North Korea an immediate threat to the United States is up 13 percentage points in less than a month.""

Another 41% say that North Korea is a long-term threat to the U.S and 16% say the isolated regime is not a threat.

North Korea has issued a catalog of alarming threats against the South and the U.S. in the past several weeks, sharpening its rhetoric after the U.N. Security Council imposed stricter sanctions for Pyongyang's latest underground nuclear test, which took place in February. The strong words have put the region on edge.

South Korea said Sunday that it believed Pyongyang could conduct a missile test this week after recently moving the necessary components to the coast.

According to the poll, only 46% of the public says the crisis can be successfully resolved with diplomatic or economic means alone, with 51% disagreeing.

""For the first time, Americans are pessimistic that the situation involving North Korea can be resolved using only economic and diplomatic means,"" says Holland. ""On previous occasions when tensions with North Korea were running high, most Americans thought that diplomacy would be enough, although that number has dropped over the years as those tensions have re-emerged time after time.""

Should the U.S. use troops to defend South Korea if that country is attacked by the north?

The survey indicates that six in ten would support a military response to an attack on South Korea, with a majority of all demographic groups approving that action.

The CNN poll was conducted by ORC International, from April 5-7, with 1,012 adults nationwide questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.

President Barack Obama has won backing from key figures in the U.S. Congress in his call for limited U.S. strikes on Syria to punish President Bashar al-Assad for his suspected use of chemical weapons against civilians.

The ship, Moskva, will take over operations from a naval unit in the region that Moscow says is needed to protect national interests. It will be joined by a destroyer from Russia's Baltic Fleet and a frigate from the Black Sea Fleet.

""The Cruiser Moskva is heading to the Gibraltar Straits. In approximately 10 days it will enter the east Mediterranean, where it will take over as the flagship of the naval task force,"" the source said.

Moscow has been Assad's most powerful ally, protecting him from consecutive U.N. security resolutions aimed at pressuring him to end violence. Russia insists the conflict must be solved through political dialogue in which Assad must take part.

Nonetheless, President Vladimir Putin, in an interview released on Wednesday, did not rule out approving a military operation if clear evidence showed Damascus had carried out the attacks, but said any attack would be illegal without U.N. support.

Last week, the Defence Ministry said new warships, including the Moskva, were being sent to the Mediterranean but described the movements as routine deployments.

Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said Russia has no intention of getting dragged into any military conflict over Syria.

Earlier this week, Interfax reported that Russia was also sending a reconnaissance ship to the region but that it would operate separately from the naval unit.

US President Barack Obama has been urged to appear in front of the European Parliament to explain the allegations that US authorities spied on EU embassies.

In a heated debate on 3 July 2013, days after new allegations of the Prism scheme surfaced, Dutch liberal MEP Sophie In 't Veld said the EU needed to secure its ""moral authority"".

""We can no longer tolerate US laws being applied directly on EU territories - I don't want to hear the arguments of national security any more,"" she stated.

Former CIA employee Edward Snowden leaked reports that claimed that US agencies were gathering millions of phone records and monitoring internet data, using a programme known as Prism.

US director of national security, James Clapper's office said information gathered under Prism was obtained under the auspices of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa).

The European United Left group has tabled a motion saying that Mr Snowden should be given asylum in the EU, with the Green group suggesting he should be given the parliament's Sakharov Prize for ""freedom of thought"".

But British Conservative MEP Timothy Kirkhope accused the European Parliament of acting as ""judge, jury and executioner, conducting a witch-hunt aimed at securing headlines rather than finding the facts"".

He also condemned as ""shameful"" calls by socialist MEPs to halt talks on developing a free trade agreement in retaliation for the spying claims.

The Greek socialist MEP Dimitrios Droutsas defended demands to block the trade deal, arguing ""we cannot sacrifice our principles on the altar of economics"".

Speaking on behalf of the European Commission, Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding said that privacy was a ""non-negotiable fundamental right"".

She said the recent allegations highlighted the need for parliament and national governments to conclude ongoing talks on creating an EU-wide data protection law as soon as possible.

On Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran has continued to develop its nuclear program, even after the election of Hassan Rouhani, whom he has labeled a “wolf in sheep’s clothing.”

“The president of Iran is trying to present a new image to the West, but advances in the nuclear program continue,” Netanyahu said during a visit to proposed new military bases in the Negev desert. “He tells us no threats will help. But the truth is that the only thing in the last 20 years that has helped stop Iran’s nuclear program were pressures and the explicit threats of military action.”

On Tuesday, Rouhani, in his first news conference since his inauguration Sunday, said Iran would not respond to threats. The new Iranian president said Iran was prepared to enter serious nuclear talks with the West, including with the United States, but would not respond to pressure tactics.

Rouhani, a former chief nuclear negotiator for Tehran, took some pointed shots at Israel’s influence in Washington without mentioning Israel specifically.

“Unfortunately, the war-mongering lobby in the U.S. is opposed to constructive [talks] and only protects the interests of the foreign regime, and often receives orders from that regime,” Rouhani told reporters in Tehran on Tuesday. “The interests of the lobby and the foreign regime have been imposed on the American lawmakers. We see that they even ignore U.S. interests.”

The change in Iran’s leadership has been a major source of concern in Israel.

Believed to be the Middle East’s only nuclear-armed power, Israel has long threatened to take military action to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb. But Netanyahu had toned down the rhetoric over the past six months.

But Rouhani’s election seems to have reinvigorated Israel’s campaign to rally international focus on Iran by threatening to take unilateral miliary action.

On Tuesday, an unnamed senior Israeli official told Israel Radio that Netanyahu’s government was losing faith in the Obama administration’s promise to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. The official cited America’s cautious approach to dealing with Syria’s alleged use of chemical weapons and said Israel cannot bank on U.S. assurances.

The official added that Israel was still capable of launching a military operation against Iran without U.S. operational support, although he acknowledged it would be less effective than a U.S. strike.

At the same time, the former head of Israel Defense Forces intelligence -- who has previously spoken out against a unilateral Israeli strike -- said Wednesday that U.S. resistance to an Israeli attack may be softening.

Advertisement

Amos Yadlin, director of the Institute for National Security Studies, a Tel Aviv think tank, told Army Radio on Wednesday that he detected a “different music” from Washington on the matter. If in 2012 the U.S. maintained “the brightest red light” on an Israeli strike, now it hasn’t perhaps changed to green, “but it’s definitely yellow.”

U.S. officials have not publicly signaled any change in their opposition to an Israeli strike, which many fear could prompt a regional war.

Advertisement

Netanyahu and others have voiced concern that Rouhani’s restrained image — a stark contrast from the provocative style of his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad — could result in a lessening of international pressure on Iran.

“Instead of leaders easy for the world to hate, now there are leaders wearing three-piece suits and a Hermes tie,” former Israeli Gen. Yoav Galant told Israel Radio on Tuesday. “But [they are] still extreme beneath a refined exterior.”

Iran says its nuclear efforts are for peaceful purposes such as energy generation and treatment of cancer patients. U.S. and Israeli officials suspect that Iran seeks to build a nuclear bomb.

Russia parliament member encourages Snowden to accept Venezuela%27s offer

Russian officials say Snowden stuck in transit area of Moscow airport

Venezuela is now waiting for answer

MOSCOW (AP) — An influential Russian parliament member who often speaks for the Kremlin encouraged NSA leaker Edward Snowden on Sunday to accept Venezuela's offer of asylum.

Alexei Pushkov, who heads the international affairs committee in Russia's parliament, posted a message on Twitter saying: ""Venezuela is waiting for an answer from Snowden. This, perhaps, is his last chance to receive political asylum.""

Venezuelan Foreign Minister Elias Jaua said Saturday his country hasn't yet been in contact with Snowden, who Russian officials say has been stuck in the transit area of Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport since arriving on a flight from Hong Kong two weeks ago. He has been unable to travel further because the U.S. annulled his passport.

Jaua said he expects to consult with Russian officials on Monday about Snowden's situation.

Pushkov's comments appeared to indicate that the Kremlin is now anxious to be rid of the former National Security Agency systems analyst, whom the U.S. wants returned to face espionage charges.

There has been no response from the Kremlin or Russian Foreign Ministry to the asylum offer made by Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro in the early hours of Saturday, Moscow time.

For Snowden to leave for South America, he would need for Venezuela to issue him travel documents and he would need to find a way to get there. The only direct commercial flight from Moscow goes to Havana, Cuba, and Snowden had booked a seat on this flight the day after arriving from Hong Kong, but failed to show up.

The Moscow-Havana flight goes over Europe and the U.S., which could cause complications. Some European countries refused to allow Bolivian President Evo Morales to fly through their airspace on his way home from Moscow last week because of suspicions that Snowden was onboard his plane.

Pushkov joked that if Snowden doesn't find shelter in Venezuela, ""he will have to stay and marry Anna Chapman,"" the redheaded Russian spy who was among 10 sleeper agents deported from the U.S. in 2010. The 31-year-old Chapman proposed to Snowden, who just turned 30, on Twitter last week.

The presidents of Bolivia and Nicaragua also said over the weekend that Snowden was welcome in their countries. Bolivia's foreign minister, David Choquehuanca, said Sunday on state television that his country hasn't yet received a formal petition for asylum from Snowden. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said his country's embassy in Moscow has received Snowden's application and is studying the request.

Snowden has applied for asylum in more than two dozen countries, including Bolivia, Nicaragua and Venezuela, according to WikiLeaks, the secret-spilling website that has been advising him.

U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he wasn't surprised that those three Latin American nations were offering asylum.

""They like sticking it to the United States,"" Menendez told NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

He also mentioned re-examining U.S. trade policies and foreign aid to any country that might take in Snowden."

Top administration officials including National Security Advisor Susan Rice, Secretary of State John F. Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel led the nearly 90-minute conference call, an unclassified session that included intelligence on the alleged use of chemical weapons by Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces in rebel-held areas of his country.

The two dozen congressional leaders were sought out “to brief them on the administration’s thinking and seek their input,” the administration said in a statement.

The conference call resulted in mixed reactions as President Obama considers the U.S. response to the alleged chemical attack in Syria last week that reportedly killed hundreds of people, many of them civilians.

“Tonight the administration failed to explain how they intend to effectively respond to the situation in Syria,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) in a statement afterward.

House Armed Services Committee Chairman Howard “Buck” McKeon (R-Santa Clarita) said he was “disappointed” the president didn’t personally address the congressional leaders.

“If the president intends to connect this directly to Assad, he needs to make that public case -- personally,” a McKeon aide said, relaying the chairman’s remarks after the session.

Several lawmakers quizzed the administration officials about the potential costs of the military campaign, an issue that House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) has also raised in his communications this week with Obama. The lawmakers were told the administration would likely seek additional funds from Congress, the McKeon aide said.

The conference call came after a difficult day for the Obama administration as key U.S. allies distanced themselves from military action against the Syrian government. The call participants also included James R. Clapper, director of national intelligence, and Adm. James Winnefeld, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

“The United States cannot be the lone sheriff of the whole world,” C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement. “The United States must be careful in how it proceeds and must act together with a coalition of countries.”

Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the nation’s security interests demand action.

“The use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime requires a decisive response. Our national security interests, those of our allies, and regional stability are at risk as Syria is disintegrating into a failed state,” Menendez said in a statement. “This is not a moment to look the other way.”

The top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Elliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), said, “The president’s national security team said that he is still weighing his options.”

Obama spoke earlier in the day to both Boehner and Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the Senate minority leader, who did not join the call.

The Democratic congressional leaders have also been in contact with the president. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has been “briefed constantly,” an aide said, including in talks with Obama, but he did not participate in Thursday’s briefing.

Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), the minority leader, who noted that Americans were “weary of war,” said during the call that she agreed with Boehner that there should be more consultation with Congress and transparency from the administration, and “that the case needs to be made to the American people.”

Even before the evening session began, lawmakers grumbled that it was insufficient.

Lawmakers have become increasingly vocal on the need for congressional authorization of military action, and more than 160 House lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, have signed letters demanding a vote in Congress.

Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said the administration needed to present the classified information to a wider group of lawmakers, “to get buy-in to the program, to go over the evidence.”

“I do think that when people see the evidence in a classified way, they’ll be convinced, like I was convinced,” Rogers said earlier Thursday on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports.”

Once released, they would be welcomed back with open arms into the Al-Qaeda terrorists groups (they've been gone a long time - who would recognize them). Then at a pre-arranged signal, they would shoot all their ""co-conspirators"" in the back.

I suppose it will be OK if Obama actually decides to ship all them GITMO loafers back home to Mohammedlands - just as long as some unknown, faceless, federal civil servant with connections to certain places makes sure they are secretly inoculated with some rapidly spreading deadly virus or two that are sure to not only knock off the newly freed GITMO miscreants, but spread into the general population where belief in Allah will soon turn sour as the populace diminishes.

So many keep saying [Obama is] a fool or he's in over his head.

Nothing could be further from the truth. He's even more dangerous to America than cigs to lungs. So he may have gotten caught, but he may still survive, the MSM will be going into cover mode. Oh, I forgot to remember to say the MSM is communist controlled.The APObama will soon get over their feigned horror about their fuhrer checking them out.

Obozo proves once again that he is qualified to be the Islamist apologist-in-chief. Worse, he is so narcissistic that he thinks all jihadists will shed their Quranic commandments because he unilaterally declared that the war is over. Obozo is a joke!

He's the most dangerous person we have ever had in the WH.

We've had communists in the WH before advising prezs.(That's how we got the UN in NY) But I don't think we've had a real communist as the topdog before .

Anti war protestors are nothing but worthless commies seeking CHANGE and World REVOLUTION and BLOOD SHED.

Our Muslim Emperor (or would that be Caliph?) is making every effort to appease his Muslim constituency. I fear for our service members and members of the diplomatic corps.

And when there is a terror attack by one of the released detainees Obumphuck and his minions will blame GWB, state we must not jump to conclusions, and give the perpetrator, if he is caught, more legal rights, protections, and coverage than the average American citizen gets.

Obama needs to clear out GITMO to make room for his real enemies: conservatives who don't swallow his brand of Kool-aid,and any reporters who dare to actually do their job and report on his crimes

The entire diplomatic corp especially those in the Middle East should resign and leave those countries immediately. They have absolutely no support from the WH and the Department of State.

Sure we can give the Gitmo detainees 30 billion dollars each and set them free, no problem.We already know what becomes of those already released. Like with Clinton, this will be a problem for the next guy.

Obama needs a distraction. Americans who die in the future at the hands of released terrorists are sacrificial lambs for Obama narcissistic altar.

If that was a Hollywood script, it would be a stupid Hollywood script.But if Muslims did that to Americans, it would be worse than Hitler, right?He was totally busted saying ""act of terror"" when he should've said ""terrorist act"". But the MSM will cover for him and protect him from impeachment!Nah, he first killed off most of Al Qaeda's top leadership. Unlike the last guy to unilaterally declare ""mission accomplished"".I thought he was a Jihadist?Anti-war people want war?Here's an idea? Don't cut the diplomatic security budget. Give ol' Paul Ryan a call on that one, would you?You mean they'll get OJ Simpson's lawyers?Right! By ""closing Gitmo"", he actually meant ""keep Gitmo open"". Sucks how conservatives have cracked out code!The same State Department that warned that cuts to diplomatic security would harm national security?

Sanger'],U.S. Accuses China’s Military in Cyberattacks,"But the Pentagon report describes something far more sophisticated: a China that has now leapt into the first ranks of offensive cybertechnologies. It is investing in electronic warfare capabilities in an effort to blind American satellites and other space assets, and hopes to use electronic and traditional weapons systems to gradually push the United States military presence into the mid-Pacific nearly 2,000 miles from China’s coast.

The report argues that China’s first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, commissioned last September, is the first of several carriers the country plans to deploy over the next 15 years. It said the carrier would not reach “operational effectiveness” for three or four years, but is already set to operate in the East and South China Seas, the site of China’s territorial disputes with several neighbors, including Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. The report notes a new carrier base under construction in Yuchi.

The report also detailed China’s progress in developing its stealth aircraft, first tested in January 2011.

Three months ago the Obama administration would not officially confirm reports in The New York Times, based in large part on a detailed study by the computer security firm Mandiant, that identified P.L.A. Unit 61398 near Shanghai as the likely source of many of the biggest thefts of data from American companies and some government institutions.

Until Monday, the strongest critique of China had come from Thomas E. Donilon, the president’s national security adviser, who said in a speech at the Asia Society in March that American companies were increasingly concerned about “cyberintrusions emanating from China on an unprecedented scale,” and that “the international community cannot tolerate such activity from any country.” He stopped short of blaming the Chinese government for the espionage.

But government officials said the overall issue of cyberintrusions would move to the center of the United States-China relationship, and it was raised on recent trips to Beijing by Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey.

To bolster its case, the report argues that cyberweapons have become integral to Chinese military strategy. It cites two major public works of military doctrine, “Science of Strategy” and “Science of Campaigns,” saying they identify “information warfare (I.W.) as integral to achieving information superiority and an effective means for countering a stronger foe.” But it notes that neither document “identifies the specific criteria for employing a computer network attack against an adversary,” though they “advocate developing capabilities to compete in this medium.”"

Not so much,"CARACAS, Venezuela -- Does Edward Snowden know what he’d be getting into if he ends up gaining asylum here? Many Venezuelans doubt it.

The former National Security Agency contractor remains in Russia seeking at least temporary asylum. But leaders in Venezuela, Bolivia and Nicaragua have to varying degrees said they would be willing to take him in if he can work out a way to get to those countries.

Venezuelans interviewed in recent days say they have more pressing concerns than taking in Snowden, who is wanted by the U.S. government on espionage charges for having leaked details of the government’s efforts to monitor email and voice communications.

“It would be better for Venezuela if he stayed far away,” said 57-year-old Caracas bus driver Sergio Chacon.

“But if they do bring him, all I ask is that he keep his mouth shut and not live off the money of Venezuelans,” Chacon said. “I believe his only intention would be to bother people.”

Said real estate agent Beatriz Monterola, 69: “The government offered asylum just to stick it to the U.S., but Snowden would only bring more headaches than the ones we already have.”

Snowden has been stuck in the transit zone of Moscow’s Sheremetyevo International Airport since June 23. On July 9, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro became the first foreign leader to formally offer him asylum, a move that was later matched by the two other countries. All three are all left-leaning governments and frequent critics of U.S. foreign policy.

Some analysts have suggested Maduro was trying to divert Venezuelans’ attention from problems on the home front, including rampant violent crime, scarcities, high inflation and a stagnant economy.

“The asylum offer was a failed attempt to try to change the political agenda,” said political scientist Jose Vicente Carrasquero. “But when people suffer for their basic subsistence, it’s not so easy to divert their attention.”

Yelicer Hernandez, a 33-year-old apartment building concierge in an upscale Caracas neighborhood, said he was willing to give Maduro the benefit of the doubt.

“If President Maduro offers him asylum, it’s so [Snowden] can find a secure place to live, and we will welcome him here,” Hernandez said.

But several people interviewed at random this week in Caracas had no idea who Snowden was. And among those who did, many were concerned that Venezuela would be needlessly involving itself in an international dispute with an uncertain outcome.

“It’s up to the U.S. and Russia to resolve the situation of this guy in the airport,” said 23-year-old university mathematics student Arturo Marcano.

Computer student Maria Cristina Perez, 22, said Snowden’s arrival might only aggravate Venezuelans’ problems.

“The United States is a powerful country that could carry out reprisals for giving asylum to someone they consider a traitor,” she said. “An economic blockade would make scarcities more acute when we have enough problems as it is.”

Columnist Daniel Lansberg-Rodriguez wrote in El Universal, a Caracas newspaper that frequently opposes government policies, that offering asylum to Snowden was hypocritical because the government pressures opposition politicians, judges and news media in Venezuela.

“Who are they to sermonize to the rest of the world on human rights?” Lansberg-Rodriguez wrote.

Caracas hairdresser Jose Molina, 28, said some Venezuelans had become political refugees in other countries to escape persecution at home merely for having opposed the government.

“Everyone has the right to ask for asylum when their life is in danger, but this Mr. Snowden committed a crime, betrayed his country, and should face the consequences,” Molina said.

Andres Schmucke wrote a humorous column in El Universal wondering how Snowden would cope with rampant crime and scarcities.

“He could spend the mornings looking for flour and toilet paper,” Schmucke wrote. “Ha! Welcome to Venezuela, gringo!”

http://news.yahoo.com/reported-syria-attack-tests-us-hope-avoid-war-175903340.html,,[],Reported Syria attack tests US hope to avoid war,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Obama administration searched for answers Wednesday about a reported chemical weapons attack in Syria that would mark the most flagrant violation yet of the U.S. ""red line"" for potential military action. But the possibility of intervention seemed ever smaller after America's top general offered a starkly pessimistic assessment of options.

Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a letter this week to a congressman that the administration is opposed to even limited action in Syria because it believes rebels fighting the Assad government wouldn't support American interests if they seized power.

Dempsey said the U.S. military is clearly capable of taking out Assad's air force and shifting the balance of the war toward the armed opposition. But such an approach would plunge the U.S. into the war without offering any strategy for ending what has become a sectarian fight, he said.

On Wednesday, Syrian anti-Assad activists accused the government of carrying out a toxic gas attack in the eastern suburbs of Damascus, killing at least 100 people including children. The claims coincided with a visit by a U.N. chemical weapons team to three previous sites of alleged attacks. Syrian President Bashar Assad's government rejected the accusations, and U.S. officials said they were seeking details of what happened.

For the United States, the death toll and painful images again put a spotlight on President Barack Obama's pledge almost exactly a year ago to respond forcefully to any chemical weapons use by the Assad government. Since then, the administration has said it has confirmed that Syrian forces have committed such attacks, and the U.S. has ordered a lethal aid package of small arms to be sent to some rebel groups, though it's unclear what if any weapons have been delivered.

Yet up to now, Obama has refused all options of direct U.S. military intervention in a civil war that has killed more than 100,000 people and displaced millions.

Story continues

""The United States is deeply concerned by reports that hundreds of Syrian civilians have been killed in an attack by Syrian government forces, including by the use of chemical weapons,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Wednesday.

""We are working urgently to gather additional information,"" Earnest said, adding that Washington has asked for U.N. investigators to be granted access to the area of the fighting. He made no mention of possible consequences if chemical weapons use is confirmed.

Obama has stated that he doesn't want to be drawn into another Mideast conflict after a decade of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, and polling suggests he has the public's support on that.

Dempsey, in his letter, said, ""Syria today is not about choosing between two sides but rather about choosing one among many sides,"" In the Aug. 19 letter to Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., he said, ""It is my belief that the side we choose must be ready to promote their interests and ours when the balance shifts in their favor. Today, they are not.""

Despite Dempsey's assessment of the forces fighting Assad, Obama recognized the Syrian opposition coalition as ""the legitimate representative"" of the Syrian people more than eight months ago. And Secretary of State John Kerry has repeatedly backed the moderate vision promoted by Salim Idris, the rebel military chief.

But the more than 50 distinct rebel groups fighting to end the Assad family's four-decade dynasty range wildly in political beliefs and not all are interested in Western support.

As the conflict has dragged on, al-Qaida-linked rebels and other extremist groups have been responsible for some of the same types of massacres and ethnic attacks that the Assad government is accused of. On Tuesday, Kurdish militias battled against al-Qaida-linked fighters in the northeast in fighting that has fueled a mass exodus of refugees into Iraq and risks exploding into a full-blown side conflict.

Dempsey said Syria was experiencing ""a deeply rooted, long-term conflict among multiple factions and violent struggles for power"" that will continue after Assad's rule ends.

His letter to Engel was a follow-up to the sharp examination he faced in July from the Senate Armed Services Committee as part of his reconfirmation.

Dempsey sent a letter afterward saying the establishment of a no-fly zone to protect the Syrian rebels would require hundreds of U.S. aircraft, cost as much as $1 billion a month and offer no assurance of changing the war's momentum. He also discouraged training of rebel groups, limited strikes on Syria's air defenses or creating a buffer zone for the opposition, citing the high costs involved and risks such as lost U.S. aircraft.

Engel, an advocate of more forceful U.S. action, proposed the use of cruise missiles and other weapons against Syrian government-controlled air bases in an Aug. 5 letter to Dempsey. The congressman said strikes could ground Assad's air force and reduce weapons flow to his government from Iran and Russia, while costing less to U.S. taxpayers and requiring no American troops in Syrian territory or airspace.

Dempsey said this approach wouldn't tip the balance against Assad and wouldn't solve the deeper problems plaguing Syria.

""The loss of Assad's air force would negate his ability to attack opposition forces from the air, but it would also escalate and potentially further commit the United States to the conflict,"" Dempsey said. ""It would not be militarily decisive, but it would commit us decisively to the conflict.""

Instead, he spoke in favor of an expansion of the Obama administration's current policy.

The U.S. can provide far greater humanitarian assistance and, if asked, do more to bolster a moderate opposition in Syria. Such an approach ""represents the best framework for an effective U.S. strategy toward Syria,"" Dempsey said."

Joint military exercises had been scheduled for next month

Obama deplores violence in Egypt%2C but does not suspend all aid

Situation in Cairo is complex%2C Obama says

President Obama has canceled U.S.-Egyptian military exercises and suggested that aid cuts could be coming if Egypt's military government does not stop its bloody crackdown on protesters and move quickly to new elections.

He told reporters Thursday that his government ""strongly condemns"" the violence in Egypt. At the same time, however, he said continued U.S. ""engagement"" with the interim government in Cairo will help it transition back to democracy.

""But while we want to sustain our relationship with Egypt, our traditional cooperation cannot continue as usual when civilians are being killed in the streets and rights are being rolled back,"" Obama said from his vacation home at Martha's Vineyard. The death toll now is at least 600.

Some lawmakers and policy analysts are urging the Obama administration to cut off aid to Egypt now.

""While President Obama condemns the violence in Egypt, his administration continues to send billions of taxpayer dollars to help pay for it,"" said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky, a potential Republican presidential candidate in 2016.

The president did not describe the military's removal of President Mohammed Morsi last month as ""a coup,"" a declaration that would require ending U.S. aid to Egypt that adds up to about $1.3 billion a year.

Obama spoke a day after Egypt's interim government used force to clear encampments created by backers of Morsi. The action triggered violent clashes throughout the country, as the government has declared a nationwide state of emergency and a nighttime curfew.

Calling Morsi's removal an obvious coup, Paul said: ""Mr. President, stop skirting the issue, follow the law, and cancel all foreign aid to Egypt.""

Isobel Coleman, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said a suspension of military aid is long overdue and may the only real leverage the Obama administration has over Egypt.

Obama's cancellation of military exercises is only ""an incremental step that's really too little, too late at this point,"" Coleman said.

The United States and Egypt had joint military maneuvers known as ""Bright Star"" scheduled for mid-September. Obama said they cannot go on given the violence that has claimed so many lives and injured thousands more.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said he spoke with his Egyptian counterpart about the canceled maneuvers, and added that ""the United States has made it clear that the Egyptian government must refrain from violence, respect freedom of assembly and move toward an inclusive political transition.""

Obama, who met with his national security team on Thursday, said he has asked aides to assess ""further steps we may take"" if Egypt's interim government does not honor pledges to conduct new elections as soon as possible and restore a democratic government.

""Let me say that the Egyptian people deserve better than what we've seen over the last several days,"" Obama said. ""And, to the Egyptian people, let me say the cycle of violence and escalation needs to stop.""

The State Department, meanwhile, sent out a travel advisory urging tourists to avoid Egypt and to leave the country if they are already there.

The two sides in Egypt are offering vastly different estimates of the death toll. The government says more than 600 have died in the violence; the Muslim Brotherhood, the organization that includes Morsi, puts the death count at more than 2,500.

In his brief remarks to reporters, Obama made clear he does not want to cut ties to Egypt, saying its relationship with the United States ""goes back decades."" The U.S. has long seen Egypt as a bulwark of stability in the Middle East, and treasures its peace treaty with Israel, he said.

Obama applauded the desire of the Egyptian people for freedom and democracy and said he has long known that change would not come ""quickly or easily.

The U.S. also appreciates ""the complexity"" of the current situation in Egypt, he said.

The Morsi government, while democratically elected, ""was not inclusive and did not respect the views of all Egyptians,"" Obama said, noting that millions of citizens supported his removal.

While the interim military government promised a restoration of democracy, Obama said that it has now taken ""a more dangerous path"" that includes ""arbitrary arrests, a broad crackdown on Mr. Morsi's associations and supporters, and now, tragically, violence that's taken the lives of hundreds of people and wounded thousands more.""

In the past, Bright Star military exercises involving the U.S. and Egypt have been held every two years, though the 2011 exercises were canceled because of that year's removal of President Hosni Mubarak.

Bright Star exercises began in 1980, a product of the Camp David Peace Accords. The last time it was held, in 2009, some 5,000 U.S. troops took part, along with military units from Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Jordan, Kuwait, Pakistan, Turkey and Great Britain.

Members of both the interim government and Morsi supporters have accused the Obama administration of supporting the other side, but Obama said the United States isn't taking any side.

""We want a peaceful, democratic, prosperous Egypt,"" Obama said. ""That's our interest. But to achieve that, the Egyptians are going to have to do the work.""

After his speech, Obama played golf at Mink Meadows Golf Club. He is scheduled to return from his week-long vacation on Martha's Vineyard on Sunday.

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/opinion/sunday/how-to-play-well-with-china.html,2013-06-02 00:00:00,"['Ian Bremmer', 'Jon M. Huntsman Jr.']",How to Play Well With China - The New York Times,"For instance, China won’t sharply reduce greenhouse gas emissions because it fears that slower production could put millions of Chinese workers on the streets. And it won’t play a major role in propping up the teetering euro zone if doing so requires them to work with governments other than Germany, whose stability it trusts. And it won’t change its position on Taiwan, Tibet or Tiananmen Square.

But there are things China can and will do if the United States offers some incentives that China wants and needs.

China would happily produce a document that Mr. Xi could brag about at home, while accepting responsibility for only a carefully negotiated set of mutually profitable projects. A new communiqué should therefore include negotiated agreements on the joint development of clean energy technologies, cooperation in scientific research and coordinated strategies to mitigate conflict in the developing world.

It’s not a sign of weakness that Washington can’t force China’s leaders to change course on issues they consider central to their national security. Naming and shaming can be an important foreign policy tool. But China will never change its approach on these core issues because of America’s objections, and we can’t allow criticism to drown out calls for cooperation in other areas.

So Mr. Obama shouldn’t expect much movement on issues like Tibet, territorial disputes between China and its neighbors in the East and South China Seas, and a range of human rights issues. Mr. Obama can commit the United States to a frank approach, one that acknowledges China’s core interests, and where appropriate, allows Washington to act as an honest broker.

America and China already enjoy an enormously profitable trade and investment relationship. In 1985, trade between the countries amounted to just $7.7 billion. By 2000, the total reached $116 billion, and in 2012, it surged to $536 billion, putting America and China on track to build the largest trade relationship in history. But certain moves by both sides have eroded trust.

The Obama administration has worked to build momentum behind the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a colossal trade deal involving a host of Pacific Rim countries. China sees the partnership as a move to isolate it and won’t join because it would force Beijing to open areas of its economy that are not ready to withstand competitive pressures. But this does not mean that China must see it as a threat. Those who join should continue to build new commercial ties with China to help assuage the fear that the partnership is designed specifically to isolate China."

Brinley Bruton', 'Staff Writer', 'Nbc News']",Snowden hunt: Bolivia complains to UN over 'abduction' of its president,"Bolivia said it would complain to the United Nations Wednesday over the ""abduction"" of its president, Evo Morales, whose plane was grounded amid a false rumor that NSA leaker Edward Snowden was on board.

The country reacted with fury to the enforced diversion of the plane, saying international law had been violated and that it would file a formal complaint to the U.N. Human Rights Commission.

Morales' jet took off from Vienna, Austria, on Wednesday morning almost 14 hours after they say was forced to land there because France, Portugal, Italy and Spain all denied it access to their airspace.

The aircraft was taking Morales home from Russia, where he had met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit for gas exporters. No unauthorized people were found on board.

“We want to tell Bolivians, we want to tell the world, that President Evo Morales, our president, the president of all Bolivians, was kidnapped in Europe today,"" Vice President Alvaro García Linera said late Tuesday in front of the official presidential residence in the capital, La Paz. ""We want to say to the nations of the world that President Evo Morales has been abducted by imperialism and is being held in Europe.”

In a statement from aboard his presidential plane Wednesday, Morales underlined the indignation and fury felt at the highest levels of the Bolivian government, and made a thinly-veiled attack on Western powers.

“I feel this was an excuse to frighten, intimidate and punish me. More than anything, an excuse to try and silence us on the struggle against the politics of plunder, invasion and domination,” president Morales said.

The statement added that Morales’ life was put in grave danger when Portugal and France stopped his plane at the last minute.

“I don’t understand why France, Italia, Portugal and Spain would say ... that they were stopping me because I was taking a certain Edward Snowden,” he said.

Snowden was ""no suitcase that could be taken aboard a plane"" and flown to Bolivia, the statement added.

Cuba echoed his comments, denouncing the international decision to divert Morales' flight as ""inadmissible, unfounded and arbitrary.""

""Cuba calls on the international community to mobilize against these violations of international law and human rights,"" said a foreign ministry statement that was issued late Tuesday and carried by state media on Wednesday, according to Reuters.

Earlier on Wednesday, Morales told journalists in the Vienna airport who asked about the delay that officials were ""surely consulting with their friend, and their friend must be the United States.""

The Morales government already has a strained relationship with the U.S. In September 2008, his administration expelled the U.S. ambassador along with DEA agents and USAID officials.

And in April 2009, Morales said he suspected U.S. intelligence was behind an attempt to assassinate him at a hotel. Police commandos shot dead three men in a hotel room in the eastern city of Santa Cruz, which was said to be the base for plot to stage a coup. The U.S. denies his claims.

Sacha Llorentty Solíz, Bolivia's ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters in Geneva that Austria's move was an act of aggression and a violation of international law.

A tweet posted on the official Twitter page of the Austrian foreign ministry read: ""Rumors claiming that Snowden was on board the plane of President Morales that landed in Vienna are not correct.""

A senior U.S. official said there was no indication Tuesday that Snowden was anywhere but still in the transit area of a Moscow airport. When asked if it was possible Snowden had managed to leave the country on a foreign official's plane, the official said: ""I've heard nothing remotely like that.""

The incident was the latest turn in 30-year-old Snowden's attempt to evade the United States since he spilled details of a secret American government surveillance program called Prism.

Jill Dougherty', 'Tom Cohen']",Hagel: 'We're ready to go' if ordered on Syria chemical weapons,"Washington (CNN) -- With a flurry of comments and activity, U.S. officials sought Tuesday to lay the groundwork for a military strike in Syria -- though some in Washington are pushing back.

The moves by top members of President Barack Obama's administration come less than a week after rebels claim more than 1,300 people were killed in a Syrian government, most of them dying from use of chemical weapons.

The White House offered legal justification for a strike, with spokesman Jay Carney telling reporters the large-scale use of chemical weapons in Syria presented a national security threat to the United States that required a response.

Carney said Obama had yet to make a final decision on how to respond to what U.S. officials characterize as the worst chemical weapons attack since former Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein launched a poison gas attack that killed thousands of Kurds in 1988.

The president continues to review options, Carney said, adding ""nothing has been decided."" Carney assured reporters some sort of response will come.

""Allowing the use of chemical weapons on a significant scale to take place without a response would present a significant challenge to or threat to the United States' national security,"" he said.

Vice President Joe Biden made clear the administration's view of who was to blame, telling the American Legion that ""there is no doubt who is responsible for the heinous use of chemical weapons -- the Syrian regime.""

On the same day Obama talked with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and UK Prime MInister David Cameron, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and Secretary of State John Kerry consulted allies and indicated potentially imminent action by a coalition likely to include key NATO partners and regional powers.

The United States has already moved warships armed with cruise missiles into the region. Hagel told the BBC on Tuesday that forces were ready to carry out a strike if ordered. A senior Defense Department official told CNN that any strike could be completed ""within several days.""

""We are ready to go, like that,"" Hagel told the BBC, adding that ""the options are there, the United States Department of Defense is ready to carry out those options.""

Syria warns West amid growing talk of military strike

White House: No decision yet

Options available to Obama range from ordering limited missile strikes to continued diplomatic efforts labeled by critics as a ""do-nothing"" approach.

The White House has ruled out sending ground troops to Syria or implementing a no-fly zone to blunt al-Assad's aerial superiority over rebels fighting to oust his regime.

On Monday, Carney said that the first step toward a military response in Syria would be the public release of a U.S. intelligence report on the August 21 event near Damascus that reportedly killed and wounded thousands.

A U.S. official who was not authorized to speak on the record told CNN that release of the intelligence report was planned for Tuesday, but Carney later said it would come out some time this week.

Another official told CNN the intelligence report would include forensic evidence and intercepted communications among Syrian military commanders.

Yet there's been some debate, within the administration, over what information should be released. The CIA and other intelligence agencies, for instance, have argued there was no need, and perhaps harm, in divulging details, two U.S. officials told CNN's Evan Perez.

One of the officials noted that the U.S. conclusion that the Syrian government was responsible, as expressed by Biden and Kerry, made releasing underlying intelligence superfluous.

Carney said Tuesday there was ""no doubt"" in the administration that chemical weapons were used by the al-Assad government, telling reporters that ""we see no evidence of any alternative scenario.""

For almost two years, Obama has avoided direct military involvement in Syria's civil war, only escalating aid to rebel fighters in June after suspected smaller-scale chemical weapons attacks by Syrian government forces.

However, last week's attack obliterated the ""red line"" Obama set just over a year ago against the use of Syria's chemical weapons stocks.

Opinion: How Al-Assad used chemical weapons to poison debate

Legislator: Congress can't 'be pushed aside'

Yet some in Congress say that before Obama orders any strike, they should go through them first.

A group of 31 Republican and six Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday sent a letter to the president urging him ""to consult and receive authorization"" before authorizing any such military action.

""Any U.S. military action could bring serious consequences or further escalation,"" said Rep. Ed Royce, a California Republican who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee and was not among the letter's initial signatories. ""The president should be making the case to the American public, and his administration should come to Congress to explain their plans.

""The consequences are too great for Congress to be pushed aside.""

Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican and influential member of the House Homeland Security Committee, said the U.S. response to the Syria situation will influence another regional proliferation issue -- Iran's potential development of nuclear weapons.

Obama ""time and again has basically said that Iran will not be allowed to have nuclear weapons, that's the red line,"" King told CNN on Monday, adding that failure to enforce a similar threat against Syria on chemical weapons would undermine the president.

""This is as much a warning to Iran as I see it, as it is action against Syria,"" King said.

Even some in Obama's own party are cautioning against action that's not suitably inclusive. Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island told CNN on Monday the United States should only act in concert with an international coalition from at least NATO allies and Arab League members.

""Without their participation, it looks as if this is just a Western-vs.-Islamic struggle. It's not,"" said Reed, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""This is to vindicate a basic rule of international law that these weapons will not be used, not by Iran, not by any power.""

Reed said the most realistic option would be cruise missiles launched from U.S. Navy ships at sea, noting that ""we can have precision weapons that could be fired and keep our aircraft out of Syrian airspace and away from their anti-aircraft systems.""

""The most effective targets would have command-and-control, because you could send a signal to the Syrian regime that if they don't agree to international standards, if they don't make it clear and make it obvious that they're not going to use these weapons, and that we can inflict additional damage on their command-and-control,"" he added.

Earlier, a senior administration official said that assuming Obama decides to go ahead with a military response, any action could come as early as mid-week.

Factors weighing into the timing of any action include a desire to get it done before the president leaves for Russia next week for a summit with G8 allies, and before the administration has to make a decision on whether to suspend aid to Egypt because of the ongoing political turmoil there, the official explained.

Why Jordan wants military meeting to be hush-hush

American officials are consulting with allies to ensure they are supportive of any U.S. action, which the senior administration official said would be very limited in scope and a direct reaction to the use of chemical weapons. Representatives of three allied governments involved in those top-level consultations said the goal is to reach a consensus as soon as possible.

""No one is talking about a long process,"" one European diplomat told CNN.

Russia, China opposition make U.N. action unlikely

While U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Monday that the use of chemical weapons was a crime against humanity and must be punished, certain opposition by Syrian ally Russia and possibly China undermined the possibility that the Security Council would support a military mission.

Instead, a limited coalition of NATO partners such as Germany, France and Britain -- all of which have called for action against Syria -- and some Arab League members appeared more likely to provide political backing for Obama to order U.S. missile strikes.

Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, said Kerry spoke Monday with his British, Jordanian, Qatari and Saudi counterparts, as well as the secretary-general of the Arab League.

The diplomatic efforts appeared to be working, with an Arab League spokesman condemning the al-Assad regime Tuesday for the chemical attack.

Opinion: For U.S., Syria is truly a problem from hell

In another move, the United States postponed its involvement in talks scheduled for this week in Geneva on seeking a political solution to the Syrian civil war. Russia expressed disappointment at the U.S. decision and warned against any Western military strike on Syria.

Last month, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey provided Congress with a list of declassified U.S. military options for Syria that emphasized the high costs and risks of what he said would amount to ""an act of war"" at a time of deep budget cuts.

Dempsey's letter, dated July 19, listed U.S. assets in the region including Patriot missile defense batteries in Turkey and Jordan, as well as F-16 jet fighters positioned to defend Jordan from possible cross-border trouble. In addition, the Pentagon has sent four warships armed with cruise missiles to the region.

U.S. official: Almost no doubt al-Assad regime used chemical weapons

According to U.S. officials, updated options offered to the president in recent days included:

• Cruise missiles fired from one of four Navy destroyers deployed in the Mediterranean Sea. The missiles would be used to strike ""command and control"" facilities such as command bunkers, or the Syrian regime's means of delivering chemical weapons: artillery batteries and launchers. There is no indication that the missiles would strike actual chemical weapons stockpiles.

• Military jets firings weapons from outside Syrian airspace. This option carries additional risks and is considered less likely.

Chemical weapons inspectors reach alleged attack site

To Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, the situation is forcing Obama to shift from being an ""avoider-in-chief"" regarding military involvement in Syria.

""It's almost inevitable that the president will authorize some form of military action,"" Miller told National Public Radio in an interview broadcast Monday.

He said he expected a significant response that amounts to ""a warning that lays down this time a red line that the president intends to enforce, not one that turns pink.""

""It cannot simply be a couple of cruise missiles into a storage shed somewhere,"" Miller said, adding that the goal was to deter al-Assad rather than topple him or radically shift the balance in Syria at this time. ""The president's not on the verge of becoming the cavalry to rescue the country.""

Though American officials said they remained concerned about the invective flowing from North Korea — and South Korea’s president ordered military commanders to carry out a swift and strong response to any provocations — the Obama administration took pains to emphasize the “disconnect” between Mr. Kim’s “rhetoric and action.”

The White House’s strategy, officials said, was calculated to ease tensions after a fraught few days in which Mr. Kim threatened to rain missiles on the American mainland and the United States responded by flying nuclear-capable bombers over the Korean Peninsula.

“We are not seeing changes to the North Korean military posture such as large-scale mobilizations or positioning of forces,” said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary. “What that disconnect between rhetoric and action means, I’ll leave to the analysts to judge.”"

Iran does not see itself as vanquished. Its political system is still the most steadfast and resilient in the region. It is reveling in a newfound stability on the back of a surprisingly smooth presidential election. There were no street protests in Tehran this year, like those that paralyzed Tehran in 2009, Cairo in 2011 and Istanbul earlier this year. Indeed, Mr. Rouhani’s government, by freeing political prisoners and potentially relaxing controls on the press and social media, is showing its confidence.

Arab anger notwithstanding, there is agreement across the region that Iranian support for Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, has been effective. That consensus buttresses Iran’s claim to regional power and influence. Syria has showed Iran to be the only regional actor capable of successfully running a war in another country — and one with which it does not share a border. Iran has given the Assad regime money and weapons, deployed fighters in Syria and created a regional alliance with the Shiite government in Iraq and its proxy militia Hezbollah in Lebanon to help Mr. Assad. The West thinks of Russia as Mr. Assad’s vital ally, but it is Iran that holds the cards to his survival.

Hope that Turkey and America’s Arab allies would form an alliance that would isolate Iran has not come to pass. Those allies have been divided over what to do with Egypt, and now Syria. Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey are bickering over whom to support in Syria. Saudi support for Egypt’s generals, who ousted the democratically elected Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in July, has alienated Turkey, which supported Mr. Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood, now outlawed. For decades the Persian Gulf monarchies bought the support of the Muslim Brotherhood. Now the Islamists and the gulf rulers are competing for support of the Sunni Arab world. This gives Iran a strategic opportunity to exploit its role as a regional power broker.

Iran’s main nemesis, however, remains the United States. America’s withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan, and its strategic “pivot” toward Asia, have been welcome news in Tehran. American standing in the region has taken a toll with the Obama administration’s decision not to enforce its own red line against Syria’s use of chemical weapons. That created an opening for Iran’s chief ally, Russia, to play a critical role at the United Nations as a diplomatic broker.

Meanwhile, after Mr. Obama’s historic (though brief) phone conversation with Mr. Rouhani, pressure from Israel led Mr. Obama to reiterate, after meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, that he would not rule out the use of force to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. Mr. Netanyahu went before the United Nations to call Mr. Rouhani “a wolf in sheep’s clothing.”"

In the latest ratcheting up of the administration’s effort to stop Congress from adding to existing sanctions, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Americans are in a deeply antiwar mood and implied that voters might turn their anger on lawmakers if a failure of diplomacy leads to military action to prevent Iran from getting the bomb.

“The American people do not want a march to war,” Carney told reporters.

“The American people justifiably and understandably prefer a peaceful solution that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and this agreement, if it’s achieved, has the potential to do that,” he said, referring to the deal that the U.S. and five other nations have been negotiating with Iran. “The alternative is military action.”

The administration has been lobbying against new sanctions on Iran since last summer, contending they could drive Tehran from the negotiating table or splinter the international coalition that has been cooperating on sanctions, which are designed to convince Tehran it should to accept limits on its nuclear program. New economic penalties, on top of years of earlier sanctions, could also strengthen hard-liners in Tehran who want to see the collapse of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s diplomatic initiative, officials warn.

Many nations fear Iran is seeking a nuclear weapons capability, despite its contention that it is seeking peaceful applications of nuclear energy.

Diplomats from the U.S., France, China, Russia, Germany and Britain said they had been unable to seal a preliminary deal with Iran during weekend talks in Geneva aimed at launching comprehensive negotiations on Tehran’s nuclear program. They said lower-level officials would return to Geneva on Nov. 20 to resume efforts to end the diplomatic stalemate.

Many U.S. lawmakers of both parties have spurned the administration’s appeals. Some members of Congress believe that the two rounds of international negotiations since mid-October have shown the administration is ready to accept too lenient a deal, and they want to sharply step up pressure on Iran.

The administration intensified its lobbying effort this week. Vice President Joe Biden called Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), and Secretary of State John F. Kerry plans to meet in closed session Wednesday with members of the Senate Banking Committee, which is weighing legislation that would mirror sanctions approved by the House in August.

Kerry will ask for a “temporary pause” in sanctions to make sure that “our legislative strategy and our negotiating strategy are running hand in hand,” Jen Psaki, a State Department spokeswoman, said Tuesday.

Suzanne Maloney, an Iran specialist at the Brookings Institution’s Saban Center, said the White House warning about antiwar sentiment is effective. But the alternative to diplomacy “is not war, it’s lousier diplomatic options,” she tweeted.

Such a change under the new president, Hassan Rouhani, would be a significant departure for Iran in the nuclear talks. Mr. Rouhani, a moderate cleric who won the presidency in June over his more conservative rivals, has pledged to reduce tensions with the West over the nuclear issue, which has left Iran increasingly isolated and economically troubled by punitive sanctions.

Mr. Rouhani’s choice for foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, was confirmed by Parliament last week. The signals that Mr. Zarif would lead the nuclear negotiations were conveyed on Tuesday at a regular weekly news conference in Tehran by the Foreign Ministry spokesman, which was broadcast by Iran’s Press TV Web site.

“Over the past 10 to 12 years, the negotiator has been the secretary of the Supreme National Security Council. This may change,” said the spokesman, Abbas Araqchi. “Rouhani may decide to appoint somebody else. Maybe the foreign minister, or anyone else that he deems fit.”"

Snowden was en route to a “third country,” officials in the Chinese territory said. The South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong newspaper that had repeated contact with the American during his month-long stay in the city, reported that Snowden left on a flight bound for Moscow.

Russia’s ITAR-Tass news agency, citing an unidentified Aeroflot airlines official, said Snowden would fly from Moscow to Cuba on Monday and then on to Venezuela. Last week, Iceland had also been mentioned as a possible destination for Snowden.

Exactly how Snowden’s departure was arranged was unclear, but WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has praised him as a “hero,” and according to the organization’s Twitter feed, Snowden was accompanied on the flight to Russia by WikiLeaks legal advisors.

“WikiLeaks has assisted Mr. Snowden’s political asylum in a democratic country, travel papers and safe exit from Hong Kong,” the group said.

U.S. authorities are seeking to prosecute Snowden for disclosing to the media a trove of documents detailing secret American surveillance programs. On Friday, U.S. authorities revealed that Snowden had been charged with theft of government property and two violations of the Espionage Act: unauthorized communication of national defense information and providing U.S. classified intelligence to an unauthorized person.

Hong Kong officials said Sunday that U.S. authorities had asked Hong Kong to issue a provisional arrest warrant for Snowden but that without “sufficient information to process the request for provisional warrant of arrest, there is no legal basis to restrict Mr. Snowden from leaving Hong Kong.”

Hong Kong authorities said they had informed the U.S. government of Snowden’s departure and said they would continue to seek details from Washington about Snowden’s revelations that U.S. hacking activities had targeted facilities in Hong Kong.

Snowden’s departure from Hong Kong offered authorities in both the semi-autonomous Chinese territory and Beijing a face-saving if inelegant solution to a complicated situation that threatened to strain relations for years had Snowden exercised his various rights to appeal or applied for asylum.

Hong Kong, a former British territory, has a treaty with the U.S. that allows for extraditions; however, mainland officials are allowed to intervene in cases that they determine concern foreign policy or national defense.

Willy Lam, a political analyst at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said it was “highly likely” that Beijing authorities had instructed Hong Kong officials not to surrender Snowden.

“The decision was basically made in Beijing not to send him to the U.S.,” Lam said. “Hong Kong was seeking a politically expedient way out before the legal procedures started. What the Hong Kong government said is that they received Washington’s request but were seeking more info. But they haven’t gotten it. So the pretext was that they have no legal reason to detain him.”

Advertisement

“This is a sort of a clever way out for the Hong Kong government to avoid getting into a more difficult situation,” Lam added.

Simon N.M. Young, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong who has been closely monitoring Snowden’s case, called Hong Kong’s decision to allow the departure “a shocker.”

“I thought he was going to stay and fight it out,” Young said. “The U.S. government will be irate with their Hong Kong counterparts. They may even question whether the Hong Kong government was acting in good faith pursuant to their treaty obligations.”

Opposition to extraditing Snowden from Hong Kong had been building both in the city and on the mainland over the last several weeks. A public opinion poll last weekend in the city of 7 million found about half of respondents did not favor sending him back to the United States for prosecution.

An editorial last week in the Global Times, a Beijing newspaper with close ties to the Communist Party, inveighed against extraditing Snowden, saying “it would be a face-losing outcome for both the Hong Kong government and the Chinese central government if Snowden is extradited back to the U.S. Unlike a common criminal, Snowden did not hurt anybody. His ‘crime’ is that he blew the whistle on the U.S. government’s violation of civil rights.”

“His whistle-blowing is in the global public interest,” the commentary added. “Therefore, extraditing Snowden back to the U.S. would not only be a betrayal of Snowden’s trust, but a disappointment for expectations around the world. The image of Hong Kong would be forever tarnished.”

In Hong Kong, support for Snowden hinged both on Hong Kong’s historic status as a refuge for dissidents -- mostly from the mainland -- as well as locals’ outrage over Snowden’s revelations that their supposed ally, the United States, had been targeting the city for extensive surveillance activities.

Hundreds of Hong Kongers marched last Saturday on the U.S. consulate in the city, chanting slogans such as “Protect Edward Snowden!” and carrying posters of President Obama saying, “Big Brother is Watching You.”

Law Yuk Kai, director of the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor, said Sunday that he was pleased that the city government had “honored its obligation under our legal system to allow Mr. Snowden to leave” the city.

“Hong Kong was probably not a very good place for him,” Law said. “The legal procedures involved had certain uncertainties: First, the legal system is not totally in our hands; Beijing has a lot to say. Second, the procedure relates to a large number of big legal issues … extradition legislation, refugee laws and constitutional obligations to protect rights under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.”

Advertisement

Tom Grundy, one of the organizers of last weekend’s demonstration in support of Snowden, said he was “surprised and relieved” that the Hong Kong government “had the option to detain him and put out an arrest warrant and they didn’t.”

“It’s probably good for him,” Grundy said. “It could have been a bit messy. Had he claimed asylum … he would have found himself in a very much broken local immigration system. It could have been a long drawn out process. … We’re relieved for him, and we hope his final destination country will provide him some asylum.”

Young agreed that Snowden’s situation would have “changed drastically” with the issue of an arrest warrant in Hong Kong.

“From his ‘safe place’ he would have been detained in prison awaiting the completion of both his surrender and asylum proceedings,” Young said. “That would have been a harsh existence if he was to fight it out and no certainty that he would not be surrendered.”

Lam said the decision to allow Snowden to leave Hong Kong would certainly result in a “period of tension” both between the U.S. and Beijing and the U.S. and Hong Kong.

“The U.S. of course will now say that Hong Kong’s position as an autonomous region might be jeopardized, because it is quite clear that Hong Kong has taken orders from Beijing not to extradite Snowden. I think it’s likely U.S. will start asking questions about status of Hong Kong, whether it is really still that autonomous.”"

During a press briefing on Monday, Kerry said that Assad could avoid American air strikes by giving up all his chemical weapons within a week. Within hours, the State Department was forced to walk Kerry’s new red line back with the claim that he was making a “rhetorical argument about the impossibility and unlikelihood of Assad turning over chemical weapons he has denied he used.”

It seems, then, reasonable to conclude that Kerry spoke out of turn. Kerry was not authorized to offer Syria an “out” or a new ultimatum. But Kerry’s hypothetical hyperbole appears to have already backfired.

In an obvious desire to make Kerry pay for his flub and throw a wrench in Obama’s determination to go to war with Syria, Putin has seized upon Kerry’s hypothetical and called on Syria to accept Kerry’s offer and turn over all of its chemical weapons. No one believes Assad would ever willingly give up his chemical weapons, but should he agree to an offer the Obama administration did not mean to make, it could stall American action for weeks and even months.

Syria is already warming to the idea.

This complication could be a major blow to all of the Obama administration’s prepared plans to punish Assad for using the weapons and to change the balance of power in the ongoing Syrian civil war. Public opposition to Obama’s war is already surging. Weeks or months from now, after the torturous international diplomatic process that no one believes would end with Assad giving up the chemical weapons that keep him in power winds down, it is doubtful Congress or the American public would be ready to stomach a renewed push for war.

But now that Putin has suggested Syria say “yes” to an offer Kerry was sure no one would accept, the Associated Press is reporting that the State Department will take a “hard look” at Russia’s proposal.

Just like Obama’s unscripted “red line” comment that started this debacle, it looks as though another off-teleprompter administration blunder has shoved America’s foreign policy into a corner.

(CNN) —

Two years after bringing home U.S. troops from Iraq, the Obama administration is sending Hellfire rockets and ScanEagle surveillance drones to help government forces fight al Qaeda affiliates growing in influence, a State Department official confirmed to CNN on Thursday.

As first reported by The New York Times, a shipment of 75 Hellfire rockets bought by Iraq arrived last week. Plans call for 10 ScanEagle drones to be sent in the early months of 2014.

“The recent delivery of Hellfire missiles and an upcoming delivery of ScanEagles are standard FMS (foreign military sales) cases that we have with Iraq to strengthen their capabilities to combat this threat,” the State Department official said on condition of not being identified. “We remain committed to supporting the government of Iraq in meeting its defense needs in the face of these challenges.”

State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki recently noted that terrorists were “seeking to gain control of territory inside the borders of Iraq.”

Increasing violence in parts of Iraq has highlighted the security challenges facing the country since the departure of U.S. forces at the end of 2011.

On Christmas Day, two car bombs targeting Christians killed and injured more than 100 people in southern Baghdad.

One exploded outside a church just as worshipers were leaving a Christmas service, while another went off at an outdoor market where many Christians shop, police said.

At least 38 people died in the two bombings that wounded some 70 others, the Interior Ministry said, and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad condemned the attacks.

“The Christian community in Iraq has suffered deliberate and senseless targeting by terrorists for many years, as have many other innocent Iraqis,” an embassy statement said. “The United States abhors all such attacks and is committed to its partnership with the government of Iraq to combat the scourge of terrorism.”

Iraq has experienced an uptick in sectarian violence this year because of simmering tensions between the disaffected minority Sunni community and the dominant Shiites, who control the government.

(CNN) —

It’s official: U.S. President Barack Obama wants lawmakers to weigh in on whether to use military force in Syria.

Obama sent a letter to the heads of the House and Senate on Saturday night, hours after announcing that he believes military action against Syrian targets is the right step to take over the alleged use of chemical weapons.

The proposed legislation from Obama asks Congress to approve the use of military force “to deter, disrupt, prevent and degrade the potential for future uses of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction.”

It’s a step that is set to turn an international crisis into a fierce domestic political battle.

There are key questions looming over the debate: What did U.N. weapons inspectors find in Syria? What happens if Congress votes no? And how will the Syrian government react?

In a televised address from the White House Rose Garden earlier Saturday, the president said he would take his case to Congress, not because he has to – but because he wants to.

“While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,” he said. “We should have this debate, because the issues are too big for business as usual.”

Obama said top congressional leaders had agreed to schedule a debate when the body returns to Washington on September 9. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a hearing over the matter on Tuesday, Sen. Robert Menendez said.

Syrian crisis: Latest developments

U.N. inspectors leave Syria

Obama’s remarks came shortly after U.N. inspectors left Syria, carrying evidence that will determine whether chemical weapons were used in an attack early last week in a Damascus suburb.

“The aim of the game here, the mandate, is very clear – and that is to ascertain whether chemical weapons were used – and not by whom,” U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters on Saturday.

But who used the weapons in the reported toxic gas attack in a Damascus suburb on August 21 has been a key point of global debate over the Syrian crisis.

Top U.S. officials have said there’s no doubt that the Syrian government was behind it, while Syrian officials have denied responsibility and blamed jihadists fighting with the rebels.

British and U.S. intelligence reports say the attack involved chemical weapons, but U.N. officials have stressed the importance of waiting for an official report from inspectors.

The inspectors will share their findings with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Ban, who has said he wants to wait until the U.N. team’s final report is completed before presenting it to the U.N. Security Council.

The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which nine of the inspectors belong to, said Saturday that it could take up to three weeks to analyze the evidence they collected.

“It needs time to be able to analyze the information and the samples,” Nesirky said.

He noted that Ban has repeatedly said there is no alternative to a political solution to the crisis in Syria, and that “a military solution is not an option.”

Obama: ‘This menace must be confronted’

Obama’s senior advisers have debated the next steps to take, and the president’s comments Saturday came amid mounting political pressure over the situation in Syria. Some U.S. lawmakers have called for immediate action while others warn of stepping into what could become a quagmire.

Some global leaders have expressed support, but the British Parliament’s vote against military action earlier this week was a blow to Obama’s hopes of getting strong backing from key NATO allies.

On Saturday, Obama proposed what he said would be a limited military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Any military attack would not be open-ended or include U.S. ground forces, he said.

Syria’s alleged use of chemical weapons earlier this month “is an assault on human dignity,” the president said.

A failure to respond with force, Obama argued, “could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm. In a world with many dangers, this menace must be confronted.”

Obama decision came Friday night

On Friday night, the president made a last-minute decision to consult lawmakers.

What will happen if they vote no?

It’s unclear. A senior administration official told CNN that Obama has the authority to act without Congress – even if Congress rejects his request for authorization to use force.

Obama on Saturday continued to shore up support for a strike on the al-Assad government.

He spoke by phone with French President Francois Hollande before his Rose Garden speech.

“The two leaders agreed that the international community must deliver a resolute message to the Assad regime – and others who would consider using chemical weapons – that these crimes are unacceptable and those who violate this international norm will be held accountable by the world,” the White House said.

Meanwhile, as uncertainty loomed over how Congress would weigh in, U.S. military officials said they remained at the ready.

Reactions mixed to Obama’s speech

A spokesman for the Syrian National Coalition said that the opposition group was disappointed by Obama’s announcement.

“Our fear now is that the lack of action could embolden the regime and they repeat his attacks in a more serious way,” said spokesman Louay Safi. “So we are quite concerned.”

Some members of Congress applauded Obama’s decision.

House Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy and Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers issued a statement Saturday praising the president.

“Under the Constitution, the responsibility to declare war lies with Congress,” the Republican lawmakers said. “We are glad the president is seeking authorization for any military action in Syria in response to serious, substantive questions being raised.”

More than 160 legislators, including 63 of Obama’s fellow Democrats, had signed letters calling for either a vote or at least a “full debate” before any U.S. action.

British Prime Minister David Cameron, whose own attempt to get lawmakers in his country to support military action in Syria failed earlier this week, responded to Obama’s speech in a Twitter post Saturday.

“I understand and support Barack Obama’s position on Syria,” Cameron said.

An influential lawmaker in Russia – which has stood by Syria and criticized the United States – had his own theory.

“The main reason Obama is turning to the Congress: the military operation did not get enough support either in the world, among allies of the US or in the United States itself,” Alexei Pushkov, chairman of the international-affairs committee of the Russian State Duma, said in a Twitter post.

In the United States, scattered groups of anti-war protesters around the country took to the streets Saturday.

“Like many other Americans…we’re just tired of the United States getting involved and invading and bombing other countries,” said Robin Rosecrans, who was among hundreds at a Los Angeles demonstration.

Syria’s government unfazed

After Obama’s speech, a military and political analyst on Syrian state TV said Obama is “embarrassed” that Russia opposes military action against Syria, is “crying for help” for someone to come to his rescue and is facing two defeats – on the political and military levels.

Syria’s prime minister appeared unfazed by the saber-rattling.

“The Syrian Army’s status is on maximum readiness and fingers are on the trigger to confront all challenges,” Wael Nader al-Halqi said during a meeting with a delegation of Syrian expatriates from Italy, according to a banner on Syria State TV that was broadcast prior to Obama’s address.

An anchor on Syrian state television said Obama “appeared to be preparing for an aggression on Syria based on repeated lies.”

A top Syrian diplomat told the state television network that Obama was facing pressure to take military action from Israel, Turkey, some Arabs and right-wing extremists in the United States.

“I think he has done well by doing what Cameron did in terms of taking the issue to Parliament,” said Bashar Jaafari, Syria’s ambassador to the United Nations.

Both Obama and Cameron, he said, “climbed to the top of the tree and don’t know how to get down.”

The Syrian government has denied that it used chemical weapons in the August 21 attack, saying that jihadists fighting with the rebels used them in an effort to turn global sentiments against it.

British intelligence had put the number of people killed in the attack at more than 350.

On Saturday, Obama said “all told, well over 1,000 people were murdered.” U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday cited a death toll of 1,429, more than 400 of them children. No explanation was offered for the discrepancy.

Special for USA TODAY

""They who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.""

— Benjamin Franklin, for the Pennsylvania Assembly, in its reply to the governor, 1755.

SAN FRANCISCO — In the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the American people, through their elected representatives in Washington, chose to exchange a significant amount of freedom for safety.

But until a lone information-technology contractor named Edward Snowden leaked a trove of National Security Agency documents to the media this summer, we didn't know just how much we'd surrendered.

Now that we do, our nation can have a healthy debate — out in the open, as a democracy should debate — about how good a bargain we got in that exchange.

For facilitating that debate, at great risk to his own personal liberty, Snowden is this column's technology person of the year for 2013.

While a long line of so-called leaders of the tech industry were repeating the smug mantra that ""there is no privacy"" — all while secretly cooperating with the NSA's surveillance program — Snowden risked prosecution and jail to give Americans the chance to choose for themselves whether it still matters in the digital age.

Secrecy has long been a favorite tool of totalitarian regimes that want to stifle internal political debate.

Secret courts were a staple of Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union, used to exile dissidents to Siberian gulags.

They are still used today by China's communist government to silence its critics.

The U.S. also has secret courts, first created under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.

The FISA court was set up to allow American intelligence agencies to track foreign agents without allowing those agents to know about it, as they would if the warrant for monitoring their communications had to be approved in a public court.

On its surface, that rationale sounds reasonable.

Yet, like all secret courts, hidden from oversight, it was allowed to run amok.

After 9/11, it became a rubber stamp that approved massive surveillance programs that swept up the phone and Internet communications of ordinary Americans.

Whether that surveillance captured any actual communication or so-called metadata about phone calls and e-mails is a new argument that members of Congress and the NSA are now trying to use to confuse the debate.

But it misses the key point: If the government wants to know about the routine communication of law-abiding Americans, it should have to prove to a judge in an open courtroom that that surveillance is in the best interests of public safety.

This privacy safeguard is enshrined in the Fourth Amendment, which protects us all against ""unreasonable searches and seizures.""

Thanks to Snowden, this country can now argue and debate — in the federal courts and in the halls of Congress — whether the NSA's surveillance programs are constitutional.

Snowden also showed just how inept the NSA was in protecting even its own information.

Let's not forget the 9/11 terrorist attacks represented the worst intelligence failure in the nation's history.

Various government security agencies knew the names of many of the 9/11 terrorists before the attack. They also knew some were taking flying lessons, but failed to connect the dots.

Such a failure should have led to more oversight, not less.

But critics of that failure were soon bullied into silence by hysterical talk from those who needed to focus Americans' attention on our enemies, as when former secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld famously said people, ""need to be very careful about what they say.""

Not since Sen. Joseph McCarthy's Communist witch hunt of the 1950s had fear become so palpable in the land of the free and the home of the brave.

That was enough to cow most of the tech industry's largest companies into cooperating with the NSA.

Fortunately, some Americans are not so frightened of our enemies as Rumsfeld that they would trade liberty for safety.

Some believe that taxpayer-funded entities such as the NSA and the FISA court should have some measure of public oversight, to ensure they are helping to protect the U.S. Constitution, rather than undermining it.

Now that the scope of NSA spying has been exposed, let's have a debate about all of it.

And let's thank Edward Snowden for moving that debate into the public arena.

Updated 12:38 p.m. ET, 12/15/2013

(CNN) - Sen. John McCain joined CNN's ""State of the Union"" from Kiev, Ukraine, on Sunday after the Arizona Republican addressed thousands of protesters who are angry over the Ukrainian government's decision to backpedal away from an agreement with the European Union.

McCain spoke about a range of issues happening around the globe, and suggested the Central Intelligence Agency was not truthful to Congress about former FBI agent Bob Levinson, who went missing in Iran seven years ago.

Here are five noteworthy points from the interview.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

1) McCain: More oversight needed of U.S. intelligence agencies

McCain said he was ""confident we are doing everything that we can"" to get former FBI agent Bob Levinson released from Iran, where he went missing seven years ago.

But the senator said he was disturbed at recent reports that Levinson was in fact working for the CIA in Iran, not conducting private business as officials have previously claimed.

""What disturbs me is apparently they did not tell the truth to the Congress. The CIA did not tell the truth to the American Congress about Mr. Levinson,"" he said. ""If that's true, then you put this on top of things that our intelligence committees didn't know about other activities, which have been revealed by (NSA leaker Edward) Snowden - maybe it means that we should be examining the oversight role of Congress over our different intelligence agencies.""

He added that any negotiations in Levinson's case should also include attempts to free other Americans who are believed to be in Iranian custody.

McCain also weighed in on the interim deal reached with international powers and Iran on the country's nuclear program. In exchange for easing of sanctions, Iran agreed to slow its nuclear development program as the world powers continue talks for another six months.

He said he thinks it's ""very likely"" the Senate will have a bill that restores some sanctions against Iran at the end of the six months if there's no result in further negotiations to dismantle Iran's program.

2) McCain says Putin is meddling

There's a political tug of war going on in the former Soviet republic of Ukraine, with the western part of the country at odds with the eastern part – which is more closely aligned with Russia - over a failed deal with the European Union.

Last month, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych did not sign a trade agreement with the European Union, choosing instead closer economic ties with Moscow. The move sparked mass protests, with thousands pouring into the capital city, furious over the government's sharp turnaround from previous efforts to better integrate with Europe.

McCain showed up this weekend, along with Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, to express support.

""This is a grass-roots revolution here,"" McCain told CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley. ""It's been peaceful, except for when the government tried to crack down on them, and the government hasn't done that since. But I am praising their ability and their desire to demonstrate peacefully for change that I think they deserve.""

Protesters say an EU agreement would open borders to trade and set the stage for modernization and inclusion. They accuse Yanukovych of preparing to take the country into a Moscow-led customs union.

Moscow has leverage that may have affected Yanukovych's decision last month to backpedal on the EU talks because Russia supplies Ukraine with natural gas.

McCain, a longtime critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said the recent pressure on Ukraine is one more example of Putin asserting his power in other countries.

there's no doubt that Ukraine is of vital importance to Vladimir Putin. One of - I think it was Kissinger, I'm not sure, said that Russian without Ukraine is an Eastern power; with Ukraine it's a Western power.

""This is the beginning of Russia. It was right here in Kiev,"" McCain said. ""So Putin views it as the most highly important, and he has put pressure on Ukrainians. The price of energy, different kinds of activities, and the word is very clear that he has made certain threats. Whether he would carry those through or not, I don't know.""

McCain also said Putin ""is now a player in the Middle East, which he has not been since 1973,"" adding Putin is ""realizing, thanks to our weakness, some of his ambitions.""

Given that the U.S. is trying to work on a deal with Russia to remove Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles, Crowley asked McCain whether it was a good time to be taking on Russia.

""I don't think that we would be taking on Russia,"" McCain replied. ""Look, these people (the protesters) love the United States of America, they love freedom, and I don't think you could view this as anything but our traditional support for people who want a free and democratic society.""

""We're not talking about military action,"" he continued. ""We're not talking about blockades. We're talking about the possibility of sanctions if they continue to brutally repress their people. That would require some action on our part, just because that's what the United States of America is all about.""

3) 'Plead guilty'

McCain admitted Sunday he exaggerated when he compared President Obama's handshake last week with Cuban President Raul Castro to a handshake between Neville Chamberlain and Adolf Hitler at the start of World War II.

""I'm sure it was an exaggeration, Candy,"" he said. ""If you want me to plead guilty here on CNN - guilty.""

Obama faced a wave of criticism following his warm, though brief, greeting with Castro at Nelson Mandela's memorial service in South Africa.

""I think it was gross exaggeration,"" McCain said of the comparison. ""But have no doubt that (the handshake) is of great propaganda value for the Cuban government, which is oppressive, repressive, continues to jail dissidents and continues to be one of the - probably easily the most repressive government in our hemisphere.""

""I don't think you should shake hands with someone who continues to violate his own country's human rights,"" he continued. ""It happened. But it is what it is. And I'm sure that Mr. Castro appreciated it.""

The White House said the handshake was not preplanned, and officials pointed to Obama's comments in his speech that urged freedom in dictatorial societies.

4) McCain will vote for the budget bill

McCain said Sunday he'll vote for a compromise budget bill that would prevent another government shutdown.

""I hope it will pass the Senate,"" he said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""We must not shut down the government again. We can't do that to the people of this country and my state.""

The House approved the measure last week, but many GOP senators, raising a variety of concerns, are expected to vote against the bill. Despite their opposition, a few Republicans, including McCain, may help push the bill through the Senate.

Senate expected to pass budget bill – narrowly

McCain said he has spoken with military leaders who approve the deal because it ""gives them relief from the harsh effects of sequestration.""

Crowley asked if McCain would vote for the budget package as long as it stays the same.

""Yes,"" McCain said.

Final congressional approval would mark a rare win for bipartisanship and a step up for a Congress infected with political dysfunction and held in low public esteem, with midterm elections less than a year off.

5) 'This must be a huge embarrassment for China'

The execution of Kim Jong Un's uncle shows that the young North Korea leader is ""dangerous,"" McCain said, noting the country's nuclear capabilities.

Because Jang Song Thaek, Kim's uncle by marriage, was believed to be a key figure in North Korea and a liaison between North Korea and China, McCain argued ""this must be a huge embarrassment for China.""

""It's very obvious this young man is capable of some very aberrational behavior, and given the toys that he has, I think it's very dangerous,"" McCain continued. ""And you would think that the Chinese would understand that as well. They've got to rein this young man in, and they can.""

Administration efforts to seek support from lawmakers, including personal phone calls by the president, so far appear to have changed few minds.

Nor has the support of top Republican and Democratic congressional leaders in both houses, who have lined up behind President Obama’s plan to punish the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad for what U.S. officials say was a poison gas attack last month near Damascus that killed more than 1,400 people.

Administration officials say they remain optimistic about winning a vote in the Senate, expected later this week. Vice President Joe Biden hosted Obama and six GOP senators for dinner at the vice presidential residence Sunday night.

TRANSCRIPT: Obama’s remarks on Syria

But even in the Senate, the result remains in doubt and may require Biden to break a tie vote. And in the House, the support of Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) has not swayed an impromptu liberal-conservative alliance that opposes the Syria plan.

The president faces a potent dual threat — Republicans who don’t trust and won’t support him despite the urgings of their leadership and a sizable antiwar contingent of Democrats who oppose military action except for national self-defense. Public opposition to the proposed cruise missile strikes against Syria has bolstered those lawmakers.

Congressional and White House aides cautioned against drawing “premature” tallies of the votes, because many lawmakers are just considering the issue as they return from the monthlong summer recess.

But the nature of the White House lobbying, heavily focused on groups who are ordinarily among the president’s strongest supporters, highlights how difficult Obama’s position has become. Officials plan to bus members of the Congressional Black Caucus to the White House on Monday so national security advisor Susan Rice can personally urge them to support military action in Syria. Several members of the caucus already have publicly opposed a military strike.

Pelosi has nudged her troops almost daily. A letter Saturday suggested they consider the work of Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), a liberal ally, who voted to approve the Syria resolution in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

The White House is well accustomed to losing legislative battles because of Republican opposition. But large-scale defections among Democrats would create a high-profile, bipartisan rebuke of a president’s foreign policy wishes, a move that has little precedent.

To try to avoid that, Obama plans to step up his personal efforts, blanketing the airwaves with a series of television interviews Monday and a speech to the nation and a visit to Capitol Hill to meet Senate Democrats on Tuesday.

PHOTOS: Syria before the war

Obama plans to emphasize several key points, according to a senior administration official who requested anonymity in discussing White House strategy: Officials have no doubt Assad is responsible for the sarin gas attack, a military strike would be limited, the U.S. has exhausted all diplomatic channels, and it is up to the U.S. to act.

The messaging blitz might not move poll numbers, the official said. But it is aimed in part at lawmakers who have wanted the president to own the case for action.

Meantime, Assad, in a rare interview, sent his own message, warning against military involvement by the United States.

CBS News said Sunday that in the interview Assad threatened that “people aligned with him” would retaliate against the U.S. for any attack and denied using chemical weapons. The network plans to air the interview Monday; interviewer Charlie Rose previewed its contents Sunday on “Face the Nation.”

Administration officials said that they had spoken to at least 85 senators and more than 165 House members in the last two weeks, an unusual accounting of its behind-the-scenes lobbying that implicitly acknowledged the stakes of the fight that none of Obama’s advisors expected and some argued against having.

But the conversations so far have had limited effect. One undecided House Democrat from a moderate district entered the week wary but looking for a reason to support the president, said an aide who asked for anonymity in discussing the lawmaker’s thinking.

A week of briefings and a review of the administration’s case left the lawmaker only more convinced that the administration could not promise the “limited” intervention Obama has described.

With the congressional midterm reelection fight around the corner, the lawmaker would need a powerful reason to defy the clear message coming from constituents.

“All we’re hearing is no,” the House aide said of the calls coming to the congressional office.

In addition to its efforts with Democrats, the White House is enlisting former Bush administration officials and Republican foreign policy experts to appeal to GOP lawmakers. However, the vote count so far has illustrated not just Obama’s weakness on Capitol Hill but also stark divisions among Republicans.

The onetime GOP unity on foreign affairs has splintered, with the party’s anti-interventionist wing growing in strength. The more traditional hawks appear unable to influence the newer libertarians.

The unusual left-right partnership was evident Sunday as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a tea party champion, cited Dennis Kucinich, a favorite of the Democratic left wing, as the source for his suggestion that a cruise missile attack on Assad’s government would turn the U.S. into “Al Qaeda’s air force.”

The reality that some of the rebel groups fighting Assad have links to Al Qaeda is one of several issues that lawmakers of both parties, even those inclined to back Obama, have wrestled with.

In the Senate, only a handful of Republicans, led by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), have said they will support military action against Syria.

Failure to win congressional approval of a strike against Syria, which Obama abruptly decided to pursue a week ago, could harm his second-term agenda not only in foreign affairs, but in domestic policy as well. Budget issues and immigration reform, his top domestic priority, are pending in Congress.

“If Congress won’t support him on this, they’ll be much more willing to say no,” said Julian E. Zelizer, a professor of history and public policy at Princeton University.

“It will signal that Obama can’t move Congress,” he said, and “just as troublesome, it will show again that the Republican leadership can’t control its caucus, and liberal Democrats are no longer willing to stand behind him out of loyalty.”

On Sunday, the administration sent White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough onto all five network public affairs talk shows to make the case for the Syria policy, hoping he would accomplish more than Secretary of State John F. Kerry did with a similar set of television appearances a week earlier.

“The question for Congress this week is a very simple one: Should there be consequences for his having used gases, chemical weapons, to kill more than 1,000 of his own people, including more than 400 children?” McDonough said. U.S. failure to act would encourage Iran, Hezbollah and other U.S. adversaries, he said.

Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), an Air Force pilot during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars who supports striking Syria, expressed his frustration with Congress and the White House.

“We’re all war weary,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.”

“But this is a moment in time where I think in 10, 20, 30 years, the history books are going to say this was a redefining moment in world history, and what was the United States doing?”

(CNN) —

The appearance Friday in a lower Manhattan courtroom of Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, Osama bin Laden’s son-in-law and one-time al Qaeda spokesman, to face charges of conspiracy to kill Americans underlines the perhaps surprising fact that members of bin Laden’s inner circle have been living in Iran for the past decade or so.

It was Abu Ghaith’s decision to leave the comparative safety of his longtime refuge in Iran for Turkey a few weeks ago that led to the chain of events that landed him in Manhattan for trial.

The leading Turkish newspaper, Hurriyet, reported that Abu Ghaith was detained in the Turkish capital, Ankara, in early February. Turkey then decided to deport him to his native Kuwait via Jordan, where he was intercepted by FBI agents, who escorted him to New York.

As is well known, many of bin Laden’s family and members of his inner circle fled Afghanistan for Pakistan after the fall of the Taliban in the winter of 2001, but what is less well known is that some also fled to neighboring Iran.

According to U.S. documents and officials, in addition to Abu Ghaith, other of bin Laden’s inner circle who ended up in Iran include the formidable military commander of al Qaeda, Saif al-Adel, a former Egyptian Special Forces officer who had fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan, as well as Saad bin Laden, one of the al Qaeda’s leader older sons who has played some kind of leadership role in the group.

Saad bin Laden spent the first six months of 2002 living in Karachi in southern Pakistan. From there he helped one of his father’s wives, Khairiah bin Laden, and several of his father’s children to move from Pakistan to Iran.

For years these bin Laden family members all lived in the Iranian capital, Tehran, under some form of house arrest. Their conditions were not unpleasant, with time for visits to swimming pools and shopping trips.

Meanwhile, U.S. intelligence learned that some al Qaeda operatives were living in the northern Iranian town of Chalus, on the Caspian Sea.

In 2002 a U.S. Navy SEAL operation into Chalus was planned and then rehearsed somewhere along the U.S. Gulf Coast.

The chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Richard Myers, called off the assault because the information about where precisely the al Qaeda members were living in Chalus was not clear.

A year after that operation was called off, according to US and Saudi officials, from his Iranian refuge Saif al-Adel authorized al-Qaeda’s branch in Saudi Arabia to launch a series of terrorist attacks in the Saudi kingdom that began in the capital Riyadh in May 2003, a campaign that killed scores of Saudis and expatriates.

Bergen: Trying bin Laden’s son-in-law in New York makes sense

On the face of it, the fact that a number of al Qaeda leaders and operatives and bin Laden family members found shelter in Iran is puzzling, as the Shia theocrats in the Iranian regime are hostile to the Sunni ultra zealots in al Qaeda, and vice versa.

For al Qaeda’s operatives, life in Iran was more secure than for many of their colleagues in Pakistan who risked capture by Pakistani forces working with the CIA or death by CIA drones.

The Iranian regime likely saw the al Qaeda operatives as useful bargaining chips with the United States in the event of some kind of peace negotiations with the Americans. That peace deal, of course, never happened.

Of course, for Iran the adage, “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” may have also come into play, although there doesn’t seem to be evidence that Iran and al Qaeda have ever cooperated on a specific operation.

That said, the 9/11 Commission found that of the 19 hijackers, “8 to 10 of the 14 Saudi “muscle” operatives traveled into or out of Iran between October 2000 and February 2001.” Whether this was with any degree of Iranian complicity is still an open question.

The fact that leading members of al Qaeda were based in Iran from 2002 on was known to the U.S. government at the time. (In fact, in early 2003 counterterrorism officials briefed me about this development).

There is something of an irony here. This was during the same time period in which senior administration officials under President George W. Bush were citing the alleged presence of al Qaeda members in Baghdad and a supposedly burgeoning alliance between al Qaeda and Iraq’s leader Saddam Hussein as a key reason to go to war against Saddam, Iran’s bitter enemy.

Five years after the invasion of Iraq, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence concluded, as had every other official investigation of the matter, that in fact there was no “cooperative relationship” between Saddam and al Qaeda.

In late 2008 al Qaeda operatives kidnapped Heshmatollah Attarzadeh-Niyaki, an Iranian diplomat, in the western Pakistan city of Peshawar.

After holding the diplomat for over a year the militants quietly released him back to Iran in the spring of 2010.

This was part of a deal that allowed some of bin Laden’s family and al Qaeda members living under house arrest in Iran to depart, according to a Pakistani official familiar with the deal.

This deal did not, however, mean that relations between the Iranians and al Qaeda suddenly became all hunky dory.

Documents recovered at bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, following the SEAL raid there on May 1, 2011, and since publicly released portray a rather tense relationship between al Qaeda and the Iranian authorities.

In a letter that bin Laden wrote just five days before he died he described a document from his son Saad who had lived in Iran for years “which exposes the truth of the Iranian regime.” What bin Laden meant precisely by this is not clear, but taken together with some of the other letters that were found in his Abbottabad compound it is obvious that bin Laden and his men were quite distrustful of the Iranian regime.

A letter to bin Laden from his chief of staff dated 11 June 2009 has a detailed account about a group of “mid level” al Qaeda members who the Iranians had recently released, including three Egyptians, a Yemeni, a Iraqi and a Libyan.

Bin Laden’s chief of staff attributed these releases to al Qaeda’s kidnapping of the Iranian diplomat in Peshawar, but added that the Iranians “don’t want to show that they are negotiating with us or reacting to our pressure. … We ask God to repel their evil.”

In another undated letter from bin Laden to his chief off staff al Qaeda’s leader gave a set of detailed instructions about how best to handle his family members living in Iran once they were released.

Bin Laden urged extreme caution “since the Iranians are not to be trusted.” Among another precautions, he wrote that his family members “should be warned about the importance of getting rid of everything they received from Iran like baggage or anything even as small as a needle, as there are eavesdropping chips that have been developed to be so small they can be put inside a medical syringe.”

In this letter bin Laden mentioned by name a number of his children living in Iran including his sons Ladin, Uthman and Muhammad and his daughter Fatima, who is married to Sulaiman Abu Ghaith who now sits in a Manhattan jail.

In October the U.S. Treasury named as terrorists six al Qaeda members living in Iran who it said are funding terrorist activities in Pakistan and sending fighters and money to Syria to fight the Assad regime there.

Abu Ghaith didn’t play an operational role in al Qaeda – a fact that was underlined in the charges filed against him last week in Manhattan that revolve around his role as a propagandist for the group. So it is the precise nature of al Qaeda’s arrangements in Iran and the kind of activities outlined in the recent Treasury designation of the half-dozen al Qaeda members living in Iran that are likely to be of most interest to American investigators.

Given the fact that since 9/11, New York courts have convicted at a rate of 100% in cases that involve members of al Qaeda and associated groups, Abu Ghaith could doubtless cut an attractive plea deal for himself if he gives a full accounting of al Qaeda’s murky decade in Iran.

The Republican drubbing in November among Latino voters, the shifting demographics of the American electorate, and the rise of telegenic champions of the immigration changes like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, both Republicans, have changed the stakes as well as the political equation.

But in Mr. Sessions, they face an opponent with experience, one who reminds his staff every day that passage of immigration legislation was supposed to be inevitable in 2006 as well, and even more so in 2007. His tactics are the same as they were back then: organize the opposition, break down the bill section by section, raise questions over every aspect of it, slow progress on the floor to a crawl through procedural objections and a flurry of amendments, and hope that in the light of day a conservative backlash will crush final passage.

During the first official week of debate on the Senate floor last week, Senate leaders were able to hold all of one amendment vote — in large measure because of Mr. Sessions’s delaying tactics. “Sessions is taking a full-spectrum view of this bill, and his opposition is not just one section: it’s from Page 1 to Page 1,041,” said Tripp Baird, director of Senate relations at Heritage Action, the conservative Heritage Foundation’s political arm and a vociferous opponent of the immigration bill.

Mr. Sessions does not necessarily hold the same sway in the Senate as the lawmakers he is challenging. The leading champions of the immigration bill include the Senate’s No. 2 and No. 3 Democrats, Richard J. Durbin of Illinois and Charles E. Schumer of New York, along with a former Republican presidential nominee in Mr. McCain and one of the party’s brightest stars in Mr. Rubio.

Mr. Sessions, the son of a country-store owner from rural Alabama, is neither party leader nor telegenic star. He was elected to the Senate in 1996, a decade after that same body blocked his nomination by President Ronald Reagan to a Federal District Court judgeship amid accusations of racial insensitivity."

He Joined The Post In', 'Previously Has Covered Congress', 'The Obama White House']","Obama, in Russia, urges U.S. lawmakers to back strike on Syria","President Obama scrambled with senior advisers Thursday to soften resistance to a military strike against the Syrian government among U.S. lawmakers and some of Obama’s most reliable global allies.

Obama has staked the credibility of the United States — and his presidency — on his call for a military operation to punish the Syrian government for its alleged use of chemical weapons against civilians last month.

But the president faces hardening barriers in Congress, where both Republican critics and Democratic allies have voiced deep reservations or flat opposition to his proposal to intervene militarily in a predominantly Muslim nation after a decade of war overseas. Polls show that much of the American public is skeptical, too.

Obama carved out time from his trip abroad this week to call key U.S. lawmakers, including five calls to Democratic and Republican senators on Wednesday.

The urgency partly reflects the surprising way that Obama culminated days of deliberation over how to respond to President Bashar al-Assad’s alleged use of chemical weapons, which Obama called “an assault on human dignity” that cannot go unpunished. He announced Saturday that he would seek congressional approval for any military strike against the Syrian government, and he has struggled to rally support across party lines amid his previously scheduled trip to Sweden and Russia.

View Graphic As of Sept. 4, lawmakers appear to be tentatively dividing into four camps over military action in Syria.

The White House lobbying effort has included direct conversations between Obama or top administration officials and at least 60 senators and at least 125 House members as of Thursday, according to a White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal administration operations.

Late Thursday afternoon, Vice President Biden and Antony Blinken, the deputy national security adviser, briefed a bipartisan group of House and Senate members in the White House Situation Room, an administration official said.

The outcome of a congressional vote, especially in the Republican­led House, is unclear, and the issue has blurred traditional party lines.

White House officials said they are not concerned about the vote trend in Congress so far. They said Obama, who is to return to Washington late Friday, will begin a more public campaign, including perhaps a presidential address, to win support from Congress and the American public for a strike.

The full Senate plans to begin considering as early as Friday a resolution authorizing the use of force after a divided Foreign Relations Committee this week backed limited military action. Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) is “guardedly optimistic” that the resolution can pass, according to Senate aides.

But Sen. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.), a moderate Democrat who has been a bipartisan consensus-­builder, said Thursday that a military strike “would be the wrong course of action” before all diplomatic options are exhausted.

Here in St. Petersburg, Obama’s quandary over Syria — and his estrangement from the summit’s host and Syria’s key patron, Russian President Vladi­mir Putin — largely overshadowed the economic agenda of the Group of 20 meeting.

Obama used the gathering to privately press his G-20 colleagues to support a U.S.-led strike in words, if not resources. He found one possible ally in Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who Obama said agrees that the Syrian attack should not go unpunished.

The White House detailed an extensive outreach to lawmakers that is being coordinated by aides in Washington, as well as by national security adviser Susan E. Rice and a key deputy, Benjamin J. Rhodes, who are traveling with Obama in Russia.

On Wednesday, Obama and senior White House officials made more than 25 phone calls to lawmakers from both parties. Chief of Staff Denis McDonough arranged calls with the Progressive Caucus and the Hispanic Caucus in the House, while Blinken held a conference call with Jewish House members.

The administration also has held classified briefings for any lawmaker who requests one detailing evidence that the alleged Aug. 21 chemical attack was carried out by Assad’s regime. The administration has said that more than 1,400 civilians, including at least 426 children, were killed when rockets containing highly toxic sarin gas were launched from regime territory and landed on rebel strongholds or contested areas in the Damascus suburbs.

Secretary of State John F. Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel have participated in the Capitol Hill outreach. Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Thursday that the United States must “respond decisively to this horrific attack” in Syria.

Obama spent most of the day Thursday in private meetings with world leaders but spoke briefly with reporters at the start of one session. Seated at a long table across from Abe, Obama spoke about their “joint recognition that the use of chemical weapons in Syria is not only a tragedy but also a violation of international law that must be addressed.”

The loudest critic of military action in Syria is Putin, who has scoffed at U.S. allegations about the attack. Putin welcomed Obama to the ornate Constantine Palace, once the summer playground for Russian czars, with a formal handshake and about 15 seconds of chitchat. The two leaders do not plan to meet here, although U.S. officials said Obama and Putin may interact informally on the summit’s sidelines.

Obama has argued forcefully that a U.S.-led military strike is needed to enforce an international ban on the use of chemical weapons and to degrade the ability of Assad’s forces to use them again in a brutal conflict with rebels that is in its third year.

The State Department said Thursday that Kerry, who has been the administration’s most visible supporter of military action in Syria, will travel to Europe over the weekend for consultations with allies and partners. He is scheduled first to speak with European Union counterparts who are meeting in Lithuania. In Paris, Kerry will meet with senior French officials and with Arab League representatives.

In Washington, many lawmakers said they remain unconvinced that the United States should engage militarily in Syria, even after closed-door classified briefings led by national security officials.

“I’ve had more phone calls on this issue than on any issue I’ve ever had since I got here in 2001, and my phone calls, e-mails, faxes are running 96 percent no,” said Rep. John Abney Culberson (R-Tex.). He said that there’s “absolutely no question” that Assad attacked innocent civilians but that “America has absolutely no strategic interest involved, and we should stay out of it.”

A growing number of liberals also oppose military action, including key allies of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who backs a strike. Rep. Niki Tsongas (D-Mass.), a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said, “I give the administration great credit for strongly making their case, but I still have many reservations about the unintended consequences of our actions.”

With a vote in the House several days away at least, aides said Pelosi has not started reaching out to individual lawmakers because she believes that colleagues need time to review hundreds of classified documents and other materials.

To help rally support for the authorization, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is asking the CIA to prepare DVDs for members of Congress containing video footage that supports the administration’s claims about the alleged chemical attack.

Feinstein, chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said Thursday that the video evidence will help inform lawmakers’ decisions.

Assad’s forces have used chemical weapons “between 11 and 14 times before” the Aug. 21 attack “but in small amounts,” Feinstein said. “And I looked at that as if they were testing it in some way. It is a very serious situation, and Assad’s got to understand there is a penalty for this.”

“His choice of itinerary and his request for help were an absolute surprise for us. We did not invite him,” a Russian official told the newspaper.

However, Western countries suspect that the Russians asked Snowden to come to their consulate in Hong Kong, where he was hiding from U.S. authorities after leaking information about the NSA’s widespread spying. The Russians sent an invitation through the Chinese, “who were glad to get rid of him,” a Western source told Kommersant.

While Snowden contacted the Russian government in Hong Kong before getting on the Aeroflot flight to Moscow, Moscow was not his planned final destination, Russian government sources told the newspaper.

Snowden was supposed to fly to Havana after a 22-hour layover in Moscow, and connect to either Bolivia or Ecuador. However, he did not board the flight, to the chagrin of nearly the entire Moscow press corps who found his reserved seat 17A empty.

The United States pressured Cuba to prohibit the flight from landing if Snowden was on board, several sources told the newspaper. Cuba was one of the countries that the United States threatened with “unfavorable consequences” if it accepted Snowden, a source close to the State Department was quoted as saying by Kommersant.

A Russian official told Kommersant that before flying to Moscow, Snowden spent two days at the Russian consulate in Hong Kong. Snowden told the Russians that he planned to ask for political asylum in a Latin American country and presented a ticket to Havana, with a 22-hour layover in Moscow, dated June 23. He said that his life was in danger and asked for help, citing international conventions for refugees.

Snowden also celebrated his 30th birthday at the Russian consulate on June 21, according to an unnamed source close to the NSA leaker.

(CNN) —

U.S. officials were pleasantly surprised and encouraged by the initial declaration that Syria has submitted to the world’s chemical weapons watchdog outlining its inventory of the munitions, a senior administration official said Saturday.

The official said the declaration was more complete than what the officials had expected the Syrians to put forth.

The news came hours after the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons announced that Syria had handed over a list of what it says is its chemical arms stockpile.

“The Technical Secretariat is currently reviewing the information received,” the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

The handover occurred a day before the organization is to meet at The Hague in the Netherlands to discuss Syria.

The timing meets the terms set in a deal forged last week between the United States and Russia in Geneva to begin destroying Syria’s chemical arsenal.

Under the fast-tracked Geneva deal, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was to declare the weapons no later than Saturday.

The normal 60-day process for declaring arms was expedited to seven days “because of the extraordinary concern about Syria’s weapons,” said Michael Luhan, a spokesman for the organization.

“Until now, each country has been typical. The United States, Russia, Libya, India, none have been in a state of war or conflict,” Luhan said Friday.

His organization planned to begin reviewing Monday, he said.

“We have to go through it in detail and plan how to conduct the on-the-ground inspection mission, to verify the accuracy of the declaration and put seals on all the materials to make sure they are secure,” Luhan said.

The stakes over halting the Syrian civil war heightened after an August 21 chemical weapons attack outside Damascus that U.S. officials estimate killed 1,400 people.

The United States and other Western nations blame the regime for the attack. Russia and Syria say they think rebels used the weapons.

Citing international norms against the use of chemical weapons, U.S. President Barack Obama called for authorization from Congress to use military force in Syria.

As the United States threatened force to degrade Assad’s ability to carry out chemical weapons attacks, a diplomatic opportunity arose between Russia and the United States to put Syria’s stockpile under international control.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov hammered out a deal in Geneva last week compelling Syria to accept the agreement. Syria has agreed to it.

Speaking ahead of next week’s U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York, Kerry said Thursday that while “the complete removal of Syria’s chemical weapons is possible here, through peaceful means,” urgency is needed.

The U.N. Security Council must be prepared to act next week, Kerry said, citing a U.N. chemical weapons report about the attack.

While the report did not assign responsibility for the attack, Kerry said it offered “crucial details,” making the case implicating Assad “only … more compelling.”

Russia called the report “distorted” and said it was based on insufficient information.

Even as diplomatic efforts were continuing, U.S. officials have not dropped their threat to use force and are wary, saying Syria could be using the diplomacy as a stalling tactic.

“Time is short,” Kerry said. “Let’s not spend time debating what we already know.”

Also on Saturday, the Syrian opposition coalition rejected an offer made by Iran to broker a peace deal between rebels and the government, calling it “ridiculous and desperate.”

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who is also planning to attend the U.N. General Assembly meeting, said he can help bring peace to Syria, a long-time Iranian ally torn by civil war.

In a Washington Post op-ed on Thursday, the recently elected Iranian president called for an end to “the unhealthy rivalries and interferences that fuel violence and drive us apart.” And he signaled his desire for better engagement with the West.

Given Iran’s closeness to Syria’s government, it seems unlikely rebels would consider Rouhani an independent broker. But Rouhani’s tone is far less fiery than that of his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. And Rouhani’s promise of more positive engagement with the world during his election campaign appeared to propel him to victory.

“The Syrian National Coalition considers Iran’s offer as ridiculous amid all the bloodshed that Iran participated with the (Bashar) al-Assad regime, through political, economic support and military support during the past two and a half years.”

Rouhani, 65, has promised more positive engagement with the world.

But the Syrian opposition coalition said Iran is part of the problem.

“There is no doubt that Rouhani’s offer is a desperate attempt to prolong the crisis and increase the complexity,” the coalition said in a statement.

The United Nations estimates more than 100,000 people have died since March 2011, a period in which harsh government crackdowns against protesters devolved into an all-out civil war.

Another 2 million people have fled their homeland, and more than 4.25 million have been displaced within Syria, the United Nations says.

More violence

Government forces killed at least 26 people Saturday in Hamas suburbs, according to the opposition group Local Coordination Committees. CNN could not independently verify the claim.

Putin in September as the standoff over the fate of Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor seeking asylum there, takes its toll on already strained relations between the United States and Russia, officials said Thursday.

Canceling the meeting in Moscow would be seen as a direct slap at Mr. Putin, who is known to value such high-level visits as a validation of Russian prestige. While the White House may be using the meeting as leverage to win cooperation as it seeks the return to the United States of Mr. Snowden, who is now staying at a Moscow airport, the reconsideration also reflects a broader concern that the two countries are far apart on issues like Syria, Iran, arms control and missile defense.

The conviction on Thursday of Aleksei A. Navalny, a prominent leader of the opposition to Mr. Putin, on embezzlement charges further underscored the deepening divide between the two countries as the White House pronounced itself “deeply disappointed” at what it called a trend of “suppressing dissent and civil society in Russia.” The verdict and five-year sentence came a week after the posthumous conviction of Sergei L. Magnitsky, a lawyer investigating official corruption who was arrested and died in custody.

“We call on the Russian government to cease its campaign of pressure against individuals and groups seeking to expose corruption, and to ensure that the universal human rights and fundamental freedoms of all of its citizens, including the freedoms of speech and assembly, are protected and respected,” said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary."

A bipartisan group of foreign policy leaders in the Senate warned in unusually blunt terms Tuesday that Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki may be pulling his country back toward civil war.

In a letter to President Obama timed for Maliki’s visit to Washington, the leaders of the Senate defense and foreign affairs committees said Maliki is contributing to what the lawmakers called an alarming slide toward sectarian violence compounded by the Syrian civil war next door.

Obama will see Maliki at the White House on Friday.

“Prime Minister Maliki’s mismanagement of Iraqi politics is contributing to the recent surge of violence,” Sens. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), John McCain (R-Ariz.), Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) wrote.

Maliki’s Shiite-led government is too dominated by Iran’s “malign influence” and its mistreatment of the Sunnis is pushing that minority group toward extremism, the senators charged.

“These were the same conditions that drove Iraq toward civil war during the last decade and we fear that fate could befall Iraq once again,” the letter said.

The Obama administration has tried without much success to foster a more inclusive government in Baghdad. That impasse is expected to be one major topic for Maliki’s meeting with the president. His request for more U.S. counterterrorism aid is the other.

Iraq wants to buy U.S.-made Apache helicopters, among other equipment.

The request is now before Congress, and the bipartisan Senate group appeared to endorse it.

Among the senators’ recommendations for Obama is greater counterterrorism aid for Iraq, to deal with the resurgence and expansion of the al-Qaeda affiliate in Iraq.

Iraq’s ambassador to the United States, Lukman Faily, said the security concerns would top Iraq’s agenda for meetings this week across the administration and in Congress.

He acknowledged U.S. concern about Iraq’s political balance, and the case Obama is likely to make to Maliki about the cost of excluding Sunnis.

“We have done our homework,” he said."

So while Secretary of State John Kerry said Monday that links between the attack and the Assad government are ""undeniable,"" U.S. intelligence officials are not so certain that the suspected chemical attack was carried out on Assad's orders, or even completely sure it was carried out by government forces, the officials said. Ideally, the White House seeks intelligence that links the attack directly to Assad or someone in his inner circle to rule out the possibility that a rogue element of the military decided to use chemical weapons without Assad's authorization. Another possibility that officials would hope to rule out: that stocks had fallen out of the government's control and were deployed by rebels in a callous and calculated attempt to draw the West into the war.

Cloud Covers The Pentagon']","North Korea may have nuclear warhead capability, U.S. agency says","WASHINGTON -- A U.S. intelligence agency has concluded that North Korea has the capability to develop nuclear warheads small enough to fit on a ballistic missile, a congressman disclosed Thursday.

Although U.S. experts believe that North Korea cannot hit the U.S. mainland with its missiles, a significant improvement in Pyongyang’s weapons technology would be deeply disconcerting for U.S. policymakers. It would also help explain American measures -- including an emphasis on the U.S. ability to respond with nuclear weapons -- after weeks of warlike rhetoric from Pyongyang.

Regional intelligence officials and analysts say North Korea is poised to launch as many as five missiles from its east coast, but that they did not appear to be in preparation for war. They said the launches were likely to only be part of a military exercise and would not pose a threat to the United States or its allies, Japan and South Korea.

Analysts said the exercise would probably be part of festivities planned to mark the birthday Monday of the country’s late founder, Kim Il Sung, grandfather of the current leader.

At a House Armed Services Committee hearing focused on the budget, Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.) read from what he said was an unclassified portion of a classified Defense Intelligence Agency study. “DIA assesses with moderate confidence the North currently has nuclear weapons capable of delivery by ballistic missiles. However, the reliability will be low,” it says.

Lamborn said the DIA study was completed last month, but that the conclusion had not been made public.

Pentagon spokesman George Little said he could not address the details of a classified report. However, he added, “It would be inaccurate to suggest that the North Korean regime has fully tested, developed, or demonstrated the kinds of nuclear capabilities referenced in the passage.”

James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, said in a statement that the DIA view is not a formal assessment shared by all U.S. intelligence agencies.

The DIA tends to be more aggressive in its intelligence assessments than the CIA, according to Bruce Klingner, a former CIA analyst on North Korea. He said the DIA has hinted in the past that Pyongyang could mount warheads on its missiles.

The Pentagon announced last month that it plans to augment missile defense systems in Alaska in response to the North Korean threat. The Defense Department also said it will deploy another antimissile system to Guam, which is within range of North Korean missiles.

The Pentagon also sent two long-range B-2 bombers from their base in Missouri last month on a round-trip flight to South Korea as part of a military exercise.

North Korea claimed after its most recent nuclear test in February that its objective was to develop a smaller and lighter warhead with “diverse materials.”

Advertisement

Analysts said the statement indicated that Pyongyang was stepping up its development of a miniaturized warhead that could fit atop one of its long-range missiles, and that the device used enriched uranium as a trigger, rather than the plutonium previously used.

North Korea’s official news agency said the nuclear test was successful. Seismic monitoring systems measured a resulting earthquake of magnitude 5.1, slightly higher than in past tests. But U.S. officials said yield estimates were uncertain.

At a Pentagon news conference last month to announce expansion of the U.S. missile defense systems, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel did not answer directly when he was asked when North Korea would have intercontinental ballistic missiles armed with nuclear warheads. He said the U.S. goal was to stay ahead of the development of North Korea’s weapons.

David Albright, a nuclear weapons expert with the Institute for Science and International Security, said in February that he believed North Korea has had the capability to mount a plutonium-based warhead on its shorter-range Rodong missiles “for some time,” and was making progress on developing a warhead for an intercontinental ballistic missile.

He said that the U.S. intelligence community has not “been of one opinion” on North Korea’s ability to produce miniaturized warheads. “Key members” of the intelligence community have credited Pyongyang with the ability to produce smaller warheads “for many years,” he said but that conclusion was based on assessment and “not concrete evidence.”

At a different congressional hearing Thursday, Clapper sought to downplay the recent tensions with North Korea. He said tensions were worse in previous episodes in his career, but he underscored how uncertain the intelligence is about North Korea’s new leader, Kim Jong Un.

“We don’t have good detail on the inner sanctum,” he said. “There’s no telling how he’s going to behave. He impresses me as impetuous, [and] not as inhibited as his father became about taking aggressive action.”

Xu Guangyu, a senior military analyst in Beijing, said there was no threat from the missiles likely to be launched in coming days by North Korea. “The grandson is using the missiles to salute his grandfather and celebrate his power,” Xu said.

Nevertheless, Japan and South Korea said they will use Patriot antimissile systems to shoot down any North Korean projectiles that threaten their territory.

Among the missiles that might be launched is a new, as-yet-untested Musudan with an estimated range of up to 2,400 miles, enough to reach the Pacific island of Guam.

South Korean intelligence sources were quoted Thursday as saying satellites had detected two of the missiles and launchers being moved in and out of a shed near the coastal city of Wonsan.

“There are signs the North could fire off Musudan missiles any time soon,” an unidentified intelligence source in Seoul told the state-run Yonhap news agency.

Advertisement

The South Korean officials also predicted possible launches of short-range Scud missiles and medium-range Rodong missiles.

Trying to defuse the tension, the South Korean government suggested negotiations over a jointly run industrial park in Kaesong, just north of the demilitarized zone. North Korea pulled out its 53,000 workers this week, threatening a project that had been one of the crowning achievements of inter-Korean cooperation.

Officials in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, have been issuing daily predictions about the imminent outbreak of war.

On Thursday, the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland said that Pyongyang had “powerful striking means” on standby for a launch that would “turn the stronghold of the enemies into a sea of fire.”

Advertisement

But tourists, who flew out Thursday after a two-week trip, said they saw no signs of war preparations or anxiety among the North Korean population.

“Soldiers are working in the fields, planting trees, or just hanging around,” said Kees Wielinga, a Dutch businessman who had returned through Beijing. “There were no civil defense preparations, no mobilization at all.”

Advertisement

Military analysts said the planned launches did not appear to be in preparation for war.

“I worry as much about North Korea unleashing a full-scale war as I do about an asteroid hitting my house,” said Daniel Pinkston, a Seoul-based analyst for the International Crisis Group, a think tank.

Advertisement

“We expect these missiles will fall in the ocean and give the intel people a chance to study their weapons systems.”

Shin In-kyun, who heads an alliance of defense experts based in Seoul, added that North Korea’s leader wants to show his people that he is taking a “bold stance” against the United States and Japan.

In London, meanwhile, foreign ministers from eight of the world’s leading economies denounced North Korea’s bellicose rhetoric “in the strongest possible terms” and warned that they would step up sanctions if the isolated nation conducts another missile launch or nuclear test.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A tabloid says Vladimir Putin is Russia's most eligible bachelor, but the president may have competition from an American half his age: Edward Snowden, the former U.S. spy agency contractor believed to be holed up at a Moscow airport.

Snowden, 30, has received a marriage proposal of sorts in a tweet from Anna Chapman, the glamorous redhead who was one of 10 Russian agents arrested in the United States and deported in a Cold war-style spy swap in 2010.

""Snowden, will you marry me?!"" a posting on a Twitter account bearing Chapman's name and photograph said late on Wednesday.

After a few hours with no reply, a second tweet appeared.

Anna Chapman was at the center of the biggest spy crisis between the United States and Russia since the Cold War as one of the US-based 'sleeper' agents. SERGEI CHIRIKOV / EPA

""@nsa, will you look after our children?"" it said, a wry reference, perhaps, to the surveillance powers of the U.S. National Security Agency.

Chapman, 31, did not immediately respond to an emailed query about the authenticity of the tweets and the proposal to Snowden, who is wanted by Washington on espionage charges.

Former NSA contractor Snowden is believed to have been living in a transit area in the Moscow airport since arriving on June 23. He has appealed to various countries for asylum.

Putin, 60, who praised Chapman and the other Russian agents deported from the United States, has separated from his wife, prompting the weekly Secrets of the Stars to speculate on his eligibility, under the headline: ""Any woman would marry Putin!""

Pollak'],This Iran Deal's Getting Worse All the Time,"The Obama administration has been forced to admit that the nuclear deal to which Iran agreed last weekend in Geneva, Switzlerland has not actually been finalized. In the interim, Iran is continuing its enrichment of uranium, as well as continuing construction on the Arak nuclear plant it is meant to suspend. And the White House is being criticized for misleading the public about the terms of the Iran deal, which keep getting worse.

The Washington Post noted, in an editorial otherwise supportive of the deal, that the Obama administration had not told the whole truth: “What the White House didn’t report is that the text of the accord makes several major concessions to Tehran on the terms of a planned second-stage agreement…the United States and its partners have already agreed that Iranian enrichment activity will continue indefinitely. In contrast, a long-standing U.S. demand that an underground enrichment facility be closed is not mentioned.”

Iran clearly expects that the deal will eventually lead to the end of all sanctions against the regime for its repeated violations of UN Security Council resolutions that ban any nuclear enrichment, and that it will see its so-called “right” to enrich uranium recognized either explicitly or de facto, without restrictions–and not in 15-20 years, as the administration has implied, but in a mere five years from the signing of the deal.

No one is quite sure when the deal begins, and when the six-month window contemplated under the terms will be over. So Iran continues to play for time, and the Obama administration, having accepted Iran’s nuclear enrichment in principle, is forced to accept interpretations of the deal that favor Iran, having lost the leverage sanctions once provided. As the line from The Empire Strikes Back goes: this deal’s getting worse all the time."

Politico reports that the meeting started at approximately 12:45 PM ET, and that it moved the normal press briefing to 1:45 PM ET. Jay Carney, White House press secretary, did not comment on whether the meeting took place.

Politico reports:

The off-the-record session was announced to reporters in the wake of an ABC News report showing that White House and State Dept. officials were involved in revising the now-discredited CIA talking points about the attack on Benghazi.

The administration routinely exerts pressure on reporters it feels are not kind enough in their coverage. Reporters like Cheryl Attkisson of CBS News have felt the hand of their bosses for “wading dangerously close to advocacy” with regard to Benghazi. No doubt this “off-the-record” meeting was designed to get all the president’s horses and all the president’s men to put the Benghazi humpty dumpty together again.

UPDATE: Reporters not invited to the off-the-record briefing are reportedly incredibly unhappy about it:

UPDATE II: Jake Tapper of CNN reports that the regularly scheduled press briefing has been delayed even further:

UPDATE III: Politico now reports that the meeting has been characterized as “deep background.” The existence of the meeting itself is considered “off-the-record.” White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, “Deep background means that the info presented by the briefers can be used in reporting but the briefers can’t be quoted.” So expect a fair number of “White House sources” to appear in reportage for the next few days.

UPDATE IV: Jay Carney began his on-the-record press briefing by announcing that 14 news organizations were invited to the closed door briefing, but that it was not a substitute for the on-the-record briefing. He then announced that it was “erroneous” to describe the briefing as “off-the-record,” and instead suggested it was “deep background.”

The United States and Iran have embarked on a new phase in their relationship. It is marked by bilateral negotiations, handshakes, smiles, side-by-side flags and significant compromise, including United States acquiescence to a “mutually defined enrichment program” for Iran in any long-term agreement and an Iranian commitment that “under no circumstances” will it “ever seek or develop any nuclear weapons.”

The six-month interim deal between major powers and Iran, renewable for a further six months pending a full accord (for a period to be defined), freezes Iran’s nuclear program about where it is — at a technologically advanced point short of militarization. But it fast-forwards American-Iranian relations and may thereby redraw the strategic map of the Middle East.

This explains Israel’s over-the-top “nyet,” its insistence that a deal heading off escalation makes the region more dangerous. Israel is the status-quo Middle Eastern power par excellence because the status quo cements its nuclear-armed domination. Any change is suspect, including popular Arab uprisings against despotism. As changes go, this U.S.-Iranian breakthrough is big, almost as big as an Israeli-Palestinian peace would be.

Just as the United States has had to adapt to a world where its power is unmatched but no longer determinant, Israel will have to do the same. With enlightened leadership this adaptation could strengthen the Jewish state, securing the nation through integration in its region rather than domination of it. For now Israel is some way from this mind-set. Its overriding prism is military. It was important that President Obama set down a marker, as he has through this deal, one that may spur new strategic reflection in Israel.

By KEN THOMAS and DONNA CASSATA, The Associated Press

WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama's plea to Congress for the go-ahead for military strikes against Syria is forcing ambitious Republicans weighing a White House bid to choose sides, as the party is bitterly divided over the U.S. role in foreign policy.

Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky remains unequivocal in his opposition, tangling with Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday over constitutional powers and the possibility that a U.S. attack will further destabilize the Mideast. The tea party favorite and leading anti-interventionist in the GOP sees only a downside to a U.S. attack.

""There's no sentiment in Kentucky, and the people up here are so out of touch,"" Paul told reporters on a conference call after a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing with Kerry and other national security officials. ""These senators who are going to vote for this, they need to go home and talk to their people or look at what their people are saying because people do not want to get involved in Syria and, despite what the people want, their senators are going to vote the opposite way, I have a bad feeling.""

Paul didn't rule out a Senate filibuster of a resolution authorizing the president to use military force.

""Whether there is an actual standing filibuster, I've got to check my shoes and see if I can hold my water,"" he said. ""We'll see. I haven't made a decision on that.""

Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a fierce foe of Syrian President Bashar Assad, expressed frustration with the Obama administration's handling of Syria and skepticism about U.S. involvement.

""When America ignores these problems, these problems don't ignore us,"" Rubio told senior administration officials at the Senate hearing. ""Yes, this is a horrible incident where perhaps 1,000 people died, but before this incident 100,000 people had died ... and nothing happened.""

The administration says it has proof that the Assad regime used deadly chemical weapons in an attack on Damascus suburbs and must respond. It places the number killed at 1,429 people, including 426 children. However, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights puts the death toll at 502.

Potential Republican presidential candidates hardly want to appear weak on national security, an issue that traditionally has been a strength for the GOP. But no one knows whether the United States would be drawn into a protracted conflict or if limited military steps would prove unsuccessful in the 2-year-old civil war.

Any Republican who supports the use of force resolution essentially will be siding with Obama, who is despised in conservative circles, and a vote in favor could anger more isolationist Republicans who are wary of getting involved in another military conflict after more than a decade of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The votes could dog Republican candidates with voters in early primary states such as Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Even the most nuanced explanation for a vote could be undermined by events on the ground.

Yet if Republicans oppose the resolution, they could be accused of giving Assad a pass after his regime used chemical weapons.

Republican strategist Steve Schmidt, who managed Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, said a vote in favor of the resolution would be the equivalent of ""a purchase of stock over the long term in Obama's decision-making on Syria.""

""Any Republican may go into a vote thinking, `I have given authority for a limited scope of action to the president,' but the reality is you're buying stock in the president's current decisions on Syria and also his future actions in any escalation that may occur,"" Schmidt said.

Polls show public opposition to U.S. military intervention in Syria, regardless of whether Syria's government used chemical weapons on its people, and doubts about airstrikes across party lines.

A war vote can make or break a candidate. Just ask Hillary Rodham Clinton.

In the 2008 Democratic primary, Obama used the October 2002 vote for the Iraq war as a cudgel against Clinton, who along with John Edwards voted to give President George W. Bush the broad authority to invade Iraq. Edwards said his vote was a mistake; Clinton stood by her decision - and never recovered with strong anti-war Democratic voters.

Clinton, a potential Democratic candidate in 2016, has not spoken publicly about Obama's attempt to win congressional support for a military strike against Syria. But an aide to Clinton said Tuesday that she supports the president's effort in Congress to pursue a targeted response to the Assad regime's alleged use of chemical weapons.

In 2004, the first presidential election since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, Democratic primary voters rejected the anti-war candidate, Howard Dean, and nominated John Kerry, the decorated Vietnam War veteran who had backed the Iraq war. Kerry was perceived as the stronger candidate on national security against the incumbent president, but he stumbled in explaining his Iraq war votes, saying he voted for an $87 billion war supplemental ""before I voted against it."" Bush prevailed in the election.

For Republicans, the debate over Syria foreshadows a fierce argument in the party over the role of U.S. foreign policy and military involvement after Iraq and Afghanistan. The divisions have been simmering for months.

Paul conducted a lengthy Senate filibuster in March to raise concerns over the president's use of aerial drones to kill suspected terrorists, rallying libertarians within the party. Some establishment Republicans opposed the filibuster and pushed back against criticism of the National Security Agency's collection of hundreds of millions of U.S. phone records, saying it was needed to keep Americans safe.

In July, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called the libertarian strain within the GOP a ""very dangerous thought"" more than a decade after the Sept. 11 attacks. Paul responded, saying Christie was worried about the ""dangers of freedom"" instead of being concerned about losing those freedoms.

As Obama has pushed for the U.S. to intervene in Syria, the GOP divisions have emerged.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has expressed skepticism about possible intervention, saying the administration has yet to make a forceful case that it would protect U.S. national security interests.

The Syria question is easier to avoid outside Washington.

Christie, asked about the Syrian conflict Tuesday, told reporters the ""use of chemical weapons is something that just is intolerable for civilized society,"" but he said he would ""let the policymaking be done by the people who are getting the bulk of the briefing on this, which is our federal representatives."""

Gen. John R. Allen, who commands the international forces in Afghanistan, had wanted to keep the bulk of the 66,000 U.S. troops in place through the summer, traditionally the heaviest months of fighting against Taliban insurgents.

But in recent weeks Allen’s advisors and top Obama administration officials have developed a timetable for steady reductions that would reduce troop levels to fewer than 66,000 this summer and to 25,000-30,000 in spring 2014, with further withdrawals later that year, the officials said.

The emerging consensus has narrowed the split between the Pentagon and the White House over the extent to which the U.S. needs to remain engaged militarily in Afghanistan to prevent the country from slipping back into lawlessness and civil war after the bulk of foreign troops withdraw.

The administration is still discussing the size of the American force that will remain in Afghanistan after 2014, talks that will intensify this week when Afghan President Hamid Karzai meets President Obama at the White House. Pentagon officials are pushing for 6,000 to 9,000 troops, though White House aides are considering a force of 3,000 or even fewer.

The plan to accelerate the pace of the U.S. drawdown has emerged as military planners have examined the cost and logistical complexity of waiting until next year to bring out tens of thousands of troops, the officials said.

Keeping troop levels near 60,000 would require the Pentagon to extend deployments of troops currently on nine-month deployments or to send additional units for short tours, officials said, noting that neither option is likely to be popular with the public or the White House.

Deputy national security advisor Ben Rhodes told reporters Tuesday that Obama “is committed to continuing steady reductions,” and that “we are not going to plateau at” 66,000 until 2014 “and then remove our troops.”

At the same time, U.S. officials want to keep as many as 30,000 troops in Afghanistan through April 2014, when the nation is scheduled to hold elections to choose Karzai’s successor. That size force is considered large enough to serve as a deterrent to efforts by the Taliban to disrupt the elections or by presidential contenders to seize power by force, officials said.

Many senior military officers remain deeply concerned that the post-2014 U.S. troop presence under consideration is too small to meaningfully assist the fledgling Afghan security forces. But these officers acknowledge that they are unlikely to win the argument with a White House that is intent on reducing the U.S. footprint as much as possible.

Rhodes did not rule out the possibility that Obama could eventually decide to leave no U.S. troops in Afghanistan after 2014. The “zero option” would be considered, he said.

Whether or not troops remain, the U.S. will help Afghanistan with training, equipment and aid, Rhodes said.

Earlier concern among senior U.S. commanders that a rapid U.S. withdrawal could jeopardize security has eased as many Afghan army and police units have successfully taken over security responsibilities in some areas.

“That’s a surprising fact, so with that variable in play you have more room to maneuver,” said a U.S. official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

The Obama administration is also making a renewed push for peace talks with some factions of the Taliban, in hope that reducing the strength of the insurgency will make it easier for Afghan security forces, which now number nearly 352,000, to handle security with limited U.S. backing.

“We believe ultimately that [negotiating ] is an essential part of a process that would lead to a more peaceful and stable Afghanistan,” White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters.

(CNN) —

Diplomatic tensions between the United States and Venezuela showed no signs of slowing Monday as the State Department announced that two Venezuelan diplomats had been expelled.

Orlando Jose Montanez Olivares and Victor Camacaro Mata were declared personae non gratae and ordered to leave the country in response to the South American nation’s decision to kick out two U.S. officials last week, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters.

“Around the world, when our people are thrown out unjustly, we’re going to take reciprocal action,” she said. “We need to do that to protect our own people.”

The expulsion of the Venezuelan diplomats comes after Venezuelan officials – just hours before announcing President Hugo Chavez’s death last week – said they were expelling two U.S. Embassy officials and accused them of plotting to destabilize the country.

“In the day or days that followed there was some pretty heated rhetoric coming in our direction,” Nuland said Monday. “I think I called it at one point a page from the old ‘Chavista’ playbook that we were hoping was going to change. … There is work that we would like to do together, particularly in the areas of counter-terrorism, counternarcotics, economics and energy relations, but it’s going to take a change of tone from Caracas.”

The expelled Venezuelan diplomats have left the United States, Nuland said. Camacaro worked in the Venezuelan Consulate in New York, and Montanez worked at the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington, she said.

The expelled U.S. officials, both air attaches at the U.S. Embassy in Caracas, were accused of having meetings with members of the Venezuelan military and encouraging them to pursue “destabilizing projects,” Venezuelan Foreign Minister Elias Jaua said.

“We will not allow any foreign interference in our country,” Jaua said last week.

Nicolas Maduro, then vice president and now Venezuela’s interim leader, also suggested as he criticized the U.S. Embassy officials last week that someone had deliberately infected Chavez with cancer.

State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell denied the accusations.

“This fallacious assertion of inappropriate U.S. action leads us to conclude that, unfortunately, the current Venezuelan government is not interested an improved relationship,” he said.

It isn’t the first time that diplomatic tensions have surged between the two countries.

Last year the State Department declared Venezuela’s consul general in Miami persona non grata – Latin for unwelcome or unacceptable person – and expelled her from the United States. In 2008, Venezuela expelled the U.S. ambassador to the South American country. A day later, the United States said it was expelling the Venezuelan ambassador.

He Left The Times In']",Iran nuclear deal foes rein in criticism,"WASHINGTON — As they prepare for battle over the new deal to limit Iran’s nuclear program, the accord’s supporters and foes are calibrating strategies based on their reading of Americans’ conflicted views about the Islamic Republic.

American war-weariness forms a big part of the Obama administration’s campaign for the accord, a preliminary agreement to curb Iran’s disputed nuclear program. Administration officials have said that without a diplomatic deal, the country would be on a “march to war.”

For now, the administration appears to have the upper hand. Many skeptics of the deal, who issued sharp criticism shortly after its announcement, have since muted their words.

Instead of attacking the agreement directly, opponents have pinned their hopes on continued American suspicion of Iran and its leaders. They expect the government in Tehran to fail to meet its obligations under the agreement and are poised to go on the offensive if that happens.

“Critics of the deal are reluctant to attack it too frontally because they realize how popular it is,” said Dylan Williams, legislative director for J Street, a liberal pro-Israel group that supports the deal.

Polls suggest that support for the deal is strong now but could easily decline. Americans are deeply reluctant to embark on a new Middle East war. At the same time, however, Americans have consistently held negative views of Iran since the hostage crisis during the Carter administration.

For years, many Americans have said in surveys that they would support military action if that was necessary to prevent Tehran from obtaining a nuclear bomb. A June poll by the Pew Research Center found 64% support among Americans for such intervention.

Now, however, a Reuters-Ipsos survey released Tuesday showed 44% of respondents supported the new accord; 22% opposed it. If the deal failed, 49% would favor more sanctions, 31% wanted more diplomacy, and 20% wanted to turn to military force.

“The appetite for military engagement anywhere is very low,” said pollster Julia Clark of Ipsos. After two wars that were far longer and costlier than expected, “we in the public feel burned.”

Even so, Clark said, opinions on the deal could change because Americans are uncertain about its complexity and have negative views about Iran, which has been at odds with the United States since the 1979 revolution. She noted that about one-third of the poll’s respondents weren’t sure how they felt.

“There’s real hesitation here,” she said.

The preliminary agreement between Iran and six world powers, including the U.S., was announced Sunday in Geneva. It would temporarily ease some of the sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy in return for a halt to key aspects of the country’s nuclear program.

The deal is intended to allow time to negotiate a comprehensive agreement on the nuclear program. Iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but officials of many countries believe the effort is aimed at developing at least the capability to build a nuclear weapon.

Opponents of the deal have called for new sanctions, saying that greater pressure could force Iran to yield more. The Obama administration calls that unrealistic and says new sanctions could derail any chance for diplomacy to succeed.

In a videotaped message designed to sell the deal to Congress, Secretary of State John F. Kerry said the negotiators had moved to prevent Iran from acquiring a bomb “in the most effective way: We did it through diplomacy.”

A number of key lawmakers who have criticized the agreement have said they support additional sanctions but are ready to hold off unless signs emerge of Iran not holding up its part of the deal.

Sens. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), ranking minority member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called for deferred sanctions.

Israeli officials have strenuously opposed the accord, and lawmakers who support Israel have been prominent among the deal’s critics. But statements from major pro-Israel organizations in the United States have been relatively mild.

The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the leading pro-Israel lobby, cited “serious concerns” that Iran could still develop a bomb even if the two sides reached a final deal. But AIPAC said new sanctions should be imposed only if Iran violated the agreement or failed to agree to an acceptable final deal.

Another major American Jewish group, the Anti-Defamation League, said it was “deeply concerned” about the “flaws” in the deal. But instead of calling for sanctions, it committed itself to “work to promote a final agreement which ensures Iran is incapable of building a nuclear weapon.”

An official of another pro-Israel group, who declined to be identified, citing the sensitivity of the issue, said many in the organization were reluctant to be seen as trying to block the deal, especially at a time when the issue was straining relations between Israel and the Obama administration.

Mark Wallace, chief executive of the advocacy group United Against Nuclear Iran, acknowledged that the deal had support, but predicted that the backing would fade “when people begin to digest and understand the agreement.”

Clark, of Ipsos, said that could happen. The Reuters-Ipsos survey found “some hedging” in reactions because of the uncertainty about the details of the deal, she said.

But the uncertainty of public opinion creates risks for both supporters and opponents, she said. “If there’s a sudden great surge of confidence, people may not want to be on the record as being against it.”

USA TODAY

Snowden is seeking ultimate refuge in Latin America

He wants to stay temporarily in Russia

U.S.-Russia relations under strain

Intelligence leaker Edward Snowden formally submitted an application for temporary asylum in Russia on Tuesday, his lawyer said.

Snowden argued in his application that he needs asylum because ""he faces persecution by the U.S. government and he fears for his life and safety, fears that he could be subjected to torture and capital punishment,"" lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said on Russian television.

The former NSA systems analyst has been living in the transit zone of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport since arriving from Hong Kong on June 23. Snowden said Friday at a meeting with Russian rights activists and public figures that he would seek at least temporary refuge in Russia until he could fly to one of the Latin American nations that have offered him asylum.

The application may not be welcome news to President Vladimir Putin.

Putin has characterized the National Security Agency leaker's long stay at a Moscow airport as an unwelcome present foisted on Russia by the U.S. He says the U.S. intimidated other countries against accepting Snowden, effectively blocking him from flying further.

When asked about Snowden's future, Russia media quoted Putin as saying, ""Such a present to us. Merry Christmas.""

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/world/europe/us-russian-ties-still-fall-short-of-reset-goal.html,2013-09-03 00:00:00,['Peter Baker'],U.S.-Russian Ties Still Fall Short of ‘Reset’ Goal,"WASHINGTON — Just days before Vladimir V. Putin reassumed the presidency of Russia last year, President Obama dispatched his national security adviser to Moscow. Mr. Obama had made considerable progress with Dmitri A. Medvedev, the caretaker president, and wanted to preserve the momentum.

Any hopes of that, however, were quickly dashed when Mr. Putin sat down with the visiting American adviser, Tom Donilon, at the lavish presidential residence outside Moscow. Rather than talk of cooperation, Mr. Putin opened the meeting with a sharp challenge underscoring his deep suspicion of American ambitions:

“When,” he asked pointedly, “are you going to start bombing Syria?”

At the time, Mr. Obama had no plans for military involvement in the civil war raging in the heart of the Middle East, but Mr. Putin did not believe that. In Mr. Putin’s view, the United States wanted only to meddle in places where it had no business, fomenting revolutions to install governments friendly to Washington.

The meeting 16 months ago set the stage for a tense new chapter in Russian-American relations, one that will play out publicly this week when Mr. Obama travels to St. Petersburg for a Group of 20 summit meeting hosted by Mr. Putin. Although Mr. Obama had no intention of bombing Syria last year, on Saturday he said he now favored military action against Syrian forces, not to depose the government of Bashar al-Assad, a Russian ally, but in retaliation for gassing its own citizens — an assertion Mr. Putin denounced as “utter nonsense” to justify American intervention.

While it was the Kremlin’s decision last month to shelter Edward J. Snowden, the National Security Agency leaker, that finally prompted Mr. Obama to call off a separate one-on-one meeting he had scheduled with Mr. Putin while in Russia, the core of the schism is not so much that case as the radically different worldviews revealed by the Syria dispute. Where Mr. Obama feels compelled to take action to curb the use of unconventional weapons, Mr. Putin sees American imperialism at work again."

(CNN) —

The U.S. Justice Department will not seek the death penalty for U.S. intelligence leaker Edward Snowden, Attorney General Eric Holder wrote to Russian authorities in a letter dated July 23.

In the letter, Holder says Snowden’s arguments for temporary asylum in Russia are without merit.

Snowden is seeking asylum because he claims he will be tortured and face the death penalty if returned to the United States.

But the death penalty is not an option given the current charges against Snowden, and even if additional charges are filed, the United States would still not seek capital punishment, Holder wrote.

Once back in the United States, Snowden would not be tortured and would face a civilian trial with a lawyer appointed to him, the attorney general wrote.

“We believe that these assurances eliminate these asserted grounds for Mr. Snowden’s claim that he should be treated as a refugee or granted asylum,” Holder wrote.

Snowden did not access ‘crown jewels’ of NSA intel, official says

He also said it is untrue that Snowden cannot travel because his U.S. passport was revoked. Snowden is still a U.S. citizen and is eligible for a limited-validity passport that would authorize a direct return to the United States.

“The United States is willing to immediately issue such a passport to Mr. Snowden,” Holder wrote.

Father asks Obama to rein in Holder

In a letter released Friday, Snowden’s father called on President Barack Obama to order Holder to dismiss the criminal complaint filed against his son.

Lon Snowden defended his son’s actions, comparing them to acts of civil disobedience.

“We are also appalled at your administration’s scorn for due process, the rule of law, fairness and the presumption of innocence as regards Edward,” the letter said.

Earlier in the day, Lon Snowden said on NBC’s “Today” that Snowden did the right thing by leaking U.S. intelligence and helping Americans see the truth.

“I think my son, when he takes his final breath, whether it’s today or 100 years from now, (will) be comfortable with what he did,” he said. “He did what he knew was right. He shared the truth with the American people. What we choose to do with it is up to us as a people.”

Lon Snowden expressed his disappointment with the recent House vote that continued funding for the spy program that Edward Snowden exposed.

There is a need for a strong intelligence community, Lon Snowden said, but many who voted for continued funding for the program are really looking out for the special interests that will benefit.

“It’s all about the money,” he said.

The father said he has not been in direct contact with his son, but there has been indirect contact through intermediaries.

The intermediaries do not include WikiLeaks, Lon Snowden said, but he added that he is thankful to that group for aiding his son.

“I’m thankful for anybody at this point that is providing him with assistance to keep him safe and secure,” he said.

U.S., Russian officials continue talks

Meanwhile, the Kremlin said that the Russian security agency FSB is talking to American officials.

“The situation around Snowden is not being discussed at the top level. There’s a discussion between heads of FSB and FBI,” the Kremlin press office said.

A spokesman for Vladimir Putin said the Russian president “expressed a firm intention to not allow” further damage to U.S. interests, including a pledge by Snowden not to release any more intelligence. “And I have no doubt this is how it will be, no matter how the situation develops,” the spokesman said, according to the Russian news agency RIA Novosti.

The many mysteries of Snowden’s transit zone

Snowden isn’t yet allowed to step outside the Moscow airport where he’s been confined for weeks. He is waiting for permission to stay elsewhere in Russia while his request for temporary asylum is considered.

He has been searching for a place to settle after the United States charged him with espionage.

The former National Security Agency contractor, who admitted last month to revealing sweeping U.S. electronic surveillance programs to the news media, left Hong Kong for Moscow on June 23.

Snowden may remain stuck in the transit area for weeks and maybe months, the head of Russia’s migration service, Vladimir Volokh, told the Russian news agency Interfax. The maximum length of time Snowden can spend at the airport is six months, he said.

If you’re trying to decide what to think about the deal struck between the major powers and Iran in Geneva, here’s a suggestion – imagine what would have happened if there had been no deal.

In fact, one doesn’t have to use much imagination. In 2003, Iran approached the United States with an offer to talk about its nuclear program. The George W. Bush administration rejected the offer because it believed that the Iranian regime was weak, had been battered by sanctions, and would either capitulate or collapse if Washington just stayed tough.

So there was no deal. What was the result? Iran had 164 centrifuges operating in 2003; today it has 19,000 centrifuges. Had the Geneva talks with Iran broken down, Iran would have continued expanding its nuclear program. Yes they are now under tough sanctions, but they were under sanctions then as well.

More from CNN: 20 questions about the deal

And yet, the number of centrifuges grew exponentially (Despite all the sanctions and sabotage, keep in mind, the costs of a nuclear program are small for an oil rich country like Iran.)

Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has been opposed to a deal. But is it in Israel’s interest that Iran’s program keep growing in size and scope? That’s a strategy that assumes that either Iran is heading for collapse, or that a military strike will take place that would permanently destroy Iran’s entire nuclear program. This seems more like wishful thinking than tough strategizing.

The agreement that the major powers have gotten in Geneva essentially freezes Iran’s program for six months – and rolls back some key aspects of it – while a permanent deal is negotiated. In return, Iran gets about $7 billion of sanctions relief, a fraction of what is in place against it. The main sanctions – against its oil and banking sectors – stay fully in place.

More from GPS: What would JFK have done about Iran?

This is a sensible deal – signed off on by France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China – but it is just an interim deal and not a historic rapprochement. And that’s why so much of the opposition to it is misplaced.

Washington has many points of disagreement with Tehran, from its opposition to Israel and its support of Hezbollah to its funding of Iraq militias. This is not like the opening to China – it’s more like an arms control deal with the Soviet Union, with two wary adversaries trying to find some common ground.

Many countries in the Middle East – from Israel to Saudi Arabia – have legitimate concerns about Iran. But many of these countries have also gotten used to having a permanent enemy against whom they could rail, focusing domestic attention, driving ideological and sectarian divides, and garnering support.

The Middle East is undergoing so much change. Perhaps this is one more change. And perhaps Iran will come in from the Cold. For now, this deal is just one step, not a seismic shift. But it is still a step forward."

USA TODAY

President Obama deals with a pair of knotty problems Monday: Tensions in the Middle East, and the possibility of a government shutdown in the United States.

In the late morning, Obama discusses the Iranian nuclear program during an Oval Office meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

The Netanyahu visit comes three days after Obama spoke by phone with Iranian President Hasan Rouhani, the first direct contact between American and Iranian leaders in more than three decades.

Obama and Rouhani ordered their staffs to explore new talks on an agreement over Iran's nuclear program -- though Netanyahu and other Israeli officials warn that Iran is still seeking the means to make nuclear weapons.

Other Obama-Netanyahu topics: Talks about chemical weapons removal in Syria, and the long-standing dispute between Israelis and Palestinians.

""The president looks forward to discussing with Prime Minister Netanyahu the progress on final status negotiations with the Palestinians, as well as developments in Iran, Syria, and elsewhere in the region,"" says the White House schedule.

The White House adds: ""Prime Minister Netanyahu's visit is a demonstration of the deep and enduring bonds between the United States and Israel, and our close coordination on a range of security issues.""

Obama and Netanyahu, along with Vice President Biden, will also have a working lunch.

Later Monday, Obama meets with his Cabinet, with the prospect of a government shutdown on the agenda.

Monday is the last day of the fiscal year, and the Republican-run House passed a new spending plan over the weekend that calls for a one-year delay of the new health care plan — a condition that Obama and the Democratic-run Senate reject.

If the parties are unable to strike a deal by midnight, parts of the government will shut down.

Tuesday is also a big day for the health care plan — the opening of market exchanges that are the key to financing the project."

Washington has already approved sales of the new stealth fighter to a range of allies, including Turkey, South Korea, Japan and Israel, but sales to the Gulf require a deeper review given U.S. policy guidelines that call for Israel to maintain a qualitative military edge in the Middle East. Talk about selling the plane to the United Arab Emirates and other U.S. allies in the Gulf came into the open during the Dubai air show last month, with potential buyers weighing whether to buy existing planes or wait for the U.S. government to release the new radar-evading F-35. Government officials and industry experts have said they do not expect Washington to allow the sale of the F-35 to Gulf countries until around 2020, just short of five years after Israel receives its first F-35 fighters in 2016. The senior U.S. official said the depth of interest in the new fighter - the Pentagon's most expensive weapons program - from Gulf countries came as a surprise to some in the U.S. government. ""We in the Defense Department now recognize that there is significant interest there,"" said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. ""We knew eventually we were going to have to face that question, but it's come upon us a little sooner than we thought and we're going to have to deal with it."" Decisions about releasing sensitive technologies for sale to foreign countries are made by the State Department in consultation with the Pentagon and other government agencies. ""Eventually we're going to have to make a decision. We have a very structured process in place for doing that. And it takes a little bit of time,"" said the official. ""But we are going to have to make decisions on a tighter timeline than we thought."" U.S. government officials and weapons makers have put a bigger focus on foreign arms sales in recent years as a way to offset declines in projected U.S. military spending, and buttress the Obama administration's drive to build partnerships and help U.S. allies beef up their own military capacities. The United States is particularly concerned about reassuring Gulf nations that Washington remains committed to Middle East security despite differences over Iran and Syria. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel traveled to Bahrain this week and is expected to deliver that message during a meeting with regional defense officials on Saturday. Lockheed is building three F-35 models for the U.S. military and eight countries that helped fund its development: Britain, Canada, Australia, Italy, Norway, Turkey, Denmark and the Netherlands. Israel and Japan have also ordered the jet, and South Korea signaled last month that it also expected to order the F-35. ""The interest in the airplane is coming about simply because it's getting more mature and people are finally realizing that it's really going to happen,"" said the official. The $392 billion F-35 program has seen repeated delays and a 70 percent increase in costs over initial estimates, but U.S. officials say the program is making good progress now. Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan told a defense conference on Wednesday that the program had a ""tragic past,"" but the cost of the plane was coming down, flight testing was continuing, and most technical issues had been addressed.

In a separate case last year, F.B.I. agents asked the White House, the Defense Department and intelligence agencies for phone and e-mail logs showing exchanges with a New York Times reporter writing about computer attacks on Iran. Agents grilled officials about their contacts with him, two people familiar with the investigation said.

And agents tracing the leak of a highly classified C.I.A. report on North Korea to a Fox News reporter pulled electronic archives showing which officials had gained access to the report and had contact with the reporter on the day of the leak.

Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.).

McCaskill said Thursday at a Senate hearing that the investigation into USIS, whose original name was US Investigations Services, is based on the “systemic failure to adequately conduct investigations under its contract” with the federal government.

In a statement, USIS said it “has never been informed that it is under criminal investigation.” The company said it received a subpoena for records from OPM’s inspector general in January 2012 and fully cooperated with “the government’s civil investigative efforts.”

The company declined to confirm whether it had screened Snowden, saying the thousands of investigations it conducts for the government are confidential.

Snowden was working for another Virginia government contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton, when he disclosed details of National Security Agency surveillance of U.S. citizens. The case has thrown a spotlight on the government’s reliance on contractors for sensitive tasks. In 2011, more than 4.2 million government and contract workers had security clearances, and more than a third of them had top-secret access.

McCaskill spokesman Drew Pusateri said McCaskill was told of the investigation by OPM’s inspector general.

Patrick McFarland, the inspector general for OPM, told the committee that there are concerns about USIS’s background check into Snowden. “Yes, we do believe that there — there may be some problems,” McFarland said at the hearing, according to the Reuters news agency.

According to its Web site, privately held USIS has 100 contracts to provide background checks for more than 95 federal agencies. The company was established in July 1996 “as a result of the privatization of the investigative branch of the Office of Personnel Management,” according to the Web site.

The company’s has more than 6,700 employees, and its clients include the departments of Justice, State, Homeland Security and Defense, plus about a dozen intelligence agencies, including the NSA and the National Reconnaissance Office. USIS is part of Altegrity, which is in turn owned by Providence Equity Partners."

Scrapping equipment key to Afghan drawdown

Facing a tight withdrawal deadline and tough terrain, the U.S. military has destroyed more than 170 million pounds worth of vehicles and other military equipment as it rushes to wind down its role in the Afghanistan war by the end of 2014.

The massive disposal effort, which U.S. military officials call unprecedented, has unfolded largely out of sight amid an ongoing debate inside the Pentagon about what to do with the heaps of equipment that won’t be returning home. Military planners have determined that they will not ship back more than $7 billion worth of equipment — about 20 percent of what the U.S. military has in Afghanistan — because it is no longer needed or would be too costly to ship back home.

That has left the Pentagon in a quandary about what to do with the items. Bequeathing a large share to the Afghan government would be challenging because of complicated rules governing equipment donations to other countries, and there is concern that Afghanistan’s fledgling forces would be unable to maintain it. Some gear may be sold or donated to allied nations, but few are likely to be able to retrieve it from the war zone.

Therefore, much of it will continue to be shredded, cut and crushed to be sold for pennies per pound on the Afghan scrap market — a process that reflects a presumptive end to an era of protracted ground wars. The destruction of tons of equipment is all but certain to raise sharp questions in Afghanistan and the United States about whether the Pentagon’s approach is fiscally responsible and whether it should find ways to leave a greater share to the Afghans.

“We’re making history doing what we’re doing here,” said Maj. Gen. Kurt J. Stein, head of the 1st Sustainment Command, who is overseeing the drawdown in Afghanistan. “This is the largest retrograde mission in history.”

The most contentious and closely watched part of the effort involves the disposal of Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, the hulking beige personnel carriers that the Pentagon raced to build starting in 2007 to counter the threat of roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan. The massive trucks, known as MRAPs, came to symbolize the bloody evolution of wars that were meant to be short conflicts but turned into quagmires.

The Pentagon has determined that it will no longer have use for about 12,300 of its 25,500 MRAPs scattered at bases worldwide, officials said. In Afghanistan, the military has labeled about 2,000 of its roughly 11,000 MRAPs “excess.” About 9,000 will be shipped to the United States and U.S. military bases in Kuwait and elsewhere, but the majority of the unwanted vehicles — which cost about $1 million each — will probably be shredded, officials said, because they are unlikely to find clients willing to come pick them up.

“MRAPs have served us well in the current war, but we will not need all that we bought for Iraq and Afghanistan in the future,” Alan Estevez, the assistant secretary of defense for logistics and materiel readiness, said in a statement. “It is cost prohibitive to retrograde and reset MRAPs that we do not need for the future.”

‘Gold dust’

Those MRAPs that the Pentagon has deemed unnecessary have been arriving by the dozen at scrap yards at four U.S. military bases in Afghanistan in recent months. Toiling under the searing sun last week at this vast base in southern Kandahar province, contract workers from Nepal and other countries in the region wore fireproof suits and masks as they used special blowtorches to dismantle vehicles built to withstand deadly blasts. It takes about 12 hours to tear apart each MRAP.

In another section of the scrap yard, a massive grinder gobbled slabs of steel, turning them into small scraps. The debris is packed into U.S.-owned shipping containers that also have been deemed unfit to return home.

Last month, the Kandahar yard produced 11 million pounds of scrap that was sold to Afghan contractors for a few cents per pound, said Morgan Gunn, a Defense Logistics Agency employee who runs the site. Afghans use the scrap mainly for construction and as makeshift spare parts.

“Gold dust is what they call it,” Gunn said.

Military officials have drawn little attention to the scrapping operations, mindful that the endeavor might appear wasteful in an era of contracting defense budgets and misguided at a time when Afghan troops are being killed at a record rate. But officials argue that the effort is part of a withdrawal operation that is being carried out in a fiscally responsible, carefully planned manner.

“One might ask: Why not give it to the Afghans?” Stein said as he toured the Kandahar yard. “It’s such a fast-paced operation, and most of it is trash. We don’t want to leave this in the battlefield.”

As they have debated how much excess equipment to shred or sell, officials have considered whether the defense industry would suffer if the Pentagon unloaded tons of used equipment on the market at vastly reduced prices. Additionally, Pentagon policy requires that allied nations seeking to take ownership of excess U.S. equipment travel to Afghanistan to pick it up — an onerous task that few nations are likely to take on.

When the U.S. military withdrew from Iraq, it donated much of its equipment to the Iraqis, who had access to cheap fuel, a robust defense budget and more sophisticated mechanics. The Pentagon also shipped a significant share to Afghanistan, where a troop surge was underway. But donating MRAPs to the Afghans would be more complicated and potentially counterproductive, military officials said.

“Frankly, in a lot of ways, the Afghan economy and military can’t absorb some of the things the Iraqis did,” said Lt. Gen. Raymond V. Mason, the Army deputy chief of staff for logistics. “We don’t want to give [the Afghans] a lot of equipment that they can’t handle and could compound their challenges.”

Military officials said they have spent billions of dollars equipping and building up Afghanistan’s security forces over the past decade, outfitting them with lighter tactical vehicles that are a better fit for the country’s rudimentary road networks.

A situation unlike in Iraq

The U.S. Army owns the lion’s share of the military equipment currently in Afghanistan. As of May, Mason said, $25 billion worth of equipment was deployed with Army personnel. After an analysis of needs and costs, it has decided to ship back no more than 76 percent. Transporting that much will cost $2 billion to $3 billion, the Army estimates. And repairing the gear that comes back will cost $8 billion to $9 billion.

Stein, the general overseeing the Afghanistan drawdown, headed the same process in Iraq, which turned out to be a far easier mission. For starters, the U.S. military had a relatively well-

organized system in place to hand over bases and equipment to the Iraqi government 21 / 2 years before American troops pulled out entirely. Security was more permissive. And, crucially, the U.S. military could use its large bases in next-door Kuwait as a staging ground for items driven out of Iraq.

“Kuwait was a lifesaver,” Stein said, noting that there are no neighboring U.S. bases where equipment leaving Afghanistan could be easily stored. “It’s very hard to get our stuff out of Afghanistan. In Iraq, we could drive it out to Kuwait, and it sat there for a year or two until the Army decided its disposition.”

As the U.S. military reduces its footprint in Afghanistan from 150 bases to 50 by February, Stein’s teams are ramping up their efforts, finding more efficient ways of sorting through equipment to be shipped and drawing from lessons learned in Iraq.

Until a few months ago, the military flew out the vast majority of the equipment it was sending back to the United States.

In recent months, after Pakistan, a neighbor of landlocked Afghanistan, agreed to let the U.S. military use its roads to ship materiel out through its ports, most containers that don’t include sensitive materials or weapons are being trucked out by land. Shipping through Pakistan is by no means trouble-free — and officials recognize that the route could get shut down in the event of a new spat between Islamabad and Washington.

“We continue to get delays. There’s still corruption, taxes, tariffs,” Stein said. “But our equipment is getting through.”"

(CNN) —

A former U.S. soldier has been arrested and charged with illegally using a weapon on behalf of an al Qaeda-affiliated group in Syria.

Eric Harroun, 30, of Phoenix was arrested Tuesday night by the FBI at a hotel near Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia. A Justice Department official tells CNN that FBI agents questioned Harroun at the hotel, then took him into custody.

Harroun appeared Thursday in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, and was charged in connection with his alleged use of a rocket-propelled grenade in Syria.

The law used to charge him states, “Any national of the United States who, without lawful authority, uses or threatens, attempts, or conspires to use a weapon of mass destruction outside of the U.S. shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for life, or if death results, may be punished by death.”

Harroun served with the U.S. Army from 2000 to 2003. He is not charged with targeting U.S. troops in Iraq.

The organization he allegedly fought with, al-Nusra Front, is one of several aliases used by the al Qaeda in Iraq terrorist organization. The organization claims responsibility for nearly 600 terrorist attacks in Syria, the Justice Department said.

An FBI affidavit says Harroun crossed into Syria in January 2013 and fought against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces. He posted photos and videos of himself on the Internet handling RPGs and other weapons, it said.

The Pentagon declined to comment on Harroun’s arrest. However, “It’s always a concern when terrorist networks in that part of the world and elsewhere seek to recruit Americans, whether they’re in the military or not,” spokesman George Little told CNN’s Erin Burnett.

“I don’t think this is a widespread phenomenon, and most of our people in this country – and certainly most men and women in the military – would not consider joining a terrorist network,” Little added.

The secret move, described briefly in a draft report by the Pentagon's inspector general, set off no alarms within the Obama administration even though it appears to have sidestepped federal rules and perhaps also the Freedom of Information Act.

An acknowledgement by Adm. William McRaven of his actions was quietly removed from the final version of an inspector general's report published weeks ago. A spokesman for the admiral declined to comment. The CIA, noting that the bin Laden mission was overseen by then-CIA Director Leon Panetta before he became defense secretary, said that the SEALs were effectively assigned to work temporarily for the CIA, which has presidential authority to conduct covert operations.

""Documents related to the raid were handled in a manner consistent with the fact that the operation was conducted under the direction of the CIA director,"" agency spokesman Preston Golson said in an emailed statement. ""Records of a CIA operation such as the (bin Laden) raid, which were created during the conduct of the operation by persons acting under the authority of the CIA Director, are CIA records.""

Golson said it is ""absolutely false"" that records were moved to the CIA to avoid the legal requirements of the Freedom of Information Act.

The records transfer was part of an effort by McRaven to protect the names of the personnel involved in the raid, according to the inspector general's draft report.

But secretly moving the records allowed the Pentagon to tell The Associated Press that it couldn't find any documents inside the Defense Department that AP had requested more than two years ago, and could represent a new strategy for the U.S. government to shield even its most sensitive activities from public scrutiny.

""Welcome to the shell game in place of open government,"" said Thomas Blanton, director of the National Security Archive, a private research institute at George Washington University. ""Guess which shell the records are under. If you guess the right shell, we might show them to you. It's ridiculous.""

McRaven's directive sent the only copies of the military's records about its daring raid to the CIA, which has special authority to prevent the release of ""operational files"" in ways that can't effectively be challenged in federal court. The Defense Department can prevent the release of its own military files, too, citing risks to national security. But that can be contested in court, and a judge can compel the Pentagon to turn over non-sensitive portions of records.

Under federal rules, transferring government records from one executive agency to another must be approved in writing by the National Archives and Records Administration. There are limited circumstances when prior approval is not required, such as when the records are moved between two components of the same executive department. The CIA and Special Operations Command are not part of the same department.

The Archives was not aware of any request from the U.S. Special Operations Command to transfer its records to the CIA, spokeswoman Miriam Kleiman said. She said it was the Archives' understanding that the military records belonged to the CIA, so transferring them wouldn't have required permission under U.S. rules.

Special Operations Command also is required to comply with rules established by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that dictate how long records must be retained. Its July 2012 manual requires that records about military operations and planning are to be considered permanent and after 25 years, following a declassification review, transferred to the Archives.

Also, the Federal Records Act would not permit agencies ""to purge records just on a whim,"" said Dan Metcalfe, who oversaw the U.S. government's compliance with the Freedom of Information Act as former director of the Justice Department's Office of Information and Privacy. ""I don't think there's an exception allowing an agency to say, `Well, we didn't destroy it. We just deleted it here after transmitting it over there.' High-level officials ought to know better.""

It was not immediately clear exactly which Defense Department records were purged and transferred, when it happened or under what authority, if any, they were sent to the CIA. No government agencies the AP contacted would discuss details of the transfer. The timing may be significant: The Freedom of Information Act generally applies to records under an agency's control when a request for them is received. The AP asked for files about the mission in more than 20 separate requests, mostly submitted in May 2011 -- several were sent a day after Obama announced that the world's most wanted terrorist had been killed in a firefight. Obama has pledged to make his administration the most transparent in U.S. history.

The AP asked the Defense Department and CIA separately for files that included copies of the death certificate and autopsy report for bin Laden as well as the results of tests to identify the body. While the Pentagon said it could not locate the files, the CIA, with its special power to prevent the release of records, has never responded. The CIA also has not responded to a separate request for other records, including documents identifying and describing the forces and supplies required to execute the assault on bin Laden's compound.

The CIA did tell the AP it could not locate any emails from or to Panetta and two other top agency officials discussing the bin Laden mission.

McRaven's unusual order would have remained secret had it not been mentioned in a single sentence on the final page in the inspector general's draft report that examined whether the Obama administration gave special access to Hollywood executives planning a film, ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" about the raid. The draft report was obtained and posted online last month by the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit watchdog group in Washington.

McRaven, who oversaw the bin Laden raid, expressed concerns in the report about possible disclosure of the identities of the SEALs. The Pentagon ""provided the operators and their families an inordinate level of security,"" the report said. McRaven also directed that the names and photographs associated with the raid not be released.

""This effort included purging the combatant command's systems of all records related to the operation and providing these records to another government agency,"" according to the draft report. The sentence was dropped from the report's final version.

Since the raid, one of the SEALs published a book about the raid under a pseudonym but was subsequently identified by his actual name. And earlier this year the SEAL credited with shooting bin Laden granted a tell-all, anonymous interview with Esquire about the raid and the challenges of his retiring from the military after 16 years without a pension.

Current and former Defense Department officials knowledgeable about McRaven's directive and the inspector general's report told AP the description of the order in the draft report was accurate. The reference to ""another government agency"" was code for the CIA, they said. These individuals spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter by name.

There is no indication the inspector general's office or anyone else in the U.S. government is investigating the legality of transferring the military records. Bridget Serchak, a spokeswoman for the inspector general, would not explain why the reference was left out of the final report and what, if any, actions the office might be taking.

""Our general statement is that any draft is pre-decisional and that drafts go through many reviews before the final version, including editing or changing language,"" Serchak wrote in an e-mail.

The unexplained decision to remove the reference to the purge and transfer of the records ""smells of bad faith,"" said Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists. ""How should one understand that? That adds insult to injury. It essentially covers up the action.""

McRaven oversaw the raid while serving as commander of the Joint Special Operations Command, the secretive outfit in charge of SEAL Team Six and the military's other specialized counterterrorism units. McRaven was nominated by Obama to lead Special Operations Command, JSOC's parent organization, a month before the raid on bin Laden's compound. He replaced Adm. Eric Olson as the command's top officer in August 2011.

Ken McGraw, a spokesman for Special Operations Command, referred questions to the inspector general's office.

The refusal to make available authoritative or contemporaneous records about the bin Laden mission means that the only official accounts of the mission come from U.S. officials who have described details of the raid in speeches, interviews and television appearances. In the days after bin Laden's death, the White House provided conflicting versions of events, falsely saying bin Laden was armed and even firing at the SEALs, misidentifying which of bin Laden's sons was killed and incorrectly saying bin Laden's wife died in the shootout. Obama's press secretary attributed the errors to the ""fog of combat.""

A U.S. judge and a federal appeals court previously sided with the CIA in a lawsuit over publishing more than 50 ""post-mortem"" photos and video recordings of bin Laden's corpse. In the case, brought by Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group, the CIA did not say the images were operational files to keep them secret. It argued successfully that the photos and videos must be withheld from the public to avoid inciting violence against Americans overseas and compromising secret systems and techniques used by the CIA and the military.

The Defense Department told the AP in March 2012 it could not locate any photographs or video taken during the raid or showing bin Laden's body. It also said it could not find any images of bin Laden's body on the USS Carl Vinson, the aircraft carrier from which he was buried at sea. The Pentagon also said it could not find any death certificate, autopsy report or results of DNA identification tests for bin Laden, or any pre-raid materials discussing how the government planned to dispose of bin Laden's body if he were killed. It said it searched files at the Pentagon, Special Operations Command headquarters in Tampa, Fla., and the Navy command in San Diego that controls the Carl Vinson.

The Pentagon also refused to confirm or deny the existence of helicopter maintenance logs and reports about the performance of military gear used in the raid. One of the stealth helicopters that carried the SEALs in Pakistan crashed during the mission and its wreckage was left behind.

The Defense Department also told the AP in February 2012 that it could not find any emails about the bin Laden mission or his ""Geronimo"" code name that were sent or received in the year before the raid by McRaven. The department did not say they had been moved to the CIA. It also said it could not find any emails from other senior officers who would have been involved in the mission's planning. It found only three such emails written by or sent to then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates, and these consisted of 12 pages sent to Gates summarizing news reports after the raid.

The Defense Department in November 2012 released copies of 10 emails totaling 31 pages found in the Carl Vinson's computer systems. The messages were heavily censored and described how bin Laden's body was prepared for burial.

These records were not among those purged and then moved to the CIA. Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. James Gregory said the messages from the Carl Vinson ""were not relating to the mission itself and were the property of the Navy."""

It would be more than just an assertion on his part.”

Mr. Snowden is living and working in Russia under a one-year asylum. The Russian government has refused to extradite Mr. Snowden, who was indicted by the Justice Department in June on charges of espionage and stealing government property, to the United States.

Mr. Snowden has said he would return to the United States if he was offered amnesty, but it is unclear whether Mr. Obama — who would most likely have to make such a decision — would make such an offer, given the damage the administration has claimed Mr. Snowden’s leaks have done to national security.

Because the N.S.A. is still uncertain about exactly what Mr. Snowden took, government officials sometimes first learn about specific documents from reporters preparing their articles for publication — leaving the State Department with little time to notify foreign leaders about coming disclosures.

With the security agency trying to revamp its computer network in the aftermath of what could turn out to be the largest breach of classified information in American history, the Justice Department has continued its investigation of Mr. Snowden.

According to senior government officials, F.B.I. agents from the bureau’s Washington field office, who are leading the investigation, believe that Mr. Snowden methodically downloaded the files over several months while working as a government contractor at the Hawaii facility. They also believe that he worked alone, the officials said.

But for all of Mr. Snowden’s technical expertise, some American officials also place blame on the security agency for being slow to install software that can detect unusual computer activity carried out by the agency’s work force — which, at approximately 35,000 employees, is the largest of any intelligence agency."

The strong 68-to-32 vote in the often polarized Senate tossed the issue into the House, where the Republican leadership has said that it will not take up the Senate measure and is instead focused on much narrower legislation that would not provide a path to citizenship for the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the country. Party leaders hope that the Senate action will put pressure on the House.

Leading up to the final votes, which the senators cast at their desks to mark the import of the moment, members of the bipartisan “Gang of Eight,” who drafted the framework of the legislation, took to the Senate floor to make a final argument for the measure. Among them was Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, who is one of his party’s leading Hispanic voices. When Mr. Rubio finished, the other senators in the group surrounded him on the floor, patting him on the back and offering words of encouragement. “Good job,” one said. “I’m proud of you,” another offered.

The future will show whether voters in Republican presidential primaries share that pride.

After Mitt Romney’s loss in November, top Republicans immediately began formulating a way to improve the party’s standing with Hispanics, who have flocked to Democrats. A group of top Republican political and business officials who support an immigration overhaul met at the downtown Washington office of the anti-tax leader Grover Norquist on Jan. 17 with memories of Mr. Romney’s poor showing in their minds."

(Courtesy of U.S. Air Force)

The steel-gray U.S. Air Force Predator drone plunged from the sky, shattering on mountainous terrain near the Iraq-Turkey border. For Kurdish guerrillas hiding nearby, it was an unexpected gift from the propaganda gods.

Fighters from the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, filmed the charred wreckage on Sept. 18 and posted a video on YouTube. A narrator bragged unconvincingly that the group had shot down the drone. But for anyone who might doubt that the flying robot was really American, the video zoomed in on mangled parts stamped in English and bearing the label of the manufacturer, San Diego-based General Atomics.

For a brief moment, the crash drew back the curtain on Operation Nomad Shadow, a secretive U.S. military surveillance program. Since November 2011, the U.S. Air Force has been flying unarmed drones from Incirlik Air Base in Turkey in an attempt to suppress a long-simmering regional conflict. The camera-equipped Predators hover above the rugged border with Iraq and beam high-resolution imagery to the Turkish armed forces, helping them pursue PKK rebels as they slip back and forth across the mountains.

As the Obama administration dials back the number of drone attacks in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen, the U.S. military is shifting its huge fleet of unmanned aircraft to other hot spots around the world. This next phase of drone warfare is focused more on spying than killing and will extend the Pentagon’s robust surveillance networks far beyond traditional, declared combat zones.

Over the past decade, the Pentagon has amassed more than 400 Predators, Reapers, Hunters, Gray Eagles and other high-altitude drones that have revolutionized counterterrorism operations. Some of the unmanned aircraft will return home with U.S. troops when they leave Afghanistan. But many of the drones will redeploy to fresh frontiers, where they will spy on a melange of armed groups, drug runners, pirates and other targets that worry U.S. officials.

Elsewhere in the Middle East, the U.S. Air Force has drone hubs in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates to conduct reconnaissance over the Persian Gulf. Twice since November, Iran has scrambled fighter jets to approach or fire on U.S. Predator drones that edged close to Iranian airspace.

In Africa, the U.S. Air Force began flying unarmed drones over the Sahara five months ago to track al-Qaeda fighters and rebels in northern Mali. The Pentagon has also set up drone bases in Ethiopia, Djibouti and Seychelles. Even so, the commander of U.S. forces in Africa told Congress in February that he needed a 15-fold increase in surveillance, reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering on the continent.

In an April speech, Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said the Pentagon is planning for the first time to send Reaper drones — a bigger, faster version of the Predator — to parts of Asia other than Afghanistan. He did not give details. A Defense Department spokeswoman said the military “hasn’t made any final decisions yet” but is “committed to increasing” its surveillance in Asia and the Pacific.

In South and Central America, U.S. military commanders have long pined for drones to aid counternarcotics operations. “Surveillance drones could really help us out and really take the heat and wear and tear off of some of our manned aviation assets,” Marine Gen. John F. Kelly, chief of the U.S. Southern Command, said in March.

One possible destination for more U.S. drones is Colombia. Last year, Colombian armed forces killed 32 “high-value narco-terrorists” after the U.S. military helped pinpoint the targets’ whereabouts with manned surveillance aircraft and other equipment, according to Jose A. Ruiz, a Southern Command spokesman.

The U.S. military has occasionally operated small drones — four-foot-long ScanEagles, which are launched by a catapult — in Colombia. But with larger drones such as Predators and Reapers, U.S. forces could greatly expand the range and duration of their airborne searches for drug smugglers.

An invitation from Turkey

In the fall of 2011, four disassembled Predator drones arrived in crates at Incirlik Air Base in southern Anatolia, a joint U.S.-Turkish military installation.

The drones came from Iraq, where for the previous four years they had been devoted to surveilling that country’s northern mountains. Along with manned U.S. aircraft, the Predators tracked the movements of PKK fighters, sharing video feeds and other intelligence with the Turkish armed forces.

The Kurdish group has long fought to create an autonomous enclave in Turkey, launching cross-border attacks from its hideouts in northern Iraq. Turkey has responded with airstrikes and artillery attacks but has also sent ground troops into Iraq, further destabilizing an already volatile area. The Turkish and U.S. governments both classify the PKK as a terrorist group.

Turkey’s leaders had feared that U.S. cooperation against the PKK would wither after the Americans left Iraq. So they invited them to re-base the drones on Turkish soil and continue the spying mission from there.

Neither side has been eager to publicize the arrangement. The Obama administration has imposed a broad cone of silence on its drone programs worldwide. Pentagon officials declined interview requests about Operation Nomad Shadow.

The Turkish government has acknowledged the presence of Predators on its territory, but the robotic planes are a sensitive subject. A global survey released Thursday by the Pew Research Center found that 82 percent of Turks disapprove of the Obama administration’s international campaign of drone attacks against extremists.

Officials with the Turkish Embassy in Washington declined to comment for this report.

Pilots 6,000 miles away

The drones occupy a relatively tiny corner of the sprawling base at Incirlik, according to interviews with other officials and public documents that shed light on Nomad Shadow.

The operation is staffed by about three dozen personnel from the U.S. Air Force’s 414th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron and private contractor Battlespace Flight Services.

The drones, which began flying in November 2011, are sheltered in an unobtrusive hangar converted from an abandoned “hush house,” a jet-engine testing facility outfitted with noise suppression equipment.

“It was tight, but we could fit four aircraft inside the hangar and close the doors,” said a former Air Force official involved in Nomad Shadow who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the operation.

For most of their time aloft, the remote-control Predators are flown via satellite link by pilots and sensor operators stationed about 6,000 miles away, at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri.

While in Turkish airspace, the drones cannot spy and must turn off their high-tech cameras and sensors, according to rules set by the Turkish government. It takes the sluggish Predators, with a maximum air speed of 135 mph, about five hours to reach the Iraqi border.

The Iraqi government permits the overflights. Once in Iraq, the Predators usually fly a rectangular route known as “the box” for up to 12 hours each mission as they beam video and other intelligence to Missouri.

U.S. analysts view and evaluate the footage before transmitting it to a joint U.S.-Turkish intelligence “fusion cell” in Ankara, the capital. There’s usually a built-in delay of at least 15 to 20 minutes. That would give a drone enough time to leave the vicinity if Turkish authorities decided to launch artillery rounds or airstrikes against detected PKK targets, the former Air Force official said.

From the outset, some U.S. officials have worried about the potential for botched incidents.

In December 2011, Turkish jets bombed a caravan of suspected PKK fighters crossing from Iraq into Turkey, killing 34 people. The victims were smugglers, however, not terrorists — a blunder that ignited protests across Turkey.

The Wall Street Journal reported last year that American drone operators had alerted the Turkish military after a Predator spotted the suspicious caravan. Rather than ask for a closer look, Turkish officials waved off the drone and launched the attack soon after, the paper said. Turkey’s leaders denied the report, saying they decided to attack based on their own intelligence.

The incident exacerbated simmering frustrations among officials in Ankara and Washington.

The Turkish government has long pressed the Obama administration to devote more flight hours to the operation and to sell Turkey a fleet of armed Reaper drones. But U.S. officials and lawmakers have resisted both requests.

The Pentagon has expressed concern that the Turkish military wants the fruits of the drone surveillance but has been unwilling to consult with Americans on the best ways to exploit it. “There have been a lot of U.S. attempts to help the Turks get better at fusing the intelligence with an operation,” said a former U.S. defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to give a candid assessment.

At the same time, the former U.S. official called Nomad Shadow an overall success. The constant stream of surveillance footage has prevented PKK attacks, he said, and has enabled the Turkish military to carry out more-limited, precise counterterrorism operations instead of sending large numbers of troops into northern Iraq.

“It’s been extremely effective in preventing cross-border operations by the Turks,” the former official said.

Clues in the crash report

On Sept. 17, 2012, Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, visited Ankara to see Gen. Necdet Özel, chief of the general staff of the Turkish armed forces.

As other Turkish officials had done in previous talks, Özel pressed Dempsey for more help against the PKK, including more drone flights, according to Turkish media accounts of the meeting.

The next day, in a fit of unlucky timing, a Predator on a routine patrol experienced a sudden and complete loss of power. Drone operators at Whiteman Air Force Base could not communicate with or control the aircraft.

The drone nose-dived, dropping 11,000 feet in about four minutes before crashing into an uninhabited region, according to a U.S. Air Force accident investigation report obtained by The Washington Post under the Freedom of Information Act.

Before releasing the report, the Air Force redacted all geographic references to the location of the crash or where the drone was based. But parts of the report contain clues that make clear that the drone was on a Nomad Shadow mission in northern Iraq.

Transcripts of interviews with the drone’s ground crew mention that they were deployed to Incirlik with the 414th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron. Another document identified the lost aircraft as NOMAD 01.

But the strongest evidence can be found in an appendix to the report with photographs of the accident site.

The images are outtakes from the propaganda video that the PKK posted on YouTube the day after the crash. The photos show several damaged Predator pieces. U.S. military censors carefully blocked out the faces of guerrillas posing with the wreckage."

The order was given by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, five days after roughly 800,000 federal workers were sent home after Congress failed to reach a deal to fund the government.

Hagel said the decision to recall the workers is based on a Pentagon legal interpretation of a law called the Pay Our Military Act.

The measure was passed by Congress and signed by President Obama shortly before the slimdown began.

“Attorneys concluded that the law does allow the Department of Defense to eliminate furloughs for employees whose responsibilities contribute to the morale, well-being, capabilities and readiness of service members,” Hagel said in a written statement. “This has been a very disruptive year for our people … .Many important activities remain curtailed while the shutdown goes on.”

Hagel signaled earlier in the past week that Pentagon lawyers were trying to determine ways for some of the department's furloughed civilians to get back to work.

In a memorandum from Hagel to other high-ranking military officials and obtained by Fox News, the Defense secretary states member of the military reserves and full-time National Guardsman are among those being asked to return.

Hagel told reporters traveling with him Tuesday in South Korea: ""It does have an effect on our relationships around the world and it cuts straight to the obvious question, ‘Can you rely on the United States as a reliable partner to fulfill its commitments to its allies?’ ""

The Pentagon did not immediately say on Saturday exactly how many workers will return to work. The Defense Department said ""most"" were being brought back.

Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ed Markey praised the move and blamed the slimdown-related furloughs on the “Tea Party Republicans.”

""This is the right decision for the hundreds of thousands of patriots who support our soldiers, and now it's time to end this harmful government shutdown that has left hundreds of thousands of other federal workers sitting at home,"" Markey said.

Washington Republicans did not return requests for comment.

The law ensured that members of the military, who have remained at work throughout the shutdown, would be paid on time. It also left room for the Pentagon to keep on the job those civilians who provide support to the military.

Hagel also said Saturday that he strongly supports efforts in Congress to enact legislation to retroactively compensate all furloughed employees. ""And I will continue to urge Congress to fulfill its basic responsibilities to pass a budget and restore full funding for the Department of Defense and the rest of the government,"" Hagel said.

Rachel Washburn spent three seasons with Eagles before entering military career

She recently concluded second tour in Afghanistan

Washburn scheduled to be honored Sunday by Eagles

As a Philadelphia Eagles cheerleader, Rachel Washburn toted pom-poms. As an Army intelligence officer with a special ops combat unit in Afghanistan, she carried an assault rifle and pistol. She was a pioneer on a special mission to relate to local women in ways that would be culturally inappropriate for male troops — including helping deliver an Afghan baby in a snowstorm.

Washburn, 25, who recently returned from her second tour in Afghanistan, was honored Sunday night as a ""Hometown Hero"" by the Eagles at their home game against the Chicago Bears.

Cheerleader turned soldier? Did that turn heads when she was in military training or living in a mud hut with Green Berets in a village in Afghanistan?

""Initially, it was kind of a novelty to people I met if they ever found out,"" Washburn said Thursday in a phone interview from Savannah, Ga., where she was on the first day of her post-deployment leave.

""It's kind of a bit of a shock. You don't expect those two things to go hand in hand with one person.""

She didn't join the Army on a whim. During her three seasons with the Eagles, Washburn was an Army ROTC student and history major at Drexel University in Philadelphia. Her father was an Army helicopter pilot and an Air Force fighter pilot. She figures she moved 17 or 18 times growing up, but she calls Philadelphia home even though she just attended college there.

""I am so proud of Rachel and all of her extraordinary accomplishments. She has tremendous courage and has made an amazing impact on the lives of others,"" said Barbara Zaun, Eagles director of cheerleading.

During Washburn's freshman year at Drexel in 2006, she had a friend who was a basketball cheerleader with the Philadelphia 76ers. Washburn loved dancing and thought that would be a ""cool experience."" With her fondness for football, she tried out for the Eagles squad in the spring of her freshman year.

""I knew it was kind of a long shot with all those beautiful, talented women that try out every year,"" she said. ""I just thought, why not? Go big or go home.""

She made the team and cheered for the Eagles from 2007 to 2009. In 2008, she went on a military goodwill tour with the cheerleaders to Iraq and Kuwait. In her case, it also was a military internship.

""ROTC is a very canned version of what the military is going to be. So getting to actually talk to people who are in the military and doing their jobs day in and day out … was very eye-opening,"" she said. ""It was kind of what re-lit the fire and my passion for the military.""

After graduation, she was commissioned a 2nd lieutenant in the Army (she's now a 1st lieutenant stationed in Fort Stewart, Ga.). She went through paratrooper training, but her role was military intelligence.

Prior to her first eight-month tour in Afghanistan in 2011-12, she became part of a new ""Cultural Support Team"" program to attach women to special ops units to relate to Afghan women.

""I was always seen as somebody they could relate to and not this American imposter who brings my values to that country,"" said Washburn, who wore a head scarf when amongst the Afghans.

""We kind of noticed that women everywhere share certain similarities. They obviously care about their home, their children. Women everywhere love pretty things. So if we wore a pretty head scarf, it would be like an icebreaker.""

Near the end of her first deployment, on the day her unit was supposed to leave a village, a snowstorm hit. She and her partner learned a local woman had gone into labor. Her husband was unable to get her to a midwife. The husband did not want male troops to see her.

Washburn and her partner took the woman in a military vehicle to their unit's mud hut. On an Army radio, a special ops medic helped them deliver the baby.

""Everything was successful,"" Washburn said. ""Her husband gave us a little trinket. He was so grateful to have a boy.""

Washburn returned from her second tour in Afghanistan on Nov. 17. In those nine months, she had a different role as a platoon leader of an Army intelligence unit.

She and other women who participated in the Army program in Afghanistan have considered a book. Some kept journals. One is a writer. ""We were the first to ever do anything like that. We bonded so much,"" said Washburn.

According to Washburn, her military awards and decorations include the Bronze Star Medal, Army Commendation Medal, Combat Action Badge, Airborne Badge and Air Assault Badge.

Washburn said she has about a year left in the Army, but she is considering signing on for a few more years. ""There are some opportunities that are enticing me.""

There are issues surrounding women in the military, including opportunities for advancement and sexual harassment

""My eyes have been opened to those issues,"" said Washburn. ""Considering the communities that I have been working in, those issues exist, and I think they're ever present in the media these days with all the changes that the military is pursuing as far as gender equality.

""But with the program that I did in my first deployment, we were part of that change, and nothing motivates me more than being an example of what motivated females can be in the military. I just hope the military continues to progress and that skilled individuals are afforded the opportunities available to them.""

Washburn and the other woman assigned with her the Cultural Support Team with their unit in Afghanistan lived in a mud hut with the males.

The two women had a separate living area. ""It was a pretty big hut,"" said Washburn. ""So we had our own female quarters, which was nice.""

It would be incorrect to say Washburn traded her white cheerleader boots for combat boots. The Eagles cheerleaders wear uniforms designed by Vera Wang. But for dancing purposes they wear designer Gant sneakers.

""I like to think it's because we were more athletic and did more complicated routines,"" said Washburn.

She added that cheerleaders – like women in the military – should not be labeled with stereotypes.

""The woman I met in cheerleading were all incredibly intelligent, ambitious women,"" she said."

WASHINGTON — The head of the Transportation Security Administration has told lawmakers that despite their concerns, he's going to let passengers carry small knives on planes starting later this month.

John Pistole, the TSA administrator, delivered the message in a letter this week to 133 House members who oppose the policy change and who have called it everything from misguided to dangerous to confusing.

Pistole announced the change last month, which will allow travelers to carry pocketknives with blades up to 2.36 inches long onto airline planes starting April 25. Also being allowed back on planes for the first time since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks: hockey sticks, golf clubs, small bats.

Flight attendants, air marshals and pilots have objected loudly. So did 133 House members, who signed a letter March 21 urging Pistole to back off his decision,

Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee, asked TSA ""to revisit this potentially dangerous and confusing policy.""

Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. and a member of the transportation security subcommittee, said the policy change ""seems misguided and frankly dangerous.""

Pistole replied in his letter Wednesday that 3 billion passengers have flown domestically since small scissors and knitting needles were allowed on planes ""without a single reported disruption from these objects."" He aims to focus on riskier threats.

Locking and strengthening cockpit doors has reduced the risk that terrorists can gain control of a plane. But Pistole said the shoe bomber in 2001 and the underwear bomber in 2009 were able to smuggle non-metallic explosives onto planes, and intelligence suggests more bombers are trying to do so.

""Given these real and significant threats, security experts worldwide have concluded that small pocket knives and certain sporting equipment do not pose a security risk that would result in the catastrophic failure of an aircraft and the loss of all life on board,"" Pistole wrote lawmakers.

The House Homeland Security subcommittee on transportation will have a hearing Thursday on TSA's risk-based program. And the TSA's Aviation Security Advisory Committee, which was organized to give the agency advice about its operations, is getting a secret briefing on the knife policy April 22."

The Guardian, via Reuters, file

Microsoft worked with the National Security Agency and the FBI to provide the agencies with the encryption workarounds they needed for access to Skype video calls, Outlook Web chats and email, and information stored on Microsoft's cloud-based SkyDrive, according to new information shared by NSA leaker Edward Snowden with the Guardian newspaper.

In the latest round of disclosures about data-gathering practices of law enforcement in a program known as ""Prism,"" Microsoft ""has collaborated closely with U.S. intelligence services to allow users' communications to be intercepted, including helping the National Security Agency to circumvent the company's own encryption, according to top-secret documents obtained by the Guardian,"" the newspaper reported Thursday.

The new files ""provided by Edward Snowden illustrate the scale of cooperation between Silicon Valley and the intelligence agencies over the last three years,"" the Guardian said.

Microsoft, in a statement to NBC News, did not address the encryption workaround specifically, but said, ""We only ever comply with orders about specific accounts or identifiers, and we would not respond to the kind of blanket orders discussed in the press over the past few weeks, as the volumes documented in our most recent disclosure clearly illustrate.

""To be clear, Microsoft does not provide any government with blanket or direct access to SkyDrive, Outlook.com, Skype or any Microsoft product.""

The company said when it upgrades or updates products, ""legal obligations may in some circumstances require that we maintain the ability to provide information in response to a law enforcement or national security request. There are aspects of this debate that we wish we were able to discuss more freely. That's why we've argued for additional transparency that would help everyone understand and debate these important issues.""

ACLU principal technologist Chris Soghoian told NBC News that the new revelations show that ""time and time again, companies that specifically advertise their services as privacy protecting have been forced to circumvent those privacy protections to enable the government to spy on their customers.""

Microsoft isn't the only technology company believed to be cooperating with the government to share data, but it is the first to have more details revealed since the initial disclosures last month by Snowden.

At that time, he said that Microsoft and other technology companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, Yahoo and AOL were allowing the FBI and NSA to look at Americans' video, audio, photos, emails and other data files under what is known as the Prism program. Most of the companies, including Microsoft, have since requested government permission to share the information requests that have been made to them.

According to the information shared by Snowden with the Guardian, Microsoft ""helped the NSA to circumvent its encryption to address concerns that the agency would be able to intercept Web chats on the new Outlook.com portal.""

Microsoft completed the transfer of its 300 million Hotmail users to Outlook.com, a more modern webmail experience, in May. The NSA ""already had pre-encryption stage access to email on Outlook.com, including Hotmail,"" the Guardian said.

The Redmond, Wash.-based company ""also worked with the FBI's Data Intercept Unit to 'understand' potential issues with a feature in Outlook.com that allows users to create email aliases,"" the newspaper said.

Video-chat service Skype ""worked with intelligence agencies last year to allow Prism to collect video of conversations as well as audio,"" the Guardian said.

There have been concerns since Microsoft bought Skype in 2011 about what data the Redmond company is sharing with law enforcement. Last January, dozens of organizations, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Digital Rights Foundation, sent an open letter to Microsoft asking how, when and why the popular video chatting program complies with government requests for information.

In March, Microsoft published a transparency report about Skype, and other of its services.

""Microsoft and Skype received a total of 75,378 law enforcement requests,"" the company said in the report. ""Those requests potentially impacted 137,424 accounts. While it is not possible to directly compare the number of requests to the number of users affected, it is likely that less than 0.02 percent of active users were affected.""

The Guardian reports that Microsoft also worked with the FBI this year ""to allow the NSA easier access via Prism to its cloud storage service SkyDrive, which now has more than 250 million users worldwide.""

In its statement Thursday, Microsoft said it has ""clear principles which guide the response across our entire company to government demands for customer information for both law enforcement and national security issues.""

The company takes its ""commitments to our customers and to compliance with applicable law very seriously, so we provide customer data only in response to legal processes."" Microsoft's compliance team ""examines all demands very closely, and we reject them if we believe they aren't valid.""

Snowden, 30, has worked with the Guardian since last month to share information he learned in his time as an NSA contractor about data-gathering practices of the NSA, one of the country's most secretive agencies.

He is now believed to be staying in the transit zone of Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport, as he decides where he can go for asylum and where he can avoid being extradited to the United States. Federal prosecutors have charged Snowden with three counts of espionage.

Curbs,"WASHINGTON — A presidential advisory committee charged with examining the operations of the National Security Agency has concluded that a program to collect data on every phone call made in the United States should continue, though under broad new restraints that would be intended to increase privacy protections, according to officials with knowledge of the report’s contents.

The committee’s report, the officials said, also argues in favor of codifying and publicly announcing the steps the United States will take to protect the privacy of foreign citizens whose telephone records, Internet communications or movements are collected by the N.S.A. But it is unclear how far that effort would go, and intelligence officials have argued strenuously that they should be under few restrictions when tapping the communications of non-Americans abroad, who do not have constitutional protections under the Fourth Amendment.

The advisory group is also expected to recommend that senior White House officials, including the president, directly review the list of foreign leaders whose communications are routinely monitored by the N.S.A. President Obama recently apologized to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany for the N.S.A.’s monitoring of her calls over the past decade, promising that the actions had been halted and would not resume. But he refused to make the same promise to the leaders of Mexico and Brazil.

Administration officials say the White House has already taken over supervision of that program. “We’re not leaving it to Jim Clapper anymore,” said one official, referring to the director of national intelligence, who appears to have been the highest official to review the programs regularly."

Green Bay Press-Gazette

Targeted individuals have serious criminal records or run-ins with authorities in past

Congress directed ICE to shift focus in 2008

Number of convicted criminals deported has increased 89%25 since 2008

GREEN BAY, Wis. -- Even as immigration reform remains up for congressional consideration this fall, deportations continue to take place regularly across the Midwest.

However, it is less likely to be in the news than it was several years ago.

In the 1990s, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement would storm workplaces, march dozens of laborers out in handcuffs and load them onto awaiting buses.

""There was backlash, children being left behind,"" said Laurie Martinez, who works with immigrants through the Catholic Diocese of Green Bay, Wis. ""ICE will still do roundups, where they're looking for several individuals, and we usually hear about it a week after. But you don't hear much of them going to employers.

""Now it seems to be they're targeting people in jail, in the prison system.""

Deportations and so called ""sweeps"" by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents remain a part of life all over the country, but it's a quieter approach. It targets specific individuals rather than workers or a place of business. Those individuals targeted primarily have serious criminal records or had run-ins with immigration authorities in the past. The most recent one in Brown County, Wis., where Green Bay is the county seat, was in April, when ICE picked up 44 people.

In 2008, Congress directed ICE to shift its focus and prioritize criminal immigrants, not just undocumented ones, according to the federal agency. Immigration and Customs Enforcement says it now targets criminal immigrants and those who pose a danger to national security or public safety and those ""repeat violators who game the immigration system.""

The reason for the change? The agency noted its ""limited resources"" and, according to independent analysis, the roughly $23,000 per immigrant cost for deportation.

The shift in strategy is evident in the agency's numbers.

Since 2008, the number of convicted criminals deported nationwide has increased 89%, while the number of undocumented immigrants without criminal convictions has dropped 29%. Last year, ICE records show the agency deported 409,849 people, 96% of which fell into the agency's enforcement priority definition, which covers criminals, threats to national security and repeat violators of immigration laws.

The six-state region that includes Wisconsin shows the same shift in strategy by the agency. Last year, the agency deported 10,296 immigrants from Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri and Wisconsin. Nearly two-thirds of those immigrants were convicted criminals.

In 2011, 11,786 immigrants were deported from that area, and 64% of them were convicted criminals. In 2010, 10,346 immigrants were deported, and 52% were convicted criminals.

""Our removal stats are not broken down by county or even by state,"" said Gail Montenegro, public affairs officer for ICE's Chicago region. ""Our stats are for the entire six-state area.""

Generally, people in the country illegally who are incarcerated or picked up in a community sweep are held in either the Dodge or Kenosha, Wis., county jails. Both counties have contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to house and transport immigrants, who get a chance to argue against deportation in federal court, usually in Chicago.

Immigrants who commit serious crimes and are sentenced to prison fulfill those terms, but are identified as being of interest to the federal immigration agency, Wisconsin corrections prison spokeswoman Joy Staab said. When their prison sentences are over, they are transferred to Dodge and Kenosha county jails for deportation proceedings.

Since 2008, about 391 of those inmates were transferred to ICE custody in Dodge and Kenosha counties. Of those, 33 had been convicted in Brown County courts, Staab said.

Deportations by the numbers

2012: Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported 10,296 immigrants from Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri and Wisconsin. Of those, nearly two-thirds were convicted criminals.

2011: ICE deported 11,786 immigrants from that six-state area. Sixty-four percent of them were convicted criminals.

2010: ICE deported 10,346 immigrants. Fifty-two percent were convicted criminals.

And finally, “never again” is a challenge to nations. It’s a bitter truth — too often, the world has failed to prevent the killing of innocents on a massive scale. And we are haunted by the atrocities that we did not stop and the lives we did not save.

Three years ago today, I joined many of you for a ceremony of remembrance at the U.S. Capitol. And I said that we had to do “everything we can to prevent and end atrocities.” And so I want to report back to some of you today to let you know that as President I’ve done my utmost to back up those words with deeds.

Officials said agents rescued 52 of the 177 just in the last week, when temperatures soared near 110 degrees Fahrenheit.

The recent rescues by the Tucson sector of the Border Patrol reflect a larger trend. Agents from the sector have performed 372 rescues during the current fiscal year. During the same period last year, there were 265 rescues, according to federal data.

Those rescued are suspected of crossing into the United States illegally. It’s physically impossible for the average person to carry enough water to survive such punishing heat, Border Patrol agents report.

“Smugglers convince migrants that they will only walk a short distance. In reality, they are forced to walk long distances within short periods of time. Those unable to keep up are left behind to die,” stated Border Patrol Agent Brent M. Cagen.

Death rates among people trying to cross into the country illegally are at an all-time high in the southern Arizona desert despite a lull in illegal border crossings, according to data collected by the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner.

The deaths have probably increased because those who still choose to enter the country illegally are traveling for longer periods of time — mostly on foot — through more remote areas to avoid detection by border enforcement officials, according to a new report, a joint effort by the medical examiner’s office and University of Arizona’s Binational Migration Institute.

Bill provision that would require firms to post jobs for Americans is targeted

Technology firms have spent millions on lobbying on immigration

Judiciary Committee set to start working on bill

WASHINGTON – Technology firms, exercising new political clout on Capitol Hill, are lobbying against a measure in the leading Senate immigration bill that would make it harder for them to recruit workers from abroad without first taking steps to hire Americans for highly skilled jobs in programming, engineering and other fields.

The measure, part of a sweeping compromise bill drafted by a bipartisan group of eight senators, would require job openings to be posted on a new government website for 30 days and order companies to first extend job offers to ""equally or better qualified"" U.S. workers. It would give the U.S. Labor Department the power to review and challenge those hiring decisions.

Proponents say the measures are needed to curb abuses by companies who they say use the visa program to hire cheaper labor. Technology companies say the proposed rules would cripple their ability to hire the best employees from a global workforce and represent inappropriate government intrusion in internal hiring decisions.

The fight over hiring practices is part of the massive lobbying campaign underway on the immigration measure and will offer a fresh test of the technology industry's growing influence in Washington. The companies involved in the computer and Internet sectors spent nearly $140 million in lobbying last year -- more than twice the $69 million the industry poured into influencing Washington a decade earlier, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks political spending.

The Senate Judiciary Committee is set to begin work on the bill Thursday.

The hiring battle centers on the program that grants H-1B visas, which go mostly to college-educated foreigners in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields. Technology companies say they face a chronic shortage of qualified workers in these fields. The United States sets an annual limit of 85,000 visas for these companies, and the competition for them is intense: This year, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services opened up the application process April 1, and the cap was reached within a week.

Industry groups have made big gains in the Senate's immigration proposal. The bill, for instance, Would increase the H-1B cap to 205,000 annually. However, tech officials warn the new recruiting requirements could drive companies to move their skilled jobs overseas, rather than comply. A commonly cited example: Microsoft's decision to open a software center in Vancouver, British Columbia, after Congress failed to pass immigration legislation in 2007 that would have significantly increased the number of H-1B visas.

Under the bill, ""employers are going to have an arbitrary government standard imposed on every hiring decision,"" said Robert Hoffman, the top lobbyist for the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group. The proposed rule, he said, ignores subjective factors that influence hiring. ""A perfect example: How does one define whether or not someone has the personality to fit into a corporate culture?"" he said.

""We are not trying to change any of the fundamental policy goals that they are trying to achieve"" in the Senate, Hoffman said. ""We are just trying to tweak it, so that these goals and other goals, like retaining the best and brightest and growing in the United States, so that those types of goals are advanced as well.""

Ron Hira, an associate professor of public policy at the Rochester Institute of Technology, has criticized the visa program, saying it allows firms to hire ""cheap indentured labor.""

""The technology industry is asking the government to come in and intervene in the normal functioning of the U.S. labor market, specifically on their behalf,"" Hira said.

Bruce Morrison, a former Connecticut congressman who lobbies on behalf of a group that represents American engineers, said the organization will object to any effort to ""dilute worker protections"" as the measure moves through the Senate. ""The arguments from the companies is that there aren't any Americans to take these jobs,"" he said, ""so there shouldn't be any problem.""

The biggest users of H-1B visas are not brand-name companies, but little-known staffing companies that provide foreign workers on a temporary basis to U.S. companies — including banks, health insurance companies and big retailers. Cognizant, a New Jersey-based company that employs 27,000 people in the USA, is the top user of the temporary visas, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services records show. Most of its workers come from India.

In addition, three India-based outsourcing companies rank among the top five recipients of H-1Bs, according to the federal data.

Americans would ""be shocked to know that most of the H-1B visas … are going to outsourcing companies,"" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., one of eight senators who drafted the immigration bill, said during a recent hearing. ""They're going to these firms, largely in India, who are finding workers, engineers, who will work at low wages in the U.S.""

Durbin is a driving force behind the hiring requirements in the Senate proposal.

The measure would make business harder for staffing companies dependent on foreign workers. It would impose higher fees on firms that rely on overseas employees for more than 30% of their workforce. Starting in 2016, the bill would bar granting any new temporary visas for foreign workers at companies with more than half their workers on the visas. Both measures apply to companies that employ more than 50 people.

Cognizant spokesman John Procter said he did not have a breakdown on the percentage of the company's workers in the USA on H-1B visas. He said the bill imposes an ""arbitrary, detrimental restriction on the number of skilled immigrants.""

""It would really change the way America does business,"" he said. ""The company is very focused on educating legislators and making sure this language doesn't make its way into any final outcome.""

Cognizant hired its first federal lobbyist in 2010 andby last year, it had spent nearly $1 million on federal lobbying, congressional records show. Its team includes Democratic power broker Heather Podesta, who did not return a telephone call. Other companies also have stepped up their political activity.

Last month, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Netflix's Reed Hastings, Google's Eric Schmidt and other technology executives teamed up to underwrite an advocacy group to promote their views on immigration. Two of its subsidiaries began a seven-figure advertising campaign to shore up voter support for key senators in the immigration debate.

The tech industry ""has clearly come of age,"" said Ellen Miller, executive director of the Sunlight Foundation. ""In the last decade, we've seen this tremendous recognition from Silicon Valley of the need to play in the power circles — to both protect their bottom line and to alter the political scene to their advantage."""

Carter initially joined the Marines in 1998; he joined the Army a decade later in 2008 after being honorably discharged in 2003 and has attained the rank of Staff Sergeant.

Carter earned the Medal of Honor by running back and forth between Combat Outpost Keating and a disabled Humvee while serving in Afghanistan. Three American soldiers were stuck in the disabled humvee without any ammunition to defend themselves or strike back at the enemy.

Carter and his platoon were deployed to Afghanistan in May 2009. Once there, Carter found himself at Combat Outpost Keating, which he described as “a death trap” because it sat deep within a valley surrounded by mountains. The outpost was there to keep insurgents from slipping into Pakistan, and Carter was there to help man it until it could be shut down on October 4, 2009.

But as CNN reports, the Taliban struck the day before the outpost was to be closed. Carter and his fellow soldiers were forced to defend their lives in what is arguably one of the most intense firefights of the war in Afghanistan.

As the Taliban targeted mortars and large guns at Combat Outpost Keating in an attempt to render the location defenseless, they kept a constant barrage of small arms fire on the troops as well. By using this tactic, they were able to kill eight of the 53 American soldiers stationed there.

With the worst of the fire coming in, Carter realized three fellow soldiers–Sgt. Bradley Larson, Spc. Stephan Mace, and Sgt. Justin Gallegos–“[were] trapped in a Humvee and they needed more supplies to return fire.”

Carter ran “through that deadly gauntlet three times to get supplies to the men.”

By the time the attack on Combat Outpost Keating ended, two of the soldiers in the Humvee–Mace and Gallegos–were dead, and Carter says he is haunted by his belief that he could have done more. He says the faces of the dead soldiers pop into his head and he thinks, “I shoulda [sic] done this, I could of done that.”

Breitbart News salutes Staff Sgt. Ty Carter for his courage under fire. We are free because of men like him. God bless the families of the troops who were lost at Combat Outpost Keating. Breitbart News refuses to allow their sacrifice to be forgotten.

USA TODAY

The day after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt addressed a joint session of Congress. His speech that day, which summoned a nation to war, would become among the most iconic in American history — particularly Roosevelt's famous line describing the outrageous attack the prior day:

""Yesterday, December 7, 1941 — a date which will live in infamy — the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.""

Times of crisis often bring out the best in orators. USA TODAY Network looks back at some other famous quotes from the World War II era — both before and after the ""date which will live in infamy.""

Pearl Harbor: Complete coverage of 75th anniversary of attack

Franklin D. Roosevelt

In an effort to keep the United States out of war, Roosevelt made the case during a fireside chat on Dec. 29, 1940, that the nation must provide additional support to Great Britain. During his remarks, he coined the famous ""arsenal of democracy"" phrase.

""We must be the great arsenal of democracy. For us this is an emergency as serious as war itself. We must apply ourselves to our task with the same resolution, the same sense of urgency, the same spirit of patriotism and sacrifice as we would show were we at war.""

In that same speech, FDR discussed what had become increasingly clear: appeasing Adolf Hitler and the Nazi government in Germany was not a rational policy.

""No man can tame a tiger into a kitten by stroking it. There can be no appeasement with ruthlessness. There can be no reasoning with an incendiary bomb. We know now that a nation can have peace with the Nazis only at the price of total surrender.""

Winston Churchill

Perhaps no leader in history used oratory more effectively than Churchill during World War II. His decisive and defiant addresses inspired a nation teetering on the brink. In his first speech as the British prime minister before the House of Commons in May 1940, Churchill made clear his commitment to the cause:

""I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.""

""You ask what is our aim? I can answer in one word: Victory. Victory at all costs. Victory in spite of all terror. Victory however long and hard the road may be. For without victory there is no survival.""

A month later in June, Churchill rallied the British not long after France fell to Germany:

""Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves that, if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, 'This was their finest hour.' ""

In August of that year, the prime minister spoke of the sacrifices many British pilots had already made:

""Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.""

George S. Patton

Patton achieved legendary status during World War II, and his plainspoken style endeared him to U.S. troops. Among the quotes credited to him:

""May God have mercy upon my enemies, because I won't.""

Dwight Eisenhower

Eisenhower, commander of allied troops in Europe, delivered this message to allied forces just before they embarked on the Normandy invasion on June 6, 1944:

""Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen of the Allied Expeditionary Force! You are about to embark upon a great crusade, toward which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty loving people everywhere march with you."""

Secret-court judges upset at portrayal of ‘collaboration’ with government

Recent leaks of classified documents have pointed to the role of a special court in enabling the government’s secret surveillance programs, but members of the court are chafing at the suggestion that they were collaborating with the executive branch.

A classified 2009 draft report by the National Security Agency’s inspector general relayed some details about the interaction between the court’s judges and the NSA, which sought approval for the Bush administration’s top-secret domestic surveillance programs. The report was described in The Washington Post on June 16 and released in full Thursday by The Post and the British newspaper the Guardian.

U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, the former chief judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, took the highly unusual step Friday of voicing open frustration at the account in the report and court’s inability to explain its decisions.

“In my view, that draft report contains major omissions, and some inaccuracies, regarding the actions I took as Presiding Judge of the FISC and my interactions with Executive Branch officials,” Kollar-Kotelly said in a statement to The Post. It was her first public comment describing her work on the intelligence court.

The inspector general’s draft report is among the many documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, touching off a roiling national debate about the proper balance between the government’s reach into Americans’ lives and the effort to protect the nation in the Internet age.

The document portrays the surveillance court as “amenable” to the government’s legal theory to “re-create” authority for the Internet metadata program that had initially been authorized by President George W. Bush without court or congressional approval. The program was shut down in March 2004 when acting Attorney General James B. Comey and senior leaders at the Justice Department threatened to resign over what they felt was an illegal program.

Kollar-Kotelly disputed the NSA report’s suggestion of a fairly high level of coordination between the court and the NSA and Justice in 2004 to re-create certain authorities under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the 1978 law that created the court in response to abuses of domestic surveillance in the 1960s and 1970s.

“That is incorrect,” she said. “I participated in a process of adjudication, not ‘coordination’ with the executive branch. The discussions I had with executive branch officials were in most respects typical of how I and other district court judges entertain applications for criminal wiretaps under Title III, where issues are discussed ex parte.”

The perception that the court works too closely with the government arises in large part from the tribunal’s “ex parte” nature, which means that unlike in a traditional court, there is no legal sparring between adversaries with the judge as arbiter. Instead, a Justice Department official makes the case for the government agency seeking permission to carry out surveillance inside the United States. No one speaks for the target of the surveillance or the company that is ordered to allow its networks to be tapped or to turn over its customers’ data.

Some critics say the court is a rubber stamp for government investigators because it almost never has turned down a warrant application. However, that high batting average doesn’t take into account changes the court requires in some requests and other applications that the government withdraws.

For about 30 years, the court was located on the sixth floor of the Justice Department’s headquarters, down the hall from the officials who would argue in front of it. (The court moved to the District’s federal courthouse in 2009.) “There is a collaborative process that would be unnatural in the public, criminal court setting,” said a former Justice official familiar with the court.

Kollar-Kotelly, who was the court’s chief judge from 2002 to 2006, said she could not comment further on the matter because “the underlying subjects” in the report generally remain classified by the executive branch.

Other judges on the court have confided to colleagues their frustration at the court’s portrayal, according to people familiar with their discussion.

The inspector general’s report, combined with persistent refusals by the government to declassify the opinions, have left the public in the dark about the court’s legal justifications for approving the broad surveillance programs.

“The court is a neutral party, not a collaborator or arm of the government,” said one government official close to the court. “But the information out there now leaves people wondering how and why the court endorsed these programs.”

The court historically has authorized in secret hearings classified warrants to wiretap the calls and monitor the movements of suspected criminals. After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, far-reaching programs to gather Internet and telephone content and metadata were launched under presidential authority, without congressional action or approval from the surveillance court.

The Internet metadata portion of that program had to be revamped after Comey and other Justice officials threatened to resign. Metadata are information indicating facts such as an e-mail’s sender and recipient and its time and date, but not its content.

In May 2004, the NSA briefed Kollar-Kotelly on the technical aspects of that program’s collection, according to the report. She also met with the NSA director, Lt. Gen. Michael V. Hayden, on two successive Saturdays during the summer of 2004 to discuss the issue, the report said.

“It was very professional,” Hayden said in an interview. “We of course had to explain to her what it was we had been doing, what it was we wanted to do, how we would do it, what kind of safeguards we felt able to put in. We left it to her judgment whether there was proportionality in terms of was this worth doing, in the balance between security and liberty.”

He said in response to her concerns, the agency made some technical adjustments so that “the odds were greater that you’d pick up fewer protected communications of U.S. persons.”

Said Hayden: “She wasn’t in league with us. We were down there presenting what we thought was appropriate.”

On July 14, 2004, the surveillance court for the first time approved the gathering of information by the NSA, which created the equivalent of a digital vault to hold Internet metadata. Kollar-Kotelly’s order authorized the metadata program under a FISA provision known as the “pen register/trap and trace,” or PRTT.

The ruling was a secret not just to the public and most of Congress, but to all of Kollar-Kotelly’s surveillance court colleagues. Under orders from the president, none of the court’s other 10 members could be told about the Internet metadata program, which was one prong of a larger and highly classified data-gathering effort known as the President’s Surveillance Program, or PSP.

But the importance of her order — which approved the collection based on a 1986 law typically used for phone records — was hard to overstate.

“The order essentially gave NSA the same authority to collect bulk Internet metadata that it had under the PSP,” the inspector general’s report said, with some minor caveats including reducing the number of people who could access the records.

On May 24, 2006, Kollar-Kotelly signed another order, this one authorizing the bulk collection of phone metadata from U.S. phone companies, under a FISA provision known as Section 215, or the ”business records provision,” of the USA Patriot Act.

As with the PRTT order, the Justice Department and NSA “collaboratively designed the application, prepared declarations and responded to questions from court advisers,” the inspector general’s report said. “Their previous experience in drafting the PRTT order made this process more efficient.”

The court also agreed in 2007 to permit the government to collect the content of e-mails and phone calls to and from the United States when “there is probable cause to believe” that one of the parties is a member of al-Qaeda or an associated terrorist group. That program, known today as PRISM and described in documents obtained by The Washington Post, eventually was authorized by Congress.

Kollar-Kotelly could be a stern taskmaster when she thought the NSA was overstepping its bounds. In 2004, she temporarily shut down the government’s surveillance program when she learned of a key NSA failure, The Post reported in 2006. The agency was not properly walling off information gained in warrantless surveillance and may have been using the information to obtain court warrants, which was forbidden. In 2005, the problem resurfaced and she issued a strong warning to the government that it had to fix the problem or would face trouble obtaining court warrants.

Kollar-Kotelly “understood the problems that the government, particularly the Defense Department and the intelligence community, were facing in trying to keep this country safe,” said Robert L. Deitz, former NSA general counsel under Hayden.

But, he said, the court was no rubber stamp. “The judges ask searching questions,” he said. “If they don’t get the right answer, they don’t stamp things ‘reject.’ They say, ‘I’m not signing this.’ Then we go back and say, ‘Okay, we’ve got to do this the following way.’ ”

Still secret are the 2004 decision accompanying the PRTT court order and the legal opinion accompanying the 2006 business records order.

A former senior Justice Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the subject’s sensitivity, said he believes the government should consider releasing declassified summaries of relevant opinions.

“I think it would help” quell the “furor” raised by the recent disclosures, he said. “In this current environment, you may have to lean forward a little more in declassifying stuff than you otherwise would. You might be able to prepare reasonable summaries that would be helpful to the American people.”

Lawmakers and civil-liberties advocates have been pushing the Obama administration for several years to declassify these opinions and other opinions from Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel that explain the legal justification for these programs.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has led an effort to review these opinions to see what, if anything, can be declassified. But Robert S. Litt, ODNI general counsel, has argued that declassification can be difficult when so much of the legal reasoning is intertwined with facts that need to remain secret lest they tip off enemies about surveillance methods.

Still, the former official explained, segregating relevant facts from classified material is routinely done in criminal proceedings under the Classified Information Procedures Act. In those cases, the government can extract the information that is relevant to the defense, the judge approves it, and it is provided to the defense.

“This is not unheard-of in the unclassified world, and some kind of summary document can be generated,” the former official said. “Maybe that’s a middle ground that can be done.”

Since April, about a third of the Air Force's combat flying fleet has been grounded due to federal spending cuts. The Air Force won a temporary reprieve from the cuts, which will allow the jets to begin flying again.

Congress gave the Air Force and other agencies the power to re-allocate money within their budgets. The Air Force on Monday decided to reinstate $208 million to restore the flights.

Related: 650,000 defense employees start furloughs

The move also affects the grounded Thunderbirds. They resume training with hopes of performing aerial shows next year. There will be no Thunderbird shows this year.

Air Force leaders called the move a step in the right direction but warned that budget cuts have left the military agency less prepared for crisis, especially since federal funding for next year is also precarious. The latest move only restores the flights until Oct. 1, when the current fiscal year ends.

""Budget uncertainly makes it difficult to determine whether we'll be able to sustain a fully combat-ready force,"" said Gen. Mike Hostage, commander of Air Combat Command.

The Pentagon is the largest federal employer, with a budget of $680 billion. It has faced the lion's share, or $40 billion of the $85 billion in federal spending cuts, that kicked in on March 1.

Some 650,000 civilian defense workers have started taking furloughs, or one unpaid day off each week, since early July.

The move has no effect on the Navy's Blue Angels aerial performance, which has also been grounded and will remain so for the remainder of the fiscal year.

Republican Sen. John McCain, from Arizona, called the solution a ""band-aid"" that ""cannot be sustained."" McCain called for the president and lawmakers to find a way to end forced spending cuts.

""The Air Force is cutting hundreds of millions of dollars from important programs so that it can continue to fund the minimum acceptable amount of training for combat squadrons,"" he warned."

John McCain (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) attended a private meeting with President Barack Obama on the subject of immigration reform. They emerged all smiles: “It’s one of the best meetings I’ve ever had with the president,” Graham said. President Obama “understands the parameters of what we’re dealing with,” said McCain. Both senators are supporters of immigration reform efforts now under way in the Senate.

Those efforts themselves are the product of separate negotiations outside “regular order” in the Senate. A group called the “Gang of Eight,” which includes both McCain and Graham, has agreed to the broad principles of a bipartisan compromise on immigration that would include both border enforcement and a “path to citizenship”–though the question of whether, and for how long, the enforcement stage would come first remains unresolved.

It is not the first time a “gang” effort has been used to pressure the rest of the Republican caucus, but it is the first time such an effort has been coordinated with the president. McCain and Graham’s endorsement of the president’s efforts is particularly striking given their persistent push for answers on the Benghazi scandal, and their strong opposition to Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel (though they both refused to sustain a filibuster).

The Republicans’ “gang problem” has contributed to the growing frustration that conservative voters feel with the GOP. In McCain’s case, the frustration is compounded by the fact that he ran for re-election in 2010 while promising to crack down on illegal immigration. In the House of Representatives, Speaker John Boehner agreed to stop separate talks with Obama, and to commit to “regular order.” The Senate has added no such discipline.

Even in the House, Boehner has abandoned a promise to observe the “Hastert rule”–to ensure that any vote that comes to the floor is approved by the majority Republican caucus first. The result has been a string of capitulations that lead in turn to bad policy. The noble cause of bipartisanship first requires two parties. If Republicans cannot establish minimal policy discipline–even personal discipline–the country’s frustrations will grow."

No one in the White House had the relationship with Bush that Rice had. She worked out with him, talked sports with him, dined with him and Laura in the residence and spent weekends with them at Camp David. Over lunch one day in the first term, Rice told Christine Todd Whitman, then the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, “I can count on one hand the days when I have not spoken to the president over the last three years.” As Whitman later reflected: “She didn’t have a life. Her life was all about that.”

Bush turned to Rice to help repair the damage done by the administration’s aggressive response to the Sept. 11 attacks. “We had broken a lot of china,” Rice told me. “But at that point, you have to leave something in place. That is true with allies. It is true with the Middle East. It is true in putting together an international consensus on North Korea and international consensus on Iran. And I don’t think that is how the vice president saw it. I think he would have liked to have kept breaking china.”

Only by the end of his sixth year did Bush finally conclude that Rumsfeld had to go, a decision that represented the most fundamental break with Cheney, who was informed, not consulted. “It wasn’t open for discussion by the time he came to me,” Cheney told me. Cheney managed to preserve much of the national-security architecture he helped create, but he was now on defense more than offense, fending off changes that he thought would weaken the country or unravel the policies he had urged. “Perhaps my clout was diminished,” Cheney said in a 2011 television interview. “That’s possible. I wouldn’t quarrel about that.” Indeed, by the time they left office, Bush and Cheney disagreed on a long list of significant issues and policies. Where Bush was willing to pursue international diplomacy, empty secret C.I.A. prisons, sign an agreement to withdraw from Iraq and cut deals with Congress on military tribunals and warrantless eavesdropping, Cheney resisted any compromise as a sellout of the principles they once shared.

And then there was the Scooter Libby pardon.

A few weeks before Barack Obama’s inauguration, Joshua Bolten invited all of his predecessors to his office in the West Wing to meet with his successor, Rahm Emanuel. Thirteen of the living 16 men to have served as chief of staff attended, including Cheney, who was Gerald Ford’s top assistant. They went around the table one by one, offering advice. When Cheney’s turn came up, a devilish look crossed his face. “Whatever you do,” he said, “make sure you’ve got the vice president under control.”

As Bush’s final days in the White House approached, he did not exactly have his vice president under control. Cheney’s lobbying campaign on behalf of Scooter Libby had become deeply disconcerting to the president. To Cheney, it was a simple matter of justice. As he saw it, Libby had been pursued by an unprincipled prosecutor bent on damaging the White House. Neither Libby nor anyone else had been charged with the actual leak that precipitated the investigation, only with not testifying truthfully about how he learned about Wilson’s identity. Years later, it would be revealed that the special prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald, knew from nearly the start that Richard Armitage, Colin Powell’s deputy, was the original source of the leak, not Libby. Cheney believed that Fitzgerald’s relentless investigation in spite of this fact was proof that Cheney was the real target, and that Libby was caught in the cross-fire. Libby had loyally served his country, Cheney argued, only to be made into a criminal. And Powell and Armitage stayed quiet as it happened. “The Powell-Armitage thing was such a sense of betrayal,” Cheney’s daughter Liz told me. “They sat there and watched their colleagues in the White House — Scooter and everyone else — go through the ordeal of the investigation, and all that time they both knew Armitage was the leaker.” Armitage and Powell said they were simply following investigators’ instructions to keep silent.

As Cheney pressed Bush for the pardon, the president put him off by saying he would wait to issue controversial pardons until near the end of his term, which the vice president took as an indication that Libby would be among them. Bush had already commuted Libby’s prison sentence of two and a half years after it was handed down in 2007. As a result, Libby never had to spend a minute behind bars, a decision that inflamed critics on the left, who argued that Bush was interfering with justice, and on the right, who felt he had not gone far enough in quashing a bogus prosecution.

At the time, Bush said publicly that he was not substituting his judgment for that of the jury. So how would he explain a change of mind just 18 months later? That was the argument Ed Gillespie, the president’s counselor, made to Cheney when he came to explain why he was advising Bush against a pardon. “On top of that, the lawyers are not making the case for it,” Gillespie told Cheney, referring to the White House attorneys reviewing the case for Bush. “We’ll be asked, ‘Did the lawyers recommend it?’ And if the lawyers didn’t, it’s going to be hard to justify for the president.”"

WASHINGTON -- House Republicans said Saturday that the White House has rejected their offer to temporarily increase the debt ceiling and open the government.

Members leaving a closed-door meeting said House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) told them talks with President Barack Obama on how to end the government shutdown and avert the looming Oct. 17 deadline to raise the nation's borrowing cap, had reached a dead end. There was also concern that the White House might strike a deal with Senate Republicans, who presented their own plan to Obama on Friday.

Many lawmakers, including House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), said it was now up to their colleagues in the Senate to hold firm so that Republicans in both chambers would appear united.

""I'm disappointed that the president has rejected the offer that we put on the table,"" Cantor told reporters after the meeting. ""I know that he's trying to see which Republican senator he can pick off in the Senate. I hope that the Senate Republicans stand strong so we can speak with one voice.""

House Republicans had put forward a proposal to extend the debt limit for six weeks and work quickly to reopen the government, if the president agreed to a broader framework for deficit reduction. They presented the plan to Obama in a meeting at the White House Thursday evening. Both sides said afterward that discussions would continue, though neither the White House nor GOP leadership said they were close to a deal.

Members suggested both sides wanted to keep the appearance of potential for progress, even though Obama rejected their plan in a phone call with Boehner on Friday.

Rep. John Fleming (R-La.) paraphrased Boehner's message to the conference as, ""Every offer we've made, they've just turned us down.""

He added it was a ""White House talking point"" that the two sides were still talking.

""What [Boehner's] really saying is, 'I'm not shutting the door on further discussions, but right now nothing is happening',"" he said.

Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) said the White House requested that House leadership ""stick with the line that talks were proceeding."" ""That line was continued, and then late yesterday afternoon, the president called and they declined every part of the offer,"" he said.

An aide to Boehner declined comment.

Price said while there was concern over Obama's negotiations with Senate Republicans, he didn't think their plan would pass the upper chamber. Sources told The Huffington Post that a bipartisan group of 10 senators, five from each party, are ironing out the details of a plan floated by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). It would reportedly fund the government through March, raise the debt ceiling through January, give federal agencies flexibility to manage across-the-board cuts caused by sequestration, and delay Obamacare's medical device tax by two years.

""I think the timing on that is challenging,"" Price said. ""We want to get back to a regular order process where we're doing appropriations bills and putting Congress' stamp of priorities on the spending of this government.""

""We hope that our Senate Republican colleagues stand with us united to force the president to have a conversation,"" he added.

Conservative House members outright rejected the Collins' plan and were skeptical it would pass the Senate, let alone the House.

""The idea that Susan Collins can dictate what happens in the Senate is kind of silly,"" Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kansas) said. ""They can negotiate all day long, but obviously at the end of the day it has to pass the House.""

Fleming said the plan was dead on arrival in the House. ""They're not going to get that, because we're not going to support it,"" he said.

UPDATE: 2:05 p.m. -- Senate Democratic leadership rejected the Collins plan Saturday afternoon. A senior Democratic aide said the proposal is pretty unpopular among most Democrats, for two reasons: It locks in the current level of sequestration, minus another $20 billion in 2014, and it makes changes to Obamacare.

""Why would Dems ever support that?"" asked the aide. ""It's crazy that it got this far.""

Negotiations are now in the hands of Senate leaders Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson said McConnell requested a meeting with Reid, and that the two sat down with Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn) in Reid's office Saturday morning to hash out a way forward.

The contours of a deal were far from apparent, but Jentleson added both the White House and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's (D-Calif.) office were ""fully engaged"" as talks progressed.

(CNN) – It would be ""regrettable"" if the identities of the men photographed with Sen. John McCain in Syria this week are confirmed to be individuals responsible for a year-old kidnapping, the Arizona senator's office said in a statement Thursday.

There has been confusion and conflicting reports about who exactly the men pictured with McCain are, and whether or not they were involved in last year's kidnapping. CNN has been unable to confirm the identities of the men in the photograph. Nonetheless, McCain's office was quick to reject speculation the Republican knowingly met with men accused of the abduction.



McCain entered the war-torn country on Monday and met with commanders of the Free Syrian Army, who are fighting forces loyal to Bashar al Assad for control of the country. He was the first U.S. senator to travel to Syria since the civil war broke out there two years ago, and told CNN after leaving that his conviction the U.S. must become more involved in the country's conflict had intensified.

Opponents of a greater U.S. role in Syria say the presence of terrorists among the rebels should prevent lethal aid from being delivered to opposition forces.

A report in the Beirut-based Daily Star newspaper suggested a photo released by McCain's office from the trip showed the Arizona senator standing alongside two men accused of kidnapping 11 Lebanese Shiite pilgrims in May 2012.

The paper cited family members of the kidnapped pilgrims – along with one pilgrim who was kidnapped himself and later released – identifying Mohamad Nour and Abu Ibrahim in one of the handout photos from McCain, which the Republican also posted to Twitter.

But on Thursday, McCain's communications director Brian Rogers strongly denied that McCain would knowingly pose next to men he knew were responsible for kidnapping pilgrims.

""None of the individuals the Senator planned to meet with was named Mohamad Nour or Abu Ibrahim,"" Rogers wrote in a statement. ""A number of other Syrian commanders joined the meeting, but none of them identified himself as Mohamad Nour or Abu Ibrahim.""

The Washington-based group Syrian Emergency Task Force, which helped coordinate the trip, did not arrange any meetings with the men named as kidnappers, Rogers said.

""A number of the Syrians who greeted Senator McCain upon his arrival in Syria asked to take pictures with him, and as always, the Senator complied,"" he continued. ""If the individual photographed with Senator McCain is in fact Mohamed Nour, that is regrettable. But it would be ludicrous to suggest that the Senator in any way condones the kidnapping of Lebanese Shia pilgrims or has any communication with those responsible. Senator McCain condemns such heinous actions in the strongest possible terms.""

The kidnapping in question took place in May 2012. The pilgrims - all men - were detained by an armed group in northern Syria after crossing the border from Turkey. They were on their way back from visiting holy sites in Iran.

The pilgrims' wives were not detained but sent to the city of Aleppo; from there they returned to Lebanon.

McCain's trip to Syria underscored a long-standing debate among U.S. lawmakers over whether the U.S. should provide arms and other lethal aid to rebels in Syria.

McCain has been the leading voice in Congress calling on President Barack Obama to ramp up support for Syrian rebels, who now receive nonlethal aid like food and medicine from the United States. In early April that aid was stepped up to include equipment such as body armor, night vision goggles and other military equipment that is considered defensive in nature.

In their meeting with McCain, leaders of the Syrian rebel forces pressed the United States to provide them with weapons to continue their fight against Assad. They specifically said they need ammunition, as well as antitank and antiaircraft weapons, McCain said in an interview with CNN on Wednesday.

""They do not understand why we won't help them,"" he told Anderson Cooper.

A bipartisan measure that would allow lethal weaponry to ""vetted Syrian groups"" passed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier this month. The ""Syria Transition Support Act"" also calls for military training and both lethal and non-lethal arms for vetted groups; a $250 million ""transition fund each year"" through fiscal year 2015, and sanctions on oil sales to al-Assad.

But dissenters from both parties have expressed concerns about lethal arms ending up in the hands of terrorists, who could later use them against Americans or other allies of the United States. Republican Sen. Rand Paul has been outspoken about his opposition to U.S. intervention in Syria, part of his broader anti-interventionist stance. In an opinion article for CNN.com, Paul wrote Wednesday that arming the rebels would be ""complicated and dangerous"" and ""could actually help the extremists.""

He also took subtle jabs at McCain, pointing to the senator's switch in support from former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to the rebels seeking his demise.

Among the groups that worry U.S. leaders is the al-Nusra Front, which is designated by the United States as a pro-al Qaeda terrorist group. Members of the organization have joined the rebels in their fight against Assad.

McCain told CNN Wednesday that members of the extremist group currently represent only 7% of the 100,000 total rebel forces.

""We can help the right people,"" he said. ""Is there some risk involved? Absolutely. But is the status quo acceptable?""

The suit, filed in federal court in Washington, alleges that FBI agents and Defense Department employees disclosed Kelley's identity to outside parties, including the news media, and violated her privacy while investigating Petraeus' extramarital relationship with Paula Broadwell, the author of a Petraeus biography. Kelley, who frequently hosted Petraeus and his wife at parties, complained to the FBI that Broadwell had sent her threatening emails, and had viewed Kelley as a potential competitor for Petreaus' affections. The FBI later dropped the investigation without charges.

The lawsuit, filed by Kelley and her husband, surgeon Scott Kelley, seeks unspecified monetary damages, a formal apology, and an accounting of the information the FBI and Defense Department gathered about them. The complaint details how the Kelleys' lives were turned upside down once their names were publicly linked to the Petraeus scandal.

In addition to the nonstop media attention, the revelation that Jill Kelley had communicated on a regular basis with both Petraeus and Gen. John Allen led to suggestions she may have had romantic relationships with the commanders. Allen abruptly retired after the disclosure.

""There was no legally acceptable reason for the government to disclose confidential information about the Kelleys and thereby make them part of the public scandal,"" the lawsuit says. Details about the Kelleys' personal lives and their financial difficulties was widely reported.

""Mrs. Kelley’s reputation is indelibly tainted,"" the complaint says. ""She is consistently referred to as the 'center' of the 'sex scandal' and is often portrayed as the woman who brought down two American generals. As a result, she -- the victim and a participant in none of the bad acts in the sex scandal -- has shouldered the blame as the villain in the generals’ downfall.""

The suit describes damage to Jill Kelley's social reputation and connections to those in high places, which it claims were key to her earnings. The scandal caused the revocation of Jill Kelley's honorary consulship to South Korea, which ""deprived her of significant social and financial networking, investment, and business fee finder opportunities, as well as the loss of the tax-free annual stipend for years,"" the suit says. Today, Jill Kelley ""no longer receives prestigious invitations to the diplomatic and distinguished governmental functions."" The complaint adds that ""Dr. Kelley also suffered dramatic financial losses.""

The lawsuit is peppered with links to news articles about the Kelleys from late 2012. According to one, the Kelleys were considering legal action as far back as late November, when their attorney at the time, D.C. powerhouse litigator Abbe Lowell, released a slew of emails and phone records intended to prove that Jill Kelley did not exploit her friendship with Petraeus for financial gain.

But now, six months later, the issue of potential overreach in a federal investigation has taken on a very different tenor in Washington, a fact likely not lost on Kelley and her attorneys. Public anger has erupted over news that the Department of Justice gathered journalists' phone and email records in leak investigations. This, combined with a scandal at the Internal Revenue Service over the targeting of tea party groups for special tax scrutiny, has put the Obama administration on defense.

In the ensuing months, Jill Kelley has emerged as an advocate for greater Internet privacy and received an award from the Electronic Privacy Information Center on Monday.

Jill Kelley said in a statement provided to The Huffington Post that her experience ""made me an advocate for privacy rights for every American."" She said she would continue to work to ensure that citizens would ""not have their personal communications improperly and unreasonably searched by overreaching government or any other abuse of government powers.""

The Justice Department has 60 days to respond to the lawsuit."

USA TODAY

The Rand Paul vs. Chris Christie spat appears to be getting nastier.

Paul, a Kentucky senator, escalated his attacks on the New Jersey governor, saying on Fox News that it is ""kind of sad and cheap"" that his fellow Republican is using ""the cloak of 9/11 victims"" to criticize him on national security.

Christie followed up Tuesday with a shot about Kentucky's federal spending, along with his trademark straight talk. ""Get in line"" if you've got a personal problem with his bluntness, the governor said.

While Christie and Paul are both mentioned as potential Republican presidential candidates in 2016, their verbal fusillades aren't a sideshow. Their dispute about national security and federal spending exposes the fissures within the GOP -- similar to another battle being waged now over immigration -- that will likely be played out in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina during the presidential primaries.

This all began last week when Christie said at an Aspen Institute forum that there is a ""strain of libertarianism"" within the Republican Party by those who oppose the National Security Agency's warrantless surveillance program and other counterterrorism techniques. The governor said Paul and others in the GOP could come to New Jersey and explain their opposition to the ""widows and orphans"" who lost loved ones in the Sept. 11 terror attacks.

Paul's first response Sunday was to go after Christie on federal spending, and what he called a ""gimme, gimme, gimme"" attitude when it came to Superstorm Sandy aid.

During a Fox News appearance Monday, the Kentucky senator teed off again. First, Paul said the Republican Party in the Northeast is ""on life support"" and that ""it's not real smart for Republicans to be attacking Republicans."" Then Paul threw 9/11 back at Christie before repeating the federal spending charge.

Christie said Tuesday that he's got ""nothing personal"" against the senator, but said Paul's words seem as though ""he has something personal against me, but that's OK. He can just get in line on that front.""

As for the charges on federal spending, Christie noted that New Jersey gets back 61 cents for every dollar sent to Washington while Kentucky receives $1.51. ""Maybe he should start cutting the pork-barrel spending that he brings home to Kentucky,"" the governor said.

Sounds like the ball is back in Paul's court. Over to you, senator.

Chuck Hagel, filibustered Republican nominee.

The Senate is going to take a second stab at a confirmation vote for former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) to be defense secretary next Tuesday, and indications are that this time Republicans won't have the votes to sustain their filibuster. Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL) will vote for Hagel on Tuesday. Damning him with faint praise, Shelby told thethat Hagel is ""probably as good as we're going to get,"" in announcing his vote switch.

What else could Republicans really do at this point, particularly after the national humiliation of the ""Friends of Hamas"" debacle? There is a diehard corps of Republicans, though, that don't seem to get that they've made themselves public laughingstocks, and who just aren't capable of being embarrassed into backing down. That would be the 15 who wrote a letter to President Obama demanding that he withdraw the nomination. They include Lindsey ""I'm a tea partier! Really!"" Graham, Jim ""Hamas is like the Salvation Army"" Inhofe, and Ted ""Calgary"" Cruz who, and this is true, has a list of the communists who have infiltrated Harvard Law School. Oh, and 2016's would-be golden boy, Marco Rubio.

But with Shelby moving on, the gig is up. Republicans Thad Cochran, Mike Johanns, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski voted with Democrats last week to end cloture, and very likely will again. With all 55 Democrats, that's all she wrote. Even John McCain appears to know that enough is enough, and is ready to give up and vote for cloture. If there are already enough Republican votes to get it done, though, McCain will probably just be pissy enough to vote no. Because that's just who he is.

The pointless delay of Hagel's confirmation has accomplished a few things about Republicans, however. First, no matter how outlandish the story, if Breitbart reports it, they'll run with it. Second, these are the people who have de facto control over the Senate! They'll filibuster anything on the flimsiest of grounds, just because the can, new filibuster rules be damned.

That still has to change. If you haven't already, please sign our petition urging Harry Reid to re-open the process of filibuster reform in the Senate."

Bush will make a rare post-presidential foray into politics on Wednesday when he delivers a speech about immigration, thrusting himself into a contentious internal policy debate which has split the Republican Party he once led.

GOP lawmakers are already sending signals that his thoughts won't sway them but immigration reform is one of the great unfinished items of Bush’s presidency. His words on the matter are all the more noteworthy considering how hesitant he has been to delve into politics since leaving office, preferring instead to pursue other activities, such as charity work and his new painting hobby.

But his absence from the public stage has been more than self-imposed. Republicans have often turned their backs on his two-term presidency since he left office highly unpopular in most polls. The former president has not been a staple on the campaign trail as many former presidents have been, and he was kept so far away from the 2012 campaign that his brother, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, was left to defend his record and legacy at last year’s Republican convention.

Largely because of that history, Bush’s sentiments don’t appear to matter much to many House Republicans, who now control the fate of comprehensive immigration reform and will huddle behind closed doors to plot their path forward on the issue the same day Bush speaks at a naturalization ceremony at his presidential library in Texas. They’ve already signaled that Bush won’t have much impact on their deliberations of a bipartisan bill passed by the Senate last month.

It’s unclear precisely what Bush will say in his remarks but in a recent interview he reiterated his view that it is “very important to fix a broken system, to treat people with respect and have confidence in our capacity to assimilate people.”

Rep. Tim Griffin, an Arkansas Republican who served as a political aide in the Bush White House, flatly said “no” when asked whether his former boss’s words would weigh on his or other Republicans’ thinking on immigration.

“We represent our constituents. I think he's a great man, and I respect him greatly,” Griffin said. “But I've got 85 to 95 percent of constituents’ calls to my office against the Senate bill every week.”

The battle over comprehensive immigration reform into which Bush is wading is just the latest and broadest example of the internal battle over the trajectory of the GOP. It’s a fight pitting dogged, grassroots conservatives against establishment Republicans who worry that itinerant conservatism will irreparably harm the party – in this case, with the increasingly influential bloc of Hispanic voters.

Bush’s remarks during a naturalization ceremony at his presidential library could ostensibly break through that rift.

A number of Republicans in Congress have come to Washington in the elections since Bush left office, and the party’s identity is more tied into opposing President Barack Obama than celebrating the legacy of Obama’s predecessor. But the fight over comprehensive immigration reform during the Bush administration in many ways presaged the GOP’s struggles with Hispanic voters since conservatives drove the Republican president’s immigration proposals into the ground in 2007.

Republican proponents of comprehensive immigration reform argue that conservatives would be well-served to tune into Bush’s remarks on Wednesday.

“I think it's a reminder that he, a Republican president, tried so hard to get immigration done and it is unfinished business for him,” Ana Navarro, a prominent Republican advocate of immigration reform, said of Bush’s speech. “And I suspect that it won't be lost on some of the bigger thinkers in the GOP that the guy giving the speech was the last Republican to win the presidency and did it with 44 percent of the Hispanic vote.” (An NBC News analysis determined that Bush won 40 percent of the Latino vote in the 2004 election, still up considerably from John McCain’s 31 percent in 2008 and Mitt Romney’s 27 percent in 2012.)

“No, he's not going to sway Steve King,” she added, referring to the hardline Iowa conservative congressman. “But yes, his voice will make a difference to some and it's the right thing for him to do.”

Bush’s counsel for Republicans in his ABC interview was understated. “Good policy yields good politics, as far as I’m concerned,” the former president said.

Not that Bush’s endorsement of the Senate immigration reform law, which passed last month with bipartisan support, would necessarily make a difference.

“I'll take the hypothetical. If he were to come out for the Senate bill, in all due respect, I would say he's wrong,” said Griffin.

It doesn’t help that Bush’s cachet among conservatives had steadily eroded over the course of his second term. Mike Needham, the head of the conservative Heritage Action for America (which opposes the Senate-passed immigration reform proposal), said that after mounting government spending and Bush’s failed Supreme Court nomination of Harriet Miers, “the immigration bill did nothing to enamor the base to President Bush.”

“I think there's a strong sense among the conservative base that fundamentally the deck is stacked against people across the country and in favor of special interests,” he said.

And to the extent that Bush’s arguments threaten to fall largely upon deaf ears, it reflects the drastic shifts in the GOP over the course of just a few years. The balance of power now favors groups like Heritage Action rather than one of the two surviving former Republican presidents.

“Fundamentally, where the Republican establishment misses the boat is that people just don't trust Washington,” Needham said.

Brennan, a gruff 25-year CIA veteran and the White House's counterterrorism adviser, also spent much of the hearing fielding questions about the president's use of drone strikes, a controversial program of targeted killing abroad. Brennan defended the use of drone strikes against terrorists but said he preferred catching them alive.

“I never believe it’s better to kill a terrorist than to detain him,"" he said, and added there was value in interrogating suspects.

The issue had attracted fresh scrutiny this week when NBC News obtained and published a 16-page white paper that gives the green light for targeting individual Americans anywhere outside the U.S. for assassination—without oversight from Congress or the courts, and even if the U.S. citizen in question is not actively plotting a specific terrorist attack.

The White House on Tuesday defended targeted assassinations as “necessary,” “ethical” and “wise.” Human rights and civil liberties groups have condemned those strikes partly because they are carried out without such congressional oversight. Other critics have warned that civilian deaths in drone strikes inflame anti-U.S. sentiment and help Islamist extremist groups recruit new members.

Brennan got a bit of help late on Wednesday on the issue of drone strikes from Obama, who directed the Justice Department to share with the Senate and House Intelligence Committees several classified memos laying out the legal rationale for the strikes, notably those that target Americans. Some of the Senate committee’s eight Democrats and seven Republicans had suggested they might block Brennan's nomination until the administration made those documents available.

Story continues

Brennan also faced questions about how he opposed Bush administration “enhanced interrogation techniques""—practices like waterboarding, which the United States used to label torture. He has said in the past that, while at the CIA, he objected to that program. He told the committee that he believes waterboarding ""should not be done"" and that it ""never will be"" used under his direction.

In a prehearing submission to the committee, Brennan said he “did not play a role in its creation, execution or oversight” and “had significant concerns and personal objections” that he expressed privately to colleagues at the agency. Four years ago, Brennan withdrew his name from consideration to head the CIA in the face of opposition from liberal groups who charged that he had not done enough to oppose such interrogations. And Republican Sen. John McCain, who survived torture as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, released a letter late Wednesday openly doubting that Brennan put up much of a fight.

Regarding information leaks, Republicans have charged that the Obama administration has disclosed sensitive information for political gain. When pressed by North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr about the information he makes public, Brennan denied revealing classified information from covert operations.

""I know the importance of keeping those secrets secret,"" he said.

At the beginning of the hearing, protestors from the anti-war group Code Pink interrupted the proceedings and were immediately escorted out of the committee room. ""We're making more enemies,"" one demonstrator shouted, referring to the United States' ongoing military campaigns abroad. Other protesters continued to interrupt the hearing before committee Chairman Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., ordered the room cleared.

Brennan will undergo a confidential hearing before the committee votes on his confirmation."

Pollsters say the funding fight makes Republicans look even more obstructionist, and causes voters to worry about the effect a shutdown would have on their own finances.

Whit Ayres of North Star Opinion Research, who has been drilling down on this issue for the conservative public-opinion group Resurgent Republic, said: “Shutting down the government is the one way that Republicans can turn Obamacare from a political advantage to a political disadvantage in 2014.”"

State legislatures are passing many limits on abortion-related services

Deluge of state restrictions began in 2011

Restrictions include waiting periods%2C required counseling and more

Forty years after the Supreme Court legalized abortion, the constitutional right many Americans take for granted is coming under increased scrutiny.

State legislatures are passing limits on abortion-related services. More abortion providers face stepped-up regulations, and more patients face strictly worded counseling sessions or ultrasound tests. At least four states have just one clinic performing abortions.

As a result, dozens of challenges to those laws have been lodged in state and federal courts, and it may not be long before the issue is before the high court again. ""There's a lot of states that are just one clinic away from having no services altogether,"" says Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights. ""I think the next couple of years are going to be critical.""

Despite winning many battles over the past four decades, anti-abortion forces may be losing the war. The landmark Roe v. Wade decision of Jan. 22, 1973, still stands. The Supreme Court's slim majority in favor of abortion rights remains intact. And at least for another four years, presumably, President Obama will ensure that doesn't change.

""So many factors play a role in whether or not we will have the majority on the Supreme Court,"" says Mary Spaulding Balch, state legislation director for the National Right to Life Committee. ""But we're working to get all those factors lined up so that sometime in the future, we will have the ability to reverse Roe.""

In the meantime, the number and rate of abortions have declined over the past decade, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, because of a drop in teen pregnancies and increased use of birth control. The impact of the state restrictions isn't clear.

Although public opinion polls have been relatively steady for two generations in favor of legal abortion, one trend is growing: Among the majority of Americans born since Roe was decided, nearly four in 10 don't know it's about abortion, the Pew Research Center found. Support for Roe, though strong, is giving way ever so gradually to ambivalence.

Taken together, all those trends — legislative, legal, political, medical, public opinion — show why both sides continue to fight like it's still 1973. Ask Teresa Collett, an abortion opponent and scholar at the University of St. Thomas School of Law in Minnesota, who's winning and she has a ready answer: ""nobody.""

A new president in the White House or a change on the Supreme Court could change things. But after 40 years, legal abortion has become a way of life in America.

""Roe v. Wade is considered now to be the law of the land,"" says Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood. ""Voters consistently, no matter what state, believe that women should be making decisions about their own pregnancies. I really do believe that this country is not going to go backwards.""

After Roe, restrictions grow

Jan. 22, 1973, will forever be frozen in history for proponents and opponents of abortion rights.

In the court's 7-2 decision, Justice Harry Blackmun declared all state abortion bans unconstitutional because they interfered with the rights to privacy and liberty. Any future decision reversing Roe would not end legal abortion; rather, the authority would return to the states.

Less understood is the pregnancy timetable set by the decision. It allowed states to regulate abortions once the fetus reaches a state of viability capable of living outside the womb — providing for exceptions when the mother's health is at risk.

In the decades since, limitations have increased. A 1980 case restricted the use of Medicaid funds for abortions to cases involving rape, incest or the life of the mother.

Then, in 1992's Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the court granted states broad authority to require counseling and waiting periods, and parental consent for minors, before any abortions — as long as such laws didn't constitute an ""undue burden.""

The last major ruling came in 2007, when the court upheld a federal ban on so-called partial-birth abortions, usually performed between 20 and 24 weeks of pregnancy.

The decision was written by Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, who became the court's swing vote after Sandra Day O'Connor retired in 2006.

""That was a real turning point for Supreme Court observers, 'They allowed this prohibition, what else will they allow?' "" says Charmaine Yoest, president of Americans United for Life.

Since then, states have experimented with tougher restrictions, and supporters of abortion rights have challenged many in court. At the same time, the abortion rights cause has had victories at the federal level. Last month, Congress lifted the ban that had prohibited women in the military from using their federal health insurance to get abortions after rape or incest.

Even with the limitations, an average of 3,300 abortions are performed daily in the USA, according to the Guttmacher Institute.

""Abortions are still constitutionally protected,"" says Caitlin Borgmann, a City University of New York law professor who maintains a blog on reproductive rights. ""They're still widely available in the U.S., and the polling has not changed.""

Battles from Ariz. to Va.

The trickle of state restrictions on abortion became a deluge in 2011, when 92 provisions passed in 24 states. Last year produced 43 more, according to a survey by the Guttmacher Institute, a sexual and reproductive health think tank that supports abortion rights. The restrictions, passed mostly in states with Republican governors and legislatures, fall into several categories:

Earlier bans. Laws in Arizona and Georgia that seek to ban abortion at about 20 weeks, or in cases where the fetus could feel pain, have been blocked in court. Seven other states have similar bans — Alabama, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Carolina and Oklahoma. Since fetal pain is a potentially earlier threshold than viability, the laws represent a challenge to Roe. ""I think it's the most realistic threat of the extreme measures that challenge Roe directly,"" Borgmann says.

More than half the nation's states require waiting periods, usually 24 hours, between counseling and abortions.

As a result of all the restrictions, ""women have more information available to them as they make the decision whether to continue or curtail their pregnancy,"" Collett says.

Abortion rights supporters don't see it that way.

""What they've done is really make women walk through a gantlet to get access,"" Richards says."

At a Washington, D.C., memorial Monday night, members of Congress and loved ones gathered to remember Swartz, who committed suicide on Jan. 11 while facing years in prison for mass-downloading scholarly articles.

Swartz had already reshaped the Web experiences of millions by co-creating Reddit and the information-distribution service RSS. By turns, speakers at the Cannon House Office Building compared Swartz to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Apple founder Steve Jobs, and 20th century British programmer Alan Turing -- with Swartz as yet another cybergenius whose ambitions carried him to the law’s edge.

Swartz hanged himself in New York while under indictment for purportedly breaking the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Prosecutors had hinted he might face decades in federal prison for violating a law that congressional speakers at the memorial said they planned to change.

Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Vista), leader of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has opened an inquiry into Swartz’s prosecution by the U.S. Attorney’s office in Massachussetts. Issa told the audience, “We suspect some of it had to do with ambition, big prosecutions, smart people being brought down.”

Issa related an anecdote about selling cookies as a child to fund summer-camp trips, in which he’d punched buzzers on an apartment building door until a stranger let him in.

“I broke the law,” Issa said, adding later, “If everyone who ever tried to guess a combination on a safe -- or a password, or looked at a diary, endlessly deciding whether to open it, or a drawer that was half-opened -- [if everyone] was brought up on charges on the maximum value of what could have been the damages, then our jails… would in fact be beyond overflowing.”

Democratic Colorado Rep. Jared Polis criticized Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz’s prosecution as “a perversity of justice.”

“What I hope comes out of this terrible travesty is a policy change -- an awakening, something that will prevent this type of travesty from occurring to anybody else in this country,” Polis said.

Two legislators attending, Democratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden and Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-San Jose), have cosponsored legislation called “Aaron’s Law” that is intended to remove terms-of-service breaches from punishment under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and wire fraud statutes.

Swartz had planned to republish the expensive scholarly articles online in a place where they’d be available for free. Swartz previously said the information belonged to the world.

Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) recalled Swartz’s work as an intern. “Aaron wanted to rock the boat, not just for the sake of boat-rocking, but for the sake of improving the lives of ordinary people,” he said.

Grayson compared Swartz to Alan Turing, a crack codebreaker who was prosecuted by the British government in 1952 for being gay, which was against the law. “I’m sure there were people at that point in those days who said, ‘The law is the law – if you disobey the law, you go to prison,’ ” Grayson said.

After Turing was forced to accept estrogen treatments in exchange for avoiding prison, he killed himself.

“What we engage in is human sacrifice,” Grayson said. “We sacrifice their lives in the misguided sense that we need to protect ourselves from them, when instead, it’s the exact opposite.”

Swartz’s father, Bob Swartz -- who previously spoke with the Los Angeles Times about his son’s death -- cited a long list of other computer innovators who had, at times, broken the law, or came close.

“Are we a country that wants to encourage our best and brightest, who see things differently?” he asked. “Or do we want to crush them?”

She Joined The Post In', 'Is Based In Washington']",Obama administration had restrictions on NSA reversed in 2011,"The Obama administration secretly won permission from a surveillance court in 2011 to reverse restrictions on the National Security Agency’s use of intercepted phone calls and e-mails, permitting the agency to search deliberately for Americans’ communications in its massive databases, according to interviews with government officials and recently declassified material.

In addition, the court extended the length of time that the NSA is allowed to retain intercepted U.S. communications from five years to six years — and more under special circumstances, according to the documents, which include a recently released 2011 opinion by U.S. District Judge John D. Bates, then chief judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

What had not been previously acknowledged is that the court in 2008 imposed an explicit ban — at the government’s request — on those kinds of searches, that officials in 2011 got the court to lift the bar and that the search authority has been used.

Together the permission to search and to keep data longer expanded the NSA’s authority in significant ways without public debate or any specific authority from Congress. The administration’s assurances rely on legalistic definitions of the term “target” that can be at odds with ordinary English usage. The enlarged authority is part of a fundamental shift in the government’s approach to surveillance: collecting first, and protecting Americans’ privacy later.

“The government says, ‘We’re not targeting U.S. persons,’ ” said Gregory T. Nojeim, senior counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology. “But then they never say, ‘We turn around and deliberately search for Americans’ records in what we took from the wire.’ That, to me, is not so different from targeting Americans at the outset.”

Read the document Declassified 2011 FISA court ruling Opinion struck down an NSA program that unlawfully gathered thousands of electronic communications between Americans.

The court decision allowed the NSA “to query the vast majority” of its e-mail and phone call databases using the e-mail addresses and phone numbers of Americans and legal residents without a warrant, according to Bates’s opinion.

The queries must be “reasonably likely to yield foreign intelligence information.” And the results are subject to the NSA’s privacy rules.

The court in 2008 imposed a wholesale ban on such searches at the government’s request, said Alex Joel, civil liberties protection officer at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). The government included this restriction “to remain consistent with NSA policies and procedures that NSA applied to other authorized collection activities,” he said.

But in 2011, to more rapidly and effectively identify relevant foreign intelligence communications, “we did ask the court” to lift the ban, ODNI general counsel Robert S. Litt said in an interview. “We wanted to be able to do it,” he said, referring to the searching of Americans’ communications without a warrant.

Joel gave hypothetical examples of why the authority was needed, such as when the NSA learns of a rapidly developing terrorist plot and suspects that a U.S. person may be a conspirator. Searching for communications to, from or about that person can help assess that person’s involvement and whether he is in touch with terrorists who are surveillance targets, he said. Officials would not say how many searches have been conducted.

The court’s expansion of authority went largely unnoticed when the opinion was released, but it formed the basis for cryptic warnings last year by a pair of Democratic senators, Ron Wyden (Ore.) and Mark Udall (Colo.), that the administration had a “back-door search loophole” that enabled the NSA to scour intercepted communications for those of Americans. They introduced legislation to require a warrant, but they were barred by classification rules from disclosing the court’s authorization or whether the NSA was already conducting such searches.

“The [surveillance] Court documents declassified recently show that in late 2011 the court authorized the NSA to conduct warrantless searches of individual Americans’ communications using an authority intended to target only foreigners,” Wyden said in a statement to The Washington Post. “Our intelligence agencies need the authority to target the communications of foreigners, but for government agencies to deliberately read the e-mails or listen to the phone calls of individual Americans, the Constitution requires a warrant.”

Senior administration officials disagree. “If we’re validly targeting foreigners and we happen to collect communications of Americans, we don’t have to close our eyes to that,” Litt said. “I’m not aware of other situations where once we have lawfully collected information, we have to go back and get a warrant to look at the information we’ve already collected.”

The searches take place under a surveillance program Congress authorized in 2008 under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Under that law, the target must be a foreigner “reasonably believed” to be outside the United States, and the court must approve the targeting procedures in an order good for one year.

But — and this was the nub of the criticism — a warrant for each target would no longer be required. That means that communications with Americans could be picked up without a court first determining that there is probable cause that the people they were talking to were terrorists, spies or “foreign powers.”

That is why it is important to require a warrant before searching for Americans’ data, Udall said. “Our founders laid out a roadmap where Americans’ privacy rights are protected before their communications are seized or searched — not after the fact,” he said in a statement to The Post.

Another change approved by Bates allows the agency to keep the e-mails of or concerning Americans for up to six years, with an extension possible for foreign intelligence or counterintelligence purposes. Because the retention period begins “from the expiration date” of the one-year surveillance period, the court effectively added up to one year of shelf life for the e-mails collected at the beginning of the period.

Joel said that the change was intended to standardize retention periods across the agencies and that the more generous standard was “already in use” by another agency.

The NSA intercepts more than 250 million Internet communications each year under Section 702. Ninety-one percent are from U.S. Internet companies such as Google and Yahoo. The rest come from “upstream” companies that route Internet traffic to, from and within the United States. The expanded search authority applies only to the downstream collection.

Shear', 'Ashley Parker']",Immigration Bill Debate Nears in Senate,"The legislation, which would be the first major immigration overhaul since President Ronald Reagan backed amnesty for illegal immigrants in 1986, was drafted over the last several months by the so-called Gang of Eight, a bipartisan group of senators. It is largely in step with the president’s goals of offering a path to citizenship for the millions of illegal immigrants already in the country while tightening border security and expanding legal entry into the country for families and workers.

But no one expects the bill to pass the Senate without some modifications. Mr. Obama’s Republican allies on the issue — in particular Senators Marco Rubio of Florida, a member of the bipartisan group, and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma — warned last week that the president could lose their support without stronger efforts to secure the border, as well as other changes.

“I’m trying to get to where I can say yes,” Mr. Coburn said as senators prepared to clear the way for what could be weeks of debate in the full chamber. “But the only way you can say yes and sell it to the American people is to know that the border is secure, and this bill doesn’t do it.”

Mr. Obama will try to set the tone for the legislative fight with a speech at the White House on Tuesday. But the battle will quickly shift to the Capitol, where the biggest struggle may be over how far to go in securing America’s border with Mexico against illegal crossings.

White House officials say they expect Democrats will have to make compromises on border security by accepting some amendments that tighten enforcement. But they said Democrats would resist any amendments that significantly undermine the core of the bill — a certain path to citizenship for those already in the country.

“We are willing to toughen up border — many of our colleagues feel that’s important — but without forsaking our principles,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and a member of the bipartisan group. He said border security demands must be reasonable “so that if, God forbid, there’s a president in 2017 who hates immigration reform, it will still go forward.”

Mr. Obama has stayed clear of personally directing the legislative process from the West Wing, on the theory that his participation would make it more difficult for Republicans to support it. But administration officials are working behind the scenes with allies from both parties in the Senate to provide technical support as they draft friendly amendments to the legislation. They are also helping lawmakers develop talking points and prepare side-by-side comparisons to help defeat efforts intended to undermine the bill."

Important!',"Moments after President Obama made his briefing room statement about race and Trayvon Martin, CNN’s BREAKING NEWS graphic swirled, faded, and cut to anchor Brooke Baldwin, who was visibly flushed with excitement. Brooke announced, “Wow, what a surprise we have all witnessed, if you have been tuned in the last half-hour, we were watching THE President surprise everyone…”

She went on to describe Obama’s statement as “very, very personal; very heartfelt.” Baldwin then assured her audience that Obama had “not used a teleprompter,” because he had “given much thought and much time to making this message VERY personal.”

The CNN anchor then went to a video clip saying, “But FIRST, here’s the president, making this personal.”

Apparently, Baldwin thought Obama’s statement was personal.

After the clip, Breathless Brooke returned with her panel: Candy Crowley, Sonny Hostin, Jessica Yellin, and Gloria Borger.

After another “Wow!”, Baldwin (who looked like she might have been trembling) turned things over to Chief White House Correspondent, Yellin.

If you hadn’t known what she was talking about, based solely on Yellin’s awe-inspired melodramatic rhetoric, you would think that something had happened on the level of the first man walking on the moon. Barely able to contain herself, Yellin described Obama’s statement as something “as personal and as bluntly as I have ever heard him speak about racism in America and his own experience of racism in his life.”

Yellin later added that this was “an important moment for this president, and an important moment for America.”

After again reminding us of how “incredibly personal” Obama was, Baldwin then turned things over to Candy Crowley.

As excited as the rest, Crowley jumped right in to tell us that Obama is a “thoughtful guy” and the “sort of person who thinks these things through.”

Crowley obviously missed Obama’s “acted stupid” racial debacle.

Crowley closed her comment by pointing out that Obama has just “elevated the discussion.”

Sonny Hostin, the only legal analyst in the country who was shocked by the Zimmerman verdict, was left a little speechless due to the “so many thoughts she had running through her mind. After mentioning that she was the mother of a “young, brown boy,” she then put those thoughts together and used Obama’s words to trash our country and judicial system as racist.

Finally, it was political analyst Gloria Borger’s turn, and she started out with some hysterical nonsense about how Obama didn’t want this conversation to be about him — even though this is the second time he has chosen to interject both himself and his race into a local crime that had nothing to with him or racism. Borger found this, “stunning.”

Borger than narrowed her eyes and talked about how Obama came to the podium as an “African-American male and reflected soberly about some important issues we have to discuss in this country.” Borger was in awe over how Obama “distilled ” all of these complicated issues one statement.

My favorite part of the discussion, though, was Borger’s non sequitar. Baldwin had a good moment when she said that she wanted to make clear that the “Stand your Ground” law had nothing to do with Zimmerman’s defense.

Borger then jumped in to say, “But it is the law in thirty states.”

Huh?

Bottom line: For almost fifteen minutes it was hard to tell if you were watching a cable news network, or a slumber party-cam with five breathless Beliebers after a Justin Bieber concert.

The gushing was as non-stop as the criticism and intelligent insight was non-existent.

Throughout the segment, Obama was constantly referred to as an “African-American.”

Like George Zimmerman, Obama has one white parent.

CNN, however, only refers to Zimmerman as a “white Hispanic.”

http://news.yahoo.com/judge-supreme-court-sign-ban-unconstitutional-194802615.html,,[],Judge: Supreme Court sign ban unconstitutional,"WASHINGTON (AP) — In a case that could end with the Supreme Court deciding how much free speech to allow on its own doorstep, a federal judge has thrown out a law barring processions and expressive banners on the Supreme Court grounds.

The law is so broad, the judge said, that it could criminalize preschool students parading on their first field trip to the high court.

Harold Hodge Jr. was arrested on the Supreme Court plaza in January 2011 while wearing a sign that criticized police treatment of blacks and Hispanics.

He claimed the law violates the constitution, and U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell agreed. She ruled Tuesday that the statute ran afoul of the First Amendment's free speech protections.

The Rutherford Institute, a civil liberties organization which challenged the law on Hodge's behalf, said that ruling ""throws a lifeline to the First Amendment at a time when government officials are doing their best to censor, silence and restrict free speech activities.""

A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Washington said the office was reviewing the decision.

If the Obama administration appeals, the case could reach the Supreme Court, historically the guardian of free speech rights. That could create the ultimate not-in-my-backyard case, except it would be more about the court's front yard.

In 2011, Hodge was on the Supreme Court plaza wearing a sign that said, ""The U.S. Gov. Allows Police To Illegally Murder and Brutalize African Americans And Hispanic People.""

After Hodge refused a Supreme Court police officer's order to leave the plaza, he was arrested and given a citation for violating the law.

That law makes it a crime to ""parade, stand, or move in processions or assemblages,"" or to display a ""flag, banner, or device designed or adapted to bring into public notice a party, organization, or movement,"" at the high court's building or grounds.

The charge eventually was dropped in a deal with prosecutors in which Hodge agreed to stay away from the Supreme Court grounds for six months. But after that period was up, Hodge decided he wanted to come back, and this time he was backed by lawyers.

Story continues

Last year, Hodge sued and said he planned to return to the plaza and picket, hand out leaflets, sing, chant and make speeches.

In a 67-page opinion, Howell, an appointee of President Barack Obama, said that the law's prohibitions on signs and processions were both overly broad. She wrote that the government ""essentially conceded"" during oral arguments that the ban on signs would prohibit a group of tourists assembling on the Supreme Court plaza, all wearing T-shirts to bring public notice to their organization — be it a church, school or other group.

The ban on processions, the judge wrote, ""could apply to, and provide criminal penalties for, any group parading or assembling for any conceivable purpose, even, for example, the familiar line of preschool students from federal agency daycare centers, holding hands with chaperones, parading on the plaza on their first field trip to the Supreme Court.""

The government argued that the law was a ""reasonable limitation on speech,"" because it furthered two significant interests: permitting unimpeded access of visitors to the Supreme Court, and preserving the appearance of the court as a body not swayed by external influence.

Howell wasn't buying it.

She said that first interest wasn't significant enough to justify the ban. As for the second, ""It is hard to imagine how tourists assembling on the plaza wearing T-shirts bearing their school's seal, for example, could possibly create the appearance of a judicial system vulnerable to outside pressure.""

Should the Supreme Court decide the case, it won't be the first time the justices have ruled on a challenge like this.

Howell went into detail on the history of the no-protests law, which was passed in 1949 and patterned after a law that applied to the U.S. Capitol grounds.

The Capitol grounds law was challenged by a coalition of women against the Vietnam War, and in 1972, a three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia declared it unconstitutional. The Supreme Court affirmed the decision.

In 1981, the federal appeals court in Washington threw out the ""nearly identical"" law applying to the Supreme Court, saying it was ""repugnant to the First Amendment of the Constitution. ... We believe that it would be tragic if the grounds of the Supreme Court, unquestionably the greatest protector of First Amendment rights, stood as an island of silence in which those rights could never be exercised in any form.""

But the Supreme Court took a narrower view. The justices agreed that the law was unconstitutional as it applied to sidewalks surrounding the court, but they did not decide on the constitutionality of the law as a whole. Now, the current practice is that protesters have to stay on the sidewalk, but can't be on the marble plaza at the foot of the court's front steps.

In an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, Justice Thurgood Marshall said the Supreme Court should have gone further. The late justice said he ""would not leave visitors to this court subject to the continuing threat of imprisonment if they dare to exercise their First Amendment rights once inside the sidewalk.""

Decision a victory for pro-choice proponents

But what%27s OK in Oklahoma is not in Texas

Issue of early-pregnancy abortion won%27t go away

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court won't consider Oklahoma's appeal seeking to reinstate its law banning medical abortions, such as those performed with the drug RU-486.

The decision comes after Oklahoma's Supreme Court said the law, which would restrict the use of several abortion-inducing drugs to their labels, effectively bans all medical abortions.

That apparently was enough for the justices to leave alone the lower court's decision striking down the law. But similar controversies in other states, including neighboring Texas, make it possible another case will reach the high court eventually.

A federal appeals court ruled last week that a Texas anti-abortion law banning most medical abortions and requiring doctors who provide abortions to get local hospital admitting privileges could take effect, even while the state challenges a district court judge's ruling against the hospital provision. That means many doctors in Texas are blocked from prescribing medical abortions in the first seven weeks of pregnancy.

Abortion rights proponents asked the Supreme Court Monday to block the provision requiring hospital privileges while the legal battle continues. Justice Antonin Scalia demanded a response from the state by Nov. 12.

The prospect of a Supreme Court case on abortion had energized both sides in the debate. The Oklahoma case on RU-486 and two other drugs could have been the most important abortion case since 1992, when the justices upheld the right to abortion but approved several state restrictions. A later decision striking down so-called ""partial-birth"" abortions only affected a small number performed much later in pregnancy.

Other state abortion laws that could reach the high court before too long include those banning abortions after 20 weeks in Arizona and Idaho, as well as restrictions on abortion clinics and requirements that ultrasound tests be performed first.

The justices will hear one related case in January — a challenge by abortion opponents to a Massachusetts law that creates a 35-foot buffer zone around abortion clinics.

The stricken Oklahoma law that justices refused to consider is similar to others in states that have sought to further restrict the right to abortion. It allowed three abortion-related drugs to be used only in the ways their FDA-approved labels specify. Doctors, however, routinely follow other protocols that combine drugs and enable patients to take them at home.

In addition to the Texas law, which makes exceptions for the life and health of the woman, a similar ban on off-label uses for abortion-inducing drugs has been upheld in Ohio."

The pint-sized Democratic activist, Madison Kimrey, has become somewhat of a national sensation in recent weeks after videos circulated of her railing against election laws in her home state.

Though she's not yet old enough to vote, the self-proclaimed ""suffragette"" has been campaigning against those laws while putting the governor in an awkward position -- by calling for a sit-down with him and drawing him into a war of words.

Kimrey’s activism quickly has made her a target of criticism from Republicans. Gov. Pat McCrory, suggesting that Kimrey’s being put up to this, has called her a prop for the left.

But Kimrey, who spoke with FoxNews.com, defended herself – and said she simply “didn’t like what was happening in the state and wanted to take action.""

Specifically, she had a problem with a new state policy that took away the ability of 16- and 17-year-olds to pre-register to vote.

Supporters say the law is needed to cut down on voter fraud. The pre-registration program had been called “confusing to teenagers” and “a bureaucratic burden” by some in McCrory’s office.

But Kimrey and others see it as a tactic to suppress voter turnout.

“A lot of my friends are 16 and 17 and I thought it was important and I said, ‘Hey -- that sucks,'” Kimrey told FoxNews.com.

So Kimrey, a homeschooled Davidson Young Scholar, got involved. She started with a speech at a “Moral Mondays” protest at the state capitol and routinely posted videos on YouTube.

“Moral Mondays” are protests held in North Carolina by people opposed to new laws and policies that came out of the 2013 General Assembly session.

Kimrey also started an online petition at MoveOn.org and has gotten close to 14,000 signature.

“I have always had an interest (in politics),” Kimrey said, adding, ""Moral Mondays got me more active.""

Kimrey has already had a confrontation with the governor, who turned down her request for a 15-minute meeting. Then he called her a liberal prop.

“This is all … very liberal groups using children as, I think, props to push a very far-left agenda,” McCrory said during an interview on WWNC Radio in August. He added, “And I don’t agree with conservatives doing that. Nor do I agree with liberals doing that.”

Kimrey responded during an Oct. 29 speech, “I am not a prop! I am part of the new generation of suffragettes, and I will not stand silent while laws are passed to reduce the amount of voter turnout by young people in my home state.”

When contacted by FoxNews.com, McCrory’s office suggested they would respond to Kimrey's charges but later said their only statement would be a “no comment.”

Critics have questioned Kimrey’s political ambitions and say she’s too scripted, and claim her speeches are written and rehearsed ahead of time.

“I feel like the people who say that don’t really know me,” Kimrey countered.

Kimrey told FoxNews.com that as a child she used to run up to the television whenever President George W. Bush was on and scream, “Bush!”

While her political leanings might have changed, her love of politics has not.

Kimrey’s rise as a junior political activist mirrors that of Jonathan Krohn.

Krohn rose to GOP fame after he wrote the book “Define Conservatism” in his early teens.

He gave a speech at the 2009 Conservative Political Action Conference and quickly became the darling of conservative media outlets, which nicknamed him Lil’ Limbaugh and Alex P. Keaton, the fictional character on the 80s sitcom “Family Ties.”

Today, Krohn is an 18-year-old young adult living in Manhattan. He has renounced most of his conservative ways.

“I started reflecting on a lot of what I wrote, just thinking about what I had said and what I had done,” he told Politico during a 2012 interview, adding that he was a 13-year-old kid repeating things he had heard from his parents.

Kimrey’s father, Doug Kimrey, says he doesn’t coach his daughter on what to say or what to write.

“This is Madison,” he told FoxNews.com. “She has her own opinions and I respect that.”

When asked about the future, Kimrey, who enjoys acting, dancing and singing, says she’s not sure if politics is on the menu.

“I don’t know what I want to do,” she said. “I don’t think it’s been invented yet."""

It is 50 years since the American civil rights leader Martin Luther King delivered his I Have a Dream speech [PDF format].

On 28 August 1963, more than 200,000 Americans joined a march on Washington demanding equal justice for all citizens under the law.

On that day, the inter-racial crowd heard Martin Luther King deliver his famous speech, predicting a time when freedom and equality for all would become a reality in the US.

Here people whose lives have been touched by that moment reflect and share their memories half a century on.

During the 50s and 60s black Americans in the South were born, lived, worked, socialised and died in communities that were separate and distinctly unequal from those of our white counterparts.

Although I was just a young girl at the time, I still have vivid memories of drinking out of Coloured Only fountains and going to a segregated school. Bus drivers instructed us to move to the back of the bus - even when there were no other passengers.

Despite this my parents were emphatic in their belief that, in America, if we worked hard and were good citizens anything and everything was possible. This conviction appeared to be in direct opposition to general expectations.

When Dr King came into our lives he expanded our horizons, fuelled our expectations, extended hope, and offered the nation a blueprint for enacting change.

In August of 1963, I joined the March on Washington with my parents. Having lived in the South and experienced all we had, we felt it was really important to be there and to show our support.

Jill was 17 when she joined the 1963 March on Washington

It was the most amazing experience because people there were so loving. We all felt as if we were one.

I can remember taking notes during King's stirring speech because even at the time it felt like a moment of history.

As far as the eye could see, well-meaning individuals, both black and white, linked arms and put their hearts into singing hopeful renditions of We Shall Overcome.

I remember thinking that surely everyone in the world would hear - and heed - Dr King's simple but powerful message of love, peace and social justice for all.

Sadly, on the evening of April 4 1968, when the shots rang out at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, it became apparent that there were those who had not.

For some time afterwards it felt as if those who love to hate had seized the day, and it was devastating. But that was now 50 years ago.

Looking back at that time, Dr King's legacy of personal sacrifice, unyielding courage and service to others, feels just as radical and empowering today as it did then.

I am free to marry the man I love regardless of colour. I am free to raise my children to embrace who they are.

Denise says we are close to King's promise today

Every year on the anniversary of Dr King's famous speech, I watch a recording of it with my family. It brings tears to my eyes because it represents freedom.

It gives my children another perspective on their lives. It is a chance for them to see that there is something bigger than themselves.

The end of the speech sticks in my mind, when Dr King looks forward to a day when all God's children - of all races - will be free.

I grew up in Kentucky and the high school I went to was very conservative. I never interacted with anyone who was from another race.

But as I got older I met people from other cultures, races and backgrounds and it opened my eyes.

I feel I am able to live in a diverse community, attend a diverse church and send my children to a diverse school because a lot of people made sacrifices during those years.

When I watch Dr King's speech I feel he is making a promise about what will happen in the future. We've got a long way to go, but we are close to experiencing that promise today.

Many white residents of the city had hunkered down in their homes afraid it was going to be an occasion of violence and looting.

I wanted to be with the marchers, expressing solidarity with their aims - not hiding in my home.

Several things stand out in my mind about the march. One was the festival atmosphere, the overwhelming happiness of the crowd.

This was not an angry gathering, but a celebratory one.

What I remember above all is the warmth and friendliness around me. Maybe it was because it gladdened the hearts of some marchers to see young whites in solidarity with them.

Peter says people took a sense of moral power from King's speech.

Something enormously impressive was the seemingly endless procession of chartered buses, rolling down Pennsylvania Avenue past the Washington Monument, with signs proclaiming where they were from and where they were headed.

These people had taken their lives in their hands to drive through the South en route to Washington, with banners that made clear who they were and where they were going.

The cities named on the sides of the buses were a roll call of the places where the battle for civil rights was being fought out.

To anyone too young to remember it, it is hard to imagine just how segregated America was in those days, and what it meant on a day-to-day level.

I remember going to a birthday party when I was seven or eight years old. We were turned away from an amusement park because the birthday boy was an African-American child called Paul.

The thing that we took away from that day in 1963 was not one speech. It was a sense of moral power and political resolve - not just of leaders but of ordinary people - that was not going to be stopped.

The ""seemingly endless procession"" of chartered buses was impressive, says Peter.

I was 10 years old and living in Melbourne, Australia, when Martin Luther King intoned the words that electrified the thousands of marchers who had gathered in Washington.

I was too young to understand why my father - an Albanian-Kosovar intellectual - cried. I would have to wait several years to understand that King's dream was my father's dream, and that very soon, it would become mine.

My parents arrived in Australia after the Second World War. My father was exiled to a meat packing factory to feed his seven children.

We were not excluded because of colour but we were trapped by searing poverty. We lived in our own ""lonely island of poverty"" amid an ""ocean of material prosperity"".

Kimete's parents - pictured centre and right - moved to Australia in 1949

I have a very vivid memory of my first day of school.

When the teacher asked my name and my mother responded, the teacher shook her head and said, ""That's not going to do."" So my first experience of the world outside home was that even my name didn't fit.

My father, like King, had a dream for his children.

He had a dream that his children would one day live in a place where they would not be judged by the accents their parents could not lose or the distance that separated them from their ancestral home, but by the ""content of their character"".

My father realised the real limitations for us in Australia after my elder sister was unable to get a scholarship to university. In 1969 he took my family to Canada so we could have access to university education.

My father, like King, did not get to the mountaintop with his children - one a Harvard professor, another an award-winning reporter, another a pioneer in corporate social responsibility and yet another a director of an NGO devoted to bringing books to children.

But King's dream - my father's dream - continues to inspire us in all that we do.

We have come a long way from where we were when King made his speech.

But we still have some way to go before we get to the dream.

It depends where you are in the US. As a mixed-race person, I don't have any problems in New York City. When I lived in rural New Hampshire I would get funny looks from people.

Eden says all children should have the same opportunities

Some people would cross to the other side of the street when they saw me.

I had the opportunity to move away from racial stereotypes, to study to be a photographer and to travel.

That was partly because I was given the opportunity by an education foundation to go to a private boarding school.

In the neighbourhood I grew up in people were mainly black or from the West Indies. They were from poor backgrounds and they tended to stay poor.

At boarding school I was one of around eight students of colour. I remember when I grew my hair out people thought I was wearing a wig.

The other students made a lot of assumptions about us, imagining we all played basketball or liked certain types of music. Even the black students who had come from other countries were making these kind of assumptions about us.

So for me, the most important part of King's speech is where he says he wants his children to grow up in a country where they have the same opportunity as everyone else. We are not there yet.

We are the most generous nation on earth to immigrants, allowing over one million people a year to come here legally. They come here in pursuit of what we recognize as the American dream – the chance to live in freedom and have the opportunity to work hard to make a better life for themselves and their families.

The problem is that our legal immigration system has been broken for decades. It has enabled 11 million people to come here illegally or overstay visas. It is a bureaucratic and inefficient system that does not address the needs of our economy.

All this has further deepened the American people’s mistrust in the ability of their government to perform basic functions.

Leaving in place a broken immigration system -– and the millions of people whose identities are a mystery to us –- is simply not an acceptable option. This must be fixed.

More On This... Senators say bombings should spark immigration reform, not halt process

That is why I am advocating for securing our borders, improving enforcement, modernizing our legal immigration system and changing it so that it prioritizes welcoming people to the U.S. based on skills, not just on whether they have a family member already living here.

And that is why I support a process to identify and register those who are here illegally. They will have to submit biometric data in order to pass multiple national security and criminal background checks, pay $2,000 in fines, pay taxes, and learn English and American civics. They won’t be able to get any federal benefits like welfare or ObamaCare.

Before they can even apply to become permanent residents, they will have to wait at least ten years. They will have to get in line behind those who are trying to come the right way.

They will have to wait until we have a system in place to prevent illegal immigrants from being hired.

They will have to wait until we have a system in place to track people who overstay their visas.

And they will have to wait until we implement plans to spend at least $5.5 billion dollars to secure the border through more border patrol officers, more technology and more fencing.

I thought long and hard before taking on this issue. I understand how divisive it can be. I’ve seen how the left has used it to accuse opponents of their version of reform of being bigots and racists. And I would much rather be having a debate on the more fundamental ways we can grow our economy and get our debt and spending under control. But with or without us, the president and the Democrats who control the Senate were going to bring this issue up.

And I believe conservatives need to fight for the ideas and policies we believe are critical to fixing our immigration system.

The opponents of reform raise important points about not rewarding the violation of the law. I, too, have felt the frustration many feel that our nation’s generosity has been taken advantage of by some.

But policy-making is about solving problems. And to pick the right solution, you have to weigh the realistic alternatives. Deporting all illegal immigrants is not a practical solution. But ignoring the fact that they are here is just as bad.

For example, passing a law that only focuses on modernization and enforcement and leaves for another day the issue of those here illegally is not a good idea. Because as the enforcement measures kick in, millions of people living here illegally will be unable to work and provide for themselves and their families. The resulting humanitarian impact will then force us to scramble to address it. It is better to address it now as part of an orderly and measured process.

The only solution I know that can work is to reform legal immigration in a way that is good for the economy, do everything we can to secure the border, and allow illegal immigrants to eventually earn permanent residency by passing background checks, paying a fine, learning English and waiting at the back of the line for at least 10 years, at the same time that border security and enforcement measures are put in place to prevent this problem from happening again.

The bill I helped write is a good starting point, but it is not a take it or leave it proposition. I am open to any ideas others may have on how to do this, and I’ve been listening to the legitimate concerns people have raised with the expectation that we will be able to improve the bill as this debate continues.

We must do something to end today’s de facto amnesty, and conservative Republicans should lead on this issue. Because without conservatives at the table and in the fight, we are ceding this issue to President Obama and his allies in Congress. And as the last four years have proven, that is never a good idea."

The Justice Department on Thursday redoubled its efforts to challenge state voting laws, suing Texas over its new voter ID measure as part of a growing political showdown over electoral rights.

The move marked the latest bid by the Obama administration to counter a Supreme Court ruling that officials have said threatens the voting rights of minorities. It also signaled that the administration will probably take legal action in voting rights cases in other states, including North Carolina, where the governor signed a voter ID law this month.

The Supreme Court in June invalidated a key section of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that had forced certain jurisdictions to receive approval from the Justice Department or a federal court before changing their voting laws. The ruling, however, did not preclude the Obama administration from using other sections of the law.

On Thursday, the Justice Department said it will rely on another section of the act to contend that the Texas voter ID measure was “adopted with the purpose, and will have the result, of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group.”

The Texas law sets strict requirements for the types of government-issued photo ID that must be presented at polling places. Texas argues that the requirements are intended to curb voter fraud. The suit filed by Justice says the state “knew or should have known that Hispanic and African-American Texans disproportionately lack the forms of photo ID required” by the law.

Read the document Justice Dept. voter ID complaint The Justice Department's court filing in its lawsuit against the state of Texas's new voter photo identification law.

“We will not allow the Supreme Court’s recent decision to be interpreted as open season for states to pursue measures that suppress voting rights,” Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said in a statement. “We will keep fighting aggressively to prevent voter disenfranchisement. . . . This represents the department’s latest action to protect voting rights, but it will not be our last.”

Texas Republicans said the move smacked of federal interference and vowed to fight it. The lawsuit drew a particularly sharp response from Gov. Rick Perry, who accused Holder and President Obama of filing “endless litigation in an effort to obstruct the will of the people of Texas.”

“We will continue to defend the integrity of our elections against this administration’s blatant disregard for the 10th Amendment,” Perry said. The amendment sets limits on federal powers.

Sen. John Cornyn (R), a member of the Judiciary Committee and a former Texas attorney general, struck a similar note of outrage. “Facts mean little to a politicized Justice Department bent on inserting itself into the sovereign affairs of Texas and a lame-duck Administration trying to turn our state blue,” Cornyn said in a statement. “As Texans we reject the notion that the federal government knows what’s best for us.”

Holder announced last month that the department will support a separate lawsuit in Texas brought by a coalition of Democratic legislators and civil rights groups against a Republican-drawn redistricting plan. It submitted a “statement of interest” to the court and asked it to require Texas to submit all voting law changes for approval.

On Thursday, the department took a further step in that case, asking the federal court in Texas to formally allow it to become a party to the suit.

In both the voter ID and the redistricting case, the department asked that Texas again be required to submit to pre-clearance of any changes to its voting laws.

The Voting Rights Act required states with a history of discrimination to be granted approval by the Justice Department or courts before they could change their voting laws. In its June ruling in Shelby County v. Holder , the Supreme Court did not strike down the law but said Congress must come up with a new formula to determine which states should be subject to special scrutiny.

Legal experts said the Justice Department has various legal tools to counter the Supreme Court ruling. “They are trying a bunch of things,” said Richard L. Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California at Irvine.

Experts noted that some of those approaches might not be effective. The provision the Justice Department is using to challenge the Texas voter ID law, for example, has traditionally been used for redistricting cases, according to Spencer Overton, a law professor at George Washington University.

“Congress needs to act to update the Voting Rights Act” because existing legal tools are inadequate for these kinds of cases, said Overton, who served as principal deputy for legal policy in the Justice Department during Obama’s first term.

Hasen said the Justice Department’s recent actions signaled an admission that Congress may be unwilling to act. As a result, the administration will be forced to challenge electoral laws on a case-by-case basis.

The next state to be challenged, experts say, could be North Carolina. The new voter ID law there includes requirements that critics say will make voting harder, especially for racial minorities. Last week, civil rights groups filed a lawsuit challenging it.

Anticipating that lawmakers will face resistance to the bill when they go home for the August recess, the letter marks the escalation of a campaign in which Republican leaders and donors are pressuring House Republicans to act on an immigration reform bill.

The letter begins: “We write to urge you to take action to fix our broken immigration system.” According to the New York Times, those who have signed include Rove; “former Vice President Dan Quayle; Tom Stemberg, a founder of Staples; and Frank VanderSloot, the founder of Melaleuca Inc.” Romney campaign finance director Spencer Zwick was also signed the letter.

The Times reports that Carlos Gutierrez, former Commerce Secretary for President George W. Bush and a founder of the Republicans for Immigration Reform super PAC, organized the effort. Gutierrez, who has said in the past that English should not be the official language of government, said the letter was “the beginning of a campaign to lobby Republican lawmakers in favor of a broad immigration bill as they return to their districts for the August break.”

“What tends to happen during the month of August is that members go home and they go to town hall meetings and they check up on their offices in terms of phone calls and letters, and that’s where they get bombarded,” Gutierrez told the Times. “So Republicans who are for immigration reform–and I believe there are many–we need to make our voice known in August.”

http://news.yahoo.com/court-rejects-routine-no-warrant-dui-blood-tests-142337206.html,,[],Court rejects routine no-warrant DUI blood tests,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that police usually must try to obtain a search warrant from a judge before ordering blood tests for drunken-driving suspects.

The justices sided with a Missouri man who was subjected to a blood test without a warrant and found to have nearly twice the legal limit of alcohol in his blood.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the natural dissipation of alcohol in the blood is generally not sufficient reason to jettison the requirement that police get a judge's approval before drawing a blood sample.

Missouri and the Obama administration were asking the court to endorse a blanket rule that would have allowed the tests without a warrant.

Eight of the nine justices rejected that plea. Only Justice Clarence Thomas would have held that a warrantless blood test does not violate a suspect's constitutional rights.

The case stemmed from the arrest of Tyler McNeely in Missouri's rural Cape Girardeau County. A state trooper stopped McNeely's speeding, swerving car. The driver, who had two previous drunken-driving convictions, refused to submit to a breath test to measure the alcohol level in his body.

He failed several field sobriety tests. The arresting officer, Cpl. Mark Winder of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, said McNeely's speech was slurred and he was unsteady on his feet.

There seemed little dispute that Winder had enough evidence to get a warrant for a blood test, but chose not to. Instead, he drove McNeely to a hospital. A technician drew blood from McNeely, who was handcuffed throughout the process.

McNeely's blood-alcohol content was 0.154 percent, well above the 0.08 percent legal limit.

But the Missouri Supreme Court upheld a lower court order that threw out the results of the blood test. The state high court said the blood test violated the Constitution's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. Police need a warrant to take a suspect's blood except when a delay could threaten a life or destroy potential evidence, the Missouri court said.

Story continues

About half the states already prohibit warrantless blood tests in all or most suspected drunken-driving cases.

The Supreme Court did not offer much guidance Wednesday about when police may dispense with a warrant. Justice Anthony Kennedy, in a separate opinion, said a later case may give the court to opportunity to say more on that subject.

The case is Missouri v. McNeely, 11-1425."

“The point is some would have to lose their lives,” said the 70-year-old retired administrator, who sings in his church choir. “But when they realized that they can’t cross without being shot, they would stop.”

Talk about boosting border security, albeit with less extreme measures, is common in Escondido, a working-class city in northern San Diego County, 40 miles from Mexico. But the decades-long patchwork of remedies to halt the flow of illegal immigrants has proved so frustrating that residents like Gazzara expressed qualified support for broad reforms such as those championed by President Obama in his immigration policy speech Tuesday.

They include a path to citizenship for those brought to the United States illegally as children and the possibility of legal status for millions of other undocumented immigrants, provided they pass a background check and meet other criteria.

An estimated 2.5 million illegal immigrants live and work in California, embedded in such bulwarks of the state economy as agriculture and the service industry. The state’s voters tilt toward Democrats for president, but in some regions elect conservative Republican congressmen -- such as Darrell Issa (R-Vista), whose district includes Escondido, and Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield). Their support will be key to getting any immigration plan through a fractious House of Representatives.

Immigration reform activists greeted Obama’s speech with broad enthusiasm. The president was tackling nothing less than “a defining civil and human rights issue of our time,” said Wade Henderson, president and chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.

But the mixed reactions of Californians suggest the fraught terrain legislators must navigate to bring an immigration reform bill to Obama’s desk.

“Anyone applying for citizenship should pay a penalty,” said Gazzara, the retired administrator. “If you don’t respect our laws then you should pay the consequences.”

Gazzara was getting a haircut at Del’s Barber Shop in Escondido in the company of other self-described conservative Republicans, while immigrant women pushed baby strollers by the American flag that fluttered outside.

Escondido is one of the few cities in the country where immigration enforcement agents monitor and respond to police traffic stops, resulting in hundreds of deportation proceedings.

One passing woman, an illegal immigrant with three children who gave her name only as Maria, said she didn’t drive in the city because she feared getting pulled over at a traffic checkpoint.

But she has common ground with the men in the barbershop, and with Obama’s proposal, in calling for background checks.

“I tell my friends that everyone should get the opportunity to apply for citizenship, but there must be conditions,” she said. “They can’t be pushed through really fast. They need to check people’s backgrounds thoroughly.”

At El Gallo Giro restaurant in Huntington Park, a heavily Latino city, the tables and chairs reflect the colors of the Mexican flag, and the Virgin of Guadalupe has a shrine.

But only one man in the lunchtime crowd showed interest when Obama’s speech came on the TV on Tuesday, interrupting a Spanish-language celebrity talk show.

Felipe Velasquez, 56, who came from Sinaloa, Mexico, said he crossed into the country illegally in the early 1980s. Years later he was among millions of immigrants who received amnesty in the last major overhaul of immigration law.

He applauded Obama’s call for broader paths to citizenship. “People come here thinking it means a future. It’s a fantasy,” Velasquez said. “The only ones who do well are banks and big companies. The rest of us struggle all our lives to get ahead.”

Farther north in Kern County, a place both heavily Republican and heavily dependent on farm labor, reaction was mixed.

Randy Hubble, 55, a construction worker who was having lunch at Cope’s Knotty Pine Cafe in Bakersfield, has clear views on what to do with the country’s estimated 11 million illegal immigrants: “Put them on the bus, and put them back where they came from.”

The local congressman, McCarthy, is a staunch conservative and the House majority whip, and he will alienate voters like Hubble if he supports Obama’s plan.

However, other locals, including Kyle Steinberg, who works as a Caltrans supervisor and votes Republican, expressed support for a citizenship plan, provided applicants joined mainstream America. “They just need to accept our way of life and not try to make this into Mexico,” Steinberg said.

Dennis McDonnell, a retired schoolteacher and a Democrat, worries that immigration reform will create a flood of illegal crossers. “Too many people forgot what the ‘il’ in ‘illegal’ means -- it means ‘not,’ ” he said.

Since deporting 11 million people isn’t possible, he said, he could live with a legalization plan with the conditions Obama articulated -- pay taxes, learn English and go to the back of the line.

William Mashburn, 62, a small-business owner who voted for Republican Mitt Romney in the November election, believes that wages have been depressed because illegal immigrants settle for less.

“If they became citizens, it would eliminate that, which is good for them and for the prosperity of the country,” he said.

It sounds like a bizarre notion. But in the case of migrants, there may be something to it.

In 1990, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, which stipulated a comprehensive set of civil, political, economic and social rights for migrants, including those living or working abroad illegally. But 23 years later, there is no denying the failure of the convention to protect those rights.

News of the mistreatment of migrants seems to arrive every few months. In September, an investigation by the British newspaper The Guardian exposed numerous deaths among Nepalese workers on World Cup construction sites in Qatar. Earlier this month, more than 400 migrants rioted after a bus hit and killed an Indian worker in Singapore, where large numbers of low-skilled migrants are employed under deplorable working and living conditions.

There is a wide gap between the rights of migrant workers in theory and practice, especially in the case of those employed in lower-wage jobs. Under most existing temporary migration programs in North America and Europe, for example, migrants do not enjoy the degree of access to welfare benefits demanded by the convention. In the Persian Gulf nations, more alarmingly, it is common practice for employers to retain migrant employees’ passports to make sure they cannot “escape.”"
http://news.yahoo.com/widow-works-preserve-evers-civil-rights-legacy-093438698.html,,[],Widow works to preserve Evers' civil-rights legacy,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Myrlie Evers-Williams acknowledges it would be easy to remain mired in bitterness and anger, 50 years after a sniper's bullet made her a widow.

Instead, she's determined to celebrate the legacy of her first husband, Medgar Evers — a civil rights figure often overshadowed by peers such as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X.

Events including a black-tie gala are being held this week to remember Evers, the first Mississippi field secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He was 37 when he was assassinated on June 12, 1963.

""We are cursed as human beings with this element that's called hatred, prejudice and racism,"" said Evers-Williams, now 80. ""But it is my belief that, as it was Medgar's, that there is something good and decent in each and every one of us, and we have to call on that, and we have to find a way to work together.""

Evers-Willliams, who moved back to Mississippi in 2012, is treated with reverence by strangers who recognize her these days. She recently went to downtown Jackson's King Edward Hotel to meet reporters from The Associated Press for an interview — a hotel, she notes, that was off limits to black people decades ago. As she waited for her coffee, a white man approached to shake her hand and ask if she'd pose for a photo.

""I've always wanted to meet you,"" said Ron Walker, former mayor of the tiny town of Taylorsville.

Evers-Williams smiled cautiously, then beamed, as Walker said he believes she and Medgar Evers had made Mississippi a better, more open society.

Evers-Williams gave the invocation at President Barack Obama's inauguration in January, and met with the president June 5 at the White House. A ceremony of remembrance was held June 6 at Evers' gravesite in Arlington National Cemetery, attended by former President Bill Clinton and Attorney General Eric Holder.

Myrlie Beasley and Medgar Evers met as students in 1950 at Alcorn College, a historically black school in rural southwest Mississippi. He was from Decatur, Miss., and served in the Army during World War II before becoming a star football player for the school. Nearly eight years his junior, she was a talented pianist raised by a protective grandmother in Vicksburg. The couple married in 1951.

Story continues

In 1954, Evers applied to the all-white University of Mississippi Law School. After he was rejected, he sought the NAACP's help to file a lawsuit. Instead, the organization hired him to coordinate its work in stubbornly segregationist Mississippi.

Evers spent years investigating violence against black people, including the 1955 killing of 14-year-old Emmett Till. He helped James Meredith gain admission as the first black student at the University of Mississippi in 1962. Evers pushed for black voter registration, drew young people into the civil rights movement and, in the final months of his life, led a boycott of white-owned businesses in downtown Jackson.

Two weeks before his death, Evers helped coordinate a sit-in at an all-white lunch counter. That night, someone tossed a firebomb at his house. It was extinguished, but the warning clear.

Evers-Williams recalled that the night before her husband was slain, she sat with him on their couch and talked about the danger. He made her promise that if anything happened to him, she would take care of their three young children. She also vowed that if he were killed, she would seek justice and keep his memory alive.

The night he was killed, Medgar Evers stayed out late, attending a community meeting. Shortly after midnight on June 12, 1963, he arrived home. His wife and children were still awake after watching a televised speech on civil rights by President John F. Kennedy.

""And as soon as the children said, 'There's daddy,' the shot rang out — one of the loudest and most powerful I had, and still have, ever heard. And I knew exactly what had happened,"" Evers-Williams recalled.

Neighbors drove Evers to the University of Mississippi Medical Center a few miles away. Within an hour, he was dead from the shot to his back.

Evers-Williams and her children moved to California just over a year later.

""We could no longer live in our home,"" she said. ""The memories were just too vivid, and I could never get all of the blood up off of the concrete driveway.""

A white segregationist, Byron De La Beckwith, was tried twice for Medgar Evers' slaying in the 1960s, but all-white juries failed to convict him. The case was re-opened in the 1990s based on new evidence, and he was convicted of murder in 1994. He was 80 when he died in prison in 2001.

Myrlie Evers-Williams remarried in 1976 to longshoreman Walter Williams, and the couple moved to Oregon in 1989. Williams died of cancer in 1995, about the time she became national chairwoman of the NAACP, a post she held until 1998. She is widely credited with putting the organization back on solid financial footing.

She had never planned to move back to Mississippi, but was drawn by an invitation to teach at her alma mater, now known as Alcorn State University.

Evers-Williams said she sees progress, such as Mississippi's large number of black elected officials, including a congressman, and mayors of Jackson and several other cities. It's common to see black and white people working together and socializing, though many neighborhoods are still largely one race or another.

Still, some things disturb her in Mississippi and elsewhere. Long lines to vote and voter-identification laws could limit access to the ballot, she said. When Obama was re-elected, clashes between students at the University of Mississippi were largely divided on racial lines.

What would Medgar Evers think about American society now?

""I believe he would look at the landscape of this country and realize what so many of us have said: We have made progress but there's still so much to be done, and if we don't guard the progress we've made, that too will slip away,"" Evers-Williams said.

She spoke at the University of Mississippi graduation May 11, and the university gave her a humanitarian award — the third it has ever given. After the ceremony, she was attending a campus reception when James Meredith and his wife arrived.

""I ran to the door and I stood there and held my arms out,"" Evers-Williams recalled with a smile. ""I said to him, 'You can't come in here unless you come through me.'""

It was an echo of long-dead segregationist governors.

""We had the biggest laugh,"" Evers-Williams said. ""We laughed until we cried. Here we are, 50-plus years later, and we can do that now.""

At least one chaplain was told that if he engaged in any ministry activity, he would be subjected to disciplinary action.

“In very practical terms it means Sunday Mass won’t be offered,” Archbishop Timothy Broglio of the Archdiocese for the Military Services told me. “If someone has a baptism scheduled, it won’t be celebrated.”

The Archdiocese for the Military Services tells me the military installations impacted are served by non-active-duty priests who were hired as government contractors. As a result of a shortage of active duty Catholic chaplains, the government hires contract priests.

[pullquote]

Broglio said some military bases have forbidden the contract priests from volunteering to celebrate Mass without pay.

“They were told they cannot function because those are contracted services and since there’s no funding they can’t do it – even if they volunteer,” he said.

John Schlageter, general counsel for the archdiocese, said any furloughed priests volunteering their services could face big trouble.

“During the shutdown, it is illegal for them to minister on base and they risk being arrested if they attempt to do so,” he said in a written statement.

A well-placed source told me that a furloughed Air Force chaplain was threatened after he offered to forgo pay. The chaplain was told he could not go on base or enter his chapel offices. He was also barred from engaging in any ministry activity.

The source told me the chaplain was told that if he violated those orders he and his supervisor would be subjected to disciplinary action – with the possibility of being fired.

Ron Crews, executive director of the Chaplain Alliance for Religious Liberty, called those developments disturbing.

“Catholic military personnel should not have their religious liberties held hostage by this funding crisis,” Crews told me. “I find it alarming that these priests cannot even volunteer to provide services without threat of arrest.”

The archbishop said a priest at Joint Base Langley-Eustis was banned from officiating at the wedding of a couple he’d been counseling.

“The wedding could be on the base, but the priest can’t do the wedding,” Broglio told me.

A priest at the Naval Amphibious Base in Little Creek, Va., was told he could not celebrate Mass on base because of the government shutdown. So he discovered a way to circumvent the ban.

“He’s having Mass in a local park off base,” the archbishop said.

The archbishop said it doesn’t make any sense to forbid priests from voluntarily ministering to the troops.

“Most of us don’t look to see that we’re going to be paid before we do something,” he said. “They are not being allowed to volunteer even to meet the needs of the faithful.”

Bill Donohue, of the Catholic League, told me he’s not surprised by the decision to furlough Catholic priests.

“In American history there has been no administration more anti-Catholic than the Obama administration,” he said. “For them to deny Catholic men and women the opportunity of the sacraments and to deal with their prayerful vocations is really a stunning statement.”

Donohue chalked it up to meanness.

“This idea of punishing Catholics in the military - denying them their priests - is consistent with the animus this administration has demonstrated,” he said.

It’s not exactly clear who is the final arbiter in the furloughs – but I suspect it’s the same folks who kicked school children out of the White House and elderly veterans out of the World War II Memorial.

“It’s difficult to know who exactly is making these decisions,” the archbishop said. “I’m being told it keeps getting kicked up to a higher level.”

I called the Pentagon but no one returned my calls.

I called the Air Force public affairs office and they told me to reach out to the local bases.

Surely there must be some way to compromise, to let Catholics practice their faith.

I find it odd that the military was able to find enough cash to let their football teams play this weekend – but they can’t scrounge up enough cash for weekend church services.

“It’s a sad contrast when we can let a football game go on but we won’t let a priest go on base and celebrate Mass,” he said.

So in President Obama’s world – college football players are essential but Catholic priests are not."

Schmidt']",Judge Upholds N.S.A.’s Bulk Collection of Data on Calls,"Judge Pauley began his opinion with an anecdote. In the months before Sept. 11, he said, the N.S.A. intercepted seven calls made to a Qaeda safe house in Yemen from the United States. They were from Khalid al-Mihdhar, who was living in San Diego and would become one of the hijackers.

But the security agency “could not capture al-Mihdhar’s telephone number,” the judge wrote, and “N.S.A. analysts concluded mistakenly that al-Mihdhar was overseas and not in the United States.”

“Telephony metadata would have furnished the missing information and might have permitted the N.S.A. to notify the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the fact that al-Mihdhar was calling the Yemeni safe house from inside the United States,” Judge Pauley wrote.

Judge Leon, in Washington, took the opposite view, saying the government had failed to make the case that the program is needed to protect the nation. “The government does not cite a single instance in which analysis of the N.S.A.’s bulk metadata collection actually stopped an imminent attack, or otherwise aided the government in achieving any objective that was time-sensitive in nature,” he wrote.

The presidential review group took a middle ground, though it seemed to lean toward Judge Leon’s position. It said the security agency “believes that on at least a few occasions” the program “has contributed to its efforts to prevent possible terrorist attacks, either in the United States or somewhere else in the world.” But it added that its own review suggested that the program “was not essential to preventing attacks,” and that less intrusive measures would work.

The group recommended that bulk storage of telephone records by the government be halted in favor of “a system in which such metadata is held instead either by private providers or by a private third party.” Access to the data, it said, should require a court order.

The two judges did not limit their disagreements to how well the program worked. They also drew different conclusions about its constitutionality."

(CNN) —

Florida Gov. Rick Scott met with protesters overnight and defended his position to not amend his state’s controversial “stand your ground” law.

“Tonight, the protesters again asked that I call a special session of the legislature to repeal Florida’s ‘stand your ground’ law,” Scott said in a written statement. “I told them I agree with the Task Force on Citizen Safety and Protection, which concurred with the law.”

Scott issued a proclamation Friday for a “statewide day of prayer for unity.” The proclamation calls Trayvon Martin’s death a tragedy, notes that “emotions are running high” and calls for Floridians to show unity.

Earlier, Scott said that he mourns with Martin’s parents, but that he stands by the findings of the task force, which consulted with citizens and experts.

The protesters are students and members of Dream Defenders, an activist group that participates in civic engagement and promotes nonviolent social change.

They walked into Scott’s office Wednesday, led by Amon Gabriel, 9, and asked to speak to the governor.

After the protesters camped there for three days, Scott met with them overnight and told them he has not changed his position. The Dream Defenders say they will continue their sit-in until their demand is met.

“We’d like the repeal of ‘stand your ground’ or some type of modification where we can hold people responsible to a level that humanity expects, where we don’t have 17-year-olds getting gunned down with no justice for them and their families,” said the group’s legal and policy director, Ahmad Abuznaid.

A call for reforms

On Thursday, Florida officials joined state House Democratic Leader Perry Thurston in urging that reforms be made to the controversial law.

One of those officials, Senate Democratic Leader Chris Smith, is refiling his legislation to change “stand your ground.”

“We have a clear case that shows SYG has very troubling problems, and those problems are central to the well-being of Floridians,” he said.

Though former neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman’s defense never cited “stand your ground” laws in its case, the jury was instructed to consider them during deliberations. The jury acquitted Zimmerman of all charges Saturday in the 2012 shooting death of Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old.

Stevie Wonder says he’ll boycott ‘stand your ground’ states

The Florida version of the law states, “A person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.”

Eight other states have laws worded similarly, while 22 total states, including Florida, have laws stating residents have no “duty” to retreat from a would-be attacker, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Civil rights groups attack the laws as racially motivated and are planning nationwide demonstrations. Stevie Wonder is refusing to perform in any state with such a law.

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the laws “try to fix something that was never broken” and now encourage “violent situations to escalate in public.”

But just as adamantly as the laws are decried, the National Rifle Association has stood by the measure it helped many states adopt.

“The attorney general fails to understand that self-defense is not a concept, it’s a fundamental human right,” said Chris W. Cox, executive director of the National Rifle Association’s Institute for Legislative Action. “To send a message that legitimate self-defense is to blame is unconscionable.”

What are the chances of repeal?

As for those Dream Defenders at the Florida governor’s office, their protest may be futile. Scott’s office noted that the gubernatorial task force recommends the law stay in place, though with minor tweaks, including limiting neighborhood watches to observing and reporting.

Daniel Webster, director of Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said he doubts the protests will change anything. Overturning laws isn’t incredibly common already, and with Stand Your Ground, there are complicating factors.

The NRA is strong in the 22 states that have the laws, and “I think there is some popular appeal to the notion, the very general notion that citizens should be able to protect themselves and you shouldn’t have to, in essence, run from crime.”

Also, the laws are relatively new, most of them enacted in the past eight years, and it’s unlikely the same legislators who put Stand Your Ground laws on the books would suddenly be inclined to think they were wrong.

“The more common response is they’re going to dig their heels,” he said.

As a parallel, Webster offered the “Draconian” drug-sentencing laws of the 1980s, which hugely expanded incarceration rates, were outrageously expensive and did little in the way of improving public safety. Yet, the country is only now examining those laws and considering their repeal.

“I assume, in part, that’s because the people who passed them are no longer there,” Webster said.

The trickiest factor, however, is that proponents and opponents of Stand Your Ground can find in the Zimmerman case facts to support their beliefs, he said.

One side believes Trayvon attacked Zimmerman, and ZImmerman had no choice but to fire his weapon to defend himself. The other side believes Zimmerman racially profiled Trayvon, followed him against a dispatcher’s order, then shot a teen who was only reacting, perhaps out of fear, to being followed.

“You can find whatever you want to back your assumptions,” Webster said.

Putting on his gun policy expert hat, Webster said he felt the laws are a “very bad idea,” and they don’t do what they were intended to do: deter criminals and protect the citizenry.

Doubts about ‘stand your ground’

After Florida expanded its “Castle Doctrine” laws to a “stand your ground” provision in 2005, the National District Attorneys Association released a report. It said a “diminished sense of public safety” after 9/11, a lack of confidence in the criminal justice system’s ability to protect victims, a perception that due process trumps victims’ rights and a decrease in gun legislation spurred the creation of “stand your ground” laws.

The study cited concerns from law enforcement officials, including doubts that it would deter criminals.

“There must be appreciation among the would-be criminals that deadly force can be used against them, leading to a change in criminal behavior,” the study said. “Unfortunately, attendees at the NDAA symposium expressed little confidence that criminals would take the provisions of the Castle Doctrine into consideration before committing a crime.”

Webster pointed to a Texas A&M University study examining crime in more than 20 states that passed Castle Doctrine or Stand Your Ground laws from 2000 to 2010. Researchers found that not only was there no decrease in robbery, burglary and aggravated assault, but there was an 8% spike in reported murders and non-negligent manslaughter.

“The data are pretty compelling, showing that it increased justifiable homicides and it increased homicides overall,” Webster said. “In all likelihood, it really led to more altercations similar to the Zimmerman-Martin exchange.”

Additional protests this weekend

The Zimmerman verdict has been met by strong reactions.

A national “Justice for Trayvon” day is slated for Saturday in 100 cities, led by the Rev. Al Sharpton. The protesters will call for federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman.

The rallies will take place outside of federal court buildings in cities across the country, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.

(CNN) —

Celebrity chef Paula Deen hopes the Supreme Court’s ruling allowing same-sex marriage to be legal in California will help in her defense against a racial discrimination lawsuit.

The woman alleging that she was subjected to a hostile work environment while working as an assistant manager at Deen’s restaurants is white and therefore doesn’t have the “standing,” or legal right, to claim racial discrimination, according to a motion filed Monday by Deen’s lawyer.

The high court rejected an appeal of California’s Proposition 8 law last week on the grounds that the private parties behind the appeal did not have standing to defend the ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state-sanctioned wedlock.

Even if the federal judge in Savannah, Georgia, accepts the argument and tosses the lawsuit, much damage has already been done to Deen’s career and businesses by the public fallout from a deposition in which she acknowledged using the “N-word.”

Chat: Comfort food, uncomfortable topics

Asked by the lawyer taking the deposition if she had ever used the word, she said, “Yes, of course.”

She said she had probably used the racial slur when talking to her husband about “when a black man burst into the bank that I was working at and put a gun to my head” – an incident that took place 30 years ago.

Asked if she had used it since then, she said, “I’m sure I have, but it’s been a very long time.” She noted that circumstances have changed “since the ‘60s in the South.”

Many of Deen’s lucrative business relationships have crumbled in the wake of media coverage of the lawsuit. She has lost at least nine endorsements along with her Food Network cooking show, and publication of her eagerly anticipated cookbook has been canceled.

Deen attorney William Franklin’s motion, filed Monday with the U.S. District Court in Savannah, cited the June 26 Supreme Court decision in Hollingsworth v. Perry, the California case.

“Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Roberts made this observation: Article III of the Constitution confines the judicial power of federal courts to deciding actual ‘Cases’ or ‘Controversies,’” the motion said. “One essential aspect of this requirement is that any person invoking the power of a federal court must demonstrate standing to do so. This requires the litigant to prove that he has suffered a concrete and particularized injury that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct, and is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.”

George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley told CNN Tuesday the contention that the Prop 8 ruling is relevant to the Deen case won’t hold water.

The concept of standing is hardly new, and the Supreme Court bringing it into the spotlight in Hollingsworth v. Perry doesn’t not advance Deen’s motion to dismiss the case, Turley said.

Deen’s accuser: ‘This has never been about the N-word’

Lisa Jackson, the plaintiff in the suit against Deen is white, has no standing because she couldn’t have suffered “a personal and tangible harm” from hearing the “N-word” on the job, the Franklin’s , motion says.

In the Prop 8 case, state officials refused to pursue an appeal when a federal judge struck down the same-sex marriage ban. Private citizens picked it up, ultimately to be told by the high court last week that they had no standing to do so.

Jackson is a former manager at Deen’s restaurants in Savannah, Georgia. She is suing Deen and her brother, Bubba Hier, alleging they committed numerous acts of violence, discrimination and racism that resulted in the end of her five-year employment at Deen’s Lady & Sons and Bubba’s Seafood and Oyster House eateries in Savannah.

She gave a statement to CNN’s Don Lemon through her lawyer, Matthew Billips, on Monday.

“This lawsuit has never been about the N-word,” she said. “It is to address Ms. Deen’s patterns of disrespect and degradation of people that she deems to be inferior. I may be a white woman, but I could no longer tolerate her abuse of power as a business owner, nor her condonation of Mr. Hier’s despicable behavior on a day-to-day basis. I am what I am, and I am a human being that cares about all races, and that is why I feel it is important to be the voice for those who are too afraid to use theirs.”

Deen’s lawyer has called the allegations false, and Deen has said she does not tolerate prejudice.

Deen made an emotional appearance on NBC’s “Today Show” last week in which she called the accusations “horrible, horrible lies.”

“I believe that every creature on this Earth, every one of God’s creatures, was created equal,” she said. “… I believe that everyone ought to be treated equal.”

Deen was raised to never be unkind to anyone, she said.

Opinion: We use Deen to give ourselves a pass

According to a report in the Miami Herald, Fusion, the cable channel that will debut on October 28 in roughly 20 million homes, may collect nearly $10 million in subsidies “pledged by Miami-Dade County and Florida for the new venture, with the state contributing $7 million to the package.”

Fusion’s facility opened on Wednesday in Doral, Florida and, in return for the subsidies, Univision has reportedly “pledged to spend $247 million on the new complex over many years.”

Jorge Ramos, the host of Univision’s Al Punto Sunday Show, will anchor a one-hour show at 8 PM on Fusion, and he was clear that the channel will intend to “own” the immigration debate “from the first hour.” On his Sunday show, Ramos has been a fierce advocate of comprehensive immigration reform. On a recent episode, Ramos interviewed citizen-activist D.A. King, a staunch opponent of amnesty. Ramos’s first question to King was, “Why do you hate immigrants so much?”

“We’re going to come out on Oct. 28th, and if the House doesn’t approve immigration reform by then, then there’s going to be a new, very loud voice in Fusion, talking about immigration every single night until immigration reform passes,” Ramos told The Huffington Post in a recent interview.

As the Herald notes, Fusion is “partly a hedge against the aging of Univision’s primetime audience of nearly 4 million Spanish-speaking residents, as their children and grandchildren increasingly turn to English-language programming.”

Though “Nielsen ratings show Univision drawing an average prime-time audience of 3.6 million, large enough for it to be the No. 1 network in any language during the summer re-run season,” a Pew Research poll found that “half of Hispanic Latino adults get their news in both Spanish and English, while the number relying solely on Spanish-language news sources dropped from 22 percent in 2006 to 18 percent in 2012.”

The channel also plans to target so-called millennials, and some of their hosts do not speak Spanish. The network has even hired a former producer for The Daily Show to produce satire programming on news and sports."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/10/national-security-poll_n_3572406.html,2013-07-10 00:00:00,"['Politics Reporter', 'The Huffington Post']",National Security Policies Go Too Far In Restricting Civil Liberties: Poll,"A plurality of Americans say that counterterrorism policies go too far in restricting civil liberties, revealing a massive change in attitudes since 2010, a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday showed.

Forty-five percent said the government's anti-terrorism efforts go too far in restricting civil liberties, compared to 40 percent saying they did not go far enough. A 2010 poll by the group found that 63 percent felt anti-terrorism policies did not go far enough, while just 25 percent said they went too far.

The numbers suggest that the revelation of the NSA's telephone and Internet spying programs has caused many Americans to change their opinions of the national security state.

Men, by a 54-34 margin, said that policies had gone too far, while women, by a 47-36 margin, said they had not gone far enough, revealing a sizable gender gap.

In the new poll, 55 percent of Americans characterized former NSA contractor Edward Snowden as a whistleblower, while 34 percent deemed him a traitor. Forty-nine percent of Democrats, 55 percent of Republicans and 58 percent of independents said he is a whistleblower.

The survey reveals that the public disagrees with many lawmakers -- both Democrats and Republicans -- who have called the former NSA contractor a traitor. Snowden is believed to be holed up in the transit zone of a Moscow airport after he leaked classified documents to The Guardian and The Washington Post detailing the agency's massive telephone and Internet spying programs.

Nevertheless, other recent surveys have shown that more Americans disapprove than approve of Snowden's actions. A HuffPost/YouGov poll found that 38 percent of Americans thought Snowden had done the wrong thing in leaking the documents, while 33 percent condoned his actions. Twenty-nine percent were unsure. A CNN poll released on June 17 showed that 52 percent disagreed with his actions, and 44 percent agreed."

According to aides familiar with the closed-door negotiations, the bill would require illegal immigrants to register with Homeland Security Department authorities, file federal income taxes for their time in America and pay a still-to-be-determined fine. They also must have a clean law enforcement record.

Once granted probationary legal status, immigrants would be allowed to work but would be barred from receiving federal public benefits, including food stamps, family cash assistance, Medicaid and unemployment insurance.

RELATED: Is the border secure?

The group’s current draft is largely in line with President Obama’s call to set a pathway to earned citizenship as part of a broader immigration reform package, as well as with recent efforts by prominent Republican lawmakers to resolve an issue that hurt GOP candidates in November’s election.

Though the draft is a long way from becoming law, immigration advocates expressed guarded optimism about a possible breakthrough.

“Nine months ago, people would have thought you were nuts to say that four Republicans and four Democrats were working on a way to legalize 11 million people,” said Angela Kelley, an immigration expert at the Center for American Progress, a think tank with close ties to the White House. “It’s a Rubik’s Cube, but more sides are matching in color than ever before. That’s significant.”

Still undecided is how long illegal immigrants would need to wait before they could apply for permanent resident status and eventually become citizens. The delay for a green card probably would be 10 years or longer, the aides said.

Also unresolved are such politically charged topics as how many visas to issue to high-tech specialists and other guest workers; how to keep track of when visitors leave the country; and how to pay for more Border Patrol officers, fencing and other security measures in an era of shrinking budgets, the aides said.

U.S. immigration law: Decades of debate

The eight senators met Tuesday and Wednesday, alternating between a private office in the Russell Senate Office Building and a marble-floored ceremonial room off the Senate chamber.

The group had hoped to deliver a completed bill to the Senate Judiciary Committee for consideration before the Senate leaves for Easter recess on March 22. But aides said remaining issues required more technical advice and cost estimates that could delay delivery until early April.

The group includes Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Marco Rubio of Florida and Jeff Flake of Arizona. The Democrats are Sens. Charles E. Schumer of New York, Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Michael Bennet of Colorado.

The draft bill will be several hundred pages long when finished. For now, the unfinished pieces are peppered throughout the draft.

“We’re working through them. I’m not sure we’ll get them all done,” McCain said in an interview. “Some of these issues are very controversial.”

Business groups and Silicon Valley companies have pushed for more H1B visas for software engineers and other high-skilled employees, for example, while labor unions have warned that too many immigrants would undercut qualified Americans seeking high-tech jobs in a weak economy.

Advertisement

Unless the group designs a visa program that ensures a robust labor force, Rubio told reporters, “What you’re going to have is people coming into the country illegally or overstaying visas.”

Immigration overhaul bills floated in 2006 and 2007 were sunk by disagreements between labor and business leaders over how many workers to allow into the country. Some senators are skeptical that the current group can find a solution.

“The country can absorb only so much low-skilled labor without significantly impacting the prospects of working Americans to get jobs and get higher pay,” said Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a member of the judiciary panel who has been critical of previous efforts to expand the visa program.

In an effort to resolve the issue, negotiators from the AFL-CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have worked with Senate staffers to set a formula so the number of visas for both high-tech and low-skilled workers can fluctuate. They have agreed that the tally would move up or down based on job demand, unemployment rates and other data.

Advertisement

“We’re really trying to fill in the details,” said Ana Avendano, an AFL-CIO negotiator.

The two sides have agreed that a work visa need not be tied to a specific employer and that foreign workers would be allowed to change jobs. Unions want assurances that foreign workers have the same rights as Americans to report mistreatment to the Labor Department and to sue employers for unpaid wages.

Unlike in the past, both business and organized labor want an immigration bill to pass, said Eliseo Medina, secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union, which represents more than 2 million workers.

“No one wants to be responsible for deep-sixing the effort,” Medina said.

Advertisement

Negotiators also have hit a roadblock on whether the government should keep track of who is leaving the country and how to do so.

Under current law, U.S. immigration authorities do not keep a record when tourists and other foreign visitors leave the country. So the government doesn’t know whether they have overstayed their visas, as thousands do each year.

Advertisement

The Senate group has tentatively agreed to create a system to check visas against an immigration database at international airports and seaports but have not determined whether it is feasible at much busier border crossings. The task is potentially huge: U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada are the most highly trafficked in the world, with 250 million crossings each year.

Some lawmakers warn that checking visas as people leave the country would be expensive to implement, further clog busy border crossings and slow crucial commerce.

Muzaffar Chishti, director of the Migration Policy Institute at New York University School of Law, said the real legislative battle over immigration would come after the bill was made public.

“We haven’t even begun to see the opposition to the bill,” Chishti said. “Because there isn’t meat on the bone.”

That sounds straightforward enough. But there are two ways to understand the decision, Graham v. Florida.

One is formal. The court may have meant only to bar sentences labeled “life without parole.” On that understanding, judges remained free to impose very long sentences — 100 years, say — as long as they were for a fixed term rather than for life.

That is how Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., in dissent, urged lower-court judges to interpret the decision. “Nothing in the court’s opinion affects the imposition of a sentence to a term of years without the possibility of parole,” he wrote."

He Also Reported The White House']","On immigration, Obama seeks to cement Latino vote for Democrats","There is an art to political stagecraft, a sort of medium-is-the-message thing, which explains why President Obama will be in Las Vegas on Tuesday to begin his effort to overhaul the nation’s confounding immigration system.

For generations, the West was a Republican stronghold, the land of Goldwater and Reagan and sagebrush rebels. But a change began under President Clinton and was hastened under President Obama, who twice added Nevada and Colorado to the Democrats’ stable of support in the West.

The reason, in short, is Latino voters.

The rise of Latino power, which began in California as a backlash to the heated rhetoric surrounding Proposition 187, the 1994 anti-illegal-immigration initiative, has steadily spread eastward, giving once-red states a distinctly more blue tinge.

There may be no better illustration than California’s next-door neighbor.

Obama won Nevada in 2008 by a whopping 12 percentage points. By all rights, however, Republican Mitt Romney should have been strongly competitive there in 2012. He had an organizational base among the state’s large Mormon population, and Nevada has been an economic basket case for years, with jobless, foreclosure and bankruptcy rates that set a national standard for awfulness.

Obama carried the state, however, winning in November by more than 6 percentage points.

Strong Latino support is one reason. What happened in Nevada reflected the results nationwide: The percentage of Latino voters grew to 18% of the electorate, from 15% in 2008, and Obama won their support by a crushingly large margin.

Immigration has become the Democrats’ wedge issue, drawing small-business-owning and culturally conservative Latinos away from the GOP in the way Republicans long used abortion and other contentious social issues to pry working-class Democrats away from their party moorings.

As an added political benefit to Democrats, the issue of illegal immigration splits the GOP between enforcement-only hard-liners and advocates of a more balanced approach that would mix fortified borders with some path to citizenship for the millions of immigrants in the United States illegally. To hard-liners, that amounts to amnesty for lawbreakers and an unacceptable capitulation to Obama and his fellow Democrats.

The president used last week’s inaugural address to signal that immigration reform, one of the unfulfilled promises of his first term, would no longer be overlooked.

America’s journey “is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity,” he said to strong applause from the hundreds of thousands gathered on the National Mall.

Latinos in Congress who met with Obama on Friday said the president described the issue as his top legislative priority.

Obama’s remarks in Las Vegas are likely to cover proposals he has called for in the past: tougher border security, a crackdown on employers who hire illegal workers and a way for undocumented immigrants to responsibly “earn” their way to U.S. citizenship. More details are expected in the president’s State of the Union address on Feb. 12.

The political message on Tuesday, however, may be more significant than the substance.

The goal for Democrats is to lock in their strong Latino support and the votes of succeeding generations, the way the party has in California, so candidates can devote more time and resources to red states like Arizona and Texas that should, the demographics suggest, grow more competitive in 2016 and beyond.

Obama may have run his last election campaign. But one thing he would like to bequeath to fellow Democrats is a solid electoral college base rooted in the West to offset the advantage Republicans enjoy across the South.

His Las Vegas appearance is a step toward that second-term goal.

The provision, proposed by Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-Co.), was voted down 224-189, with Republicans constituting the majority.

""This is a very simple amendment that really does two things,"" Perlmutter told the House Thursday, before the vote. ""It helps the individual protect his right to privacy and it doesn't allow the employer to impersonate that particular employee when other people are interacting with that person across social media platforms.""

While Perlmutter warned of breached privacy and the potential to impersonate employees, as U.S. News & World Report notes, CISPA sponsor Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) called the Democratic congressman's proposal an attempt to kill the bill.

Perlmutter denied the claim, but Rogers still suggested that he instead address the employee privacy issue with separate legislation.

After initially introducing the password privacy measure in 2011, Perlmutter explained in a statement:

People have an expectation of privacy when using social media like Facebook and Twitter. They have an expectation that their right to free speech and religion will be respected when they use social media outlets. No American should have to provide their confidential personal passwords as a condition of employment. Both users of social media and those who correspond share the expectation of privacy in their personal communications. Employers essentially can act as imposters and assume the identity of an employee and continually access, monitor and even manipulate an employee's personal social activities and opinions. That's simply a step too far.

Though CISPA passed the House, 288 to 127, it could very likely be killed in the Senate -- as the first version of the cybersecurity legislation was -- or face a veto from the White House, which has already threatened the controversial legislation.

In the meantime, Anonymous has called for an Internet blackout on April 22 to protest CISPA.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/05/27/The-Ailes-Manifesto,2013-05-27 00:00:00,['Stephen K. Bannon'],The Ailes Manifesto: America Rallies Around Roger Ailes and Fox News,"Fox News CEO Roger Ailes’ May 23 stirring letter to Fox employees will be remembered as a turning point in the battle for freedom of the press in the age of Obama.

The Ailes letter, denouncing the Obama administration’s trampling on the First Amendment, should be seen, of course, as a strong defense of Fox correspondent James Rosen. In addition, the Ailes letter–in truth, a manifesto–is a staunch vindication of Fox News and its “speak-truth-to-power” approach to journalism. Finally, the Ailes Manifesto should be seen as a clarion call for freedom–for freedom of the press, and also for the right of all Americans to think freely, liberated from the MSM thought-monopoly.

As Patrick Caddell has pointed out here at Breitbart News, the Obama Administration has never truly been worried about leaks, because the Administration itself has been the main source of leaks. Why? For political advantage, of course. That is, to make the Administration look good, especially in regard to the war on terror in the run-up to the 2012 election.

The Obamans wanted to maintain their exclusive “franchise” on leaks, rewarding friendly reporters, such as The New York Times’ David Sanger, with information on highly-classified programs, including the Stuxnet virus used against Iran. In fact, Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, upon reading Sanger’s book Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power, said, “You learn more from the book than I did as Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and that’s very disturbing to me.” In other words, US national security was a distant second, well behind the primary goal, which was the President’s re-election.

To be sure, the Obama Administration leaked for other reasons, as well. As Breitbart News’ Matthew Boyle reported, the Obama Justice Department was happy to leak documents to advance its own interests in the “Fast and Furious” scandal.

It is obvious that the Obama Administration will leak any information regardless of its sensitivity to national security or to individuals’ reputations when it is expedient for political gain. The facts are incontrovertible, over a broad range of issues, over a long period of time.

While the Obama administration has been playing this dangerous game, Roger Ailes has been clear and straightforward. The Ailes Manifesto is, indeed, fierce in its defense of freedom. As the Fox News founder–at the helm, now, for 17 years–wrote:

The administration’s attempt to intimidate Fox News and its employees will not succeed and their excuses will stand neither the test of law, the test of decency, nor the test of time. We will not allow a climate of press intimidation, unseen since the McCarthy era, to frighten any of us away from the truth.

Even amidst the greatest threat to press freedom in six decades, neither Fox, nor its friends and allies, are going to back away, or back down. The fight for freedom is a fight for all of us.

Indeed, as the Ailes Manifesto continues to reverberate through the media and political landscape, we can observe three kinds of reaction: first, strong awareness and support from the activist public; second, a surprising amount of solidarity from the other journalists and journalistic organizations; and third, a cringing U-turn by some notorious Obama administration lackeys and lapdogs.

So let’s look at each of these three categories in turn.

First, support from the activist public. Social media showed a huge outpouring of support for reporter Rosen and the Ailes letter. “Ailes’ letter give you a sense of him as a boss,” one Twitter user said. “Kind of man that inspires real loyalty out of respect.”

“Simply put, Roger Ailes, a true principled Leader,” said another. One response read, “The Roger Ailes memo might be the most badass thing I’ve ever read.”

Another reader remarked, “Roger Ailes sounds downright Churchillian.”

Second, others in the MSM have chosen to side with Fox, at least on this one issue. Urged on by press leaders–including Fox News’ Ed Henry, who said to fellow pressies, “let’s not be a bunch of lemmings”–many MSM-ers have chosen to do the right thing, even if it pains them. As Joel Pollak noted, stalwart liberal Alex Seitz-Wald of Salon.com was moved to tweet, “I understand lib cognitive dissonance on Obama admin going after Fox reporter, but only right answer is #TeamRosen.”

Fox News Opinion summed up much of this diverse media support in a May 23 compendium titled, “They All Stand with Fox News’ James Rosen.” The piece took note of supportive comments from staffers of CNN, The New Yorker, The Washington Post–even former anchor Keith Olbermann. Remarkably, the tabloid-y TMZ, not known for its political coverage, had to agree that the controversy, and the Ailes Manifesto, constituted a hot story.

On May 21, the White House Correspondents Association issued a strong statement:

Reporters should never be threatened with prosecution for the simple act of doing their jobs. The problem is that in two recent cases, one involving Fox News’ James Rosen and the other focused on the Associated Press, serious questions have been raised about whether our government has gotten far too aggressive in its monitoring of reporters’ movements, phone records, and even personal email.

Meanwhile, the support keeps coming. On Saturday, The Washington Post wrote a tough pro-Rosen editorial titled, “The freedom to ask,” in which the Post quoted the Justice Department’s own stated policy on leak investigations, which declares, “The prosecutorial power of the government should not be used in such a way that it impairs a reporter’s responsibility to cover as broadly as possible controversial public issues.” The Post then added, “The Obama administration should recommit to its spirit.”

Third, even some of Obama’s most groveling fans have had to adjust course in light of the new knowledge about his administration’s bullying methods. In fact, support for Ailes and Fox has been so broad and strong that even mortal enemies of Fox have had to come around, however grudgingly. For example, Media Matters for America (MMFA), the George Soros-funded anti-Fox smear operation run by David Brock, has been forced to do a 180 from its original pro-Obama position.

On May 14, as the news about the Justice Department investigations was breaking, MMFA slavishly published talking points in support for the Obama administration. In other words, the MMFA Obama-propaganda operation was trying to teach others how they, too, could be Obama-propagandists. Yet after a firestorm of criticism, MMFA shifted its position, albeit over ten long days.

On May 24, MMFA Senior Fellow and Andrew Breitbart bête noire Eric Boehlert, reflecting this new line, complained that “federal law enforcement seems preoccupied with snooping around, in increasingly clandestine ways, and ensnaring reporters in criminal investigations.” Well, yes; better late than never.

Boehlert continued in this manner, even allowing for the heretical thought that Fox News might not be at fault in everything:

Whether it was the Department of Justice’s wild overreach in seizing phone records of more than 20 separate telephone lines used by Associated Press editors and reporters, or the Department’s more focused, yet even more troubling, information grab of a Fox News reporter, the practice is wrong and shortsighted. It’s also un-American.

One can only imagine the drama inside MMFA before those anti-Obama Administration words were printed on its site. Which was more gut-wrenching for David Brock, criticizing the Obama Administration or defending Fox News from it?

Of course, as Pollak wrote, the pro-Ailes/pro-Fox sentiment, while welcome, is unlikely to last for long:

Now that Holder has been caught in a hacking scandal of his own–first of telephones at the Associated Press, then of Rosen and other Fox News journalists–the playing field is leveled. And even though the wider media solidarity with Fox News is doomed to be short-lived, from now on the White House will face bolder, fearless conservative media, confident in the knowledge that they are defending universal principles.

Still, Ailes and Fox have made their point, and it will be an enduring point. The impact of the strong Ailes Manifesto and the unyielding Fox stance may be felt only briefly among the MSM, but it will remembered forever in conservative, libertarian, and constitutionalist circles.

On this Memorial Day, these words of Ailes have it exactly right:

Too many Americans fought and died to protect our unique American right of press freedom. We can’t and we won’t forget that. To be an American journalist is not only a great responsibility, but also a great honor. To be a Fox journalist is a high honor, not a high crime.

And we here at Breitbart News might humbly add: it’s a high honor to be an American on the same side as Roger Ailes, James Rosen, and Fox News, in this historic fight for freedom. Together, we will win, because victory begets victory."

David Goodman'],U.S. Offers Conditional Support for Police Monitor in Stop-and-Frisk Case,"The Justice Department on Wednesday waded into a federal trial over the New York Police Department’s stop-and-frisk practices, strongly endorsing a monitor to oversee changes if a judge were to find the practices to be unconstitutional.

But the so-called statement of interest, which the department filed late Wednesday in Federal District Court in Manhattan, stopped short of offering the Justice Department itself as a monitor for the Police Department.

The Justice Department lamented that the court had decided to address questions of fact — whether the department systematically violated New Yorkers’ rights — and the question of remedies at the same time, saying it would have preferred to weigh in only after the former had been decided.

In its carefully worded 21-page statement, the Justice Department took no position on matters of fact in the case. But should the court find against the city, the Justice Department said, it would endorse the use of a court-appointed monitor. “The experience of the United States in enforcing police reform injunctions teaches that the appointment of an independent monitor is a critically important asset,” the department said."

http://news.yahoo.com/texas-senate-passes-abortion-restrictions-050032557.html,,[],Texas Senate passes new abortion restrictions,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The Texas Senate passed sweeping new abortion restrictions late Friday, sending them to Republican Gov. Rick Perry to sign into law after weeks of protests and rallies that drew thousands of people to the Capitol and made the state the focus of the national abortion debate.

Republicans used their large majority in the Texas Legislature to pass the bill nearly three weeks after a filibuster by Democratic Sen. Wendy Davis and an outburst by abortion-rights activists in the Senate gallery disrupted a deadline vote June 25.

Called back for a new special session by Perry, lawmakers took up the bill again as thousands of supporters and opponents held rallies and jammed the Capitol to testify at public hearings. As the Senate took its final vote, protesters in the hallway outside the chamber chanted, ""Shame! Shame! Shame!""

Democrats have called the GOP proposal unnecessary and unconstitutional. Republicans said the measure was about protecting women and unborn children.

House Bill 2 would require doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, allow abortions only in surgical centers, limit where and when women may take abortion-inducing pills and ban abortions after 20 weeks.

Abortion-rights supporters say the bill will close all but five abortion clinics in Texas, leaving large areas of the vast state without abortion services. Only five out of 42 existing abortion clinics meet the requirements to be a surgical center, and clinic owners say they can't afford to upgrade or relocate.

The circus-like atmosphere in the Texas Capitol marked the culmination of weeks of protests, the most dramatic of which came June 25 in the final minutes of the last special legislative session, Davis' filibuster and subsequent protest prevented the bill from becoming law.

The Senate's debate took place between a packed gallery of demonstrators, with anti-abortion activists wearing blue and abortion-rights supporters wearing orange. Security was tight, and state troopers reported confiscating bottles of urine and feces as they worked to prevent another attempt to stop the Republican majority from passing the proposal.

Story continues

Those arrested or removed from the chamber included four women who tried to chain themselves to a railing in the gallery. One of the women was successful in chaining herself, prompting a 10-minute recess.

When debate resumed, protesters began loudly singing, ""Give choice a chance. All we are saying is give choice a chance."" The Senate's leader, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, told officers to remove them.

Sen. Glen Hegar of Katy, the bill's Republican author, argued that all abortions, including those induced with medications, should take place in an ambulatory surgical center in case of complications.

Democrats pointed out that childbirth is more dangerous than an abortion and there have been no serious problems with women taking abortion drugs at home. They introduced amendments to add exceptions for cases of rape and incest and to remove some of the more restrictive clauses, but Republicans dismissed all of the proposed changes.

Sen. Royce West, a Dallas Democrat, asked why Hegar was pushing restrictions that federal courts in other states had suspended as possibly unconstitutional.

""There will be a lawsuit. I promise you,"" West said, raising his right hand as if taking an oath.

The bill mirrors restrictions passed in Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma, Alabama, Kansas, Wisconsin and Arizona. In North Carolina, lawmakers are considering a measure that would allow state health officials to apply standards for ambulatory surgical centers to abortion clinics.

Passing the law in Texas would be a major victory for anti-abortion activists in the nation's second most-populous state. A lawsuit originating in Texas would also likely win a sympathetic hearing at the conservative 5th Circuit Court of Appeals on its way to the U.S. Supreme Court.

But Democrats see in the protests an opportunity that could help them break a 20-year statewide losing streak. They believe Republicans have overreached in trying to appease their base and alienated suburban women, a constituency that helped President Barack Obama win re-election.

""In the long run, all they have done is built a committed group of people across this state who are outraged about the treatment of women and the lengths to which this Legislature will go to take women's health care away,"" Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards told The Associated Press in an interview Friday.

Sen. John Whitmire, a Houston Democrat, said during the debate that it was clear the bill was part of national conservative agenda attempting to ban abortion and infringe on women's rights one state at a time. He pressed Hegar on why the Texas Medical Association, Texas Hospital Association and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology opposed the bill.

He asked Hegar how he could ignore these experts.

""There are differences in the medical profession,"" Hegar insisted, rejecting the criticism. ""I don't believe this legislation will majorly impede the doctor-patient relationship.""

Sen. Bob Deuell, a Greenville Republican and a doctor, defended the bill, saying abortion clinics ""had not maintained the proper standard of care.""

A proposal would also require that an exit system be in place for tracking departures of foreigners who entered the country through airports or seaports, before any illegal immigrants could start on a path to citizenship.

The lawmakers intend for their proposals to frame the debate in the Senate, which is expected to take up immigration this spring, ahead of the House of Representatives. Compared with an immigration blueprint from 2011 that White House officials have said is the basis for the president’s position, the senators’ proposals appear to include tougher enforcement and a less direct path for illegal immigrants than Mr. Obama is considering.

In a parallel effort, a separate group of four senators will introduce a bill this week dealing with another thorny issue that is likely to be addressed in a comprehensive measure: visas for legal immigrants with advanced skills in technology and science. The bill, written primarily by Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, a Republican, and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a Democrat, would nearly double the number of temporary visas, known as an H-1B, available each year to highly skilled immigrants. It would also free up more permanent resident visas, known as green cards, so those immigrants could eventually settle in the United States and go on to become citizens.

In a sign of the rapidly changing mood in Washington on immigration, the two groups of senators and the White House have been vying in recent days to see who would unveil their proposals first.

Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a Democrat who was one of those negotiating the comprehensive principles, said the senators finally agreed that any legislation should include a pathway to citizenship.

“First of all, Americans support it, in poll after poll,” said Mr. Menendez, who was interviewed along with Mr. McCain by Martha Raddatz on Sunday. “Secondly, Latino voters expect it. Thirdly, Democrats want it. And fourth, Republicans need it.”"

Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, who both blasted Florida in the wake of the Trayvon Martin shooting and the acquittal of George Zimmerman in Martin's death, with Jackson calling it an ""apartheid state"" and ""our Selma,"" have not spoken publicly of the brutal beating aboard a school bus caught on cellphone and surveillance video. Neither Jackson nor Sharpton responded to requests for comment from FoxNews.com.

“Three 15-yr-old black teens beat up a 13-yr-old white kid because he told school officials they tried to sell him drugs,” former congressman Allen West, an ex-Army Colonel who is African-American, wrote on his Facebook page. “Do you hear anything from Sharpton, Jackson, NAACP, Stevie Wonder, Jay-Z, liberal media, or Hollywood? Cat got your tongues or is it that pathetic hypocrisy revealing itself once again? Y'all just make me sick.”

Robert Zimmerman Jr., who vociferously defended his brother against charges the shooting of Martin was racially motivated, also chimed in, taking Sharpton and Jackson to task for staying silent on the beating.

“It's time 2 ""unplug"" their mic if U ask me...“@JimmieFleek: @rzimmermanjr @TheRevAl @RevJJackson apparently racism only works one way?” Zimmerman tweeted.

More On This...

The attack took place July 9 in the St. Petersburg-area community of Gulfport. But the horrific cellphone and surveillance video came out only recently. Police say the three youths, all African-American, attacked the boy after he told officials at their dropout prevention school that one of them had tried to sell him marijuana. The unidentified boy was left with a broken arm and two black eyes.

Joshua Reddin, Julian McKnight, and Lloyd Khemradj, all 15 years old, were arrested a short time later. All three were charged with aggravated battery and have since been released. Reddin is also charged with unarmed robbery.

Gulfport Police Chief Robert Vincent told Fox News the attack does not appear to be racially motivated and was due to the younger boy reporting that one of the assailants had tried to sell him marijuana.

West, who represented southeastern Florida in the House, denounced Jackson and Sharpton as “race-baiters” and “faux leaders” during the Zimmerman trial for making the death of Martin into a racial issue.

“Do you really want to talk about the issues that are confronting the black community or do you want to talk about the politically manufactured crises that you have these faux leaders and these race-baiters that are out there, you know, promoting it,” West said in a July interview on Fox News Radio.

Rev. Dr. Manuel Sykes, president of the St. Petersburg chapter of the NAACP, told FoxNews.com his group is aware of the bus beating and is monitoring it closely.

“We would want to see if any and all information out there has determined if there are any disparities,” he said.

All three of the assailants were expelled from school and are due back in court for a hearing early next week."

The film — based on a Washington Post article written by Wil Haygood in 2008 — has a cast headlined by Forest Whitaker as Cecil Gaines. Gaines, an African American born a sharecropper’s son in Georgia, goes to Washington in the 1950s and eventually serves eight U.S. presidents as a White House butler.

Over the past several decades, important feature films have been made about most of the historical and cultural touchstones of post-World War II America, from the Vietnam War and John F. Kennedy’s assassination to Watergate and women’s liberation. But there’s been one glaring exception: The breadth and depth of the civil rights movement — the most influential social and political force of the 20th century, not just on American life but throughout the world — has never been represented in the dominant narrative medium of our age.

Until now.

A number of films about the civil rights movement are in various stages of development. The first out of the gate will be “Lee Daniels’ The Butler,” which stars Forest Whitaker as Cecil Gaines, an African American man born a sharecropper’s son in Georgia, who comes to Washington in the 1950s and eventually serves eight U.S. presidents as a White House butler. (The film is based on a Washington Post article written by Wil Haygood in 2008.)

Directed by Daniels and featuring a cavalcade of stars in cameo roles, “The Butler” largely focuses on Gaines’s family life and interactions with the presidential families he serves. But it also chronicles the burgeoning movement taking shape on the streets far beyond 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.

While Gaines silently observes Dwight D. Eisenhower grappling with school desegregation, Lyndon B. Johnson preparing to sign the 1965 voting rights act and Richard M. Nixon plotting against the Black Panthers, his son Louis (David Oyelowo) is sitting in at a Nashville lunch counter, joining the Freedom Riders, crossing paths with Martin Luther King Jr. and eventually joining the Panthers himself.

Similar scenes have been portrayed as backdrops or perfunctory montages in previous films. But “The Butler,” which arrives in theaters Friday, is the first major feature film to capture the full sweep and scope of the civil rights movement, including its global reverberations. (Gaines retires during the administration of Ronald Reagan, who is seen vetoing sanctions against South Africa’s apartheid regime.) For that reason, if “The Butler” does well at the box office, projects about the same era that have been stalled over the past several years may find renewed momentum. Conversely, should the film flop, some of Hollywood’s most pernicious myths — most pointedly that there are not wide audiences for historical dramas in general and black films in particular — will become all the more entrenched.

“Yikes,” said Daniels, who visited Washington last week, when he considered “The Butler” as a cinematic and cultural bellwether. Upon reflection, however, it’s a burden he was happy to accept. “If it opens the doors for other civil rights films and African American dramas, right on,” he said. “That’s a great thing. Anything to help the cause.”

At least four major film or television projects about the civil rights movement are in the works: DreamWorks is developing an untitled Martin Luther King Jr. biopic. “Memphis,” about King’s final days and the hunt for his assassin, is back on track with director Paul Greengrass and producer Scott Rudin after being dropped by Universal Pictures in 2011. Director Ava DuVernay is preparing to direct “Selma,” about the 1965 voting rights campaign (a film that Daniels himself once intended to direct). And “America: In the King Years,” based on Taylor Branch’s trilogy of civil rights books, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning “Parting the Waters,” is in development as a seven-part mini-series at HBO.

Each of these projects has been gestating over several years, and each of them has been stymied or derailed at some point, sometimes because of disputes over King’s life rights, sometimes because financing fell apart, sometimes because a filmmaker got cold feet. But all of them have been subject to the tyranny of “comparables” in the entertainment business, whereby executives green-light or drop movies based on the performance of projects with similar themes and casting configurations.

“In any business, part of the job is to mitigate your risk,” Edward Saxon told me in 2007. Saxon, an independent producer, worked with Jonathan Demme 20 years ago when Demme sought to adapt “Parting the Waters” as a feature film. “So you say, ‘Okay, if this superhero movie does even half of what that superhero movie did, it’ll be successful.’ But when you tried to call up comparables on a movie like ‘Parting the Waters,’ they [didn’t] exist.”

That math might be changing. Consider: In 2009, Daniels’s drama “Precious: Based on the Novel ‘Push’ by Sapphire” became an unexpected art-house hit, and earned Daniels an Oscar nomination. Last year, “Lincoln,” Steven Spielberg’s historical drama about the 16th U.S. president, exceeded even Spielberg’s commercial expectations. This year, the Jackie Robinson biopic “42” and the micro-budget contemporary drama “Fruitvale Station” have both done well at the box office, earning more than $95 million and $10 million, respectively.

And it’s no coincidence that “The Butler” is opening the same month as did “The Help,” the period drama about African American domestic workers and their white employers that became a box-office smash in 2011 — and that shares more than a little thematic DNA with “The Butler.”

Eugene Allen saw eight presidents come and go over three decades serving on The White House staff. On Background's Nia-Malika Henderson talks with Wil Haygood, who wrote a book about Allen and whose reporting inspired the film version of ""The Butler."" (The Washington Post)

Knowing the importance of comparables, “The Butler” screenwriter Danny Strong crossed his fingers when “The Help” came out, watching its commercial journey closely. “I was writing ‘The Butler’ simultaneously and I was very worried: Could this hurt getting ‘The Butler’ made?” Strong recalled last week. On the strength of the $180 million “The Help” earned at the box office, he added, “we were able to go to private financiers and say, ‘Look at what a hit this was.’ It was enormously helpful in giving people confidence that we could quote unquote be the next ‘Help.’ And if we can make half as much as ‘The Help’ did, we’re a hit.”

Of course, the reason why “The Butler” was financed independently — the film boasts more than 30 producers, each of whom ponied up some money for the $25 million production — is because Sony, the studio that originally optioned Haygood’s article, has almost entirely gotten out of the business of producing modestly budgeted dramas. Like every other major movie company, Sony’s revenue is increasingly coming from overseas, where tent-pole pictures such as “Spider-Man” and “Men in Black” habitually rake in the euros. And like every studio, Sony has been operating under the stubborn belief that black films don’t do well overseas — despite success stories like “The Help,” which earned a respectable $42 million in non-U.S. markets.

For that reason, even with such recognizable stars as Whitaker, Oprah Winfrey and Cuba Gooding Jr., Daniels felt compelled to cast the biggest white stars he could find, “name actors that meant something overseas, so that we could finance the film.” (“The Butler” features Jane Fonda, Robin Williams, John Cusack and Alan Rickman in cameo roles.)

Despite the fact that the studio didn’t go forward with the project, Daniels credits Sony’s co-chairman, Amy Pascal, for seeing value in the story in the first place. “I’m not upset with her, I’m upset with the system,” he said, adding that the studios’ recalcitrance is “an incredible testament to Hollywood underestimating the intelligence of America.”

Branch, for one, is eager to put the “black doesn’t travel” shibboleth to rest. “To me, it’s just a matter of intuition that that’s wrong, because the civil rights movement went abroad so strongly,” he says. “The Solidarity movement against the Soviet Union was modeled on sit-ins. They were singing ‘We Shall Overcome’ in Prague and in South Africa. . . . I am convinced that in Germany and in India and Asia, a good story that crosses racial barriers and shows the potential of democratic freedom will have an enormous market, not necessarily because it’s black, but because it’s in the larger sphere of people growing.”

Branch says he’ll be watching how “The Butler” does domestically and, perhaps most crucially, internationally. “There are a hundred movies about that era that might come crowding behind the first successful one.”

Branch also thinks the election of Barack Obama represented a shift that is only now being seem in movies, a sentiment shared by “Selma” director DuVernay — who notes that a wide range of movies about African Americans are being released this year, including “Fruitvale Station,” the pre-Civil War-era drama “12 Years a Slave,” and “Black Nativity,” a modern-day musical. DuVernay isn’t looking to “The Butler” as an augury of “Selma’s” fortunes once it’s ready to make a distribution deal. “I would say it’s much less about one film as opposed to an overall collective energy around what’s real, what’s viable and what’s relevant and worth being told,” she said.

Whether it’s a function of comparables, cultural progress, changes in the global film business or the Obama effect, the zeitgeist seems to be shifting. The result is that one of the most vibrant, meaningful, potent and richly dramatic eras in American history may finally find the cinematic foothold it has been denied for far too long. As Daniels told me when I asked how “The Butler” got made in spite of the obstacles: “You can’t stop the universe from doing what is meant to happen.”"

Original bill allowed local police to investigate drivers%27 immigration status during traffic stops

The law allowed police to arrest immigrants in circumstances far broader than federal law%2C judge said

Anyone using a consular identification card issued by a foreign country as ID also committed a crime

INDIANAPOLIS — A federal judge permanently blocked enforcement Friday of two key provisions of a controversial 2011 Indiana immigration bill: one barring the use of consular identification cards and another allowing the arrests of people whose immigration status is questionable.

In the ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Sarah Evans Barker made permanent a preliminary injunction that she issued in June 2011.

That ruling found the state law violated the Constitution's due process and search and seizure provisions, as well as other protections, because local police were allowed to arrest people whose immigration status had been questioned by federal authorities — even if those authorities had determined that a person should be able to remain in the country.

Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller said he will not appeal the decision.

""Now that the federal court decision reinforces what we said all along — that immigration enforcement is a federal government not a state responsibility — this case is at an end,"" Zoeller said.

Advocates for civil liberties and Indiana's growing Latino community hailed the ruling as a victory that protects law-abiding citizens and visitors to the U.S. — a decision that reaches well beyond any one ethnic group.

""The ruling says we're not going to allow police officers to profile people just because of their national origin,"" said Kevin C. Munoz, an Indianapolis immigration and criminal lawyer. ""It protects us from xenophobia that anybody can have and all of a sudden start harassing someone who has every right to be here whether they are a legal resident or have been granted some other protective status.""

Other provisions of the state law, which penalize employers for hiring illegal immigrants, remain in effect.

Barker also issued an order Friday denying a motion from three Indiana lawmakers who asked to defend parts of the state's immigration law in court.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana and National Immigration Law Center had filed the challenge on behalf of three foreign-born residents living in the state.

""The U.S. Supreme Court made it quite clear that states should not be engaged in this sort of enterprise,"" Ken Falk, the state ACLU's legal director, said of the immigration legislation. ""This ruling demonstrates that the Constitution applies to all Indiana residents.""

The 2011 law originally empowered local police to investigate drivers' immigration status during traffic stops. It was significantly watered down amidst opposition from many public figures, including the state attorney general.

Still, as adopted, the law made it a crime for a person to provide as identification a consular identification card issued by the government of a foreign country.

""These sweeping regulations, targeted solely at foreign government-issued identification that consulates are entitled to issue and which restrict the manner in which foreign citizens may travel, live, and trade in the United States, have a direct effect on our nation's interactions with foreign nations,"" Barker wrote in her ruling. ""Such interactions cannot be dictated or restricted by individual states.""

The law also had allowed police to arrest a person if that person was the subject of a removal order issued by an immigration court, a detainer or notice of action by U.S. Department of Homeland Security, or when there is ""probable cause to believe that the person has been indicted for or convicted of one or more aggravated felonies.""

The Indiana law authorized ""state and local law enforcement to arrest in circumstances far broader than those in which Congress has allowed state and local officers to arrest immigrants,"" Barker wrote. The provisions were even broader than what federal officers are allowed under federal law.

Senate Democratic Leader Tim Lanane of Anderson, Ind., said the ruling should be ""a reminder to the legislature to be extremely careful when creating punitive public policy."" Republicans dominate the Indiana General Assembly.

""Its measures unfortunately portray Indiana as intolerant"" and involve the state in time-consuming litigation, he said."

States defended use of genetic material to solve cold cases

Civil liberties advocates say collecting DNA violates privacy

Justices%27 dilemma%3A Nab criminals or guard against intrusion%3F

WASHINGTON -- A narrowly divided Supreme Court ruled Monday that police can collect DNA from people arrested but not yet convicted of serious crimes, a tool that more than half the states already use to help crack unsolved crimes.

The case, described by Justice Samuel Alito as ""the most important criminal procedure case that this court has heard in decades,"" represented a classic test between modern crime-fighting technology and centuries-old privacy rights.

In the end, the justices had to balance the benefits and the intrusion of a simple cheek swab -- and the considerable benefits won out. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority's 5-4 decision, in which one liberal justice, Stephen Breyer, concurred. The key to the ruling, Kennedy said, is ""reasonableness.""

""DNA identification of arrestees is a reasonable search that can be considered part of a routine booking procedure,"" Kennedy said. ""Taking and analyzing a cheek swab of the arrestee's DNA is, like fingerprinting and photographing, a legitimate police booking procedure that is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.""

Justice Antonin Scalia wrote an angry dissent for himself and three liberal justices, charging that the decision will lead to an increased use of DNA testing in violation of the Constitution's protection against unreasonable searches.

""Make no mistake about it: because of today's decision, your DNA can be taken and entered into a national database if you are ever arrested, rightly or wrongly, and for whatever reason,"" Scalia warned. ""This will solve some extra crimes, to be sure. But so would taking your DNA whenever you fly on an airplane.""

Twenty-six states have laws on the books that allow for the collection of DNA from those arrested for felonies or other serious crimes. The information is uploaded into a national database run by the federal government in order to find matches with unsolved crimes.

That's how Alonzo Jay King was connected to a Maryland rape case for which he ultimately was convicted. Arrested in 2009 on an assault charge, King was linked by DNA evidence to the 2003 rape.

The Maryland Court of Appeals threw out his conviction, ruling that police needed a warrant or at least reason to suspect him of another crime before swabbing his cheek. The state, backed by the federal government, brought the case to the Supreme Court.

The justices have been inundated in recent years with difficult Fourth Amendment cases as well as others involving modern technology. Last year, they held that police could not attach a GPS tracking device to a car in order to monitor a suspect's movements. This year, they ruled that using a drug-sniffing dog with reasonable suspicion was OK -- but not at the door of a private home. And they decided that executing a search warrant after a suspect had left his home was out of bounds.

Modern technology presents a problem, however, particularly for justices who try to adhere to the Constitution. The framers didn't have GPS or DNA to contend with in the late 18th century. In February, the court grappled with the patent rights of self-replicating soybeans. In April, they debated about a breast cancer detection technology that comes from human genes.

In this case, Maryland likened DNA to fingerprinting and other tools used to identify suspects. While fingerprinting is faster, Kennedy ruled that DNA testing is more accurate and the privacy intrusion relatively minor.

But opponents have noted that police take DNA from people upon arrest to help in other investigations -- a process that can lead to false hits and wrongful convictions.

During oral argument in February, Justice Sonia Sotomayor worried that DNA swabs could find their way into the nation's schools and workplaces. Justice Elena Kagan quipped that if it works so well, ""why don't we do this for anybody who comes in for a driver's license?""

That was the argument Scalia used in his dissent against what he called a ""suspicionless"" search.

""If you believe that a DNA search will identify someone arrested for bank robbery, you must believe that it will identify someone arrested for running a red light,"" he said, concluding, ""The proud men who wrote the charter of our liberties would not have been so eager to open their mouths for royal inspection.""

On the other side were the court's four other conservative justices. Most convinced about the promise of DNA during oral argument was Alito, who called it ""the fingerprinting of the 21st century."" He noted that the criminal justice system has ""lots of murders, lots of rapes that can be solved.""

The oral argument also revealed an unlikely split among the justices: Breyer said the practice targets only those arrested for serious crimes -- and for a worthy cause. In the end, his vote proved crucial to the majority.

The case received additional attention from the parents and family members of crime victims who have fought for years to expand DNA searches.

Jayann and Dave Sepich have led that effort through the organization DNA Saves. Their daughter Katie was brutally raped and strangled at the age of 22 a decade ago. By the time her killer was identified through DNA evidence, he had committed other crimes.

""This just means that so many horrible murderers and rapists are going to be taken off the streets,"" and other families won't have to go through what hers did, Jayann Sepich said after hearing of the decision. Now, she said, ""the remaining 24 states that need to pass these laws can do it and feel great about it.""

Last year, Congress passed the Katie Sepich Enhanced DNA Collection Act, which President Obama signed in January. It creates a grants program to help states pay for the expanded system.

""It's the right thing to do,"" Obama said of taking DNA from arrestees in a 2010 appearance on America's Most Wanted. ""This is where the national registry becomes so important.""

On the other side of the debate are civil liberties advocates who worry that DNA is subject to contamination, misinterpretation, sample switches and fraud.

""It won't be long now before the federal DNA database has expanded to be as comprehensive as its fingerprint database,"" said Ohio State criminal law professor Ric Simmons, ""So we should all get used to the idea of the government having our DNA on file somewhere.""

Police and crime victims' groups heralded the ruling and said states without similar laws now can consider them. Nevada became the 26th state last week. Minnesota's high court previously struck down its law, while Connecticut and Oklahoma have versions affecting a limited number of arrestees.

Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey noted his state has been waiting with a draft plan for the court to act. ""Hopefully, this will help move things along,'' he said. ""This (technology) is the fingerprint of the 21st century.''

Mai Fernandez, executive director of the National Center for Victims of Crime, called the use of DNA ""the gold standard for helping to solve cold cases."" But he said the 5-4 ruling reflects a ""split in society'' about the use of such a tool and whether it constitutes an improper intrusion.

""There are always going to be issues around privacy rights,"" Fernandez said. ""Although people are becoming more comfortable with the use of DNA, there still is a lot that people don't understand.""

So once again, the Senate overwhelmingly—and yes, with bipartisan support—passed it. And once again, House Republicans just aren't sure if they can bring themselves to even hold a vote on it.

But at least, according to The Hill, some Republicans are starting to think about how opposing this heretofore uncontroversial legislation might have some negative side effects. Like, say, on Election Day in 2014. West Virginia Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, for example, said, ""It is far, far past due to reauthorize VAWA."" Gee, ya think?

Capito and a handful of other House Republicans are suggesting that maybe they should get over themselves and their weak-tea objections to the Senate's bill, but it's not as if they've had a change of heart and suddenly want to embrace those very women they've been saying do not deserve protection from rape and abuse. Republicans aren't about to have a change of heart on non-white non-straight women. But this just might be reason enough for them to have a change of heart on the bill:



The 2012 election cycle saw Republicans up and down the ballot face accusations that they were “out of touch” on women’s issues — a Democratic argument that gained traction with voters following inopportune comments about rape and pregnancy by Republican Senate candidates in Missouri and Indiana. National exit polling showed 55 percent of women voted for House Democratic candidates, compared to 45 percent who supported House Republicans. The presidential race saw an identical gender gap in favor of President Obama.

Yeah. Turns out the Republicans' War on Women did not bode well for Republicans in the last election, and if they don't do something to change the perception that, you know, they're bad for women, they just might be looking at another gaping gender gap in next year's election.

That's the ugly reality House Republicans are starting to accept—especially those blue state Republicans who will be particularly vulnerable in 2014—which is why they sent a letter this week calling on their party leadership to hold a vote and pass the damn bill already. So will they?





@jbendery via web Boehner on VAWA: ""No decision"" yet on whether the House will take up the Senate bill or move our own version.

Yeah. Don't hold your breath. Instead, sign the petition from Daily Kos and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee urging House Republicans to protect all women by passing the Senate version of the expanded, bipartisan Violence Against Women Act."

In the debate over the future of the Voting Rights Act , it sometimes becomes apparent that certain members of the Supreme Court are either oblivious to our nation’s recent history or willfully ignore it. Justice Antonin Scalia made this abundantly clear in his comments during the Feb. 27 oral argument in Shelby County v. Holder , statements that he repeated in a speech on April 15.

To Scalia, the Voting Rights Act — especially Section 5, which requires covered states to submit any changes in voting practices to the Justice Department or a Washington court for approval — is a “racial entitlement” and a violation of state sovereignty. In his view, it unfairly and unnecessarily treats seven Southern states, plus Alaska, Arizona and parts of six others, differently from states not covered by the act. This month, according to the Wall Street Journal, he called the act a form of “racial preferment” that affected only African Americans while ignoring the white population.

Such statements indicate that Scalia is woefully ignorant of the legislation’s history. Because of our nation’s painful legacy of racial injustice, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 has often been used to safeguard black voters specifically, but its protections extend to all Americans regardless of skin color, as was vividly demonstrated in the period after its passage.

Enactment of the Voting Rights Act also led to the abolition of the poll tax. So in May 1966, African Americans were able to vote freely for the first time in an off-year primary election. Across the South, many blacks sought a host of elected offices, from county sheriff to seats in state legislatures. In Alabama, a Democratic candidate for governor, Attorney General Richmond Flowers, vigorously campaigned for black votes. If elected, he promised, he would appoint blacks to positions in his administration — men and women active in the civil rights movement, he pledged, not “just a few Uncle Toms.”

The favorite to win in Alabama, however, was Flowers’s opponent, Lurleen Wallace, a stand-in for her husband, George, the gubernatorial incumbent who was ineligible to run because of term limits. A vote for the Wallace ticket would be a vote for segregation; George Wallace had been the scourge of the civil rights movement in Alabama and had actively incited racial hatred to obtain the support of white voters.

On Election Day, the turnout was extraordinary. In Selma, the polls opened at 8 a.m., but black voters started lining up hours before. In Birmingham, a blistering sun caused one older man to faint, but when an ambulance arrived, he refused to go to the hospital until he had cast his ballot. “This is the first time I’m voting,” he said. “It might be my last.”

Voting continued far into the night. In Montgomery, the polls were supposed to close at 6 p.m. But at 8:30, 1,100 African Americans were still waiting at the polls and refused to leave before they had voted. At that same hour in Birmingham, 700 voters had waited patiently for more than five hours. “It made me think I was sort of somebody,” Willie Bolden, the 81-year-old grandson of slaves, told a reporter.

For African Americans, the outcome was disappointing. Few black candidates were elected, and Mrs. Wallace won a resounding victory with 399,024 votes, nearly twice as many as her husband had won four years earlier. Few had doubted that Wallace would win, but the size of her victory was what was truly surprising. And it was due, in part, to the Voting Rights Act.

Analysts later discovered that, while their projections had accounted for the historic enfranchisement of Alabama’s blacks, they had missed an equally important development: the even greater expansion of the white vote. By eliminating the literacy tests and other impediments such as the poll tax, the Voting Rights Act gave many poor whites the opportunity to register and cast ballots. A skillful get-out-the-vote campaign by Wallace’s staff added 110,000 new voters to the white majority, decreasing black influence even as the number of black voters grew. Nor was this phenomenon limited to Alabama. Throughout the South, many of the new registrants were white.

This election indicates that Scalia is wrong when he calls the Voting Rights Act “a racial preferment” that provides no protection for white voters. The act protects all voters, especially in the states and districts covered by Section 5, from any obstacles that might be put in their way. That was true in 1966 and remains true today as efforts to suppress the minority vote continue. Scalia needs to do his homework before the court determines the act’s future."

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']","In new term, Supreme Court may steer to right on key social issues","WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court term that opens Monday gives the court’s conservative bloc a clear opportunity to shift the law to the right on touchstone social issues such as abortion, contraception and religion, as well as the political controversy over campaign funding.

If the justices on the right agree among themselves, they could free wealthy donors to give far more to candidates and parties and clear the way for exclusively Christian prayers at local government events.

In other cases due to be heard this fall, the justices are likely to uphold state bans on college affirmative action and block most housing bias claims that allege an unfair impact on blacks and Latinos.

They may also give states more authority to restrict and regulate abortion.

The justices are being asked to hear cases from Oklahoma in which they could uphold limits on the use of the abortion pill and require pregnant women seeking abortions to undergo ultrasound tests to see the fetus. And last month, Arizona’s attorneys asked the court to uphold the state’s ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, a measure that was blocked on the basis of Roe vs. Wade.

By next spring, the justices are likely to revisit part of President Obama’s healthcare law to decide a religious-rights challenge to the requirement that large private employers provide their workers with coverage for contraceptives. Dozens of employers who run for-profit companies have sued, contending that providing health insurance that includes a full range of contraceptives violates their religious beliefs.

The upcoming term “is actually deeper in important cases than either of the last two terms,” said Irving Gornstein, executive director of the Supreme Court Institute at the Georgetown University’s law school.

The last term ended in June on a winning note for liberals, when the court handed down two victories for gay marriage. They included a 5-4 opinion by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy giving legally married same-sex couples an equal right to federal benefits.

In recent years, gay rights advocates have pushed cases toward the high court, confident that Kennedy and the four justices on his left would rule in their favor. Last week, Ted Olson and David Boies, the attorneys who led the challenge to California’s Proposition 8, filed suit in Virginia, hoping to force an eventual ruling on whether gay marriage is a constitutional right.

Advocates on the right are using the same strategy.

They have been pushing cases toward the court confident that Kennedy will join the four conservatives to rule in their favor on religion, affirmative action, campaign finance and abortion. In their legal briefs, they argue for broad rulings and a significant shift in the law. Because they believe Kennedy is on their side, they “think they have the wind at their back,” said Pamela Harris, a Georgetown professor and former Justice Department lawyer.

So far, the only abortion-related case on the court’s docket tests a Massachusetts law that sets a 35-foot buffer zone around the entrances to abortion clinics. It is being challenged as a free-speech violation by Eleanor McCullen, a 74-year-old grandmother who seeks to talk to women before they enter a Planned Parenthood clinic in Boston.

Advertisement

In 2000, over vehement dissents from Kennedy and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, the court upheld an 8-foot buffer zone in Colorado. The new case, McCullen vs. Coakley, to be heard in January, gives the court under Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. a chance to restrict buffer zones to 8 feet or, as the advocates propose, reject them entirely.

Kennedy signaled the potential for a major shift on abortion regulation six years ago. He spoke for a 5-4 majority to uphold the federal ban on “partial-birth abortions” and declared the “government has a legitimate and substantial interest in preserving and promoting fetal life.”

Advertisement

Antiabortion lawmakers read this as an invitation to enact new restrictions. “Justice Kennedy’s opinion was a foundation changer,” said John Eastman, a Chapman University law professor who appealed the decision striking down Arizona’s 20-week limit on abortions. “We’re optimistic this will force the court to confront the issue of fetal pain.”

Since 2010, Arizona and 12 states have adopted bans on abortion after 20 weeks, citing “scientific evidence of fetal pain.” Some of these states have adopted laws mandating ultrasound tests for patients seeking abortions and requiring costly changes in clinic facilities.

Advertisement

Although some measures have been blocked by federal judges, the goal was to get the issue to the Supreme Court.

It will be many months before the court decides whether it will take up an abortion regulation, but leaders of the antiabortion movement are hopeful. The Arizona appeal “may well be the case that leads the Supreme Court to examine and acknowledge the risk of abortion to women,” said Charmaine Yoest, president of Americans United for Life.

First up this fall are campaign funding and prayers at town council meetings.

On Tuesday, the court will hear an appeal brought by the Republican National Committee and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that challenges the $123,000 total limit on how much donors may give to congressional candidates and political parties. They want the court to say contributions, like political spending, are fully protected as free speech.

The lead plaintiff is Shaun McCutcheon, a 46-year-old electrical engineer from Birmingham, Ala. If he wins, it will help those in the political fundraising business because they could solicit millions of dollars from wealthy donors.

On Nov. 6, the court will consider whether town leaders can invite a Christian minister to open their meetings with a prayer to Jesus Christ. The case is Town of Greece (N.Y.) vs. Galloway.

Two race-related cases will also be heard. The justices will be asked to uphold Michigan’s voter initiative forbidding “preferential” admissions based on race. The case, Schuette vs. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, is set for Oct. 15. And the court could limit housing bias claims in a case from Mount Holly, N.J., due to be heard Dec. 4.

An employee already has, allegedly.

The owner of Jersey Joe's Pizzeria told HuffPost Weird News today that he's not the guy in a photo circulating around the Internet, showing a white-haired man masturbating in a pizzeria kitchen -- nor is it anyone working at his establishment.

In Jersey Joe's storefront window, the humble eatery proudly displays an ""A"" rating from San Diego's Department of Environmental Health, with a score of 98 on its recent June 3 inspection.

Reporters at the shop showed Giusepp ""Jersey Joe"" Scire the photo, which was posted on the photo-sharing website 4Chan, and then Yelp.

""It is not me [in the photo] and that's not my pizzeria,"" Scire told HuffPost Weird News.

Scire said that he ""fired two guys recently"" and suggested that he might be the victim of a disgruntled ex-employee.

The bombshell dropped on Wednesday, when 4Chan users posted links to several random, unsecured webcams. That's when, those users claim, they found Scire jerking his Joe, and took screenshots. The photo shows a man in a white T-shirt and shorts sitting at a desk with his pepperoni in his hand. The backdrop is a kitchen, complete with a fridge, sink and containers that are used to keep pizzas warm.

Later in the day, a man live-streamed his experience (partial video below) confronting an employee of Jersey Joe's about the photo. The man in one of the the videos -- which doesn't show any lewd acts -- appeared to show Scire serving pizza and then becoming irate when the customer asked him about the masturbation photo.

Critics on Yelp immediately took to Jersey Joe's restaurant page to poke fun at the business.

""The white cheese pizza had an odd taste,"" one user wrote. ""Five stars for such a relaxed gentleman assisting me.""

Another user added, ""So I just watched one of their employees masturbate in the back on their unsecured camera feed."" That user added a link to the circulating photo.

In the restaurant today, Scire said he hadn't heard of the tongue-in-cheek Yelp reviews, saying, ""I'm just going to call the cops.""

As for the taste, HuffPost Weird News executive editor Buck Wolf said the white slice was ""pretty good by non-New York standards.""

DOMA has been declared unconstitutional in several lower courts

The 1996 law defines marriage as between a man and a woman

It%27s possible the justices ultimately will sidestep a far-reaching decision

The Supreme Court turns Wednesday from the threshold issue of sanctioning same-sex marriage to one with financial repercussions: Can the federal government deny benefits to those already married?

At issue is the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a 1996 law passed overwhelmingly by Congress and signed by President Clinton that defines marriage as between a man and a woman. (Clinton has said he has changed his mind about the law.) At the time of its passage, no states had legalized gay marriage, but now nine states and the District of Columbia have done so — and legally wed gay couples are denied federal benefits.

The case accepted by the court from among several it could have taken features Edith Windsor, an 83-year-old New York widow who married her partner of four decades, Thea Spyer, in 2007. When Spyer died in 2009, Windsor was socked with a $363,000 estate tax bill that she would have avoided if Thea had been ""Theo.""

Now in failing health but a hero within the gay rights community, Windsor is expected to be in court today to hear her lawyer present her case. And not only her lawyer — the federal government also takes her side, which is both a benefit and a potential curse.

As was the case Tuesday, the unusual array of plaintiffs and respondents presents the court with some initial questions to hash out. The federal government is no longer defending its own law and has joined forces with its opponents. So is there any dispute left? And can the House Republican leadership, which has taken up the defense of DOMA, replace the Obama administration in court?

Those questions will be debated for nearly an hour before the two sides get to the merits of the case. It's possible the justices ultimately will sidestep a far-reaching decision when they issue their ruling, most likely in late June.

The justices could have avoided taking the Proposition 8 case, but they were forced to tackle DOMA because it had been declared unconstitutional in several lower courts. They chose from among overlapping cases, including challenges to the law from New England, New York and California.

The plaintiffs in those cases — married same-sex couples, widows and widowers in states where gay marriage is or previously was legal — are seeking the same federal benefits accorded opposite-sex couples."

BISMARCK, N.D. -- A federal judge on Monday temporarily blocked a new North Dakota law that bans abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected – as early as six weeks into pregnancy, calling the law ""clearly invalid and unconstitutional.""

U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland in Bismarck granted a temporary injunction Monday that blocks the Aug. 1 enactment of the law that abortion rights advocates call the most restrictive in the nation.

""There is no question that (the North Dakota law) is in direct contradiction to a litany of United States Supreme Court cases addressing restraints on abortion,"" Hovland wrote. "" (It) is clearly an invalid and unconstitutional law based on the United States Supreme Court precedent in Roe v. Wade from 1973 ... and the progeny of cases that have followed.""

""We have our job to do,"" Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem told The Associated Press. ""We need to convince (Hovland) why the Legislature wanted to enact the law.""

Stenehjem said the state will ask the court for a trial and already has hired an attorney to help argue the case.

New York-based Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing the state's lone abortion clinic, Red River Women's Clinic in Fargo, filed the lawsuit in June after the law was passed this year by the North Dakota Legislature. It would outlaw the procedure as early as six weeks into pregnancy and before some women even know they are pregnant.

Abortion-rights advocates say the measures are an attempt to close North Dakota's lone abortion clinic. Supporters of the so-called fetal heartbeat measure, including Gov. Jack Dalrymple, have said it's a challenge the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion up until a fetus is considered viable, usually at 22 to 24 weeks.

Janet Crepps, an attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the law banning abortions at six weeks ""poses a very immediate threat to virtually all women seeking an abortion in North Dakota.""

Red River director Tammi Kromenaker and Crepps said the six-week abortion ban would stop about 90 percent of abortions at the clinic.

""This ruling means that women won't have to rush in and make a decision,"" Kromenaker said of the injunction. ""Now they have more time to talk to their loved one, their pastor – whoever they need to talk to – while weighing their decision to have an abortion.""

Jeff Zent, a spokesman for Dalrymple, said the governor would not comment on the federal judge's ruling.

""It's our standing policy not to comment on litigation,"" he said.

The clinic's lawsuit also is challenging another new measure that would make North Dakota the only state to prohibit women from having an abortion because a fetus has a genetic defect, such as Down syndrome.

Kromenaker said the clinic wants that law overturned but didn't seek an immediate injunction to block it because abortions are not performed there for that reason.

The clinic is not challenging another new North Dakota law that would outlaw abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, based on the disputed premise that a fetus can feel pain by then. Texas Gov. Rick Perry last week signed into law a 20-week ban and other abortion restrictions for that state.

Kromenaker said the 20-week ban, which she believes is unconstitutional, does not apply to North Dakota because no abortions are performed at the clinic after 16 weeks.

Another measure would require a doctor who performs abortions to be a physician with hospital admitting privileges. A lawsuit challenging that law has been combined with another one challenging a 2011 North Dakota law that outlaws one of two drugs used in nonsurgical abortions. A state judge ruled last week that the 2011 law violates the state and U.S. constitutions. A judge hasn't yet issued a ruling on the new law requiring abortion doctors to have hospital admitting privileges.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/06/17/supreme-court-arizona-citizenship-proof-law-illegal/,2013-06-17 00:00:00,[],Supreme Court: Arizona law requiring citizenship proof for voters is illegal,"The Supreme Court ruled Monday that states cannot on their own require would-be voters to prove they are U.S. citizens before using a federal registration system designed to make signing up easier.

The justices voted 7-2 to throw out Arizona's voter-approved requirement that prospective voters document their U.S. citizenship in order to use a registration form produced under the federal ""Motor Voter"" voter registration law.

Federal law ""precludes Arizona from requiring a federal form applicant to submit information beyond that required by the form itself,"" Justice Antonia Scalia wrote for the court's majority.

The court was considering the legality of Arizona's requirement that prospective voters document their U.S. citizenship in order to use a registration form produced under the federal ""motor voter"" registration law. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which doesn't require such documentation, trumps Arizona's Proposition 200 passed in 2004.

Arizona appealed that decision to the Supreme Court.

More On This... Immigration enforcement director resigning after 4 years on the job

""Today's decision sends a strong message that states cannot block their citizens from registering to vote by superimposing burdensome paperwork requirements on top of federal law,"" said Nina Perales, vice president of litigation for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and lead counsel for the voters who challenged Proposition 200.

""The Supreme Court has affirmed that all U.S. citizens have the right to register to vote using the national postcard, regardless of the state in which they live,"" she said.

The case focuses on Arizona, which has tangled frequently with the federal government over immigration issues involving the Mexican border. But it has broader implications because four other states -- Alabama, Georgia, Kansas and Tennessee -- have similar requirements, and 12 other states are contemplating such legislation.

Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented from the court's ruling.

The Constitution ""authorizes states to determine the qualifications of voters in federal elections, which necessarily includes the related power to determine whether those qualifications are satisfied,"" Thomas said in his dissent.

Opponents of Arizona's law see it as an attack on vulnerable voter groups such as minorities, immigrants and the elderly. They say they've counted more than 31,000 potentially legal voters in Arizona who easily could have registered before Proposition 200 but were blocked initially by the law in the 20 months after it passed in 2004. They say about 20 percent of those thwarted were Latino.

Barbara Arnwine, president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, called the decision a victory. ""The court has reaffirmed the essential American right to register to vote for federal election without the burdens of state voter suppression measures,"" she said.

But Arizona officials say they should be able to pass laws to stop illegal immigrants and other noncitizens from getting on their voting rolls. The Arizona voting law was part of a package that also denied some government benefits to illegal immigrants and required Arizonans to show identification before voting.

The federal ""motor voter"" law, enacted in 1993 to expand voter registration, requires states to offer voter registration when a resident applies for a driver's license or certain benefits. Another provision of that law -- the one at issue before the court -- requires states to allow would-be voters to fill out mail-in registration cards and swear they are citizens under penalty of perjury, but it doesn't require them to show proof. Under Proposition 200, Arizona officials require an Arizona driver's license issued after 1996, a U.S. birth certificate, a passport or other similar document, or the state will reject the federal registration application form.

While the court was clear in stating that states cannot add additional identification requirements to the federal forms on their own, it was also clear that the same actions can be taken by state governments if they get the approval of the federal government and the federal courts.

Arizona can ask the federal government to include the extra documents as a state-specific requirement, Scalia said, and take any decision made by the government on that request back to court. Other states have already done so, Scalia said.

The Election Assistance Commission ""recently approved a state-specific instruction for Louisiana requiring applicants who lack a Louisiana driver's license, ID card or Social Security number to attach additional documentation to the completed federal form,"" Scalia said.

Incredible amounts of corporate money have flooded into our political system since the Citizens United decision. Indeed, Bazelon's statement in 2007 seems very prescient after this week:



The reassurances to the left about Roberts' virtues look pretty empty this week. And just wait until Roberts becomes a court veteran. The longer he's there, the less relevant keeping or chucking past decisions will be, and the more he'll build, from case to case, on the opinions he has written himself. [Emphasis supplied.]

That is precisely what Roberts did in gutting the Voting Rights Act this week, where in his opinion in Shelby County v. Holder (PDF), the precedent Roberts relies upon almost exclusively is his own 2009 opinion in. When affirmative action comes before the court again, watch the citations to Fisher

Might this be the moment that finally provides a deeper understanding and awakening in the country to just how extremist and radical the Robert Court is? Certainly on the court that may be happening. Justice Ginsburg's dissent is quite biting:



Without even identifying a standard of review, the Court dismissively brushes off arguments based on “data from the record,” and declines to enter the “debat[e about] what [the] record shows.” Ante, at 20–21. One would expect more from an opinion striking at the heart of the Nation’s signal piece of civil-rights legislation.I note the most disturbing lapses. First, by what right,given its usual restraint, does the Court even address Shelby County’s facial challenge to the VRA? Second, the Court veers away from controlling precedent regarding the“equal sovereignty” doctrine without even acknowledging that it is doing so. Third, hardly showing the respect ordinarily paid when Congress acts to implement the Civil War Amendments, and as just stressed, the Court does not even deign to grapple with the legislative record. [...] the Court’s opinion in this case contains not a word explaining why Congress lacks the power to subject to preclearance the particular plaintiff that initiated this lawsuit—Shelby County, Alabama. The reason for the Court’s silence is apparent, for as applied to Shelby County, the VRA’s preclearance requirement is hardly contestable. [...] Beyond question, the VRA is no ordinary legislation. It is extraordinary because Congress embarked on a mission long delayed and of extraordinary importance: to realize the purpose and promise of the Fifteenth Amendment. For a half century, a concerted effort has been made to end racial discrimination in voting. Thanks to the Voting Rights Act, progress once the subject of a dream has been achieved and continues to be made. [...] Congress reauthorized the VRA, including the coverage provision, with overwhelming bipartisan support. It was the judgment of Congress that “40 years has not been a sufficient amount of time to eliminate the vestiges of discrimination following nearly 100 years of disregard for the dictates of the 15th amendment and to ensure that the right of all citizens to vote is protected as guaranteed by the Constitution.” 2006 Reauthorization §2(b)(7), 120 Stat. 577. That determination of the body empowered to enforce the Civil War Amendments “by appropriate legislation” merits this Court’s utmost respect. In my judgment, the Court errs egregiously by overriding Congress’ decision. [Emphasis supplied.]

The direct political impact of the Roberts Five's radical extreme overturning of one of the most admired and effective pieces of legislation in the history of the nation is patent. Already many of the covered jurisdictions are warming up their schemes to suppress minority voting, mostly through onerous voter ID laws.

The question is will the nation, especially minority voters, be ""activated"" as well. A big part of the question will be determined by how the Democratic Party explains what is at stake. Too often it has failed in this task.

And too often liberal pundits have failed to explain the extreme and radical nature of the project the Roberts Five are engaged in.

One of my sig lines back in the day was ""the SCOTUS is extraordinary."" Every year we find out again and again how extraordinary it is. Can the extreme and radical nature of the Roberts Five be properly conveyed by the Democratic Party and liberal and progressive commentators? Can the extreme and radical Roberts Five become a significant part of the political conversation? It needs to, not just for the politics but because the country needs to know what these five men are up to. And they must be stopped."

A controversial initiative that would require women to buy an additional rider on their health insurance if they wanted abortion coverage is one short step away from going to the Legislature, where it is likely to easily become law. Because no one filed a challenge by Monday’s deadline to the more than 315,000 signatures turned in to the Secretary of State, an initiative that would prohibit abortion coverage from being included in standard insurance policies will go forward. And the Secretary of State certified Monday that Michigan Right to Life, which spearheaded the petition drive, has more than enough valid signatures to start the ball rolling on the new state law. A minimum of 258,088 valid signatures were needed. The anti-abortion activists turned in 315,477 signatures. And the Secretary of State’s elections division estimated that 299,941 of the signatures are valid. The state Board of Canvassers will meet at 9:30 a.m. Dec. 2 to certify the signatures and then the petition moves to the state Legislature, which has 40 days to approve, reject or do nothing with the legislative ballot initiative.

If Republicans vote it down or fail to act on it, it will be a ballot iniatitive in the next general election. Neither of these is likely given their ideologically extreme views. If they pass it, it becomes law. The other 95.8% of us won’t have a say and neither will Governor Snyder.

Oh and, by the way, most Michigan voters actually oppose the law.

Don't tell me there isn't a War on Women in Michigan being waged by religious conservatives in our state. The evidence is right before you.

If you want chime in, Planned Parenthood has a petition going asking legislators to allow ALL Michigan voters to have a say in this. You can sign the petition HERE.

UPDATE: For those who are asking how this is possible/legal, the process is called an ""indirect initiated state statute"". I've described how it works HERE. Challenging the legality of the law itself can't happen until it actually becomes a law so that may yet happen."

(CNN) —

The political culture in Arizona, my home state, is often coarse, racialized and divisive. President Barack Obama’s visit there Tuesday gave the world another opportunity to see it. At times it seems as though the most bigoted individuals in America’s 48th state save their most raucous and prejudiced behavior for the 44th president.

The Arizona Republic reported that hundreds of dissenters chose to model their insulting and extremist behavior before some of Phoenix’s youngest residents. Assembled outside Desert Vista High School, they mocked Obama’s race, singing “Bye Bye Black Sheep” in spirited synchronization. One “patriot” went so far as to deprecate our commander in chief by pronouncing him “47 percent Negro,” while another, Deanne Bartram, held a sign that read, “Impeach the Half-White Muslim!”

Obama chose Desert Vista, home to some of Phoenix’s best and brightest students, to present his ideas for repairing America’s ailing mortgage finance apparatus. Some activists assembled to plead with the president to take more aggressive steps to combat climate change, such as renouncing the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Nevertheless, the overwhelming disposition of the angry horde was openly reminiscent of the Jim Crow South.

One of the most disturbing aspects of the anti-Obama protest was the inclination of some participants to fault the president for increased racial tensions. “We have gone back so many years,” Judy Burris told the Republic, insisting that Obama’s presence and policies have engendered a racist backlash. “He’s divided all the races. I hate him for that.”

This mind-bending perspective has become one of the leitmotifs of the racialized anti-Obama movement, which laments regressive race relations, but which attributes increased racial tensions in Obama’s “disruptive” and “exotic” presence, rather than their own racial stereotypes, hateful rhetoric and divisive behavior. Despite myriad efforts to foster civil dialogue in Arizona, the state has proven to be fertile ground for the kind of chauvinistic crusading that greeted Obama this week.

The idea that Obama has divided the races is farcical. As I wrote in a Republic essay in March, Time magazine announced the selection of Obama as its Person of the 2012 Year (for a second time) because, as Richard Stengel argued in his editorial preface, “We are in the midst of historic cultural and demographic changes, and Obama is both the symbol and in some ways the architect of this new America.” Obama deserved credit, he wrote, “for finding and forging a new majority, for turning weakness into opportunity and for seeking, amid great adversity, to create a more perfect union.”

However, nearly five years into Obama’s presidency, the politics of hope, optimism and racial equality that his campaign and election inspired have bumped into a new political reality marked by economic challenges, political acrimony and disillusionment. The resulting political backlash has triggered rancorous and racially charged clashes.

The rowdy gathering outside Desert Vista underscored the nature of race relations in the Obama age – evolving but oddly static in some ways – and the particularly bigoted shades of anti-Obama emotion in Arizona. If the age of Obama prophesied a more progressive, multifaceted and refined dialogue about American race relations, the vision has not been realized. Rather, many Americans, particularly xenophobic cliques such as the ones on display in my state, have recoiled back to a pre-civil rights-era temperament and increasingly overt racist outbursts.

As brazen as those in the Desert Vista crowd were, they are merely the most belligerent and public face of a legion of racist anti-Obama persons. These more discreet individuals are smart enough to cloak their racialized opposition in obstructionist maneuvering and public policy that does more damage to the lives of people of color than prejudiced banter. Still, the Desert Vista protest should give everyone pause and put us on high alert. The racist rhetoric heard there reflects inner beliefs and fears that have tremendous potential to do great harm.

Arizona leaders would be remiss in dismissing it as “fringe.” As civil rights activist Pauli Murray once cautioned, “Racism is like a deadly snake coiled and ready to strike, and one only avoids its dangers by never-ending watchfulness.”

(CNN) —

Since I first became aware of the maddening case of 36-year-old Sergio Garcia, who seeks admission to the California Bar, I’ve tried to convince myself this accomplished young man – a law school graduate who passed the bar exam – should be able to practice law despite the inconvenient fact that he is an undocumented immigrant.

Yet, I can’t. My heart goes out to Garcia. But my head won’t go along.

This week, the California Supreme Court held a hearing to decide whether Garcia is eligible for a law license in California in a case that is certain to impact the fate of other undocumented immigrants in pursuit of legal careers.

Garcia is opposed by the Obama administration’s Justice Department, which cites a 1996 law that prohibits states from providing undocumented immigrants with public benefits, including professional licenses. He is supported by California Attorney General Kamala Harris, who argues the issuance of law licenses isn’t a federal matter but up to states to decide.

Courtesy San Diego Union Tribune Ruben Navarrette Jr.

A decision from the court is expected in the next 90 days.

Garcia came to the United States from Mexico with his family when he was a toddler. He returned to Mexico with his mother when he was 9 and came back to the U.S. when he was 17. He applied for citizenship. That was back in 1994, and he is still waiting to hear from Uncle Sam.

He told AP that he isn’t worried about being deported because his case is well-known and he had notified immigration officials that he is in the U.S. awaiting a decision on his citizenship.

While he waits, he has been working hard toward his goal of becoming a lawyer. He paid for his studies at Cal Northern School of Law in Chico, California, by working at a grocery store.

Yet, in the immigration debate, we must separate the individual from the idea. The individual – Garcia – looks like a keeper. The idea – that one who has lived most of his life outside the law can practice law – is problematic.

This young man wants to put his hand on a Bible and pledge the following: “I solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California, and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of an attorney and counselor at law to the best of my knowledge and ability.”

That oath comes from the California Bar Association, which states: “It is the duty of an attorney to … support the laws of the United States and of this state … maintain the respect due to the courts of justice and judicial officers … (and) never to seek to mislead the judge or any judicial officer by an artifice or false statement of fact or law.”

How is Garcia supposed to uphold “the laws of the United States” when he is, by his mere presence in this country, in violation of federal law?

How does he pledge to show respect for “the courts of justice” when, for most of his life, he has lived here in defiance of the rule of law? And how can he claim that he won’t “mislead” a judge or judicial officer when living in the United States illegally requires deception on a daily basis?

If Garcia had more respect for the profession that he is seeking to join, he might have second thoughts about whether he is eligible to join it. Yet, he seems to feel entitled to a law license and everything that comes with it.

I’ve had contact with Garcia in the past, and I’m worried that he’s lived in the United States for so long that he’s picked up some bad habits from his fellow Americans.

Several months ago, Garcia posted on Facebook: “I have a career lined up with the potential of offering employment to U.S. Citizens, no criminal record anywhere and have been in limbo for the last 19 years. Where the hell is my American Dream? Lol”

I responded: “Not to pick a fight, Sergio. But your question is very much part of the problem. ‘Where’s mine? Where’s my American Dream? Gimme, gimme.’ You’re an American after all. I’ll tell the kid at Starbucks, the one with the sense of entitlement, to scoot over and make room.”

I continued: “If America gives you the chance to live the Dream, don’t you think it’s fair for her to ask for something in return? She decided that she wanted your RESPECT, and that this could be demonstrated by you respecting her laws – the same laws you say you want to spend your life serving and defending in a courtroom. Don’t you see the irony there?”

Garcia responded: “Let me get done with lunch so I can address your entitlement issues.”

He never got back to me. In his public comments, I haven’t seen evidence that Garcia has considered for one minute the possibility that this case is about issues larger than himself, his plans, his dreams.

I don’t think he has. And if the court decides in his favor, he never will.

Senate approved the measure last month

Amendment would have to be approved by voters

Bill would cover %22historically significant displays%22 that may also have religious significance

MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- A House committee approved a constitutional amendment Wednesday that would authorize governments and schools to display the Ten Commandments, but an American Civil Liberties Union attorney said the law can't ""trump the Constitution.""

The legislation, sponsored by GOP Sen. Gerald Dial would allow public schools and public bodies to display ""historically significant displays which reflect the foundations of the rule of law in America, notwithstanding that such displays may also have religious significance.""

The Senate approved the measure last month 23-1. The committee approved the amendment on a voice vote; it now goes to the House of Representatives. If approved there, the amendment would go to voters in 2014.

As introduced, the bill explicitly authorized the display of the Ten Commandments. Dial said at a meeting of the House Constitution, Campaigns and Elections committee that the language was changed in an attempt to stave off potential lawsuits.

""That would certainly result in us going to court, because of challenges based on religious content,"" he said.

After the meeting, Dial said he hoped the measure would defend local communities that wanted to display the Ten Commandments.

""We changed to historically significant religious documents,"" he said. ""That would include the Ten Commandments, that would include the Pledge of Allegiance, you could even display a coin that said 'In God We Trust' in your building and not worry about being sued by someone.""

Dial argued that the Ten Commandments would be considered a ""historically significant"" document, claiming the Founding Fathers had implemented it in the creation of the U.S. Constitution.

But the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a similar argument made in Stone v. Graham, a 1980 decision that struck down a Kentucky statute requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in public school classrooms.

The Kentucky statute required displays of the Ten Commandments to include language saying the ""secular application"" of the Ten Commandments ""is clearly seen in its adoption as the fundamental legal code of Western Civilization and the Common Law of the United States."" The Supreme Court said the Ten Commandments were a ""sacred text,"" and that ""no legislative recitation of a supposed secular purpose can blind us to that fact.""

""The Commandments do not confine themselves to arguably secular matters, such as honoring one's parents, killing or murder,"" the court wrote. ""Rather, the first part of the Commandments concerns the religious duties of believers: Worshipping the Lord God alone, avoiding idolatry, not using the Lord's name in vain, and observing the Sabbath Day.""

The historically significant context, Dial said afterward, would not authorize the display of other religious documents, such as the Quran.

Current Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore brought the public display of the Ten Commandments to the forefront during a legal and political fight over him displaying the Commandments on a more than 2-ton granite monument he had placed in the state judicial building.

Moore originally was removed from office almost a decade ago for refusing a federal judge's order to remove the monument, which also depicted other historic documents. Moore ran again last year and reclaimed his seat.

Heather Weaver, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union's Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief, said in an interview Wednesday that ""state law can't trump the First Amendment,"" which provides for separation of church and state.

She warned the state was setting itself up for lawsuits.

""It's a power grab by the state, and it injects the state into these deeply personal religious matters,"" Weaver said. ""Religious liberty for individuals and groups can only be guaranteed when government remains neutral.""

The amendment includes language banning the use of public funds ""in defense of the constitutionality of this amendment.""

Dial argued that the display of the commandments, particularly the Fifth Commandment's prohibition of killing, would be ""worth it"" if sight of the commandment inspired a student to avoid violent acts. That drew skepticism from Democratic Rep. Juandalynn Givan.

""People see these words every day, and I don't think they've stopped anyone yet,"" Givan said after the meeting. ""You have to have the mindset, as well as the heart, not to kill."""

Follow Him On Twitter At""]",UNC prof ignites 4th Amendment debate after being pulled over by fire truck,"When a North Carolina firefighter switched on the siren atop his Chapel Hill Fire Department truck to get a driver he suspected of being impaired to pull over, he probably didn't expect to ignite a constitutional debate.

But that's exactly what has happened. The woman Fire Lt. Gordon Shatley pulled over on his way back from a call was Dorothy Hoogland Verkerk, a professor at the University of North Carolina and former town council member who is arguing use of the fire truck and siren - which are not authorized for law enforcement actions - gave the color of government to what might otherwise have been a lawful citizen's arrest. And although a lower court upheld Verkerk's arrest, an appellate court remanded the case with instructions to consider whether it was an illegal search and seizure.

The incident occurred in May, 2011, and led to Verkerk's arrest and eventual conviction by an Orange County District Court judge for driving while intoxicated. Verkerk, who teaches art history at UNC-Chapel Hill, claimed in her appeal that Shatley violated her rights under the Fourth Amendment when he used the lights and sirens on the fire truck he was driving to pull her over. When she sped away, he called police who later caught and charged her.

Lower court Judge Elaine Bushfan denied Verkerk's motion claiming that Shatley had conducted a citizen’s arrest, but suspended her sentence and ordered the professor to spend 30 days in jail plus 18 months’ probation, pay a $1,000 fine, and perform 72 hours of community service.

That’s when Verkerk filed with the court of appeals and the three-member panel ordered Bushfan to consider anew the legality of Shatley stopping the driver. In particular, the appellate judges said it must be determined whether or not Shatley acted as a private citizen or as a governmental officer; if Shatley did act as a government officer, whether he followed Fourth Amendment criteria and had reasonable suspicion that a crime was being committed; and finally if the stop was unconstitutional, if that tainted evidence and the subsequent police traffic stop.

One member of the appeals panel, Judge Robert Hunter, found that Shatley was indeed a governmental officer at the time he stopped her, but conceded that he lacked police training and the legal authority to make an official traffic stop.

According to court documents, Shatley was on his way to a fire scene the night of May 27, 2011, when he saw Verkerk’s Mercedes stopped in an intersection. He noticed that the headlights were off and that the interior and auxiliary lights were lit and that the driver’s side window was partially opened despite a pouring rain. Shatley continued to his destination where he was no longer needed, and headed back to the firehouse.

On the way back, Shatley claims he pulled up behind Verkerk’s car as she was driving with a hazard light on and was weaving while driving much slower than the speed limit. Shatley told the driver of the firetruck to turn on the lights and siren to prevent other cars from passing.

Verkerk’s car then swerved to the right and hit the curb before coming to a stop, according to the documents.

Shatley hopped out of the fire truck and approached her car to see if she was ok. He did not ask if she was drunk but did urge her to park her car and have someone pick her up, according to documents. She told Shatley that she would, but then drove off. She was picked up by Chapel Hill Police 10 minutes later and charged with driving while impaired and had her license taken away.

In addition to teaching at UNC, Verkerk, who did not return requests for comment, is a former member of the Town Council and is a local environmental activist."

(CNN) —

When asked over the years if he can use executive power to stop deporting illegal immigrants, President Barack Obama has responded: Yes, we can! Other times, the answer was: No we can’t!

This week, at the Betty Ann Ong Chinese Recreation Center in San Francisco, Obama was heckled by an audience member who was later identified as Ju Hong, an undocumented student from South Korea who graduated from the University of California at Berkeley with a degree in political science. When Hong pleaded with Obama to put the brakes on deportations and stop separating families, Obama responded:

“Now, what you need to know, when I’m speaking as President of the United States and I come to this community, is that if, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so. But we’re also a nation of laws. That’s part of our tradition.”

Courtesy San Diego Union Tribune Ruben Navarrette Jr.

But, on October 26, 2011, at the University of Colorado-Denver, Obama said this when talking to students about using an executive order to reduce student loan debt.

“We’re not going to wait for Congress. I’m going to act with or without Congress. Where they won’t act, I will, through a series of executive orders. … We’re going to look every day to see what we can do without Congress.”

And on October 25, 2010, on the Spanish-language radio show, “Piolin por la Manana” – when host Eddie “Piolin” Sotelo asked him why he hadn’t moved faster on immigration reform, Obama responded:

“I am president, I am not a king. I can’t do these things just by myself. We have a system of government that requires the Congress to work with the executive branch to make it happen.”

Yet, two years later, while facing re-election and eager to reignite support among Latinos, Obama managed to get something done without Congress’ approval.

On June 15, 2012, he announced that his administration was offering Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to allow undocumented young people to temporarily avoid deportation and apply for a two-year work permit. Speaking from the Rose Garden, Obama said:

“It makes no sense to expel talented young people who, for all intents and purposes, are Americans. … In the absence of any immigration action from Congress to fix our broken immigration system, what we’ve tried to do is focus our immigration enforcement resources in the right places. … Effective immediately, the Department of Homeland Security is taking steps to lift the shadow of deportation from these young people.”

Confused? Join the club.

Obama’s immigration schtick is simple. He blames Republicans for the fact that we don’t have immigration reform. H3 covers up for Democrats in Congress who have had a poor record on immigration. He insists that his administration is not deporting Dreamers or anyone else who isn’t a hard-core criminal. And – as he did this week – he claims that his hands are tied because he needs Congress as a dance partner.

So if a president takes action without Congress, he violates the law? But this isn’t true. There’s such a thing as the executive order.

Obama has issued 164 executive orders on such things as climate change and student debt. It’s a well-worn presidential tool – George W. Bush issued 287; Bill Clinton issued 308.

In his most recent use of executive power, Obama is attempting to tinker with the requirements of the Affordable Care Act so that Americans can keep their health plans a while longer.

The point: When it comes to using the power of the presidency for causes he really cares about, Obama is no shrinking violet. So he must not care about immigration.

The audience in San Francisco wasn’t buying it. Hong shouted at the president that he had “the power to stop deportations for all” because there are “thousands of families separated every single day.”

The actual figure is about 1,100 deportations every day if apprehensions and deportations keep pace with the rate in previous years – roughly 400,000 per year, totaling a record of nearly 2 million since Obama took office.

Obama pushed back against Hong, insisting that he didn’t have the power to stop deporting people or dividing families. “That’s why we’re here,” he said.

Other people in the crowd sided with Hong and began to shout: “Stop deportations! Yes, we can!”

On the defensive, Obama unleashed the left’s favorite weapon: condescension.

“So the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws,” he said. “What I’m proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic process to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve. But it won’t be as easy as just shouting. It requires us lobbying and getting it done.”

You know what is an easy way out, Mr. President? Not being constrained by core principles because you change your position whenever you need to get out of a scrape.

After the exchange, Hong claimed that he hadn’t planned to challenge the President of the United States, but that he couldn’t take it anymore.

“This is very urgent,” he told reporters. “This is the only venue where I could speak out, and I’m representing the voices of other undocumented students who are actually in the detention center right now and who cannot be here.”

Bravo. This young man is a hero for bravely speaking truth to power. Way to represent.

They are usually heavily armed, blinded by an intractable hatred, often motivated by religious zeal.

They’re not jihadists. They are white, right-wing Americans, nearly all with an obsessive attachment to guns, who may represent a greater danger to the lives of American civilians than international terrorists.

The Southern Poverty Law Center, which has been tracking hate groups for 30 years, released its latest report on the growth of these organizations this week. Its findings were, to say the least, alarming. The center divides its subjects into militias, which are mostly groups of weekend warriors who train for combat against imaginary foes; hate groups, which target minorities; and “patriot” groups, whose beef is with the U.S. government. Patriot groups first began surfacing after the massacre of a bizarre sect by federal agents in Waco, Texas, in the early 1990s. They showed their teeth in 1995, when a patriot adherent blew up the federal building in Oklahoma City.

SLIDESHOW: The 10 trigger-happiest states in America

Since then, the patriot movement has been growing at a blistering pace, especially following the election of President Obama in 2008, according to the report. From just 149 groups in 2008, the number jumped to 512 in 2009 and has been rising sharply since. In 2012, it hit 1,360. Now that Obama is seriously pushing for tougher gun laws, further growth is a near certainty. The result? There’s no knowing, but some kind of serious attack is increasingly possible.

Patriot groups are motivated by a host of anti-government attitudes, but their primary focus is guns. They are convinced that the government is out to seize their weapons, even though most legislation is focused on keeping guns out of the hands of criminals or restricting the types of weapons that can be sold. Many are also united by belief in an outlandish one-world government conspiracy theory positing that the United Nations is poised to strip away American property rights and impose socialism on us all.

What can be done to reverse this tide of belligerent ignorance? Not much. The typical patriot acts within his free-speech and 2nd Amendment rights, and in fact most patriot activity consists of venting steam by meeting with like-minded Neanderthals and firing off blog posts threatening civil war. Yet such blather tends to get under the skin of the Timothy McVeighs of the world. These groups should be closely monitored, with resources adequate to the task, even if it means shifting some homeland security money from the hunt for foreign terrorists."

In fact, these ideas and worse have been brewing in Washington for a few years now. I first covered this issue in 2011, when the Obama Administration first began proposing 85 percent cuts in military pension plans. I noted later that year that a big battle was brewing over it, and then again in 2012 when some of the proposed cuts became part of Grand Bargain negotiations. Each time, military families have fought back, including our very own angelajean, MilitaryTracy, and others who are part of the Daily Kos Military Group . First and foremost, join their campaign to fight this cut in military benefits.

Make no mistake, the Administration and Congress have big plans for military veterans and their retirement and none of them are good.

Among the changes being considered:



The Department should establish a new structure for the military retirement system, based on annual contributions. One model for this new structure is the existing Uniformed Military Personnel Thrift Savings Plan (TSP).

The TSP operates in much the same way as a 401(k) plan, which is the largest scam ever perpetrated in the history of finance. Money is taken out of your meager military pay and then invested in mutual-type funds. They work just like a 401(k) plan, in that you can take the money out before you retire, borrow against it, or play around in high-risk securities with it. One of the funds invests in government securities and is managed by the Plan's trustees. Those funds will not ever lose money, so long as there is never a default. But, you guessed right, the rest of the funds are invested in Wall Street securities. Those funds are managed by Larry Fink's BlackRock, a spin-off of Steven Schwartzman's Blackstone Group. Management fees are, of course, paid to BlackRock. How nice is that?

The bill approved largely along party lines would prohibit abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy, with limited exceptions to save the life of the mother or in cases of rape or incest, so long as they have been reported to law enforcement.

The final vote was 228 to 196. Six Republicans voted against the measure, while as many Democrats voted for it.

The 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision allowed abortions until a fetus is viable outside the womb, generally considered to be at 24 weeks. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals last month struck down an Arizona law that also would have banned abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Other states with Republican-led legislatures have also pushed new abortion restrictions.

House Democrats protested the measure as unconstitutional and a new assault by the GOP on women’s reproductive rights in what they call a “war on women.”

The Democratic-controlled Senate is unlikely to take up the measure. The White House said advisors would recommend President Obama veto the bill if it were to pass, calling the legislation “a direct challenge to Roe vs. Wade” that “shows contempt for women’s health and rights, the role doctors play in their patients’ healthcare decisions, and the Constitution.”

Republican leaders, though, said it was needed legislation after a Philadelphia abortion doctor was convicted on three counts of first-degree murder for killing babies after they were delivered.

“After this Kermit Gosnell trial and some of the horrific acts that were going on, [the] vast majority of the American people believe in the substance of this bill, and so do I,” House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) told reporters Tuesday.

Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said the Gosnell case was a “red herring.” “What Dr. Gosnell did was murder, plain and simple,” he said. “And as horrible as everything Dr. Gosnell did was, it was murder, it was illegal, and it has nothing to do with what we’re discussing.”

The bill was amended last week to make an exception for pregnancy caused by rape or incest, after a hearing in which its sponsor, Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), sparked an uproar when he argued against such a provision, saying that “the incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low.”

Democrats tied the statement to one from Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin last year about what he called “legitimate rape,” which hurt the party’s image in a key swing constituency: moderate women.

“I just find it astonishing to hear a phrase repeated that the incidence of pregnancy from rape is low,” said Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-San Jose). “The idea that the Republican men on this committee think they can tell the women of America that they have to carry to term the product of a rape is outrageous.”

Democrats also said the exceptions added by Republicans still fell short, because they apply only when the rape or incest has been reported, and women often are reluctant to report the crimes.

“I thought we had established this last fall with the election. Americans are tired of Congress taking up extreme and divisive legislation targeted at women’s health,” Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) said at a news conference before the vote. “Many of our Republican colleagues don’t seem to have gotten that message.”

A recent Gallup poll found that Americans’ views on abortion had changed little after the Gosnell trial, with 78% saying it should be legal under certain circumstances, compared with 20% who said it should be illegal in all circumstances.

Republican leaders sought better public faces for the legislation Tuesday after Franks’ comments. Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) led an initial floor debate on a procedural motion tied to the bill. Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) took the lead for the party in the final floor debate, during which eight of the 11 Republican speakers were women. There are 19 Republican women in the House, none of whom serve on the Judiciary Committee that first considered the bill.

http://news.yahoo.com/nc-protests-split-bibles-message-help-poor-161430742.html,,[],NC protests split on Bible's message to help poor,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Over the last two months, hundreds of protesters have walked out of North Carolina's capitol in handcuffs to show their opposition to policies by the GOP-controlled Legislature.

While a broader coalition of supporters is building around the ""Moral Mondays"" started by the state chapter of the NAACP, the inspiration behind the protests is a throwback to the biblical message of civil rights leaders fighting segregation in the Jim Crow era.

They argue that cutting benefit programs and cutting tax breaks for low- and middle-income families violates Jesus Christ's teaching to care for those with the least. It's running into another school of Christian thought followed by many Southern conservatives: The best way to help the poor is through private charity, providing jobs and promoting self-reliance, rather than government programs.

The NAACP, and other groups that are joining them in larger numbers, oppose a range of Republican policies, from refusing to expand Medicaid to about 500,000 more people to restricting eligibility for the state's pre-kindergarten program. Republicans, who control both chambers of the Legislature for the first time in more than a century, have also cut unemployment benefits and abolished the earned-income tax credit, which serves low to middle-income people.

State bishops and church leaders from five major Christian denominations issued a statement supporting the NAACP's actions ahead of a clergy-led protest on Monday.

Robert Daniels, senior pastor at St. John's Missionary Baptist Church in Durham, said Monday that he chose to get arrested to let legislators know that disproportionately hurting the poor wouldn't go unnoticed by voters or God.

""I want them to know that justice will win,"" he said. ""God will show his hand that he's for the poor. It's only a matter of time.""

On Wednesday, eight more people were arrested outside the doors of the Senate chamber after being told to leave. Two were city council members from Durham and Rocky Mount. They were among 100 people who attended a rally to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the killing of national NAACP field secretary Medgar Evers.

Story continues

Matthew Wilson, a professor at Southern Methodist University who writes about the intersection of religion and politics, said differences in responses to poverty historically come down to denomination. Roman Catholics and black Protestants don't oppose public solutions, but Protestants of evangelical or Baptist leanings often do. And those denominations — heavily clustered in the South — emphasize personal responsibility, an individual relationship with God and work ethic, he said.

""A lot of studies show that evangelicals give more money to private anti-poverty groups than any others, so they do take very seriously the biblical imperatives to help the poor, but they differ in that they see the biblical imperative to help the poor as being an individual imperative as opposed to a collective social imperative,"" Wilson said.

Russell Moore, president of the Southern Baptist Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, said he sees Christians as similarly concerned with prosperity for all, but divided over how to bring it about.

""Obviously there will always be those who have no concern for the poor at all, and that's clearly forbidden by Scripture, but usually the differences we have are over unintended consequences,"" he said. ""And so Democrats and Republicans will disagree on what policy objectives will actually help the poor and what will put into place patterns that will, in the long-term, harm poor people.

The protests are dominating local news coverage and attracting national attention, but that doesn't mean they'll be immediately effective. Republicans maintain that they're doing exactly what the public wanted in electing them to veto-proof majorities and the protesters don't represent a clear majority. But the NAACP plans to continue its weekly protests indefinitely.

While some Republicans hesitate to apply biblical lessons to fiscal programs, that hasn't stopped a raft of legislation on private social behavior. In recent years, North Carolina lawmakers have pushed through a constitutional amendment for voters to ban gay marriage and new restrictions on abortion.

Rep. Ruth Samuelson, R-Mecklenburg and a long-practicing Christian, said social legislation as well as economic policy are inevitably driven by worldviews, and among people of faith those perspectives are influenced by their religious beliefs. She said she and her family act charitably in private, but she thinks the best economic policies rein in spending and create a better climate for businesses.

""If we're spending money on this thing, we're taking it from somewhere else, but we can't do it at the cost of the ability of the person paying for the taxes to still have enough to provide for their own families and to create that environment for jobs,"" she said.

To other Christians, the Bible calls for reforms that more directly address systems of inequality.

Miguel De La Torre, a professor of social ethics at Iliff School of Theology and an ordained Southern Baptist minister, said he sees the NAACP's efforts akin to the Occupy movement but with more of a moral current. The one-time Republican candidate for the Florida House of Representatives said the more evangelical strain of Protestantism is tied to the American ideal of individualism, which he believes misses a clear biblical call to address economic strife.

""Having faith without the work of changing the structures is meaningless, which is where I think the NAACP is opposed to the more dominant evangelical view of Christianity,"" he said.

The state NAACP chapter president, the Rev. William Barber, argues it's impossible to divorce a call for collective social justice from the Bible, given that most of it was written under systems of exploitation and Christ focused so heavily on uplifting the poor.

""The problem with (private initiative) is, if you see a kid floating down the river, you can run in and rescue that one child. But if you see a bunch more, you have to go up that river to see who's throwing them in,"" he said. ""If we didn't apply that moral critique we wouldn't have hospitals, public schools, universities, Medicaid, Medicare, unemployment (benefits), even labor laws."""

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']","Non-residents have no right to a state’s records, court rules","WASHINGTON — Americans do not have a right to obtain public records from states other than their own, the Supreme Court ruled Monday, dealing a setback to businesses and researchers who gather data across the nation.

The unanimous decision upheld laws in Virginia and a handful of other states that release some public records only to their own citizens.

“This is disappointing. We have a national information economy now, and all sorts of activities depend on data from all 50 states,” said Washington attorney Deepak Gupta, who represented two men who had challenged the “citizens only” provision of Virginia’s public records law.

Despite the ruling, Gupta said the trend has been for states to open their public records on an equal basis. Only two other states — Arkansas and Tennessee — decline to do so, he said. “It’s not realistic for states to wall off their public information,” he said.

Roger Hurlbert, a Northern California man who runs a business obtaining hard-to-find real estate records, sued to challenge Virginia’s law. He was joined by Mark McBurney, a Rhode Island man who wanted to know why the Virginia agency that enforces payments of child support had been slow in processing a payment from his former wife, who lived in Virginia.

They sued after their requests for documents were denied. They contended that Virginia’s preferential treatment for its own citizens violated their rights under the U.S. Constitution, which says: “The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.” They were joined by news media organizations and ethics watchdog groups that argued for free and easy access to public records.

In rejecting the claim, the high court said the Constitution does not require states to treat out-of-state residents as though they were state residents. The justices noted that states typically charge higher fees for out-of-staters who seek a license to hunt or fish or to enroll in a state university.

Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said the privileges and immunities of U.S. citizens refer to “fundamental” rights, not “incidental” matters like obtaining local real estate assessments. Virginia’s law is not unconstitutional “simply because it has the incidental effect of preventing citizens of other states from making a profit by trading on information obtained in state records,” he said in McBurney vs. Young.

Alito added that public records laws have a special purpose. They permit citizens to hold their government “accountable.” They also require state agencies to “foot the bill” for gathering and releasing requested records, he said. Since a state’s taxpayers are paying the bill, it is reasonable to limit the benefit to them as well, he said.

In reaction, Hurlbert said he would “abandon” doing business in Virginia. “I’ve been doing this for 40 years, and I’ve gotten around to most of the states,” he said. “I gather records — property taxes, assessments and the like — that others have difficulty getting.”

Along the way, he said, he has filed more than 50 lawsuits, most of them in state courts, seeking to open public records. “It’s gotten much better over the years,” he said. “But there are still a few restrictive laws out there.”

Pat Leahy (D-VT) is using the Republican National Committee (RNC) to bolster his attack on Republicans opposed to rushing through an unexamined comprehensive immigration reform package.

Leahy made the move in his letter berating Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions for joining all his Senate Judiciary Committee GOP colleagues except for the two who are members of the so-called “Gang of Eight” in calling for an open and transparent immigration reform process.

“I am encouraged by the recent recommendations in what is being called its ‘autopsy’ of the last election, in which the Republican National Committee wrote that your party ‘must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform,'” Leahy wrote to Sessions.

The full quote from the RNC “autopsy” report reads: “We are not a policy committee, but among the steps Republicans take in the Hispanic community and beyond, we must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform. If we do not, our Party’s appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only.”

Now that the RNC, which admits it is not a vehicle from which policy should be drafted, has taken to advocating a specific policy proposal, such advocacy is being used by Senate Democrats to drive a wedge between Republican lawmakers.

“I hope that you and other Republican Senators on the Committee will do so [support immigration reform],” Leahy chided Sessions. “I am encouraged that after two resounding presidential defeats, some Republican politicians are concerned enough about the growing Hispanic voting population that they are abandoning their former demagoguery and coming to the table.”

“I welcome Republicans to this effort,” Leahy continued. “I am glad that Senator McCain is once again interested in supporting comprehensive immigration reform. I still worry that too many congressional Republicans continue to oppose a straightforward pathway to citizenship, but that is a discussion we need to have out in the open, in front of the American people.”"

USA TODAY

Throngs make their way to the Lincoln Memorial for new March on Washington

Organizers see a key theme as unfinished business on racial equality

Mood is euphoric in contrast to 1963 event%2C when violence was feared

WASHINGTON — Fifty years after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. offered a transcendent vision of racial harmony for America's future with his ""I Have a Dream"" speech, tens of thousands gathered where he spoke Saturday to hear leaders tell them that while much has been attained, much remains unfinished.

""Dreams are for those who won't accept reality as it is, so they dream of what is not there and make it possible,"" the Rev. Al Sharpton, an event organizer, told the throngs that pulsated with enthusiasm — laughing, cheering, nodding and clapping.

Orators speaking from the steps where King stood outlined what they said were promises yet unfulfilled in preserving voting rights, quelling gun violence, reducing economic disparity and achieving equal protection under the law. Among the thousands were more women, more Hispanics and more people representing sexual diversity — and more tech-savvy — than their predecessors 50 years before.

Many said they felt an inspiring sense of unity while witnessing history. ""It's beautiful around here,"" said 17-year-old Margaret Foster, who attended with her mother, Tamilikia, from Lansing, Mich.

Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., the only surviving speaker from the original 1963 event, said the most brutal days of the civil rights struggle ""for the most part are gone."" But he said the struggle for a more perfect America goes on.

""We cannot give up. We cannot give out. And we cannot give in,"" Lewis said, urging that crucial elements of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that were struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court be placed back into law by Congress.

""The vote is precious. It's almost sacred,"" he said.

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, the first African American to hold that post, laid out a broader mandate for today's activists.

""Our focus has broadened to include the cause of women, of Latinos, of Asian Americans, of lesbians, of gays, of people with disabilities. And of countless others across this great country who still yearn for equality,"" Holder said. ""I know that in the 21st century we will see an America that is more perfect and more fair.""

A message of cross-generational common cause extended from 1963 as a recurring theme Saturday.

""Me and my generation cannot now afford to sit back consuming all of our blessings, getting dumb, fat and happy thinking we have achieved our freedoms,"" said Cory Booker, the 44-year-old mayor of Newark, N.J., and Democratic candidate for Senate.

The most raucous crowd response was reserved for Sharpton, especially when he rebuked a young, black, male culture that tends to embrace guns and violence.

""Don't disrespect your women. Make it clear that you know that Rosa Parks wasn't no 'ho,' and (voting rights activist) Fannie Lou Hamer wasn't no b----,"" Sharpton bellowed from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.

Alternatively, he chastised a society that he said leaves these young men without a moral compass. ""We need to give them dreams again, not to worry about sagging pants, but sagging morality,"" Sharpton said. ""If we told them who they could be and what they could do, they would pull up their pants and get to work.""

Keying on the fabled rhythm of King's ""I have a dream"" refrain, orators reveled in the repeated phrase, punctuating remarks with: ""It's movement time,"" ""Keep dreaming,"" ""Redeem the dream"" and ""We still have work to do.""

Sixteen-year-old Qion Nicholson's only knowledge of the original march was what he learned in school. Arriving by bus from Asbury Park, N.J., he said he now feels part of that history going forward.

""I'm grateful to be living in today's era,"" said Nicholson, of Sayreville. ""The (original) march meant so much for our country.""

Andrea Williams arrived at the event with what she described as a personal history of marching for labor rights. Today as a 34-year-old Army staff sergeant from Queens, N.Y., who has served four combat tours in Iraq, Williams said she felt fulfilled by all that she saw.

The daughter of a union organizer, Williams said she marched with her mother as a child.

""My mother instilled in me a sense of action, not just that you want to do something, but act on it,"" she said, her husband and 4-year-old at her side.

Organizers were planning for nearly 100,000 to attend Saturday. Minutes before key speeches began, buses were backed up still trying to the reach the site. The crowd was expanding east to the base of the Washington Monument. People stood a dozen deep along the length of the Reflecting Pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial where, their forebears cooled their feet in the stifling heat and humidity of the original event.

Weather on Saturday was cool and breezy. U.S. Park Police said there were few problems and only about dozen of those attended fell out from problems with the heat.

The many elderly were assisted down grassy slopes by younger marchers to places where tree shade and folding chairs were waiting. Mixing with Martin Luther King T-shirt salesmen were activists working the crowd with literature discussing racial profiling, ""stand-your-ground"" laws and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights.

Marchers streamed in shoulder to shoulder, clutching an array of signs promoting the march, jobs, the DREAM Act and protection of voting rights. Many posters bore the face of slain black teenager Trayvon Martin.

Organizers kept iron-fisted limits on dozens of early speakers to two minutes, cutting microphone feeds if someone went too long. People booed when Julian Bond was shut down in midsentence.

Among arrivals watching the event was Lillian Reynolds, a minister and social worker from Mount Vernon, N.Y., who said she was there because of goals still unmet.

Literacy rates remain too low and black unemployment too high, she said, moving through tight security for a place to see her son, gospel hip-hop artist JProphet, perform. ""Trying to get there and not miss it,"" Reynolds said.

Two adult sisters attending Saturday's march echoed the view that racial unity is still a far-off dream in America. Marjorie Francis, 36, of Jackson, N.J., lamented the growth in voter identification laws across the country.

""It's a solution to a problem that didn't exist,"" she said. Said her sister, Maureen Francis, 39, of Monroe N.J., ""you always have to be fighting for freedom.""

Riding the bus from Asbury was William Griffin, 88, who also attended the original march, elbowing his way through the crowd to hear King speak.

""At the time,"" he said, ""you wondered whether it was going to do any good, whether it was going to have any results.""

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/15/Obama-Constitution-flashback,2013-11-15 00:00:00,['Ben Shapiro'],FLASHBACK: Obama: 'I Actually Respect The Constitution',"In 2007, then-Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) attended a fundraiser where he blasted President Bush, telling the crowd, “I was a constitutional law professor, which means unlike the current president I actually respect the Constitution.” President Obama, however, has been far less respectful of the Constitution that Senator Obama purportedly was. In fact, Obama has steadily violated a bevy of Constitutional provisions ranging from separation of powers to specific elements of the Bill of Rights and subsequent amendments.

This week, Obama unilaterally decided to tell insurance companies that they could now allow sale of plans in the individual insurance market that Obamacare had prevented, forcing five million Americans off the health plans they liked. As Ken Klukowski of Breitbart News has written, this is a violation of the Constitutional separation of powers:

Obama’s announcement is a flagrant and undeniable violation of his constitutional duty under the Take Care Clause. The provisions of Obamacare causing enormous trouble for insurance plans are mandatory, and only Congress can change those parts of the Affordable Care Act.

But President Obama has a history of violating the Constitutional balance of powers. As Kimberly Strassel of the Wall Street Journal has noted, he has unilaterally suspended enforcement of immigration law; he has refused to prosecute drug law violators; he simply stopped defending federal laws he didn’t like, like the Defense of Marriage Act, in court; he issues waivers on Obamacare and the No Child Left Behind Act; Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency has attempted to regulate carbon emissions when Congress didn’t push through a global warming bill; he appointed members of the National Labor Relations Board in violation of law; his administration rammed through an auto bailout that screwed bondholders, as well as a slush fund from British Petroleum. Strassel writes, “Mr. Obama came to office promising to deliver a new kind of politics. He did–his own, unilateral governance.”

President Obama’s respect for the Constitution does not extend to freedom of religion – his administration has forced religious businessowners to pay for insurance plans that cover activities in violation of religious precepts. It does not extend to freedom of speech – Obama has condemned exercises of speech he doesn’t like as violative of American principles (see, for example, the infamous YouTube video Obama said caused violence in the Middle East). It does not extend to equal protection under the laws – Obama has personally intervened in criminal cases like that of George Zimmerman.

Obama’s respect for the Constitution does not apply to protections against unreasonable search and seizure, as Obama’s deeply intrusive National Security Agency programs prove. It does not apply to Fifth Amendment protections against taking of private property. It does not apply to the Second Amendment, as Obama’s executive orders on guns show. And it most certainly does not extend to the Tenth Amendment, which protects states’ rights.

Obama has never respected the Constitution. In fact, he sees it as a barrier to his ambitions. That’s why, as a senior law lecturer at the University of Chicago, he lamented the fact that the Warren Court “never ventured into the issues of redistribution of wealth, and of more basic issues such as political and economic justice in society.” That’s why Obama repeatedly emphasizes that the Constitution stops him from doing things he wants to do — it’s an obstacle to be overcome, not the greatest governmental structure ever created.

The court ruled that the law, which in effect sought to bully undocumented immigrants into leaving the state, was an unconstitutional intrusion by a state government into an arena — immigration policy — that is the responsibility of the federal government.

But apparently the high court’s decision has done little to diminish support for such laws in Hazleton, Pa., and Farmers Branch, Texas, where officials have spent millions defiantly defending local housing ordinances intended to regulate immigration.

In Hazleton’s case, the city adopted an ordinance in 2006 that would have turned landlords into criminals if they rented to immigrants lacking legal status. Two courts, including the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, have struck down the measure, finding it both discriminatory and an infringement on the federal government’s sole authority over immigration.

And an en banc review by the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals found that the Farmers Branch law, which required city officials to deny “occupancy licenses” to renters if it was found they were in the country illegally, similarly interfered with the federal government’s authority.

Now both cities are asking the Supreme Court to review the lower-court decisions that invalidated their ordinances. Supporters argue that these laws regulate housing, not immigration, and therefore do not interfere with federal authority. They cite a Nebraska law allowing such housing restrictions that was upheld this year by a circuit court.

That argument is specious. Laws that punish immigrants who are in the country illegally for trying to find a place to live, or that require landlords to check the immigration status of prospective tenants, or that mandate that renters register with the city and provide proof of their legal status, are clearly intended to regulate immigration. In fact, these laws rely on the same “attrition by enforcement” strategy that Arizona employed when it tried to force immigrants out of the state by making their day-to-day lives so harsh that they would self-deport.

Local regulations certainly can and do interfere with the federal government’s authority. As District Judge James Munley wrote in 2007, when he struck down Hazleton’s ordinance, it “is difficult to conceive of a more effective method of ensuring that persons do not enter or remain in a locality than by precluding their ability to live in a place.” If the federal government is to have authority over who stays and who is deported, it must have that power in every state and city.

The Supreme Court should deny both cities’ requests for review, and in so doing remind local officials that immigration reform is Congress’ job — if only lawmakers would step up and do it."

Lawmakers from both parties and across the political spectrum found common ground and passed, by a near-unanimous vote, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which firmly commits the federal government to protecting and promoting our “inalienable right” to freely exercise religion. As President Clinton remarked when he signed the legislation into law, “the power of God is such that even in the legislative process, miracles can happen.”

Last week, the Supreme Court agreed to hear two cases that are testing the strength of this commitment. The arguments and decisions in the Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood lawsuits will say a lot about the health, and the future, of what Clinton called our “first freedom.”

These cases involve religious liberty challenges by two family businesses to the rule in the Affordable Care Act requiring employers to provide insurance coverage for contraception and some drugs that many believe can cause abortions.

YEAR IN REVIEW: Washington’s 5 biggest ‘fails’ of 2013

The Green family has not confined its Christian beliefs to Sunday worship, and has instead expressed them through the operation of its Hobby Lobby stores for nearly 40 years. Similarly, the Hahn family’s Mennonite faith has animated and sustained its woodworking business for generations.

Like millions of religious believers and groups, these challengers reject the idea that religious faith and religious freedom are simply about what we believe and how we pray, and not also about how we live, act and work. At the heart of these two cases is the straightforward argument that federal law does not require us to “check our faith at the door” when we pursue vocations in business and commerce.

There should be no question about the sincerity of the religious beliefs at issue. These are not cases where the profit-focused managers of publicly traded mega-companies are cynically trying to save a few bucks or to gain a competitive edge.

As many would-be Sunday shoppers know, the Green family “walks the walk.” Signs on Hobby Lobby stores’ doors say that they close on Sundays “to allow employees time for worship and to spend time with their families.” Their stores do not carry shot glasses, lewd greeting cards or vulgar posters, and the background music is Christian. Hobby Lobby contributes generously to charities and starts full-time employees at nearly double the minimum wage. When the Greens and Hobby Lobby do this, and many other things, they are living out their faith and exercising their religion.

Hobby Lobby also provides excellent health insurance, which includes coverage for most — but not all — contraceptives. However, because of the Greens’ firm belief in the dignity of human life and about when and how it begins, Hobby Lobby cannot provide coverage for some of the required drugs because they could cause an abortion.

The government and others argue that the Greens’ religious beliefs are irrelevant because they’ve freely chosen to enter the rough-and-tumble world of commerce and that, in any event, the exercise of religion is for individuals, not corporations. But Hobby Lobby’s lawyers at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty will be on solid ground when they explain to the court that both of these arguments are misguided.

The issue is not whether groups, associations and corporations have religious freedom rights under federal law. Of course they do. After all, religious hospitals, schools, social service agencies and churches are not “individuals,” but it would be bizarre to say that they don’t exercise religion.

And the question should not be whether legal protections for religious liberty stop at the sanctuary door or evaporate when a person is trying to make a living or a business is aiming to make a profit. At a time when we talk a lot about corporate responsibility and worry about the feeble influence of ethics and values on Wall Street decision-making, it would be strange if the law were to welcome sermonizing from Starbucks on the government shutdown but tell the Greens and Hobby Lobby to focus strictly on the bottom line.

The Religious Freedom Restoration Act reaffirmed an idea that is deeply rooted in America’s history and traditions — namely, that politics and policy should respect and, whenever possible, make room for religious commitments and conscientious objections. True, religious liberty is not absolute, and, in a pluralistic society like ours, not all requests for exemptions and accommodations can, or should, be granted. Some religious liberty lawsuits will, and should, fail, but not simply because they involve what happens at work on Monday and not what happens in services on the Sabbath.

What Clinton said when he signed the act into law is worth remembering today: “Let us never believe that the freedom of religion imposes on any of us some responsibility to run from our convictions.” He challenged us instead to “bring our values back to the table of American discourse to heal our troubled land.” The Greens and Hobby Lobby, by refusing to check their faith at the marketplace door, are doing just that.

Michael Brown%2C who is black%2C says his party of 25 was left waiting two hours

Brown says shift manager told the group there was a %22situation%22 and refused seating

Restaurant offered apology%2C free meals%2C but Brown says he is not satisfied

A black South Carolina man says a restaurant in North Charleston refused to seat his party of 25 family and friends and asked the group to leave after a white customer complained of feeling threatened, according to reports.

The man, Michael Brown, also known as Mike London, could not be reached but his Facebook post in which he gave details of this experience indicates the group waited two hours to be seated at the Wild Wing Cafe before a manager approached and later refused to seat the group.

The chief marketing officer for the chain of restaurants based in Mount Pleasant, S.C., said the manager involved in the alleged incident is on leave until an investigation can be completed. She confirmed the group had been offered an apology and meals all around and said the restaurant has a meeting planned for later this week with some members of the restaurant party.

""It's not an us vs. them — we really join them in their concern,"" said the chief marketing officer, Debra Stokes. ""We have a zero tolerance of any kind. We have a diverse collection of individuals within our organization. We have always prided ourselves on inviting everyone into our restaurants.""

Michael Brown's Facebook post has attracted the attention of news media in this country and overseas and the post had been shared about 3,000 times as of Monday evening.

Brown and his group arrived at the Wild Wing Cafe to celebrate his cousin's last day in Charleston, according to the Daily Mail. The group waited ""patiently"" before being told a white customer was ""threatened by us,"" Brown wrote in his Facebook post.

Wrote Brown on Thursday on Facebook, ""The manager looked me dead in the face and said she was refusing us service because she had a right to and simply she felt like it.""

Brown told WCSC TV in Charleston that the shift manager told the group there was a ""situation.""

""She said, 'There's a situation where one of our customers feels threatened by your party, so she asked us not to seat you in our (sic) section,' which totally alarmed all of us because we're sitting there peaceably for two hours,"" Brown told the news organization. ""Obviously, if we were causing any conflict, we would have been ejected out of the place hours before.""

At that point, Brown said, someone in his group began to videotape the conversation. The manager became upset and refused to seat the group, Brown told WCSC.

""I said, 'So, you're telling me I have to leave?' She said, 'I have a right to deny you service.' I said, 'So you're asking me to leave because you're upset because he was recording you, after we've waited for two hours, and after you've already pretty much discriminated on us?' And she answered, 'Yes.' ""

Stokes told WCSC that she had a ""really good conversation"" with Brown about the incident.

""He and many of his family and friends were there about a month ago, and they are regular customers of ours,"" she said. ""They were having a going-away party and they just didn't receive the experience that they have come to know and love.""

Brown said the restaurant's apology and offer of free meals are not good enough.

""This is not a situation where you can just give us a free meal and everything is OK,"" he told the news organization. ""It goes deeper than that."""

Civil rights organizations filed a complaint against 5th Circuit Judge Edith Jones this week for remarks they say she made at a February speech to the Federalist Society at the University of Pennsylvania Law School about racial bias in death row sentencing.

The groups say the comments are prejudiced and call into question Jones' ability to be an impartial and fair judge.

Jones' law office in Houston said the judge declines to comment on the case.

According to several people present who signed affidavits for the complaint, Jones said:

“[S]adly some groups seem to commit more heinous crimes than others.” When asked to explain her remarks, she stated that there was “no arguing” that “Blacks and Hispanics” outnumber “Anglos” on death row and “sadly” it was a “statistical fact” that people “from these racial groups get involved in more violent crime.” By way of example, she asserted as a “fact” that “a lot of Hispanic people [are] involved in drug trafficking,” which itself “involved a lot of violent crime.”

The judge said ""certain racial groups"" are ""prone"" to violence, according to the complaint. Jones, a Reagan appointee, also defended the use of the death penalty because “a killer is only likely to make peace with God and the victim’s family in that moment when the killer faces imminent execution, recognizing that he or she is about to face God’s judgment,” according to the complaint.

No transcript or recording exists of the speech, according to the Federalist Society.

The 5th Circuit's chief judge, Carl E. Stewart, will decide whether to dismiss or pursue the complaint, according to The New York Times.

The law school's Federalist Society says Jones' remarks are being misconstrued. ""Rest assured the Federalist Society does not host or harbor racist speakers,"" Penn's Federalist Society posted in a brief statement on its Facebook page. ""We're disappointed that constructive dialogue about federal habeas relief is being misrepresented like this."" (Federal habeas relief refers to the appeals process for prisoners.) The group did not return a request for further comment.

Story continues

The issue of racial bias in sentencing made headlines in Texas in 2000 when Texas' then-Attorney General John Cornyn identified five cases in which he thought the race of a defendant was used improperly in testimony. Jones joined her colleagues on the 5th Circuit in rejecting the stay execution request of one of these prisoners, Duane Buck, in 2011. Buck argued that his sentence should be thrown out since an expert witness psychologist, Walter Quijano, suggested during his trail that Buck's race could make him more likely to commit another crime in the future.

Jones, who was believed to be on President George H.W. Bush's short list for the Supreme Court, has been an outspoken critic of the Supreme Court and judges who do not adhere to a constructionist view of the law.

In 2001, she told University of Texas law students that people who suspect they are fired because of racial bias or their gender should ""take a better second job instead of bringing suit"" because they were almost always wrong about the cause of their firing.

Jones also criticized the Supreme Court for allowing pornography and for decriminalizing the use of profanity in public places in a 2005 interview with The American Enterprise."
"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-court-prop8-20130301,0,7758627.story",2013-02-28 08:00:00,"['David G. Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since', 'Christi Parsons Was The Los Angeles Times', 'White House Correspondent']",White House asks justices to reject Prop. 8,"WASHINGTON — The Obama administration has urged the Supreme Court to strike down California’s voter-passed law barring same-sex marriage, arguing for the first time that the Constitution protects an equal right to marry for gays and lesbians.

“Tradition, no matter how long established, cannot by itself justify a discriminatory law,” the administration said in a brief filed with the high court late Thursday. “Prejudice may not be the basis for differential treatment under the law.”

The administration’s legal argument also would apply in at least seven other states that already have granted same-sex couples nearly all the rights of marriage through civil unions. To give those rights while withholding the status of marriage would amount to discrimination based on a person’s sexual orientation, and that cannot be justified under the Constitution, the brief says.

“The designation of marriage,” the brief notes, “conveys a message to society that domestic partnerships or civil unions cannot match.”

Presenting the argument in that manner struck a legal middle ground — giving the justices a way to overturn California’s Proposition 8 without upsetting the laws in all states that ban same-sex marriage. Gay rights advocates have asked the court to strike down all laws nationwide that bar same-sex couples from marrying, but many legal analysts have doubted that a majority of the justices would go that far.

The seven other states directly affected would be Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon and Rhode Island, the brief says.

In addition, the government argued, laws that discriminate based on sexual orientation should be treated skeptically by the courts, much as laws that discriminate by gender. That standard, if adopted, ultimately could invalidate other states’ laws against same-sex marriage.

The administration was not required to get involved in the California case, but the White House was heavily lobbied by gay rights groups that have orchestrated a series of briefs on their side by business leaders, prominent Republicans and other groups. Although the government’s brief did not go as far as gay rights advocates would have liked, it won immediate praise from those organizations.

Unlike most other outside groups, the views of the solicitor general’s office often have particular weight with the justices, although the court could decide the case on several other grounds.

The decision to file a brief, which came after several weeks of hesitation and internal debate, marks the latest step in President Obama’s self-described evolution on the issue of same-sex marriage. When he ran for president in 2008, he did not support marriage rights for gays and lesbians, although he also opposed Proposition 8, which California voters approved that year.

Last spring, as he was running for reelection, Obama said he supported gay marriage but believed the issue was a matter for the states to decide. At the time, some close to him suggested he would not weigh in officially on a constitutional right to marry.

But in January, gay rights activists took heart when, in his inaugural address, Obama compared their struggle to the civil rights and women’s movements.

“We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths — that all of us are created equal — is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls, and Selma, and Stonewall,” Obama said in that address, putting on the same plane key moments in fighting discrimination based on gender, race and sexual orientation.

Since then, Obama had appeared at times to be debating with himself. He referred to same-sex marriage as an issue of civil rights, but also told people in his inner circle that he thought social change was better when it took place through elections, not by court decree.

In conversations, he talked about the writings of civil rights leaders who had struggled with how and when to let courts drive societal change. On Wednesday, Obama seemed to be resolving that inner battle as he paid tribute to civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks at a ceremony in her honor.

“Whether out of inertia or selfishness, whether out of fear or a simple lack of moral imagination, we so often spend our lives as if in a fog, accepting injustice, rationalizing inequity, tolerating the intolerable,” he said.

“Rosa Parks tell us there’s always something we can do,” he went on. “She tells us that we all have responsibilities, to ourselves and to one another.”

In a statement Thursday, Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. also put the marriage case in the context of the country’s civil rights tradition. “Throughout history, we have seen the unjust consequences of decisions and policies rooted in discrimination,” he said. “The issues before the Supreme Court are not just important to the tens of thousands of Americans who are being denied equal benefits and rights under our laws, but to our nation as a whole.”

Publicly, White House officials took pains to present the decision of whether to weigh in on the marriage case as one made at the Justice Department.

“The president obviously has expressed an opinion in the past on this issue as a matter of policy, but when it comes to legal and constitutional issues around it, that’s a jurisdiction that resides at the Department of Justice,” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said.

Privately, however, senior administration officials made clear that on such a weighty policy issue, the government’s lawyers would wait for the president’s decision.

The case before the court will be the first to directly confront the justices with the question of whether the U.S. Constitution gives gays and lesbians a right to marry.

Judges in several states have upheld gay marriage under their state constitutions, and the California Supreme Court did the same in 2008. Proposition 8 overturned that ruling by changing the state constitution.

The case before the high court began shortly afterward when two same-sex couples sued in federal court in San Francisco, arguing that excluding them from marrying violated their rights to liberty and equal treatment.

A federal judge agreed and struck down Proposition 8. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision, but did so on the narrower basis that the voters could not take marriage rights from gays and lesbians once those rights had been granted.

In December, the Supreme Court voted to hear an appeal from defenders of Proposition 8, who say the courts should defer to the wishes of the state’s voters.

California’s top officials, including Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris, have joined the case on the side of the gay plaintiffs. In a brief filed this week, Harris noted that more than 50,000 children in California are being raised by same-sex couples.

“California’s interests in protecting all of its children are best served by allowing these same-sex couples to enjoy the same benefits of marriage as opposite-sex couples,” Harris said.

The case will be argued before the court on March 26.

Smoke rises as water is sprayed at the burning remains of a fertilizer plant in the town of West, Texas

Gov. Rick Perry on Thursday declared McLennan County - home to West, the small community rocked by the deadly fertilizer plant explosion - a disaster area and announced that he's asking President Barack Obama for a federal emergency declaration as well.

That's not an unreasonable request, and the victims of the fire and the residents of West deserve it. (Even if West Fertilizer Co should ultimately pay the costs for gross negligence.)

Still, it's curious seeing Perry run to the feds after hearing his secessionist rhetoric because of the ""oppressive"" federal government. And he's joined in the hall of hypocrisy by the rest of the area's federal delegation.



U.S. Rep. Bill Flores, whose district includes West, called on all Americans to pray for the victims of this tragedy [...] ""I am grateful for all of the police, fire, emergency responders and volunteers from our community and around the state who have come to aid those in need,"" he said. ""Our offices will continue to monitor the aftermath and be on hand to assist our friends and neighbors throughout the recovery process.""

""It was too large,"" Flores said about the latest bill Wednesday. “It does more than meet the immediate needs of Sandy victims."" Flores, whose district includes Waco, said he could have supported an earlier version of the bill with $17 billion in aid if it had been offset by federal spending reductions.

U.S. Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz of Texas released a joint statement saying they are among those grieving for those who were injured or lost loved ones in the blast. ""(We) are grateful to the firefighters and first responders who risked their own lives to keep others safe,"" they said. ""We ask all Texans to keep West in their thoughts and prayers. We remain in communication with Gov. Perry's office and emergency management officials, and stand to offer whatever support we can.""

How does Flores plan on assisting? By asking for federal aid presumably (his prayers won't accomplish anything tangible), the same kind of federal aid he voted against for Sandy victims.Then there are the two Texas senators:Both Cornyn and Cruz voted against Sandy aid as well, of course. What kind of aid do they think they are proposing for West? Aside from their prayers, that is.

Again, the federal government will and should absolutely lend resources to the town's recovery. But perhaps the state's politicians should be less hostile toward similar aid to other parts of the country. Otherwise, the people of West and their neighbors should reconsider reelecting people like Flores with 80 percent of the vote.

Either we're all in this together, or we're not.

Sign petition asking Texas elected officials to embrace disaster relief, whether it happens in their backyard or not."

USA TODAY

Measure would restrict abortions to the first 20 weeks after conception

The White House has released a veto threat

The bill has little chance of passing the Senate

WASHINGTON — The Republican-led House of Representatives approved a far-reaching bill to ban a woman's ability to seek an abortion after 20 weeks on a mostly party-line 228-196 vote Tuesday.

It stands no chance of becoming law under the Obama administration. The White House issued a veto threat Monday, calling the bill an ""assault on a woman's right to choose."" The Democratic Senate also has not scheduled a vote on the legislation.

However, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, justified the vote as a response to the recent murder conviction of Philadelphia physician Kermit Gosnell for abortion procedures conducted in his medical clinic. ""Listen, after this Kermit Gosnell trial and some of the horrific acts that were going on, the vast majority of the American people believe in the substance of this bill, and so do I,"" Boehner said.

The bill included an exemption for women who get pregnant through rape or incest as long as they first report the sexual assault to legal authorities. It was added at the last minute by House Republican leaders after a broader Democratic amendment to add the exemption was defeated in the House Judiciary Committee last week. ""It shows a distrust of women and a lack of the reality of sexual assaults,"" said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., regarding the legal conditions placed on the exemption.

The legislation stirred a heated debate in the House. The majority of Democrats opposed the legislation and argued that House Republicans— 88% of whom are white males —were out of touch with women.

Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., the sponsor of the bill and a long-time abortion rights opponent, was a target of criticism last week when he commented in a June 12 committee hearing on the bill that the ""incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy (is) very low."" He later said he meant that third-trimester abortions of pregnancies caused by rape are rare.

Republicans tapped a woman, Rep. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, to moderate the House floor debate, although she does not serve on the Judiciary Committee that has jurisdiction over the legislation. There are no Republican women on that panel. Another Republican woman, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, presided over the debate. Democrats also tapped a female lawmaker, Judiciary Committee member Lofgren, to lead the debate for their party.

""This is an area that has overwhelming public support,"" Blackburn said. ""This is a step that needs to be taken to protect life.""

The debate invigorated outside groups and activists on both sides of the abortion debate. Penny Nance, president of Concerned Women for America, called it ""the most important pro-life bill to be considered by the U.S. Congress in the last 10 years"" and expressed confidence that it would eventually become law. NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue called the bill ""shameless politics"" and accused abortion opponents in Congress of ""catering to the most extreme wing of their political base.""

Most states allow abortions up to the point when the fetus becomes viable, generally considered to be about 24 weeks of pregnancy. Franks' bill would ban abortions that take place 20 weeks after conception, which is equivalent to 22 weeks of pregnancy.

Ten states have passed laws similar to the House bill, and several are facing court challenges. Last month, a federal court struck down as unconstitutional Arizona's law, which differs slightly in banning abortion 20 weeks after pregnancy rather than conception.

According to the Guttmacher Institute, a New York-based reproductive health research organization that supports abortion rights, in 2009 1.3% of the 1.2 million abortions in the country, about 15,600, occurred 20 weeks after the fetus was conceived.

President Obama delivered the commencement address at the Atlanta school

Obama called on graduates of the historically black college to be role models

Says African Americans must have empathy for other minority groups%27 struggles

President Obama on Sunday told the graduating class at Morehouse College, the country's pre-eminent historically black college, there is ""no time for excuses"" for this generation of African-American men and that it was time for their generation to step up professionally and in their personal lives.





Obama, the country's first African-American president, chose a particularly poignant moment to deliver the commencement address at the Atlanta college that boasts civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., filmmaker Spike Lee and Atlanta's first African-American mayor, Maynard Jackson, among its alumni.

Obama's visit comes nearly 50 years after King led the March on Washington, and 150 years after Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation.

The president connected his own path to the White House to the work of King and other African-American leaders of that generation. But Obama also conceded that at times as a young man he wrongly blamed his own failings ""as just another example of the world trying to keep a black man down.""

""We've got no time for excuses — not because the bitter legacies of slavery and segregation have vanished entirely; they haven't,"" Obama told the graduating class and their families who sat through intermittent rain and thunder. ""It's just that in today's hyperconnected, hypercompetitive world, with a billion young people from China and India and Brazil entering the global workforce alongside you, nobody is going to give you anything you haven't earned.""

Obama spoke in very personal terms to the 500 young men as he urged them to not only become leaders in their community, but also good fathers and good husbands. Obama, who was raised by a single mother and grandparents, lamented the absence of his father in his life and urged the graduates to make family their top priority.

Obama told the Morehouse men they are also obliged to set an example for other black men.

""Keep setting an example for what it means to be a man,"" Obama said. ""Be the best husband to your wife, or boyfriend to your partner, or father to your children that you can be. Because nothing is more important.""

In the weeks ahead of the commencement, a spat between the college administration and alumni over the role a Philadelphia pastor would play during graduation weekend threatened to cast a shadow on the president's historic visit.

Morehouse President John Silvanus Wilson and a group of alumni sparred after Wilson invited alumnus Kevin Johnson to deliver the baccalaureate sermon only to later to diminish his role.

Wilson, a former adviser in the Obama administration, told Johnson he was changing the ceremony to a multispeaker format after Johnson wrote an op-ed in a Philadelphia newspaper criticizing the president for appointing too few African Americans to senior Cabinet positions.

A dozen prominent alumni spoke out against the decision, and Johnson initially refused to take part in the baccalaureate under a multispeaker format.

But last week, Wilson and Johnson came to a resolution and Johnson delivered the baccalaureate sermon, while two recent alumni were given lesser speaking roles.

The college was also shaken by news earlier this month that four Morehouse students were charged with sexual assault in which two women from nearby Spelman College were the alleged victims.

In his speech, Obama also connected the discrimination that African Americans have faced with some of the struggles of minority groups — including gays and lesbians fighting for the right to marriage, Hispanic Americans battling anti-immigrant bias and Muslims who face suspicion because of their faith.

Having a personal understanding of discrimination, Obama said, this generation of African Americans is uniquely equipped to be leaders for the country and world on these issues.

""If you tap into that experience, it should endow you with empathy — the understanding of what it's like to walk in somebody else's shoes,"" Obama said. ""It should give you an ability to connect. It should give you a sense of what it means to overcome barriers."""
http://news.yahoo.com/ward-churchill-finally-aces-075033160.html,,[],Ward Churchill is finally all out of aces,"You remember Ward Churchill — he’s the former University of Colorado ethnic studies professor who claimed that the United States deserved the September 11, 2001 attacks because of “ongoing genocidal American imperialism.”

Well, he’s been fighting a losing battle to get his job back ever since he was eventually fired for (unrelated) plagiarism and fabricated research.

On Monday, the United States Supreme Court rejected Churchill’s appeal without comment.

Officials at the University of Colorado and David Lane, Churchill’s attorney, both told the Daily Camera that the Supreme Court’s decision effectively exhausts Churchill’s legal options.

In a joint statement, CU President Bruce Benson and Boulder campus Chancellor Phil DiStefano said that the Supreme Court upheld a “unanimous line of rulings from the Colorado courts.”

“This decision is a victory for the thousands of men and women on our faculty who live up to that obligation and for the students who benefit from their professionalism,” the administrators wrote.

Lane was substantially less effusive.

“It’s disappointing from the perspective that the First Amendment has suffered as a result of this,” the attorney told the Daily Camera. “I am sorry that the regents have been given the green light to violate the Constitution any time they feel a need.”

Intriguingly, Lane also mentioned that the former ethnic studies professor has found work lecturing in Atlanta, but provided no further details.

Churchill faced national criticism after an obscure 2001 essay called “On the Justice of Roosting Chickens” found its way into the national mainstream. In the inflammatory essay, Churchill described the people who worked in the World Trade Center as a “technocratic corps” of “little Eichmanns.” (The a reference is to Adolf Eichmann, a Nazi who played a big role in organizing the Holocaust.)

Story continues

Administrators at CU-Boulder, where Churchill taught, concluded that Churchill’s essay was protected under the First Amendment, and so the school would have to keep the tenured professor employed.

However, it was all downhill from there for Churchill’s career. In 2007, CU found a reason to fire him: allegations of academic fraud and plagiarism in other writings unrelated to the provocative “little Eichmanns” essay.

Churchill won a free-speech lawsuit against CU-Boulder in 2009, as the Daily Camera notes. It wasn’t much of a win, though. The jury awarded him a single, solitary dollar in damages and the judge refused to reinstate him as a professor.

Colorado’s state supreme court denied Churchill’s appeal in September 2012.

From the beginning, the balance of power in the relationship was a sufficiently touchy issue that at Ms. Woolner's urging, a few months before their wedding in August 2001, they joined a series of workshops on cross-class relationships.

""I had abject terror at the idea of the group,"" said Mr. Croteau, who is blunt and intellectually engaging. ""It's certainly an upper-class luxury to pay to tell someone your troubles, and with all the problems in the world, it felt a little strange to sit around talking about your relationship. But it was useful. It was a relief to hear people talk about the same kinds of issues we were facing, about who had power in the relationship and how they used it. I think we would have made it anyway, but we would have had a rockier time without the group.""

It is still accepted truth within the household that Ms. Woolner's status has given her the upper hand in the marriage. At dinner one night, when her son Isaac said baldly, ""I always think of my mom as having the power in the relationship,"" Mr. Croteau did not flinch. He is fully aware that in this relationship he is the one whose life has been most changed.

Confusing Differences

The Woolner-Croteau household is just up the hill from the groomed fields of Northfield Mount Hermon prep school -- a constant local reminder to Mr. Croteau of just how differently his wife's sons and his daughters have been educated. Jonah is now a senior there. Isaac, who also attended the school, is now back at Lewis & Clark College in Oregon after taking a couple of semesters away to study in India and to attend massage school while working in a deli near home.

By contrast, Mr. Croteau's adult daughters -- who have never lived with the couple -- made their way through the Keene public schools.

""I sometimes think Jonah and Isaac need a dose of reality, that a couple years in public school would have shown them something different,"" Mr. Croteau said. ""On the other hand I sometimes wish I'd been able to give Maggie and Lael what they had. My kids didn't have the same kind of privilege and the same kind of schools. They didn't have teachers concerned about their tender growing egos. It was catch-as-catch-can for them, and that still shows in their personalities."""

You're an average voter in Pennsylvania. The night before Election Day, your wallet goes missing, leaving you without immediate access to any of the identification you'll need to vote at your local precinct the following morning. This would be a problem under <a href=""http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/elections/voter-id.aspx#PA"" target=""_hplink"">Pennsylvania's proposed photo ID law</a>, since <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pennsylvania-voter-id-ruling_n_1919187"" target=""_hplink"">blocked by a state judge</a>. While many people in this situation may have backup forms of identification, <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pennsylvania-voter-id-law_n_1652469"" target=""_hplink"">studies have shown</a> that a significant percentage of would-be voters don't. The state's safeguard against the immediate disenfranchisement of people in this situation would be a provisional ballot cast on the day of the election. But this doesn't mean your vote counts, yet. Anyone who casts a provisional ballot is required to ""appear in person at the county board of elections"" within six days of the vote to provide proof that their ballot was valid. If you're able to take time away from your job to do this, the process still requires a would-be voter to either show up with valid ID -- a replacement driver's license <a href=""http://www.dmv.state.pa.us/fees/index.shtml"" target=""_hplink"">would cost $36</a> and considerable time -- or to sign an affirmation that you are indigent and not able to afford the fees associated with acquiring a photo ID. Even if you make a rapid and somewhat expensive turnaround to get a replacement ID -- or alternatively swear under oath that you are too poor to pay for such a document -- there is no guarantee that your vote will end up counting. Many elections are largely decided before provisional voters have a chance to verify their validity, which could serve to discouraging them from following up with election officials or leave them effectively disenfranchised. In 2008, <a href=""http://www.eac.gov/assets/1/Documents/2008 Election Administration and Voting Survey EAVS Report.pdf"" target=""_hplink"">only 61.8 percent</a> of all provisional ballots cast were fully counted.

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/magazine/laura-poitras-snowden.html,2013-08-18 00:00:00,['Peter Maass'],How Laura Poitras Helped Snowden Spill His Secrets,"Amid the chaos, Poitras, an intense-looking woman of 49, sat in a spare bedroom or at the table in the living room, working in concentrated silence in front of her multiple computers. Once in a while she would walk over to the porch to talk with Greenwald about the article he was working on, or he would sometimes stop what he was doing to look at the latest version of a new video she was editing about Snowden. They would talk intensely — Greenwald far louder and more rapid-fire than Poitras — and occasionally break out laughing at some shared joke or absurd memory. The Snowden story, they both said, was a battle they were waging together, a fight against powers of surveillance that they both believe are a threat to fundamental American liberties.

Two reporters for The Guardian were in town to assist Greenwald, so some of our time was spent in the hotel where they were staying along Copacabana Beach, the toned Brazilians playing volleyball in the sand below lending the whole thing an added layer of surreality. Poitras has shared the byline on some of Greenwald’s articles, but for the most part she has preferred to stay in the background, letting him do the writing and talking. As a result, Greenwald is the one hailed as either a fearless defender of individual rights or a nefarious traitor, depending on your perspective. “I keep calling her the Keyser Soze of the story, because she’s at once completely invisible and yet ubiquitous,” Greenwald said, referring to the character in “The Usual Suspects” played by Kevin Spacey, a mastermind masquerading as a nobody. “She’s been at the center of all of this, and yet no one knows anything about her.”

As dusk fell one evening, I followed Poitras and Greenwald to the newsroom of O Globo, one of the largest newspapers in Brazil. Greenwald had just published an article there detailing how the N.S.A. was spying on Brazilian phone calls and e-mails. The article caused a huge scandal in Brazil, as similar articles have done in other countries around the world, and Greenwald was a celebrity in the newsroom. The editor in chief pumped his hand and asked him to write a regular column; reporters took souvenir pictures with their cellphones. Poitras filmed some of this, then put her camera down and looked on. I noted that nobody was paying attention to her, that all eyes were on Greenwald, and she smiled. “That’s right,” she said. “That’s perfect.”

Poitras seems to work at blending in, a function more of strategy than of shyness. She can actually be remarkably forceful when it comes to managing information. During a conversation in which I began to ask her a few questions about her personal life, she remarked, “This is like visiting the dentist.” The thumbnail portrait is this: She was raised in a well-off family outside Boston, and after high school, she moved to San Francisco to work as a chef in upscale restaurants. She also took classes at the San Francisco Art Institute, where she studied under the experimental filmmaker Ernie Gehr. In 1992, she moved to New York and began to make her way in the film world, while also enrolling in graduate classes in social and political theory at the New School. Since then she has made five films, most recently “The Oath,” about the Guantánamo prisoner Salim Hamdan and his brother-in-law back in Yemen, and has been the recipient of a Peabody Award and a MacArthur award.

On Sept. 11, 2001, Poitras was on the Upper West Side of Manhattan when the towers were attacked. Like most New Yorkers, in the weeks that followed she was swept up in both mourning and a feeling of unity. It was a moment, she said, when “people could have done anything, in a positive sense.” When that moment led to the pre-emptive invasion of Iraq, she felt that her country had lost its way. “We always wonder how countries can veer off course,” she said. “How do people let it happen, how do people sit by during this slipping of boundaries?” Poitras had no experience in conflict zones, but in June 2004, she went to Iraq and began documenting the occupation.

Shortly after arriving in Baghdad, she received permission to go to Abu Ghraib prison to film a visit by members of Baghdad’s City Council. This was just a few months after photos were published of American soldiers abusing prisoners there. A prominent Sunni doctor was part of the visiting delegation, and Poitras shot a remarkable scene of his interaction with prisoners there, shouting that they were locked up for no good reason.

The doctor, Riyadh al-Adhadh, invited Poitras to his clinic and later allowed her to report on his life in Baghdad. Her documentary, “My Country, My Country,” is centered on his family’s travails — the shootings and blackouts in their neighborhood, the kidnapping of a nephew. The film premiered in early 2006 and received widespread acclaim, including an Oscar nomination for best documentary."

""It's a huge defeat for the civil rights community on the most important civil rights law ever passed,"" he said.

That view was echoed across other networks. ABC's Terry Moran, for instance, said that ""right now, there is no Voting Rights Act operative in the United States.""

Speaking on MSNBC, Al Sharpton called the news ""devastating."" Later, he said the Court had ""revoked"" and ""canceled"" part of Martin Luther King's ""dream.""

CNN and Fox News were slower in getting to the news. CNN, in particular, waited about eight minutes to dive into the details of the ruling.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/events/day_troubles_began,,[],Day the Troubles began,"Before the Troubles

The protest movements that broke out across the western world in 1968 had captured the imagination of many people in Northern Ireland, leading to the creation of a local civil rights movement that began a series of marches and protests calling for greater equality for the Catholic/nationalist minority.

The civil rights movement formed in Belfast in January 1967 drew inspiration from the campaign for equal rights in the United States led by Martin Luther King. Since the creation of Northern Ireland in 1921, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) had held power. The UUP drew its support from the predominantly Protestant unionist/loyalist community and many of the policies it enacted marginalised and discriminated against the Catholic/nationalist minority.

The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) called for wide-ranging reforms: it demanded equal voting rights in local government elections; a fairer system for the allocation of public housing; an end to 'gerrymandering' (the manipulation of electoral boundaries to give one community an electoral advantage); an end to discrimination in employment; the disbandment of the 'B-Specials' (an all-Protestant auxiliary police force); and the repeal of the Special Powers Act (which allowed for internment of suspects without trial).

By 1968, the civil rights movement was beginning to gather support from local politicians as well as some prominent MPs in the British Parliament at Westminster. The Ulster Unionist government in Northern Ireland, led by Prime Minister Terence O'Neill, was under pressure from all sides for its hesitant approach to social reform. The reforms that were made were considered too much by many in the unionist/loyalist community and too little by many of those in the nationalist/republican community. Those on both sides of the debate agreed on one thing - opposition to O'Neill's regime.

Showdown on 5 October

After their first march on 24 August 1968 in County Tyrone, NICRA were invited by the Derry Housing Action Committee (DHAC) to hold a march in County Londonderry on 5 October. The Apprentice Boys of Derry, a Protestant fraternal society, announced plans to march the same route, on the same day. Northern Ireland's Minister of Home Affairs William Craig responded by issuing a banning order on all marches within the boundaries of the planned route.

On the day of the march, a few hundred civil rights protesters planned to walk from Duke Street, in the predominantly Protestant Waterside area of Derry, to the Diamond in the centre of the city. Duke Street had been declared out of bounds by Craig's order and marchers were confronted by rows of police officers from the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC).

The police used batons and water cannon in an attempt to disperse the marchers and violent skirmishes broke out. Among those injured in the clash were Gerry Fitt, a Republican and Labour MP, and three Labour MPs (Russell Kerr, Anne Kerr and John Ryan). Dramatic images were captured on camera by the media and broadcast around the world.

Fallout and reaction

Television news coverage of these events brought the situation in Northern Ireland to international attention and serious rioting broke out locally. More civil rights demonstrations and counter demonstrations followed in the weeks and months ahead, with many ending in clashes as the security situation slipped out of control. The next major civil rights march (organised by the People's Democracy) in January 1969 was ambushed just outside Derry by loyalists, with some of the attackers later identified as members of the security forces - in this case B-Specials. Serious rioting followed in Derry that evening and over subsequent days.

Tensions were not confined to the streets. Prime Minister O'Neill was under pressure both inside and outside his own government to take decisive action. O'Neill set up the Cameron Commission to investigate the circumstances surrounding the disturbances in Derry on 5 October 1968. He then called a snap election in an attempt to sideline his critics.

The move backfired. The Ulster Unionist Party retained power but suffered serious splits into pro- and anti-O'Neill factions. O'Neill himself even struggled to retain his own seat, only narrowly holding off the challenge of his political bête noire, Ian Paisley. On 28 April 1969, O'Neill resigned as prime minister of Northern Ireland.

The Troubles escalate

Rioting continued to be commonplace in Derry and Belfast through the summer of 1969, a period which also saw the first deaths of the conflict.

When an Apprentice Boys march in Derry on 12 August sparked rioting in the Catholic 'Bogside' area, two days of serious violence broke out across Northern Ireland. With the police unable to cope with the scope and scale of the disturbances, Northern Ireland's government at Stormont requested that the British Army be sent in to restore order. Initially envisaged as a brief intervention, 'Operation Banner' was to become the longest continuous campaign in the history of the British Army, only coming to an end in July 2007.

By the end of 1969, various 'no-go' areas had been established and 'peace walls' set up in Belfast and Derry. A large population movement began that saw once mixed areas become exclusively Protestant or Catholic, polarising not only people, but also opinions and attitudes. Paramilitary groups on both sides began to re-emerge, gaining in strength and status as widespread civil disorder quickly escalated into a bloody conflict that would last for nearly 30 years.

The Cameron Report, published in September 1969, concluded that there had been ""use of unnecessary and ill-controlled force in the dispersal of the demonstrators"" in Derry on 5 October 1968. Eamonn McCann, one of the organisers of the march, said that the thing he recalled most in the aftermath of the day was ""the number of people who came up to me and said, using the exact phrase: 'Things will never be the same again'. And they were right."""

Martin O'Malley speaks at a rally in support of repealing the state's death penalty in January. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)

The Maryland legislature voted Friday to abolish the death penalty, which would make the state the sixth in as many years to end capital punishment and add to a canon of liberal policies recently embraced by state leaders.

The 82 to 56 vote in the House of Delegates, which followed two hours of debate, reflected a growing unease among lawmakers in Maryland and across the country that the risk of putting an innocent person to death remains too great with the death penalty in place.

The legislation, which passed the Senate last week, now goes to the desk of Gov. Martin O’Malley (D), who claimed a long-sought victory. Aides said he will sign the bill in coming weeks.

Since taking office in 2007, O’Malley has urged lawmakers to end capital punishment. He has also led successful efforts to legalize same-sex marriage, extend in-state college tuition rates to illegal immigrants and raise income taxes on wealthy residents.

In an interview, O’Malley credited the grass-roots lobbying efforts of the NAACP and faith leaders, turnover in the state Senate and some last-minute conversions with helping achieve an objective that had previously eluded him.

“I’ve felt compelled to do everything I could to change our law, repeal the death penalty, so that we could focus on doing the things that actually work to reduce violent crime,” said O’Malley, who rose to political prominence as a tough-on-crime mayor of Baltimore.

Repeal advocates said the win in Maryland — which has five prisoners on death row but hasn’t executed anyone since 2005 — would continue momentum nationally.

Benjamin T. Jealous, president of the NAACP, which has made repeal of the death penalty a national priority, noted that Maryland would become the first state south of the Mason-Dixon line to do away with capital punishment.

“This is a big day for Maryland. It’s a bigger day for the country,” said Jealous, who watched Friday’s vote in Annapolis from the House gallery and appeared at a news conference with O’Malley afterward. “It shows that the anti-death penalty movement is accelerating.”

He said that repeal advocates are within striking distance in Delaware, Colorado, New Hampshire and Kansas.

Although the death penalty remains on the books in 33 states, many are using it more sparingly than in the past. Last year, 77 people were sentenced to death nationally, the second-lowest number since capital punishment was reinstated in 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.

“State after state is deciding that the death penalty is simply not worth the risks and costs to retain,” Richard Dieter, the executive director of the center, said Friday, predicting that Maryland “won’t be the last” to end capital punishment.

During Friday’s debate in the House, opponents of the repeal bill argued that capital punishment can be an important law-enforcement tool and should be kept on the books for heinous cases, several of which were recounted in graphic detail.

“I wish that we did not need the death penalty . . . but I’ve seen the worst of the worst, and I know it’s necessary,” Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles), a former prosecutor, told colleagues.

But his side was outnumbered by delegates who said they’ve come to view life without the possibility of parole as an acceptable alternative.

More than a dozen members made references to Kirk Bloodsworth, a former death-row inmate who was exonerated by DNA evidence and released from prison in 1993. Bloodsworth, a former Marine convicted of raping and murdering a 9-year-old girl in Baltimore County in 1984, watched the proceedings Friday from the House gallery.

“Human beings cannot devise a system of justice that is perfect,” said Del. Anne Healey (D-Prince George’s). “What I can’t live with is, if we make a mistake, it costs somebody else his life.”

A couple of members said they had reached their decision only in recent days.

“I’m a reluctant convert to supporting repeal, but a convert nonetheless,” said William J. Frank (R-Baltimore County), citing a “respect for human life.”

Maryland voters could still get the final say on the measure. A provision in the state constitution allows citizens to petition recently passed laws to the ballot, as happened with same-sex marriage legislation last year.

Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. (D-Calvert) has said the death penalty is likely to be placed on the 2014 ballot, although no group has announced plans to spearhead an organized effort to collect signatures.

The outcome of a ballot measure would be far from certain. A Washington Post poll released last month showed that a majority of Marylanders want to keep the death penalty despite widespread skepticism as to whether it is a deterrent to murder or is applied fairly.

Repealing the death penalty was not an issue that O’Malley campaigned on in 2006 when he first defeated then-Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. (R). But in December 2006, a month before he took office, the Court of Appeals ruled that the state’s procedures had not been properly adopted and halted executions until new regulations could be issued by the administration.

It was then that O’Malley, a practicing Catholic, said he sensed an opening to pursue a long-held belief of his.

Rather than put forward new regulations that would allow the death penalty to resume, O’Malley focused on lobbying the legislature for repeal.

In high-profile testimony shortly after he took office in 2007, the governor argued that capital punishment is “inherently unjust,” does not serve as a deterrent to murder and consumes resources that could be better used to prevent crime.

In 2009, after two repeal bills sponsored by lawmakers had failed, O’Malley decided to put the full weight of his office behind the measure and sponsor it himself, even though it was unclear if there were enough votes in the Senate.

That measure was rejected by the chamber, with members choosing instead to tighten evidentiary standards in capital cases.

Since then, several lawmakers have suggested that their attempt to “fix” the death penalty in 2009 was insufficient.

Those include Sen. Robert A. Zirkin (D-Baltimore County), the primary author of the 2009 amendment, which limited capital cases to those with DNA evidence, videotaped confessions or videotape of the crime itself.

Zirkin said he wrestled with his position for months and still was conflicted as he cast his vote for the repeal, expressing no moral qualms about putting to death people who are guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt.

“From an emotional standpoint, I want to kill these people myself,” he said. “But that’s a different question than whether, legally, the state should be involved in their death.”

In the weeks before the vote, three other members announced that they would vote for the bill, citing a variety of reasons, including visits from families of murder victims who opposed capital punishment.

“The idea of strapping someone down and deliberately taking their life — it was a little difficult for me,” said Sen. John C. Astle (D-Anne Arundel). “I didn’t come to my decision easily.”

The outcome in the House on Friday was expected, but that didn’t lessen the drama. House Speaker Michael E. Busch (D-Anne Arundel) characterized his chamber’s death-penalty vote and its legalization of same-sex marriage last year as two of the most emotional and important undertaken by state lawmakers.

It was also a victory for the industry’s steadfast, if surprising, allies: advocacy groups representing the very communities hit hardest by the obesity epidemic.

Dozens of Hispanic and African-American civil rights groups, health advocacy organizations and business associations have joined the beverage industry in opposing soda regulation around the country in recent years, arguing that such measures — perhaps the greatest regulatory threat the soft-drink industry has ever faced — are discriminatory, paternalistic or ineffective.

Many of these groups have something else in common: They are among the recipients of tens of millions of dollars from the beverage industry that has flowed to nonprofit and educational organizations serving blacks and Hispanics over the last decade, according to a review by The New York Times of charity records and other documents.

Soda companies have sponsored conferences for the National Hispana Leadership Institute, scholarships for local chapters of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, financial literacy classes offered by the National Puerto Rican Coalition and programs from the National Hispanic Medical Association."

Breitbart News has debunked that cinematic meme, but Reagan’s commitment to racial equality began long before he even considered a life in politics.

John D. Morris, Director of Development at Eureka College’s Ronald W. Reagan Society, suspects those who malign Reagan today are fearful of his legacy and impact on the next generation of conservatives. And the facts simply don’t bear out their version of reality.

Morris describes a yearbook displayed on Eureka’s campus featuring a photograph of “Dutch” along with classmate Willie Sue Smith, a black woman Reagan would consider a dear friend.

“I have spoken with both of her children who said that Ronald Reagan and their mother corresponded for years. She had passed notes in class between Dutch and his girlfriend, Mugs Cleaver,” Morris says. “Reagan saw Willie Sue as a classmate and friend and, more than anything, another child of God.”

Another college pal, football standout William Franklin Burghardt, became one of Reagan’s lifelong chums.

Morris says one Reagan anecdote illustrates where the actor turned politician learned the value of equality. Jack Reagan, the future president’s father, one day witnessed a store clerk rudely deny a black man’s son from using the bathroom.

“The attendant next turned to Jack Reagan to ask for help. ‘Your services are no longer required by us,’ Jack replied. Taking his children outside, he told Moon and Dutch that no human beings should ever receive such treatment,” Morris says, adding the president would often share that meaningful moment with others.

Morris says it’s a shame the film industry is reluctant to tell the true nature of Reagan the man.

“Hollywood will someday see the virtues of making films based on the inspiring stories of the most consequential member of its own talent pool in history,” he says."
