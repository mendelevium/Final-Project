The effort by Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe to end Saturday mail delivery is a non-starter on many levels.

First, he lacks the legal authority to do this. Decisions on delivery schedule are the purview of Congress, and every year for the past 30 years, America's elected representatives have mandated six-day delivery — a requirement remaining in force today.

Mr. Donahoe isn't above the law. Further, his attempted power grab flouts the political will of Congress; as recently as the last session, which ended in January, a bipartisan majority of representatives co-sponsored measures backing continuation of Saturday delivery.

It's not surprising that many lawmakers have questioned Mr. Donahoe's legal overreach, or that his explanations are so evasive.

On the merits, it's a disastrous idea. The postmaster general proposes trading 17% of service for 2% in savings — an irrational business plan. Indeed, when the USPS asked the agency's overseer, the Postal Regulatory Commission, in 2011 to support ending six-day delivery, this illogic was one of the factors cited by the commission in declining to endorse the plan.

So, too, was the finding that the savings were wildly inflated. The commission also noted that ending Saturday delivery would disproportionately affect the elderly, rural communities and small businesses. Those small businesses create more than two-thirds of all jobs in this country, and forcing them to hire expensive private contractors on weekends would impose new costs.

So ending Saturday delivery would jeopardize the USPS' future by sacrificing its competitive advantage, hurt tens of millions of Americans — and it wouldn't even solve the agency's financial woes.

That's because most of the red ink has nothing to do with postal operations. Rather, 80% of the red ink stems directly from the 2006 congressional mandate that the Postal Service do something no other agency or company is required to do: pre-fund future retiree health benefits. That mandate accounted for $11.1 billion in red ink in fiscal 2012 alone.

The postmaster general should address that problem, rather than seeking to override his authority by eviscerating a network that provides residents and businesses with the world's most efficient and affordable delivery service while uniting this vast country.

USA TODAY

The library will preserve the president%27s books%2C manuscripts%2C historical documents

The founders raised %24106.4M for construction and programming

The library opens Sept. 27

An earlier version of this story misidentified Fred W. Smith as the founder of FedEx.

It took awhile, but the nation's first president finally has a presidential library.

""No president in American history deserves the honor of a presidential library more than our first chief executive -- nor is there a better story to tell,"" says Ann Bookout of the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, which owns and operates the Washington estate outside Washington, D.C., in Virginia.

The association worked to build the library, called the Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington.

The $106.4 million cost was raised in private funds from 7,000 donors, including $38 million from the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation. Under its chairman, former Las Vegas Review-Journal executive Fred W. Smith, the foundation has sponsored several projects related to George Washington.

The 45,000-square-foot library is scheduled to open Sept. 27 next to the Washington home on the Mount Vernon estate.

It will have dozens of rare artifacts that belonged to the first president, including his handwritten notes about books like A New System of Husbandry, and thousands of books, manuscripts and electronic materials about Washington.

The George Washington library is not part of the presidential library system, which is a network of 13 libraries run by the National Archives to house papers and other important materials of every president since Herbert Hoover.

""There is a national belief among ordinary citizens that having a library for the benefit of George Washington is an important thing,"" Curt Viebranz, president of the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, said at a news conference Thursday.

The three-level structure includes a general library with thousands of books, journals, audio-visual materials and other files on Washington and his work. Within the building are three vaults of rare volumes, 105 of which belonged to Washington, a reading room for manuscripts, conference rooms and a broadcast studio. There is a residence for visiting scholars.

Viebranz says the library is the culmination of a more than 150-year effort to restore Washington's personal library collection and preserve his materials. It is also meant to promote discussion about Washington's leadership and character.

""While there have been tens of thousands of books published about Washington and lots of research to be done about him, there are still new things to learn,"" he says.

Among items in the library will be Washington's notes from the Compend of Husbandry, his copy of The Beauties of Swift: or, the Favorite Offspring of Wit & Genius by 18th-century satirist Jonathan Swift, and a farm report by his nephew, George A. Washington, from August 1790.

In a letter to his friend James McHenry, Washington wrote on April 3, 1797, that he needed a place to store his documents: ""I have not houses to build, except one, which I must erect for the accommodation and security of my military, civil and private papers, which are voluminous and may be interesting.""

Decades later, Washington's vision seemed like a lost cause. In 1848 the Boston Athenaeum, a research library, purchased most of what remained of Washington's books. The Mount Vernon Ladies' Association was established five years later to preserve the president's estate and re-create his personal reading collection.

Viebranz says the library is a collaboration of scholars, colleges, corporations and individual donors from all walks of life.

""I have a regular dialogue with ordinary Americans who send me letters, who basically mentioned the importance of the founding era,"" he says. ""Those folks will dig into their pockets and give us $1, $5, $25.""

Mount Vernon plans an exhibit to open with the presidential library. ""Take Note! Washington the Reader"" will display books, letters and notes.

Curator Susan Schoelwer says the documents aim to show not just the books but how Washington read and what he thought.

""The exhibit really is trying to get inside Washington's head,"" she says. ""There's a sort of mythology out there that he wasn't a reader, but when you begin looking at his books they do cover a wide range of topics.""

The exhibits, Viebranz says, will not only preserve Washington's documents and books but will also give people insight into his character. People will have an opportunity to learn ""what was his seminal role at the founding of the republic, which is a lesson that every American should know."""

He suggested that the only way for Republicans to avoid the rules change was to acquiesce to straight up-or-down votes on Tuesday on seven nominees in question and stop filibustering executive nominations in the future.

“I love the Senate, but right now the Senate is broken and needs to be fixed,” he said.

Republicans expressed outrage at the proposal and promised to retaliate. But for a Senate that has increasingly found itself tied in procedural knots, the decisions at hand were potentially momentous. Republicans to the last minute were preparing offers of compromise, but Democratic leaders said they had the votes and the wherewithal to pull the trigger on the most significant change since the early 1970s in the way the Senate operates.

Although Mr. Reid insisted that the change was extremely narrow, it had the potential to be the beginning of the end of the filibuster — and to eliminate the need for supermajorities to get anything done in Congress’s upper chamber.

Mr. Reid’s position could be a bluff to gain leverage to force the nominees through. Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, both Republicans, were in negotiations with two Democrats, Carl Levin of Michigan and Max Baucus of Montana, to find a way out. But most senators said it was now up to Senators Reid and McConnell.

“I want a solution,” Mr. Baucus said. “That’s by far better for everyone, by far.”

After the meeting, Mr. McConnell offered Democrats up-or-down votes on all seven contested nominations in exchange for a promise to drop the rule-change threat. Mr. Reid demanded a pledge not to filibuster future nominations. Both sides balked, according to aides familiar with the exchange.

Signs earlier on Monday pointed to Mr. Reid exercising a version of what has come to be known as the “nuclear option” — meaning that rather than the 67 votes usually needed to change the Senate rules, Democrats would do so with a majority, a move that could, in the short run, eviscerate what comity is left in the chamber, and, in the longer term, fundamentally change the institution.

“It’s almost hard to measure the ramifications that would emanate from such an action,” said Olympia J. Snowe, a former Republican senator from Maine who helped head off an earlier showdown over judicial nominees. “Once you go down that path, you cannot know how this will reverberate on the institution for generations.”"

Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) attempted to attach to a water resources bill on Wednesday, which would have allowed gun owners to carry firearms into recreational areas currently off-limits. The amendment was one of two Coburn had planned to offer, although he withdrew his second earlier in the day.

Areas controlled by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers -- such as hundreds of the nation's lakes and thousands of campsites and miles of trails -- are gun-free zones, even if the state where the land is located allows concealed weapons. Coburn's amendment, however, would have granted precedence to state laws and permitted people to carry guns in some of these places.

The Senate voted 56-43 on Coburn's amendment, failing to garner the 60 votes needed to move forward.

Coburn's second amendment would have required federal agencies to account for all of their guns and ammunition, essentially creating a registry of government firearms. The push was part of a concern among some conservatives that the government may be stockpiling ammunition in order to restrict the supply available to the public.

Coburn spokesman John Hart confirmed to The Huffington Post that Coburn had withdrawn his amendment, which was also scheduled for a vote. He said it was ""a goodwill gesture"" to Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), one of the sponsors of the Water Resources Development Act. On Tuesday, Boxer criticized Republicans for putting forward gun amendments on her bill.

The NRA's federal affairs office sent out an alert on Wednesday afternoon, urging senators to support Coburn's Army Corps of Engineers amendment.

""The National Rifle Association strongly supports this amendment,"" the email reads, with the statement in bold, underlined type. The group argued that Coburn's amendment would ""not only allow law abiding citizens to protect themselves, but relieve them from the onerous responsibility of tracking where one federal agency’s land management jurisdiction ends and another begins.""

In 2010, President Barack Obama signed a bill into law that allows loaded firearms in national parks and wildlife refuges.

Washington (CNN) – Continuing his congressional outreach, President Barack Obama met with a dozen Democratic senators Wednesday night during the middle of week in which the issues of gun control and immigration reached crucial points on the legislative agenda.

Dining at the Jefferson Hotel, Obama and the group had a “productive discussion about a range of issues,” including gun violence, immigration reform and the economy, according to a White House official.



“The President and the Senators also discussed the explosions in Boston and the president reaffirmed that the full weight of the federal government is behind this investigation, which is being led by the FBI,” the official added.

The attendees were:

Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado

Senator Chris Coons of Delaware

Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois

Senator Dianne Feinstein of California

Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana

Senator Patty Murray of Washington

Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island

Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire

Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan

Senator Mark Warner of Virginia

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island

Senator Ron Wyden or Oregon

None of the Democrats who attended were among the four senators who voted against the party line Wednesday in a vote to expand the background check system to cover more firearm purchases. (Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid also voted no at the last minute for procedural reasons, allowing him to bring the amendment back up at a later date.)

The meeting ran a little more than two hours and followed two high-profile dinners between Obama and Senate Republicans in recent weeks. He also met with both caucuses in both chambers last month in multiple trips to Congress.

The president’s new outreach came after criticism that the president was not socializing enough with lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia said last month that it was good Obama was reaching out to Republicans, but he also needed to build more relationships within his own party.

""I was very pleased to see him reach out to his colleagues on the other side, and I would hope he would reach out to us as well,"" he told CNN. Manchin was not among the guests Wednesday night.

Senators were tight lipped on their way out from the hotel Wednesday. When asked how the dinner went, Stabenow yelled ""great"" and added “very positive,” and Reed simply said ""good.” Warner said it went very well, while Whitehouse literally gave it two thumbs up.

“It was a good dinner,” Bennet said. “We talked about not talking about it.”

Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray, meanwhile, released a statement after the meeting, saying the group talked about ways to tackle the deficit.

“It is clear to me that President Obama and Senate Democrats are united in our desire to end the constant lurching from crisis to crisis that is hurting middle class families and the economy,” she said. “We also share the hope that some Republicans will finally step out of their partisan corner and join us at the table willing to offer some compromises that will help move our country and our economy forward.”

On a warm night outside the hotel, a crowd of spectators gathered across the street throughout the evening. Joggers and bicyclists, some of whom first ignored the closed streets before being sternly turned back, were a constant presence on the crowded sidewalk across from the hotel.

While senators walked in the front door of the hotel, the president's motorcade did the short drive two blocks from the White House, past pedestrians, and entered on the side.

Hotel guests had their bags checked before being allowed to cross the street.

(CNN) - MSNBC host Martin Bashir said in a statement Wednesday that he would resign from the network following comments he made about former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin.

Bashir apologized on-air last month after suggesting that Palin deserved graphic punishment for comparing U.S. foreign debt to slavery. Palin later canceled an appearance on NBC's ""Today.""



Following intense backlash for the incendiary comments, Bashir elected to temporarily take additional time off during the Thanksgiving holiday.

""Upon further reflection, and after meeting with the President of msnbc, I have tendered my resignation. It is my sincere hope that all of my colleagues, at this special network, will be allowed to focus on the issues that matter without the distraction of myself or my ill-judged comments,"" he said in the statement.

""I deeply regret what was said, will endeavor to work hard at making constructive contributions in the future and will always have a deep appreciation for our viewers – who are the smartest, most compassionate and discerning of all television audiences. I would also wish to express deepest gratitude to my immediate colleagues, and our contributors, all of whom have given so much of themselves to our broadcast.""

The president of MSNBC, Phil Griffin, also issued a statement confirming that Bashir would step down and wishing him the best.

""Martin Bashir resigned today, effective immediately. I understand his decision and I thank him for three great years with msnbc. Martin is a good man and respected colleague – we wish him only the best.""

Palin responded to Bashir's initial comments last month.

""Everybody in life takes shots,"" she said ""Fox News Sunday."" ""I don't have to accept his words – his vile, evil comments. So they don't have to affect me. I move on and I charge forth.""

Also last month, the network discontinued former host Alec Baldwin's show ""Up Late"" after he reportedly yelled anti-gay slurs at a photographer outside his home in New York. Baldwin later apologized for the angry rant in a post to MSNBC's website.

After his show was canceled, Baldwin called on the network to also force Bashir to leave, pointing to his controversial comments.

""Martin Bashir's on the air, and he made his comment on the air!"" Baldwin told Gothamist last week.

Bashir's resignation was first reported by Mediaite.

Not necessarily, according to Dr. Scott Haltzman, author of ""The Secrets of Surviving Infidelity."" In fact, according to the author, ""many people will say that working through the affair made the marriage stronger than before.""

""Once an affair happens you realize, 'Hey, my marriage can’t run on auto-pilot,'"" Haltzman told HuffPost Divorce via e-mail. ""Succeeding at marriage after infidelity is akin to surviving a trauma; you often never realize your strength or resiliency until it is called on. And that’s worth something!""

But there are several large hurdles between the affair and post-infidelity marital bliss, beginning with telling your spouse about your indiscretions.

We asked Haltzman about whether or not it's important to cop to the infidelity, and how to go about having that emotional conversation. Below, he shares his answers.

Huffington Post Divorce: Should you tell your spouse if you've had an affair? Why or why not?

Dr. Scott Haltzman: In most cases, you should tell your spouse you had an affair. It goes without saying that marriages are based on openness, and affairs are based on secrets. Choosing openness is a potent step toward honoring your wedding vows.



Usually by the time you’re thinking of revealing all, your mate has already begun to figure out something is wrong. By telling your partner the truth, you free him or her up from the constant wondering, “what’s going on with you?” For the person having an affair, verbalizing your actions makes the impact more real, and moves you from “what will I do when my spouse finds out,” to “what’s the next step toward resolution”?

HP: Is there ever a time where you shouldn't tell your spouse that you cheated?

Haltzman: If the infidelity was in the remote past, it has no impact on your current marriage, you've done the emotional ""work"" to make sense of what led to it and took the necessary steps to prevent it from happening again, then it's not clear that the marriage will benefit from telling the truth.

If there's a good likelihood the the revelation will lead to domestic violence, or threaten the life of the person you had an affair with, then it is not a good idea to be entirely truthful, although you must commit to working individually to get the marriage back on track.



HP: If you've decided to tell your spouse, how should you go about telling him or her? How many details of the affair should you reveal? Should you be completely honest?

Haltzman: Your mate is about to find out that his or her world is turned inside out. Is there any right way to do it? In a word, no. But you can try. When possible, revealing an affair should take place in a home, not a park, restaurant or other public place. It's more than likely that you will unfurl a litany of emotions; your spouse should not feel constrained to control emotions by the environment.

You should be direct; no matter how you phrase it, it’s going to hurt. Once you’ve revealed your news, it may take a long time to sink in. Be prepared to answer as many questions as your partner has.

Once you have come clean about the affair, the general policy is “do ask, do tell.” Let your spouse decide what he or she wants to hear. Many people try to protect their spouse (and themselves) from the harsh realities by holding back hurtful details. Don’t do that. Once an affair has been revealed, the most important element in rebuilding a marriage is establishing trust. Trust is built on complete honesty.



HP: If your spouse reacts badly, how should you respond?



Haltzman: There’s no predictable reaction to finding out your spouse had an affair, and, with the exception of physical violence, no right or wrong way to react. A partner who has had an affair must be prepared for any kind of reaction when the truth is told. Your partner’s pain must be recognized and prioritized. It is important to not try to minimize your spouse’s feelings by saying such things as, “It’s not that big a deal” or, “It happened only once,"" or by comparing feelings (“I didn’t get that upset when you told me about your affair”) or invalidating the feeling (“You shouldn’t feel that way.”) Remember that all feelings are valid because they are real within your mate. Your role is to listen, try to understand, be as strong as you can be -- although it’s OK to break down if it is in sympathy with your mate. At some point the dust will settle, and then you will need to be there to help pick up the pieces.



HP: What's the most important thing to remember before having this conversation?



Haltzman: The most important thing to remember about having this conversation is that it is a beginning, not an end. Revealing the truth about an affair is a necessary first step toward moving the marriage back on track.

Calling the decision ""outrageous,"" Pelosi argued that not only could the House pass the immigration bill if Boehner would try, but it could also pass a bill to improve background checks for gun purchases and the Employment Non-Discrimination Act to ban employers from firing people because of their sexual identity.

""ENDA, background checks and comprehensive immigration reform -- it's right there, it's right there,"" Pelosi told reporters at her weekly briefing on Capitol Hill. ""It requires it to be bipartisan because we don't have the majority, but we say to the speaker, bring up immigration any way you want -- singly, jointly, severally -- anything -- just bring it up so we can take some votes on it.""

Pelosi made it clear, however, that she didn't really expect any action in a Congress that is about the least productive in history.

""I don't know that they ever intend to do anything -- again,"" Pelosi said. ""The legislative branch, the first article of the Constitution, the first branch of government, the legislative branch -- and we're not legislating. We are not legislating. But we could.""

Asked if the House could focus on another piece of legislation that crosses party lines -- reforming spying by the National Security Agency -- Pelosi was especially dismissive.

""You know what the agenda is around here,"" Pelosi said. ""Not only is it family friendly. It's family friendly for a family of retirees. Nothing gets done. 'Let's just go home early, if we come in at all,'"" she said, paraphrasing the attitude she attributes to Boehner.

Mark Andrew, a former Minnesota Democrat Party chairman and recent losing candidate for mayor of Minneapolis, was in a Starbucks at the gigantic mall when the incident occurred.

Andrew told the media that he had just finished a call and placed his iPhone 4S on the table when a young man came up to the table, grabbed the phone, and ran. Andrew gave chase immediately but was quickly confronted by two teenaged girls just outside the coffee shop.

One of the girls was armed with a billy club and began to smack Andrew over the head with the stick.

The former politician said he grabbed one of the girls who then gouged her fingernails into his face screaming, “I’m going to kill you! Let me go or I’m going to kill you.”

Andrew says that dozens of shoppers were standing around watching but no one moved to help.

Police arrived soon enough to catch the two girls who initially tried to claim that Andrew attacked them first. Witness told police another story and the two were taken into custody.

The male thief dropped the cell phone in an attempt to get away and Andrew got his phone back.

Police arrested Letaija Shapree Cutler-Cain, 18, and a 17-year-old accomplice whose name was not released because she is a minor.

“In my estimation, these kids are damaged,” Andrew told the St. Paul Pioneer Press. “They have to be held accountable. The juvenile may be too far gone. She was extremely violent. I believe she was trying to kill me, and her actions supported her statement. She was swinging as hard as she could.”

Andrew, who currently owns an environmental marketing firm called GreenMark, received nine stitches for a gash on his head. He also sustained several cuts and abrasions on his face.

“I was targeted because the phone was out and I’m 63 years old, and I’m sure they thought that I was easy pickins,” Andrew said."

If the bill is signed by the governor, it will be an important and long-overdue step forward that will enhance public safety.

Under AB 60, sponsored by Assemblyman Luis Alejo (D-Watsonville), immigrants in California who learn the rules of the road, pass a driving test and provide whatever additional information the state Department of Motor Vehicles determines it needs will be eligible to receive a license to operate a car.

That would bring California in line with at least nine other states that have adopted similar measures. Since 1993, most immigrants living here illegally have been barred from obtaining California licenses (except for some young people who qualify for temporary federal work permits).

Already, critics of AB 60 are arguing that providing driver’s licenses to people who are in the United States illegally rewards them for breaking the law. But that’s putting politics before common sense.

AB 60 doesn’t condone illegal immigration. Rather, it recognizes the argument made by some law enforcement officials, including Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck, that we are all safer if those immigrants who are currently driving without a license are taught to operate a car safely and are tested to ensure that they meet the same standards as other drivers. Licenses will also deter hit-and-run accidents by taking away one of the chief incentives to flee the scene.

Other critics are arguing that immigrants will use their new licenses as identification to commit voter fraud or to claim public benefits. In fact, the new license will carry explicit language noting that it confers only the right to drive a car, and doesn’t bestow any new legal rights or establish eligibility for employment or public benefits. Such language will also guarantee that California complies with the federal Real ID law, which requires states to verify the legal status of individuals when issuing driver’s licenses or other forms of identification.

California legislators deserve credit for passing this bill, which we hope Gov. Jerry Brown will sign. After that, we hope Congress will enact comprehensive immigration reform. By legalizing the status of most of the country’s undocumented immigrants, that would make the roads safer in all 50 states."

(CNN) —

One hundred and sixty-five years ago, in Coloma, California, a carpenter named James W. Marshall built a sawmill to harness the power of the American River. Below the waterwheel, he saw flakes of metal where the spent water flowed. Marshall marked the moment saying, “I have found it.” He had discovered gold in California and more: For the next century, our nation would mine its future in the Golden State.

By the 1950s, California had manufactured an optimistic nation’s dreams, brought them to life in the steel and smoke of industry and then captured them on celluloid. Business bloomed in deserts, nourishing one of the world’s great economies. A green Eden of farmland, the Central Valley where the sun shone 300 days a year, grew one third of America’s produce. Innovation followed discovery: Silicon, it turned out, was even more valuable than gold.

California’s public sector also boomed. The state built a web of roads, bridges and aqueducts that shamed their Roman inventors. It funded world-class universities to prepare beach boys and California girls for lives of endless promise.

To see where the rest of the country would be in 20 years, we could look at California. But the roads to success and failure are often almost the same.

As the state gorged on its success, California’s transportation arteries grew clogged. The public sector’s blood began to thicken.

Californians moved faster, their problems grew more complex and their demands on government accelerated. The state’s aging public sector could not respond with matching dynamism and flexibility.

Even as the state poured more money into education, transportation and public safety, it delivered less value in them. Government grew larger and more expensive, with less and less to show for it. Finally, when the housing bubble collapsed, state revenue did too. California’s river of gold dried up. The waterwheel would not turn.

Today, California owes hundreds of billions: $300 billion alone in pension obligations. Even after Gov. Jerry Brown’s effort to pay down $28 billion of immediate debt, California’s liabilities for retiree pensions and health care exceed what it spends for all state programs combined.

California’s future looks anything but golden. Taxpayers who don’t want to be left footing the bills are in exodus. The state’s politics is as paralyzing as Washington’s. To see our nation’s bright future in 20 years, can we still look at California?

Gavin Newsom is difficult to classify. Tall, slim and rakishly elegant, he could be the American reincarnation of British actor David Niven. A contradictory combination of left and right, he is a liberal hero for legalizing gay marriage in his city and a liberal villain for reforming its overly generous welfare cash payment program.

The 45-year-old Newsom, a Democrat who is now California’s lieutenant governor, is more than a government theorist, however. He owns 17 small businesses with about 1,000 employees. His confederation includes three wineries that make luscious, fruit-forward elixirs. In business, he is a swashbuckling entrepreneur whose motto is “anyone who is not failing isn’t trying hard enough.” What is most revolutionary about Newsom is that in government, he’s an entrepreneur as well.

When Newsom became mayor of San Francisco, he found a city with little money to meet social needs and behind Estonia and South Korea in digital governance. His push to modernize San Francisco without expanding its dysfunctional public sector is the launching point of his new book, “Citizenville.” It is a fertile garden of original thinking.

The lieutenant governor argues that government’s biggest problem is not that it is misguided but that it is archaic. Newsom cites open-source software pioneer Tim O’Reilly’s analogy for government. “We think of government as a vending machine: You put money in, services come out.” When something goes wrong, Newsom points out, we shake the vending machine out of frustration. If we feed it more money, it is to little effect: Vending machines are not particularly innovative or adaptive.

Our government is still built on that model, Newsom reports, the outdated, industrial-age paradigm of the factory, though everything else in our personal lives and our private sector has moved past it. Simultaneously, an explosion of technology, social media and e-commerce has created a more informed and empowered citizenry.

A “citizenville,” Newsom writes, now has the power and connectivity to solve problems in new ways, e.g., determining where tax dollars are spent, how crime is fought and where garbage trucks go. Speaking through their laptops and iPhones, people are increasingly able to organize themselves and solve social problems, independent of the old, creaky, public-sector industrial plant.

“Technology changes the very nature of government – from a top-down entity to a bottom-up one. From one-way hierarchy to two-way democracy. From vending machine to the cloud,” he explains.

If we open the doors of government to the private sector and make data accessible, we can jump-start a new era of social innovation. Open up the doors of government satellite data and you get Google Earth. Give Web designers in Chicago and Oakland access to public police data, and they create innovative crime-mapping tools that prevent muggings. Invent a digital “currency” to reward citizens for participating in their own governance, and small town decision-making becomes as interesting and involving as Farmville. “The future is sharing – open data, open participation, open source, open everything,” Newsom writes. “And it must happen at every level.”

Our old, marbled shrines to bureaucracy have grown unserviceable and unaffordable. Can we continue to justify them when mayors are using Twitter to address constituent needs instead?

The lesson: The public sector no longer has a monopoly on government. We are in a new world of revolutionary and empowering technologies. Americans aren’t waiting for Washington or Sacramento to reinvent government for the next century; they are creating an app for that. With it, they are creating a new path for democratic vitality. Now, people-to-people government is an alternative to one that flowed only to people from the state.

With new tools and technologies, Newsom contends, it is time to redefine “government” to seize the opportunities of a new day. Would we still rather be governed the old way, top down, politically and artificially by plant managers? Or bottom-up, authentically, naturally and organically, through our own decision making and handiwork?

Perhaps this has been the promise of the American experiment in self-government all along, and we have only been waiting for the powerful and democratizing technology of the communications age to seize it.

Once more, when we need it most, maybe California has discovered gold again.

USA TODAY

President Obama hits the road again Tuesday for another in a series of middle-class speeches, and a new offer to congressional Republicans.

During a trip to Chattanooga, Tenn., Obama will propose a cut in corporate tax rates -- a priority for the Republicans -- in exchange for new jobs programs, a prime White House objective.

""The president will call on Washington to work on a grand bargain focused on middle-class jobs by pairing reform of the business tax code with a significant investment in middle class jobs,"" said a statement from Obama senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer.

Previous attempts at grand bargains have fallen through. That includes efforts by Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to strike a major debt cutting deal that included both budget cuts and higher taxes on the wealthy.

Some Republicans questioned the value of the latest proposed bargain, saying that Obama has backed corporate tax reform in the past, while Republicans also want to help families and businesses. Republicans also want to pair corporate and personal tax changes so that most people can take advantage of lower rates.

""This proposal allows President Obama to support President Obama's position on taxes and President Obama's position on spending, while leaving small businesses and American families behind,"" said Boehner spokesman Michael Steel.

During his Tuesday trip to Chattanooga, Obama will tour an Amazon shipping facility and speak on what the White House calls ""a better bargain for the middle class.""

The speech ""will focus on proposals to jump-start private sector job growth and strengthen the manufacturing sector,"" the White House said.

Obama is expected to make one specific offer to congressional Republicans: A cut in corporate tax rates in exchange for new investments in jobs programs.

It's the latest in a string of economic speeches that Obama began last week.

The president returns to the White House late Tuesday afternoon for a meeting with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.

Abouhalkah, a columnist and member of the editorial board of the Kansas City Star, has been the one to first post on this. Here is his latest.

Abouhalkah notes that the state of Missouri contributes $400,000 to the fair.

There have been condemnations from the political spectrum:



• Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder, a Republican, tweeted: “I love the MoStateFair and will attend this week. I implore GovJayNixon to hold the people responsible for the other night accountable.” • Also from Kinder: “The MoStateFair celebrates Missouri and our people. I condemn the actions disrespectful to POTUS the other night. We are better than this.” • Democratic Rep. Jeremy LaFaver of Kansas City tweeted: “I will no longer be attending MOStateFair events with family.” • Republican Rep. Caleb Rowden of Columbia tweeted, “I don’t agree w/this Prez on many things. But he is deserving of respect and shouldn’t be the object of political stunts. Out of line!”

The performance by one of the rodeo clowns at Saturday’s event was inappropriate and disrespectful, and does not reflect the opinions or standards of the Missouri State Fair. We strive to be a family friendly event and regret that Saturday’s rodeo badly missed that mark.

The Missouri Fair Association blames the clown. In the Abouhalkah piece is the Fair Association's statement:Of course, the clown did not do any of the announcing. Perry Beam also has some film. Listen to the announcer.

The problem is with the Fair Association for not doing its due diligence and the company that organized this stunt. The company that organized this rodeo is doing a rodeo in my county next month.

Oh, and one more thing. The announcer is the superintendent of schools in Booneville, Missouri.

Redstate America -- isn't it grand?

After my election, I have more flexibility.""

-- Barack Obama to Dmitry Medvedev, March 26, 2012

The puzzle of the Chuck Hagel nomination for defense secretary is that you normally choose someone of the other party for your Cabinet to indicate a move to the center, but, as The Washington Post editorial board points out, Hagel's foreign policy views are to the left of Barack Obama's, let alone the GOP's. Indeed, they are at the fringe of the entire Senate.

So what's going on? Message sending. Obama won re-election. He no longer has to trim, to appear more moderate than his true instincts. He has the ""flexibility"" to be authentically Obama.

Hence the Hagel choice: Under the guise of centrist bipartisanship, it allows the president to leave the constrained first-term Obama behind and follow his natural Hagel-like foreign policy inclinations. On three pressing issues in particular:

(1) Military Spending

Current Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said in August 2011 that the scheduled automatic $600 billion defense cuts (""sequestration"") would result in ""hollowing out the force,"" which would be ""devastating."" And strongly hinted that he might resign rather than enact them.

Asked about Panetta's remarks, Hagel called the Pentagon ""bloated,"" and needing ""to be pared down.""

Just the man you'd want to carry out a U.S. disarmament that will shrink America to what Obama thinks is its proper size on the world stage, i.e. smaller. The overweening superpower that Obama promiscuously chided in his global we-have-sinned tour is poised for reduction, not only to fund the bulging welfare state but to recalibrate America's proper role in the world.

(2) Israel

The issue is not Hagel's alleged hostility but his public pronouncements. His refusal to make moral distinctions, for example. At the height of the second intifada, a relentless campaign of indiscriminate massacre of Israelis, Hagel found innocence abounding: ""Both Israelis and Palestinians are trapped in a war not of their making.""

This pass at evenhandedness is nothing but pernicious blindness. Just last month, Yasser Arafat's widow admitted on Dubai TV what everyone has long known -- that Arafat deliberately launched the intifada after the collapse of the Camp David peace talks in July 2000. He told his wife to stay in the safety of Paris. Why, she asked? Because I'm going to start an intifada.

In July 2002, with the terror still raging, Hagel offered further exquisite evenhandedness: ""Israel must take steps to show its commitment to peace."" Good God. Exactly two years earlier Israel had proposed an astonishingly generous peace that offered Arafat a Palestinian state -- and half of Jerusalem, a previously unimaginable Israeli concession. Arafat said no, made no counteroffer, walked away and started his terror war. Did no one tell Hagel?

(3) Iran

Hagel doesn't just oppose military action, a problematic option with serious arguments on both sides. He actually opposed any unilateral sanctions. You can't get more out of the mainstream than that.

He believes in diplomacy instead, as if talk alone will deter the mullahs. He even voted against designating Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization.

Most tellingly, he has indicated that he is prepared to contain a nuclear Iran, a position diametrically opposed to Obama's first-term, ostensibly unalterable opposition to containment. What message do you think this sends the mullahs?

And that's the point. Hagel himself doesn't matter. He won't make foreign policy. Obama will. Hagel's importance is the message his nomination sends about where Obama wants to go. The lessons are being duly drawn. Iran's official media have already cheered the choice of what they call this ""anti-Israel"" nominee. And they fully understand what his nomination signals regarding administration resolve about stopping them from going nuclear.

The rest of the world can see coming the Pentagon downsizing -- and the inevitable, commensurate decline of U.S. power. Pacific Rim countries will have to rethink reliance on the counterbalance of the U.S. Navy and consider acquiescence to Chinese regional hegemony. Arab countries will understand that the current rapid decline of post-Kissinger U.S. dominance in the region is not cyclical but intended to become permanent.

Hagel is a man of no independent stature. He's no George Marshall or Henry Kissinger. A fringe senator who left no trace behind, Hagel matters only because of what his nomination says about Obama.

However the Senate votes on confirmation, the signal has already been sent. Before Election Day, Obama could only whisper it to his friend Dmitry. Now, with Hagel, he's told the world."

(CNN) - A Congressional seat from Louisiana will remain in Republican hands - although that was never in question.

With 99% of the vote in, the state's Secretary of State announced a winner in a special election for Louisiana's 5th district that pitted Republican against Republican.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

With 60% of the vote, Vance McAllister, a 39-year old businessman and political newcomer, defeated state Sen. Neil Riser, who lost with 40%.

The election was a run-off after an October 19 open primary with more than a dozen candidates, where Riser and McAllister finished in first and second place, at 32% and 18%, respectively.

Both men ran on strong anti-liberal, anti-Washington platforms, including vows to repeal Obamacare.

""A self-made businessman and Louisiana native, Vance’s priorities of fiscal responsibility and accountability will be an excellent addition to Louisiana’s delegation here in Washington,"" said National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Greg Walden, R-Oregon, in a statement.

""I look forward to working with Vance as we fight back against ObamaCare and this Administration’s expensive, big-government, tax and spend policies.”

The seat was vacated by six-term Congressman Rodney Alexander. This summer, Alexander announced he would not run for reelection in 2014, only to bump up his departure and resign effective September 27. He has since joined Gov. Bobby Jindal's administration as the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Veterans Affairs.

""It is clear that the people of the Fifth Congressional District rejected the extreme policies of the state and national Democrat party. Once again, the voters of the Fifth Congressional District have decided to send a conservative Republican to represent them in the nation's capitol,"" said Louisiana Republican Party Chair Roger Villere in a statement.

""Mary Landrieu should take special notice of the results of this election. This race proves that Louisianians want leaders who will shake up the liberal establishment in Washington.""

The race gained some considerable media attention when TV star Willie Robertson from ""Duck Dynasty"" was floated as a potential candidate. He went on to campaign for McAllister, calling him his ""good buddy"" in an Internet ad.

When it comes to medical care, men always get the short end of the long end of the scope. You see, folks, up until now, health insurance in America has always struck a delicate balance. Women paid higher premiums than men, and in return, men paid less. (audience laughter) The system worked. But now, folks, all that's changing.



STEVE DOOCY (8/27/2013): Obamacare will have men and women paying the same amount for health care, but since women live longer and have babies, shouldn't they pay more? DR. JANE HUGHES (9/24/2013): Under the new law, they're including essential health benefits. And those essential health benefits include maternity, pediatric dental and vision, contraceptive services, and free birth control pills — none of which a young man needs or wants.

Did you catch that? Under Obamacare, men will pay the same amount as women, and yet we still don't get to pass a cantaloupe with toenails through our genitals. (audience laughter)

Fox Business host and Madame Tussauds' wax figure of himself John Stossel reminds us why the ladies should pay more.



JOHN STOSSEL (10/31/2013): You ought to be able to charge people who use the services more, more! ... Women go to the doctor much more often than men. Maybe they're smarter, or maybe they're hypochondriacs. They live longer, who knows?

Yeah, ladies, ladies, come on. No, ladies, ladies love going to the doctor. Who knows why? Maybe they're pretending they're extras on Grey's Anatomy, I don't know. They're suckers for that stuff.

And Fox News chief urologist Dr. David Samadi gives us a real world example of the ladies' doctor addiction.



8/27/2013: DR. DAVID SAMADI: That's not a really fair system. She sees her doctor all the time. When was the last time you went to see your doctor? BRIAN KILMEADE: Two years ago. DR. DAVID SAMADI: Exactly. And you? Last week. GRETCHEN CARLSON: I've had Lyme disease for the last 10 days, so.... DR. DAVID SAMADI: That's what happens. So you're basically paying for her.

It's not fair. And folks, it's no wonder the brown-haired guy who's not Steve Doocy won't go to the doctor, he hates wearing that cone.

And folks, he's not alone. The Fox doc explained the obvious reason why all men always go to the doctor less.



DR. DAVID SAMADI (8/27/2013): We're using the health care system much less. You know, also, our bodies are completely different. ... We only have the prostate. Women have the breasts, they have the ovaries, they have the uterus. They get checked in every part.

(wild audience laughter)

You know, you gotta squint. You gotta kind of squint to make out what's really going on down there. It's like one of those Magic Eye posters. They say there's a little man in a boat, but I've never found it. (audience laughter)

I tell you what, fellas, I tell you what. As long as we're footing the bill for all this lady maintenance, I say we demand pap smears! (audience laughter) OK? Hey, hey! It's guy-necologist, not gal-necologist. (audience laughter) I say we make them find a place to stick that speculum. They're the doctors."

Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, questioned whether that DOJ decision was ""politically motivated.""

The original allegation was one of several in a letter from J. Russell George, the inspector general who oversees the IRS, to Grassley. For the first time, George revealed claims that IRS officials targeted political candidates for audits, and that, separately, donor or candidate tax information was improperly accessed or disclosed.

To date, the IRS scandal has focused mainly on the agency's practice of targeting conservative groups for additional scrutiny as they applied for nonprofit status.

And for the first time, the letter also raised questions about the Justice Department's role in allegations of IRS misconduct.

More On This...

In one case, George said in his letter, ""we presented evidence of a willful unauthorized access to the Department of Justice, but the case was declined for prosecution.""

Grassley has since written a letter to Holder asking for details on who made the decision not to prosecute and why.

In a written statement, he questioned whether the Justice Department had an ulterior motive in not pursuing the case.

""The IRS is required to act with neutrality and professionalism, not political bias,"" he said. ""The Justice Department should answer completely and not hide behind taxpayer confidentiality laws to avoid accountability for its decision not to prosecute a violation of taxpayer confidentiality laws.""

He continued: ""The public needs to know whether the decision not to prosecute these violations was politically motivated and whether the individuals responsible were held accountable in any other way.""

Reached for comment, a Justice Department spokesman said: ""We have received the letter and are reviewing it.""

The letter from the inspector general did not say which political candidates or donors may have been affected. He confirmed only that the alleged incidents happened since 2006. This would have spanned the presidencies of both George W. Bush and Barack Obama.

In the case of the unauthorized access or disclosures, George said his office initially found eight cases, but determined four of them were not supported by evidence. In three of the remaining cases, his office found that ""unauthorized access or disclosure"" happened but was ""inadvertent.""

In the fourth case, though, his office found evidence that the access was ""willful.""

George also confirmed two cases ""involving allegations that the IRS targeted for audit candidates for public office."" He said his office is still reviewing those allegations.

It's unclear who was affected by these incidents. Grassley originally asked the inspector general for information following a news report on Republican donors stepping forward to claim they had been audited by the IRS."

On the walls of Jay Carney’s office: a photo of the Berlin Wall being dismantled. Snaps of his kids. His employer, President Obama, gracing the cover of his former employer, Time magazine. A tier of clocks labeled London, Baghdad, Beijing.

And below that, a framed copy of “Bee Thousand,” Carney’s favorite album by his favorite band, Guided by Voices. Those black scribbles? Lead singer Robert Pollard’s autograph.

“It’s pretty awesome,” Carney says, sounding half-proud, half-exhausted.

It’s Wednesday afternoon in the West Wing and the White House press secretary has been trundling through some of the most punishing days of his career. Benghazi and the IRS have kept Carney scrambling, and he hasn’t had much time to listen to “English Little League,” the latest album from the Ohio indie-rock band he has affectionately name-dropped in more than one news briefing.

The first time was a flub, with Carney invoking Guided by Voices guitarist Mitch Mitchell when he meant to name Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Happens all the time.

The second time was a shout out, with Carney describing Dayton, Ohio, as “the home of the Wright brothers, the Dayton Peace Accords and Guided by Voices, the greatest rock-and-roll band in the modern era.”

No one in the press corps challenged him on the last part — “It’s not a particularly music-oriented crowd out there,” Carney says — and the high praise quickly made its way back to the band.

“Obviously the word ‘wow’ came to mind,” Pollard writes in an e-mail. “Of course, anyone who likes my music means a lot to me but it’s even a little more special when it’s coming from a very seriously high echelon of thinkers like those cats in the White House.”

These days, Pollard dodges the media in ways that Carney probably wishes he could. The 55-year-old frontman hasn’t given an interview since 2011, but evidence of his beer-soaked brilliance springs eternal.

Formed in 1983, Guided by Voices would become one of the most prolific and beloved lo-fi indie acts of the ’90s — a cult band whose cult includes Eddie Vedder, Steven Soderbergh, Chloe Sevigny, the Strokes and the White House press secretary. “English Little League” is the group’s 20th studio album, and Pollard is scheduled to release his 19th solo album, “Honey Locust Honky Tonk,” in July. Although the band doesn’t have any Washington tour dates on the calendar, should Pollard ever be invited to a beer summit in the Rose Garden, he promises to drink twice as much as the president and Carney.

Carney, who has fronted “terrible, terrible” garage bands since his adolescence, says he always has been drawn to the idea of regular dudes making extraordinary rock-and-roll. But above all, Guided by Voices songs simply make him happy.

“I just think Pollard is brilliant and funny and has a level of creativity in abundance that is just astonishing. It’s all essential listening if you can keep up with his production,” he says. “I used to until I had this job.”

Carney, 48, fell for Guided by Voices in 1995, two years after returning to Washington from Moscow, where he was reporting for Time. He was hosting a party with journalist John Heilemann when a pack of pals rolled in from the Black Cat. Carney remembers them saying, “ ‘We have just seen the greatest show ever in the history of rock-and-roll!’ ”

The next summer, Carney caught Guided by Voices on a parking lot side stage at the annual HFStival outside RFK Stadium. “Far from their best,” Carney says of the performance, but it didn’t stop him and his friends from trekking to see the band at New York’s Irving Plaza and a shabby Philadelphia club that Carney remembers as “a hallway at the end of which bands played.”

Over the years, some of Carney’s superfan travel buddies have doubled as his bandmates. They gather once every year or two under names such as the Shirlington Temples and Cash Bar Wedding to record songs that Carney promises nobody will ever hear. The lineup includes Eli Attie, a television writer and former special assistant to Bill Clinton; David Segal, a New York Times reporter and former Washington Post pop music critic; Post contributor Dave McKenna; and deputy national security adviser Antony Blinken, who helped Carney land a spot in then-Sen. Joseph Biden’s media office in 2008.

So if you look at Carney’s career path in a “Lost” sort of way, he may never have been hired as the president’s mouthpiece in 2011 had Guided by Voices not thrown down so hard at the Black Cat in 1995.

White House communications director Jennifer Palmieri taps on the door of Carney’s office and glides in wearing a smile. “Is this, like, the greatest thing ever for you?” she asks.

“This interview is going until midnight,” Carney says — but of course it won’t because the spokesman for the most powerful man on the planet has another meeting in 10 minutes. But he promises to download “English Little League” and e-mail his thoughts in the morning.

And he does: “Every GBV album contains at least a few songs I know will stay on my playlist for years. ‘Flunky Minnows’ is one of those. Kind of like ‘Unsinkable Fats Domino.’ Just another pop-rock gem. I hope they keep at it. For sheer creative abundance, Bob is in a class of his own.”

She Writes About News', 'Politics', 'Culture. Her Columns Appear On Wednesday', 'Sunday. Twitter']","San Diego can’t seem to shake Mayor Filner, a.k.a. Headlock Bob","SAN DIEGO -- Mayor Bob Filner has put the entire city of San Diego in one of his trademark headlocks.

Seven of nine City Council members, countless members of the local Democratic establishment, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee and U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein have demanded his resignation after seven women stepped forward to accuse the 70-year-old of multiple instances of unwanted, sexually charged touching. Two recall efforts have been launched.

Filner has admitted he has a problem, has apologized to the citizens of San Diego and the women he has “offended,” and has claimed in a Univision television interview that he has a “monster … inside me.” But, he maintains, he has not sexually harassed anyone.

So he’s hanging in there.

Amazingly, no one of any gravitas has stepped forward with a full-throated defense of the man. How could that be? He represented this area in Congress for 20 years and was a member of the San Diego City Council for six years before that.

Could it be because he is brusque, truculent, unpleasant to work for and given to inappropriate outbursts? His awfulness inspires extreme metaphors. One of his political enemies told reporter Liam Dillon of the Voice of San Diego that Filner is not just an [vulgar singular epithet] but “the Grand Canyon of [vulgar plural epithet].” Sorry I can’t spell it out, but use your imagination.

Don Harrison, a longtime friend of Filner who is editor of San Diego Jewish World, suggested in a column that Filner’s lack of support may be something the mayor wishes to ponder when he leaves for two weeks of behavioral rehab, scheduled to start Aug. 5.

Harrison created a list of 18 questions Filner should ask himself. Coming in at No. 13: “After all the good I have done in the political world, why has my support melted away so quickly? Are character issues — on which I now see I clearly have fallen short — more important than policy issues?”

Dillon, who has covered Filner for several years, offered this theory Monday: “He has upset so many people over the years that when it came time for someone to step in front of the bus for him, there was no one because he’d thrown them all under the bus already.”

Like many reporters, Dillon said he has often found the mayor’s candor and humor refreshing, but he has also had his share of Filner weirdness. Twice, Dillon said, the mayor has gently slapped him in the face for no apparent reason. The first slap occurred after a news conference in December 2011, when then-Rep. Filner received a union endorsement in his quest for mayor.

“I’d never had anyone hit me while I was doing my job before,” Dillon told me. “I was sort of taken aback.” Filner did it again sometime later at City Hall. “I put my finger in his face and said, ‘You’re not allowed to do that,’ ” Dillon said. “It never happened again.”

(Sam Hodgson, a Voice of San Diego photographer who witnessed the first slap, said he told a Filner staffer, “Your candidate just slapped our government reporter in the face.”)

San Diegans are not holding out much hope that the mayor’s rehab will be successful.

In an automated telephone survey released Friday, 67% said Filner should resign. Sixty percent said he should be recalled if he stays in office, and 74% said they believe the allegations are true. The unscientific survey, noting that the city attorney has asked that Filner never be alone with a woman while he is on city business, asked whether that affects his ability to run the city. Sixty-eight percent said it does.

Still, Headlock Bob is hanging in there.

And why shouldn’t he? In an awesome display of civic-mindedness, the chief executive of San Diego’s largest newspaper suggested last week at a community meeting that the politically conservative paper would not call for the liberal Filner’s resignation because the story is good for circulation, according to the San Diego Reader.

“I’ve got to be a little selfish,” said U-T San Diego CEO John Lynch, whose paper has been at odds with Filner for years. The mayor’s troubles, he said, are a “gift that keeps giving.”

And in an awesome display of chutzpah, Filner has asked the City Council to pay his legal bills in connection with the sexual harassment lawsuit brought by his former communications director, Irene McCormack Jackson. The council has invited public testimony Tuesday evening before it votes on the request in a closed session.

Meanwhile, two San Diegans have launched separate but equally dubious recall efforts.

One, Stampp Corbin, editor of the LGBT Weekly, is a longtime Filner supporter who may or may not have launched his recall in an effort to gum up an apparently more sincere effort announced Monday evening by Republican land-use consultant and longtime Filner foe Michael Pallamary.

(It’s getting hard to find a normal news conference in this town right now. On Monday, with a “No more Grabby Grabby” sign in the background, Pallamary, in a cringe-worthy move, trotted out his 8- and 10-year-old grandchildren to tell reporters they support their “Poppy.”)

Even if either recall effort gathers the more than 100,000 signatures needed to get a measure on the ballot, San Diego’s municipal recall code conflicts with state law, and would have to be amended by the City Council, which is about to go into its August recess.

As local television legal analyst Dan Eaton told NBC 7 here, on the off chance that a recall petition does qualify for the ballot, “You’re more likely looking at Christmas, and it might be well into 2014 before San Diegans get a chance to vote.”

What can the city do but cry uncle?

Well, a girl can dream, can’t she?

You know how it goes. You wake up smiling at the memory of love, and then you realize that the nose nuzzling your neck belongs to the dog that needs to go out. It is not, in fact, your birthday. And you have not, alas, been notified that a recently discovered document at Buckingham Palace identifies you as the rightful heir to a vast fortune and several well-managed countries.

Which is to say, Congress went home without doing much of anything.

As everyone knows, Republicans are to blame. They are the obstructionists, the just-say-no enemies of women, immigrants, health care for the poor, shoes for the born and equality for gay whales, to mention a few.

This “narrative,” as they say, is pure propaganda. President Obama achieved huge legislative victories (Obamacare, Dodd-Frank, bailouts, two Supreme Court appointments) when he had hefty majorities in Congress. Once those margins were lost or reduced in the 2010 election, the president’s focus shifted to scoring political points by shouting, “Obstruction!” In truth, no serious efforts have been made toward compromise because it is in neither side’s political interest.

This is not to say that the GOP is problem-free. Far from it. The tea party/libertarian express poses a serious threat to the party and, therefore, the nation. (Don’t we really want two healthy parties?) Then again, stepping back just a tad, what we’re witnessing is perhaps an inevitable generational realignment.

Think maverick.

Remember when John McCain was the bad boy, always going his own way? Thinking for himself? Talking candidly with the press? (Out of respect for seniority, we’ll lurch past his temporary lapse of judgment in 2008.)

Actually, McCain wasn’t that much of a maverick, a nickname first suggested in 1989 by Dan Casey, then- executive director of the American Conservative Union, which consistently gave the senator respectable marks for conservative votes.

Today, as time would have it, McCain is Mr. Establishment. He not only lunches with the enemy but dines with the president. Isn’t this how life goes? Teenagers eventually grow up and become their parents. McCain is the GOP grandpa swatting at ankle-biting upstarts such as fellow Sens. Ted Cruz and Rand Paul.

They are the new, out-of-the-box mavericks. And the squabbles that threaten to shut down the government come Oct. 1 may be part of a larger generational struggle to redefine the party. Suicide isn’t as catchy as “Winning!” — but, as Rush Limbaugh has suggested, at least it’s a stand.

Caption The Post cartoonist collects her cartoons from the 43rd president’s time in office. Nov. 8, 2000 Ann Telnaes Wait 1 second to continue.

Cruz and Paul, whom McCain once called “wacko birds,” have threatened to shut down the government unless Obamacare is defunded. (On Friday, McCain said that both Cruz and Paul would be “viable” presidential candidates in 2016. Hardly a ringing endorsement, but — something.)

Obviously, Obama won’t sign off on a budget that defunds his chief achievement. But the alternative of Republicans reforming Obamacare isn’t appealing because they don’t want to help save it. The threatened shutdown, however, is more tilting at windmills than slingshots against giants.

Either Cruz and Paul have sincerely deluded themselves about the political consequences of a shutdown or, plausibly, they don’t really think they can cause a shutdown and would never have to suffer the consequences. Meanwhile, they score political points with the base by blaming the GOP “sellouts” when the establishment adults keep the trains running on time.

Even if these newbie mavericks were successful in their defunding effort, it would only be a temporary “win,” since funding comes up annually. Moreover, such a temporary victory would give Democrats a far-reaching advantage. Thereafter, responsibility for any dissatisfaction with the health care system would shift to the GOP.

Alternatively, the old maverick could prevail.

Dropping from his cockpit, the flight-suited McCain strides toward the microphone, pausing briefly to high-five wingman Lindsey Graham and crew member Kelly (Ayotte, not McGillis), and announces: “We passed a bipartisan budget today that ends sequestration, includes significant spending cuts and a tax overhaul. Eleven million illegal immigrants have been invited to become legal residents and begin a rigorous path toward citizenship. We have accepted Disney World’s offer to revamp the nation’s infrastructure and mass transportation systems. With the president’s blessing, Switzerland has agreed to fix Obamacare. That’s it. Enjoy the rest of your summer.”

In our dreams.

(CNN) - David Grosso, 42, was born and raised in the metropolitan Washington area so it's not tough to see why he's a diehard Washington Redskins fan. Been going to games since he was a boy. Season ticket holder.

But Grosso, like so many others, objects to the name and mascot of his favorite team.

""The term Redskins is a racist and derogatory term,"" he says.

These days, Grosso has the power to do something more than air his opinion. He was elected to the D.C. Council in November, and he plans to introduce a resolution Wednesday to rename the team to the Washington Redtails. That's a tribute to the Tuskegee Airmen, though, Grosso says, there are plenty of redtail hawks in the area.

He's open to other suggestions. He just wants the current name gone.

""District residents and their elected representatives should not tolerate commercial or other use of derogatory terminology relating to any people’s racial identity, or which dishonors any person’s race, or which dishonors the name Washington,"" Grosso's resolution says.

Grosso says his hometown, named after the nation's first president, has been dishonored by association with what many Native Americans call the R-word because it's just as offensive as the N-word.

“A good many Americans don’t know any Indians,” says Kevin Gover, who heads the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of the American Indian. “The Indian you see most often in Washington, D.C., is at a football game - at the expense of real Indians, real history, real culture. The petty stereotype has become expected.”

Grosso says he has the support of eight of the council's 13 members; two more are leaning his way, he says. He has been circulating his proposed resolution to them ahead of a formal introduction. Grosso expects the resolution to pass, after which he will make sure team owner Daniel Snyder sees it.

Snyder has been quiet on the issue and thus far resisted, though efforts to get the name changed have gathered steam in recent months.

Amanda Blackhorse, a 31-year-old Navajo social worker, went to Washington in March to attend a hearing of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. She has petitioned to cancel the Redskins trademark on grounds that the name is racist. Suzan Shown Harjo filed a similar petition in 1992 and won, but later lost in the appeals process.

Also in March, several lawmakers introduced a bill in Congress that would amend the Trademark Act of 1946 to ban the term “redskin” in a mark because it is disparaging of native people. Among the sponsors of the bill is civil rights activist Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia.

If passed, the bill would force the Washington football team to discard its trademarked name and ban the use of any offensive term in any future trademarks.

At least one player felt the name change campaign was going overboard. Star quarterback Robert Griffin III said this on Twitter: ""In a land of freedom we are held hostage by the tyranny of political correctness.""

As of 6 p.m., more than 3,000 people had retweeted it.

Story highlights Abandoned churches, prisons, asylums are the stars of the photo book ""States of Decay"" Photographers Daniel Marbaix and Daniel Barter found their subjects in America's Rust Belt A shared fascination with old buildings brought the photographers together

(CNN) —

British photographers and self-described “urban explorers” Daniel Marbaix and Daniel Barter see beauty amid the desolation of abandoned buildings.

Their shoots have brought them to defunct factories, mines and houses of worship around the world, from their native England to Japan. For their first book, they captured the forgotten structures of the eastern United States: ruins of churches and theaters in New York City, derelict train stations, asylums and factories in the Rust Belt.

Images from “States of Decay,” published in July, evoke different reactions, especially the book’s cover. Shot by Barter, it shows an American flag hanging over a defaced frieze of the Last Supper. Barter said the image reflects the separation of church and state in a reference to American politics.

Citing an “explorers’ code,” the photographers chose not to provide specific information about the locations of their shoots. Indeed, the decaying structure may or may not reflect a general decline in the surrounding area, regardless of the state of the structure.

A shared fascination with old buildings brought the photographers together. Barter’s love of old buildings started as a child. Growing up in North London, he and a few friends would climb a fence after school and play inside a derelict airplane.

“The combination of leather and shiny metal switches was a formative experience for me,” said Barter, 29. “If I close my eyes, I can almost still smell it.” When he grew older, Barter studied restoration art in college, and that knowledge transformed his interest into a job as a professional photographer.

Meanwhile, Marbaix studied zoology at Royal Holloway, University of London, and somehow fell in love with photography.

“My courses seemed to just spill over into exploring the urban environment and that led to photography,” said Marbaix, 33. “I have not looked back since.”

When the two first met through friends in a pub in London of 2011, they were competing photographers. But after they learned of their mutual interest in taking photos of “older building and artifacts,” a friendship developed that has led to many adventures, for work and pleasure – often both.

Poking around abandoned buildings has led to a few close calls with authorities, the “Dan duo” said. The mixture of luck and adrenaline has concocted a slew of comical memories for the pair as well as some great shots.

Although many of their shoots might appear to be planned and organized, most of the time they’re produced during holidays and trips with friends and family.

“There is not a method to the madness. We just do whatever we feel like,” Marbaix said.

While they continue to work on projects centered on the unseen and unfamiliar in Britain, they’re looking forward to more adventures.

“We are told that we are too old to be doing this sort of thing,” said Marbaix. “But honestly I could care less. My mother loves it and that’s all that matters.”"

Updated 5:49 p.m. ET Friday 5/31

Washington (CNN) – The Internal Revenue Service has told House GOP investigators they have identified 88 IRS employees who may have documents relevant to the congressional investigation into targeting of conservative groups, according to a congressional source familiar with the investigation.

The IRS asked these employees to preserve all the ""responsive documents"" on their computers, and it has been in the process of collecting it all to comply with congressional requests for information. The IRS missed its May 21st deadline to turn over documents to the House Ways and Means Committee.



The same source said the IRS argues it missed its deadline because of the scope of documents it is collecting.

The request for documents was a bipartisan one, but Republicans are privately preparing to seize on the fact that if nearly 90 IRS employees may have been somehow involved in this targeting, it is evidence that the controversy extends well beyond the mistakes by a few low level employees.

However, with no documents in hand, there is no way to know how many of the employees being asked to preserve documents were truly involved in the activity in question. The IRS, in a statement to CNN, said the large number reflects its effort to ensure they are as responsive as possible to the Congressional requests.

""The IRS and Acting Commissioner Danny Werfel are moving aggressively and taking the data requests very seriously. As a precautionary measure, the IRS is casting a wide net to capture any potentially related materials. Our goal is to be exceedingly thorough during this process to ensure we identify any and all pertinent records,"" the IRS statement said. ""The IRS has received numerous congressional requests involving an extensive set of questions and calls for data. Responding to these requests is a top priority for us. We have been in contact with committee staff, and we continue to provide them updates as we diligently work through these requests.""

The IRS is responding to multiple Congressional requests for information and struggling to meet the deadlines. According to a Senate Finance Committee aide, the IRS told the committee it will also miss Friday's deadline to produce documents relevant to the tea party targeting.

In a joint statement from the press offices of Sens. Max Baucus and Orrin Hatch, the committee's Democratic chairman and its top Republican, said they were disappointed and that the agency needed to do better.

""This is an agency that revolves around making the American taxpayer meet hard deadlines each and every year when they file their taxes, oftentimes penalizing those that are late,"" the statement said.

More problems are on the horizon for the IRS. Rep. Darrell Issa, who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, will hold a hearing next week on an audit of the agency's ""spending culture and conference abuses.""

The committee will focus on the report released by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) that shows excessive spending at IRS conferences.

Werfel said in a statement that the report will focus on an IRS conference that took place in 2010 and labeled it an ""unfortunate vestige from a prior era.""

""While there were legitimate reasons for holding the meeting, many of the expenses associated with it were inappropriate and should not have occurred,"" he said, adding new rules have been put in place and such a conference will not happen under his watch."

If this were happening in any other country, Americans would be aghast. A sentence of life in prison, without the possibility of parole, for trying to sell $10 of marijuana to an undercover officer? For sharing LSD at a Grateful Dead concert? For siphoning gas from a truck? The punishment is so extreme, so irrational, so wildly disproportionate to the crime that it defies explanation. And yet this is happening every day in federal and state courts across the United States. Judges, bound by mandatory sentencing laws that they openly denounce, are sending people away for the rest of their lives for committing nonviolent drug and property crimes. In nearly 20 percent of cases, it was the person’s first offense.

This is what happens when politics is focused on fear. Forty years of getting ""tougher on crime"" and pretending that things were getting ever worse even as real crime statistics were trending steadily down has brought us to this state of tragic idiocy.

Fourth and long! — but he remains strangely sportsmanlike. “We fumbled the rollout on this health-care law,” he admitted at Thursday afternoon’s news conference. “I am very frustrated, but I’m also somebody who, if I fumbled the ball, you know, I’m going to wait until I get the next play, and then I’m going to try to run as hard as I can and do right by the team.” ... on the broader question of whether Obama can rebuild an effective presidency after this debacle, it’s starting to look as if it may be game over. The record for recent second-term presidents is not good: Reagan had Iran-contra, Clinton had impeachment and Bush had Katrina and Iraq. Once a president suffers a blow such as Obama is now suffering with his health-care law — in which the public not only disapproves of a president’s actions but starts to take a negative view of him personally — it is difficult to recover.

What were we talking about last week? Oh yeah, how the Government shutdown had doomed the Republicans. In a town where the average memory reaches back ten minutes or less, everyone gets a second act. I'm not writing any obituaries.

The Washington Post editorial board complains about the GOP efforts to block Medicaid expansion. Let me say that again: The Washington Post editorial board complains about blocked Medicaid expansion.

“Arizonans are losing the health-care plans they love. The doctors they know. And millions still remain uninsured,” blares a political advertisement in Arizona, part of a multimillion-dollar anti-Obamacare campaign funded by conservative group Americans for Prosperity and running in swing congressional districts. Despite the ad’s clear intent to deceive, it makes a good point — just not one that should hurt those who favored the law, or those who are trying to help it succeed. The latest estimate by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reckons that 55 million non-elderly people in the United States lack health insurance; after the law phases in fully, there will be around 31 million. Last year, the CBO figured that the number of non-elderly uninsured after the phase-in would be lower — 27 million. Is the worsening outlook more evidence that the Affordable Care Act is a fundamentally flawed reform? That government is incapable of organizing the insurance system in a more rational way? That the Obama administration is incompetent? None of the above. Unfortunately, the health-care law will not quite achieve universal coverage in the United States, for a variety of reasons. The law doesn’t cover illegal immigrants, for example. Most of these reasons were easy to anticipate as lawmakers hammered out the policy, leaving to a later Congress the work of extending coverage to all. But a factor that the law’s authors couldn’t foresee was Republican intransigence combined with last year’s Supreme Court ruling. The justices proclaimed that states could opt out of an expansion of Medicaid, a partnership between states and the federal government that provides health care to poor people. The law aimed to cover a larger percentage of low-income people by raising Medicaid’s eligibility limits across the country, with the federal government paying for nearly all of the cost. It was a bargain that no state leader should have passed up. Yet Republican politicians have blocked Medicaid expansion in half the states.

Why? Well... don't look for reasons that show, you know,. Just like the punishing food policy, and the senseless policy of lifetime sentencing for petty crime, the purpose of limiting Medicaid expansion is simply to hurt people. That's not a side effect, it's the goal.

Leonard Pitts looks back 150 years to the greatest speech in American history, and to words that were intended to heal, not harm.

When it was his turn, Abraham Lincoln stood in that cemetery in Gettysburg, a town whose walls were still pitted with bullet holes from the great battle four months before and whose heart was still scarred with the memory of bodies lying twisted, bloated and mangled in the rain. “Four score and seven years ago,” he said in that high, piping twang, “our fathers brought forth upon this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.” In a speech lasting just two minutes, he grappled with the challenge of defining America. It is noteworthy that the second greatest thing any American ever said echoed the first. Standing at Lincoln’s shrine a century later, Martin Luther King noted his “symbolic shadow” and his signing of the Emancipation Proclamation “five score years ago.” And when he said, “I have a dream,” the first dream King articulated was that “one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.”

It you're already feeling a little bored with the history lesson... suck it up and read those words again. Lincoln came closer to the heart of what Americathan anyone before or since. And go read the rest of Pitts' column, which is one of his best.

Rebecca Solnit Shows how the language of hate only compounds disaster.

A lie repeated often and confidently enough can become widely mistaken for the truth, becoming a belief that obscures the facts. False beliefs about disaster follow this model; their poison is concentrated in a few oft-deployed words, notably ""mobs,"" ""panic"" and ""looting."" This poison is being poured out over the disaster zones of the Philippines right now as misleading coverage threatens to become its own disaster, augmenting the existing one. Attempts at survival are not criminal acts, yet that is how they are often portrayed in news reports suggesting the problem is out-of-control mobs or looting rather than that the largest typhoon ever to make landfall has left thousands dead and tens, perhaps hundreds of thousands, without food, water or medical care. We have headlines like these: ""Video Shows Looting in Tacloban Store"" (from Euronews); ""Looting, Gunfire Erupts in Typhoon-Hit Philippines"" (the New York Post); and ""Desperate Philippine Survivors Turn to Looting"" (the Chicago Tribune). ... Why does this misrepresentation matter? Thanks to bad journalism, many readers come to believe that the storm victims are criminals or thugs or mobs and that the situation is savage rather than tragic. That can affect relief aid, and it can also provide cover for a government to take the chaos of the storm as a chance to shift priorities — maybe suspend the constitution, impose long-term martial law, prevent aid from reaching the victims or bring violence rather than help. Governments may do this partly because they believe the media stories. Thanks in part to rumor-mongering and demonizing in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, many people in power were willing to believe the worst of New Orleans' residents. Stories suggested that survivors were shooting at helicopters and killing refugees in the Superdome, and the retractions that eventually came were too late to matter. The media can whip up another layer of suffering and destruction on top of an already dire situation, and they often have. Right now, they appear to be doing so again.

This is another strong piece that deserves to be read in full.

Graham Lawton presents seven animals made extinct by humans.

Until recently, the great auk was thought to be the only extinct species whose final moments were recorded for posterity. On 2 June 1844, three men clambered onto Eldey, a rocky island off the coast of Iceland. The next day, they captured and strangled a breeding pair of great auks and smashed the egg they were incubating. The carcasses were sold to a collector – the last of this magnificent bird, mercilessly hunted to extinction for its meat, eggs and pelts. However, it now seems that this large flightless seabird – the ""penguin of the north"" – survived a bit longer. A sighting off the Canadian island of Newfoundland in 1852 is accepted as genuine.

Just one of seven in today's gallery."

That’s not much of a good-faith effort. Though Mr. Obama expressed approval that “cooler heads” were prevailing in the House, according to his press secretary, Jay Carney, he also made it clear that the offer needs to include an end to the shutdown.

Postponing default by raising the debt ceiling for five or six weeks offers only momentary relief, and refusing to do so would have been unthinkable. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew told the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday that the public’s retirement savings and benefits were at serious risk if Republicans left the debt ceiling unchanged. Business leaders — the traditional constituency of the Republicans until the Tea Party muscled them out of the way — have been pressuring leaders to change course.

A default would roil the global bond market, push up interest rates, and almost certainly produce another recession. Although Mr. Boehner grandly pronounced the six-week delay to be a major concession, the same danger will stare Congress in the face before Thanksgiving."

(CNN) —

Robert Redford says bigotry, fear of change and a determination to personally destroy President Barack Obama have paralyzed the U.S. government.

Women and young people are the answer to fixing the gridlock that has partially shut down Washington, the actor told CNN on Tuesday.

“Give them the reins,” Redford said. “I think they can do better than we have.”

Redford, 77, sat down with CNN’s Nischelle Turner to talk about his new film, “All Is Lost,” which he agreed could serve as an analogy to the shutdown crisis.

In the movie, Redford plays a lone sailor struggling to stay alive after his sailboat is crippled by a collision with a container ship.

“At a certain point, I think, when things really get awful, when things get really bad and all seems to be lost – there’s no hope, there’s no possibility – then a lot of people quit,” Redford said about his character. “They say, ‘What’s the point?’ and they quit. And others keep going for no other reason than that.”

Opinion: Men dither while women lead

Redford: ‘Why are these people behaving so stupidly?’

The conversation then turned to the drama playing out in Washington, where a standoff between Obama and Republicans in Congress has forced the federal government into a partial shutdown and threatened a default on the U.S. debt.

“It’s so divided now with the people that are so narrow and so limited that they would take us back into the past,” Redford said. “And I was trying to figure out, why are these people behaving so stupidly? Why are they behaving so horribly that it’s crippling our whole country?

“And I think it has to do with fear. I think it’s a group of people that are so afraid of change, and they’re so narrow-minded that some people – when they see change coming – get so threatened by change, they get angry and they get terrorized, and then they get vicious. I think that’s who these people are. They’re so afraid of change that they’re behaving miserably.”

Obama is “a compassionate man who can’t function” in this political environment, Redford said. It “is so decrepit, it is so paralyzed, and the worst of it is it is paralyzed by intention,” he said. “There is a body of congressional people that wants to paralyze the system. I think what sits underneath it, unfortunately, is there’s probably some racism involved, which is really awful.”

Obama’s opponents reject whatever he might propose “because their determination was to destroy this person,” Redford said. “They wanted, if it meant destroying the government, anything to keep him from succeeding.

“I think just the idea of giving credit to this President, giving him credit for anything, is abhorrent to them, so they’ll go against it. Never mind that it’s the better good of the people, never mind that they’re supposed to be in office representing the interest of the public. They’re representing their own self-interests, which is very narrow and in some cases bigoted.”

America’s problem: We’re too dumb

Redford: All is not lost

But, unlike his latest film title, all is not lost, Redford said. He said “something new” is starting to happen that offers hope.

“Susan Collins, who is a Republican, is saying: ‘Enough of this. This is not the job I signed up for. I’ve got to do something,’ ” said Redford, referring to the U.S. senator from Maine. “So she’s bringing a bipartisan group together of women. I think the future should belong more to women and young people.”

Women must save the country “because a lot of men that were in control were behaving stupidly,” Redford said. “I mean, sometimes you say: ‘Can we actually be this dumbed down, or am I actually hearing what I’m hearing from some of these people? Are they really, is that really happening?’ It’s sad.”

Does this mean Redford is already throwing his support behind Hillary Clinton in a 2016 White House bid?

“No, I wouldn’t single out one woman over another,” he said. “I think it’s time to give more women a chance.”

“All Is Lost,” which is almost a silent movie, with its sparse dialogue, hits U.S. theaters next week.

Senate Democrats and President Obama quickly made it clear they had no intention of going along, putting the government on a course toward a shutdown unless one side relents.

The 230-to-189 party-line vote in a bitterly divided House set in motion a fiscal confrontation with significant implications — politically and economically — but with an uncertain ending. Without a resolution, large parts of the government could shut down Oct. 1, and a first-ever default on federal debt could follow weeks later.

Each side predicted that the other would be held responsible, but determined House Republicans knew they were taking a risk even as leaders of the party’s establishment warned about the threat of destructive political consequences.

Mr. Obama called House Speaker John A. Boehner on Friday evening but only to reiterate that he would not negotiate with him on raising the federal debt limit and said it was Congress’s constitutional obligation to pay the nation’s bills. Both sides described the call as brief and fruitless."

This is Washburn from her days as a Philadelphia Eagles cheerleader. She said she made the team on her first tryout.

U.S. Army 1st Lt. Rachel Washburn walks through a village while serving one of two military tours in Afghanistan. Washburn is a Bronze Star recipient and a former Philadelphia Eagles NFL cheerleader from 2007 to 2009. Washburn, who was raised in a military family, is a graduate of Drexel University in Philadelphia.

Story highlights Rachel Washburn grew up with a military father and moved many times She went to college in Philadelphia on an ROTC scholarship She cheered for the Eagles for three seasons A Bronze Star recipient, she served two tours in Afghanistan

(CNN) —

Rachel Washburn once carried pompoms. Now she carries an M4 carbine.

The military brat who became an NFL cheerleader is today a first lieutenant in the United States Army.

On Sunday, she was honored as a Hometown Hero by the Philadelphia Eagles, the team she cheered for from 2007 to 2009.

The Bronze Star recipient served two tours of duty in Afghanistan, including one as a member of the Army’s new Cultural Support Program.

It was a dangerous and stressful job, where she would go on missions with special operations forces and help search and talk to Afghan women and children.

“We could be their voice during missions for engagement to ensure security on objectives, and we could help search and secure the females and the children during missions,” she told the Philadelphia Eagles website.

Spoken like a true soldier – which is not surprising given her father, Lon, served many years in the Army and Air Force as a pilot.

Rachel Washburn, 25, said she learned during her Army training to think of a happy place when confronted by stress. For that, she liked to think of her first game as an Eagles cheerleader. It was a beautiful August day and she was lined up for the pregame dance. It is one of her best memories, she said.

She also recalled fondly her trips to hospitals in Philadelphia and a USO trip to Iraq. Cheerleading is more than just dancing on the sideline and looking pretty, she said.

“We’re all beautiful women who are there to be entertaining at games, but also, we are incredibly involved in the community, which is something that I am incredibly proud of,” she told the Eagles.

Washburn is not a Philly native. She said she is “from a little bit of everywhere” after having moved at least a dozen times while growing up.

But she loved Philadelphia from her visits there and applied for an Army ROTC scholarship at Drexel University. She also joined the dance team.

Her next steps took her to tryouts for the Eagles cheerleading squad. She made the team on her first try.

After she graduated, Washburn joined the Army and went to Afghanistan, where near the end of her first tour she helped deliver a baby during a snowstorm while communicating with medical personnel by radio.

She told USA Today that during her second tour she was a platoon leader of an intelligence unit. She is considering re-enlisting next year, she told the paper.

Her father nominated her for the Eagles honor.

“I watched her go through two tours in Afghanistan and all of the things that she sacrificed,” he said. “It was not a very easy couple of tours and I just really kind of thought, ‘Man, what a homecoming that would be if (the Eagles) recognized her for that.’”

She returned from Afghanistan in November and is stationed at Fort Stewart in Georgia."

The trips, funded by bake sales and other events throughout the year, will allow the students to take in Washington’s historic landmarks.

One premier destination is off-limits this year, however. A few weeks ago, the Obama Administration announced it was suspending public, self-guided tours of the White House as a result of the automatic sequester cuts that the administration proposed in 2011. While America’s students stand outside the White House fence, the First Daughters, Sasha and Malia, are enjoying spring break with friends at the Atlantis Resort on Paradise Island in the Bahamas.

Breitbart News’ Matt Boyle broke the news Monday morning that numerous sources have reported seeing the First Daughters in the Bahamas this weekend. Presumably, the Obamas are paying the costs of the resort out of their own pockets. The robust Secret Service detail that must accompany the First Daughters, however, is funded by taxpayers.

The principal reason the White House canceled public tours was to save money on Secret Service staff. The White House reported that suspending the tours would save $74,000 a week. Other reports have put the savings at just $18,000 a week.

Whichever the true amount, the Secret Service detail necessary to protect the First Daughters on their spring break could likely have been used to keep the White House open to the rest of America’s school children. Judicial Watch reported that Malia Obama’s Spring Break in Mexico last year cost taxpayers over $115,000. That amount would cover 2-6 weeks of White House tours.

At the very least, it would ensure that, this spring break, thousands of America’s students could cap their trip to DC with a uniquely American tradition–a tour of the White House."

Ms. White has a formidable record as a prosecutor from 1993 to 2002, when she was the United States attorney in the Southern District of New York. She also has a stellar reputation as a white-collar defense attorney at Debevoise & Plimpton, where she has been chief of litigation since 2002, representing several of the firms and executives that she would regulate at the S.E.C.

Her résumé in the past decade has understandably alarmed advocates of financial reform, who fear that her work as a defender of Wall Street means that she is dangerously biased in favor of the banks and their deregulatory agenda. Her lack of a deep regulatory background is also a worry at a time when the agency’s top priority is to finish overdue rules to carry out the Dodd-Frank financial reform and other securities laws. Complicating matters further, her husband, John White, is also a corporate lawyer, at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, with his own long list of Wall Street clients.

We understand these concerns but do not believe they are disqualifying. Ms. White is a worthy nominee, though clearly, the White House and Ms. White will have to address the conflicts of interest in her background frankly and persuasively. Equally important, she must be able to demonstrate in her confirmation hearing that she is not captive to the financial industry’s view of the world, which has dominated her recent professional life."

Mr. Rubio has been attacked at Tea Party rallies (his name elicits boos), on conservative radio (“a piece of garbage,” Glenn Beck called him) and in National Review (“Rubio’s Folly,” declared a recent cover).

Still, running interference on Mr. Rubio’s behalf is fraught with risk for conservative groups, who are going against many in their own base.

“We know that there’s a lot of folks on both sides,” said Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity. “But I think the vast majority of people appreciate the fact that Senator Rubio is doing what he thinks is best for the country. And that he’s doing it in an open and honest way.”

Mr. Phillips declined to discuss any implications for Mr. Rubio and 2016, but said, “We think that he’s got a bright future within the movement, and in whatever he chooses to do down the road.”

Many other big players in the conservative movement would like to keep that future bright as well.

Ralph Reed, president of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, invited Mr. Rubio to speak to several hundred of his members at a conference in Washington last month. Mr. Reed, who has made clear that he believes the Senate immigration bill that Mr. Rubio helped write is too lenient, described the crowd as right-leaning, by Republican standards. “Not the Chamber of Commerce variety,” he noted wryly in an interview.

But when he introduced Mr. Rubio, he offered nothing but effusive praise. “We’re proud to count him as our friend because he has not forgotten who got him here,” Mr. Reed told the crowd, which applauded politely. “He has not forgotten who he is.”

Weighing heavily on conservative leaders is a reminder of how immigration policy bedeviled Mitt Romney last year. His “self-deport” comments about what should happen with the 11 million immigrants living illegally in the United States became an easy punch line for Democrats and helped drive Latinos even farther away from the Republican Party."

""Warrior"" that I am, I'll certainly be there Saturday night! Stephen Lemons at New Times reports that the Arizona Tea Party is holding a meeting this weekend to recruit a ""shadow army"" of equally shadowy ""warriors"" who can go ""toe-to-toe"" with voters who intend to sign the petition to recall Sheriff Joe Arpaio. They're looking for a force of about 400 brave warrior souls. Hell, Napoleon retook France with only 1,000 men; with 400 shadowy figures, stopping the recall should be a piece of cake.

The petition's signature gatherers themselves are not in the shadows, but at sunny public places across the county—flea markets, libraries, downtowns, campuses, just about anywhere people congregate. If you're interested in the recall, which the tea party says is coordinated by ""paid progressive socialists,"" here's a link to Respect Arizona's website.

The New Times article quotes the invitation to this Saturday's tea party recruitment gala in its scatterbrained entirety; here's a snapshot:



The purpose of the meeting is to muster and organize a ""shadow army"" of ""shadow warriors"" that are willing to volunteer their time to stand toe-to-toe at the majority of the locations here in Maricopa County where the paid progressive socialists are collecting petition signatures to recall Sheriff Joe.... We need to make sure this abusive and egregious attempt attacking Arizona's Constitution, voter sovereignty and the will of the people here in Arizona and around the Country fails in getting enough signatures. Randy Parraz, Chad Snow and the special interest groups that are behind this recall effort are nothing more than domestic terrorists who are attempting to turn Arizona dark blue so they can further their liberal agenda. These are the same thugs who wrongfully recalled Russell Pearce. We need to stop these people now.

Someone should point out to these nitwits that the ""egregious attempt attacking Arizona's Constitution,"" i.e., the recall, is provided for right there in the Arizona Constitution! If anything, stopping people from exercising their right to sign a petition is the ""abusive"" thing that's ""attacking Arizona's Constitution.""

Dog whistle alert! The ""domestic terrorists"" and ""thugs"" who recalled SB 1070 author Sen. Russell Pearce in 2011 (though not ""wrongfully"") were teachers, priests, seniors, librarians, business leaders and Republicans! Chad Snow, one of the Pearce recall organizers mentioned in the invitation, is a Republican. And the district in Mesa that Sen. Pearce had represented for six terms was heavily GOP and Mormon. Terrorists! Thugs! If anything, Pearce's campaign team practiced thuggery—recruiting a sham candidate to syphon votes away from the eventual winner, Republican Jerry Lewis.

House indicated it will end its term without voting on Sandy relief

A vote on a $60.4 billion aid package had been expected Wednesday

GOP and Democratic House members from N.Y. and N.J. are outraged

WASHINGTON -- House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio indicated late Tuesday the 112th Congress would end its term without voting on federal emergency aid for victims of Superstorm Sandy.

""The speaker is committed to getting this bill passed this month,"" Boehner's spokesman, Brendan Buck, said in an email.

Buck also emailed a news article reporting that Craig Fugate, head of the the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said his agency will not need additional money until spring.

FEMA money will not cover everything needed by states hit by Sandy. Other needs include claims filed under the National Flood Insurance Program, repairs to mass transit and Community Development Block grants needed to help localities rebuild.

Lawmakers from Northeast states had hoped the House would vote Wednesday on the $60.4 billion aid package that passed the Senate on Friday.

If the House leaves the aid package to the next Congress, the new Senate will have to vote on the package again.

News that a House vote would not come this Congress drew outraged responses from Republican and Democratic House members from New York and New Jersey, many of whom went to the floor around 11:30 p.m. Tuesday to express their dismay.

House Democratic Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland said Boehner declined to discuss plans for the Sandy aid vote during Tuesday night's House floor vote on the ""fiscal cliff.""

Hoyer said House Republican Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia told him immediately after the vote he was ""99.9 percent confident"" the Sandy aid package would go the floor, but he was waiting for word from Boehner.

Soon after that, a Boehner aide told Cantor's staff there would be no vote. The message was conveyed to Republican Rep. Peter King of Long Island, who represents the shore communities hard hit by Sandy.

King described the decision to walk away from a Sandy aid vote as inexcusable and wrong.

""I think it's unprecedented for the United States Congress to walk away from a natural disaster,"" King said, adding that he was not given a reason for the postponement. ""This to me is just walking away from responsibility.""

King and Republican Rep. Michael Grimm of Staten Island, who represents some of the hardest-hit neighborhoods, joined Democrats at an impromptu news conference to publicly plead for Boehner to reconsider.

Grimm described himself as ""somewhat in disbelief and almost ashamed,"" adding that he's ""not proud"" of the decision his party has made.

Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey of New York said victims of Sandy shouldn't suffer because of congressional dysfunction.

Democratic Rep. Rush Holt of New Jersey said he wishes he could speak eloquently on the issue, ""but I'm afraid my anger is going to get the better of me.""

""Why would we not help each other as this House has always done?"" he said.

Democratic Rep. Rob Andrews of New Jersey said House leaders have failed the people of New Jersey.

""Our people are in great need of assistance,"" he said. ""Every time we have been called upon to help other areas of the country, we have responded. It is outrageous that our needs are being pushed aside tonight.""

The 113th Congress will be in session Thursday and Friday and then recess for a week."

Edward I. Koch, the former congressman and New York mayor whose wisecracking pugnacity embodied the city he led back from the edge of bankruptcy in the 1970s, died Friday in Manhattan of congestive heart failure, a spokesman said. He was 88.

In three terms as New York’s chief executive from 1978 through 1989, the Democrat’s touchstone achievement was to help revive a city that had defined urban dysfunction.

It was Mr. Koch’s quote-

machine of a persona — his unbridled candor and unyielding chutzpah — that made him a dominant character in a city packed with them.

“How’m I doing?” the mayor liked to bellow as he gallivanted up and down city streets, bald pate bobbing, his arms raised above his lanky frame. He spoke in a whiny, nasal voice that was as New York as the screech of an A train.

In recent years, Mr. Koch had a heart attack and quadruple bypass surgery. He was admitted to New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center this week and died there about 2 a.m. Friday.

The former mayor, always known for his timing, died on the day “Koch,” a documentary about him, was to open at theaters in New York.

“New York City lost an irrepressible icon,” New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (I) said. “Ed helped lift the city out of its darkest days and set it on course for an incredible comeback.”

After an unsuccessful bid to be mayor in 1973, Mr. Koch ran again four years later. He sought the Democratic nomination in a field that included incumbent Abraham Beame, the loquacious Rep. Bella Abzug and the largely unknown Mario Cuomo.

The race was defined by a serial killer known as Son of Sam and a midsummer blackout that triggered widespread looting and made the city a symbol of urban ills.

Against this tumult, Mr. Koch brandished the slogan “A Liberal With Sanity.” He embraced the death penalty as a way of cultivating the political center. Victorious, he rode a city bus to his swearing-in ceremony.

As mayor, Mr. Koch inherited an estimated deficit of $1 billion. Incurring the wrath of unions, he trimmed the payrolls and stabilized the city’s finances. By 1983, New York’s surplus was $500 million.

In his first two terms, Mr. Koch expanded public housing, encouraged development, and restored services.

During a 1980 subway strike, the mayor stood on the Brooklyn Bridge, cheering on commuters forced to hoof it to work. “We’re not going to let these bastards bring us to our knees!” Mr. Koch shouted, referring to the strikers. “People began to applaud,” he recalled later. “I knew I was on to something.”

When his first term ended, Mr. Koch was so popular that the Democratic and Republican parties both endorsed him for reelection. Time magazine put him on its cover, his picture floating above the city’s skyline.

Douglas Muzzio, a professor at New York’s Baruch College, called Mr. Koch the “quintessential New Yorker. He was bigger than life, and had the personality and ego to prove it.”

Riding his popularity, Mr. Koch ran for governor in 1982, but his campaign foundered after Playboy magazine published an interview in which the mayor dismissed suburban living as “sterile” and rural America as a “joke.”

Troubling times

Over the course of his three terms as mayor, Mr. Koch faced three issues that threatened the social fabric of New York and other large cities: homelessness, AIDS and the spread of crack cocaine.

While AIDS activists at the time chided the mayor, saying he was ineffectual, Mr. Koch cited the more than $400 million in government spending he had directed toward the crisis, the housing he ordered built for AIDS patients and his opposition to AIDS discrimination.

His mayoralty also was defined by several racially charged crimes, including one in 1984 in which Bernhard Goetz, a white man dubbed the “Subway Vigilante” in headlines, shot four black men he believed were about to mug him on a subway train. In 1989, a group of black and Hispanic teenagers were accused of raping and beating a white woman jogging in Central Park, an attack that Mr. Koch branded “the crime of the century.” The convictions of the men were later overturned.

The worst personal crisis Mr. Koch would face was in his third term, after he won reelection in 1985.

Corruption scandals impaled many of his political allies, one of whom, Donald Manes, the Queens borough president, committed suicide with a kitchen knife as federal investigators probed allegations that he took bribes. Rudolph W. Giuliani, then a U.S. attorney, led the prosecution, a role that helped launch a political career that culminated in two terms as mayor.

Although Mr. Koch was never implicated, he said that the scandals were the darkest days of his mayoralty. “I said to myself, ‘Is this how I’m going to be remembered?’ ” he said. “I went into a state of depression that no one was aware of.”

New Yorkers grew tired of the mayor’s apparently unceasing need to share his opinions on everything from life in the Soviet Union (“The pits,” he said) to an assessment of his own physique (“I’m a Greek God”).

During the 1988 presidential campaign, he caused a kerfuffle when he said Jews would be “crazy” to vote for the Rev. Jesse Jackson because Jackson had voiced support for Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The mayor’s remark became fodder for critics who derided him as racially polarizing.

The following year, Mr. Koch was defeated in the Democratic primary by David N. Dinkins, who then beat Giuliani during the general election. Dinkins became New York’s first black mayor.

Mr. Koch said his most significant achievement was burnishing the city’s image at a time when New York, with its graffiti-splattered subways and rampant crime, was a national punch line.

“When I came in, people would say they were from Long Island because they were too ashamed to say they were from the city,” Mr. Koch said. “I gave them back their morale.”

Son of a furrier

Edward Irving Koch was born Dec. 12, 1924, in the Bronx, the son of a Jewish immigrant furrier who moved the family to Newark during the Depression. Mr. Koch attended City College of New York but left when he was drafted into the Army during World War II. After his discharge, he received a law degree from New York University.

While practicing law in Manhattan, Mr. Koch became active in a reform group that sought to end the old machine politics in New York.

He scored his first significant political victory in 1963, ousting Carmine DeSapio, an entrenched Tammany Hall politico, as district leader in Greenwich Village. Mr. Koch served on the City Council before winning a seat in the House of Representatives in 1968.

During the 1977 mayoral campaign, Mr. Koch’s otherwise amiable relationship with Mario Cuomo soured when unsigned campaign posters cropped up that read “Vote for Cuomo, Not the Homo,” an allusion to widespread rumors about Mr. Koch’s sexual orientation.

Although Cuomo denied responsibility for the signs, Mr. Koch blamed him and his son, Andrew, who worked on that campaign and is now New York’s governor. Mr. Koch said in later years that the episode tarnished his view of the Cuomos.

Mr. Koch never married and refused to answer questions about his sexual orientation. Still, he sought to neutralize speculation during the 1977 race by campaigning alongside Bess Myerson, the first Jewish woman to win the Miss America title, with whom he was often seen holding hands.

Although Mr. Koch claimed fatigue when he left City Hall, he never grew tired of attention. He wrote novels, memoirs, newspaper columns and movie reviews. He hosted radio and television shows, including “Saturday Night Live.”

Mr. Koch rarely liked to venture far from the city. In 2008, he announced that he had bought a burial plot in New York and planned to spend eternity in the city of his birth.

“The idea of leaving Manhattan permanently irritates me,” he said."

McCain and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) took strong exception to the filibuster, saying they support the possible use of drones to prevent terrorist attacks anywhere in the world. Some Republicans have privately worried that the high-profile stand, while garnering a lot of positive attention, will ultimately be bad for the party.

""You know, I think he's just on the wrong side of history, and on the wrong side of this argument, really,"" Paul responded in a radio interview with former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee Friday afternoon. He said he respected McCain's service and record, but that that experience didn't mean his colleague was always right: ""I treat Sen. McCain with respect. I don't think I always get the same in return.""

McCain himself was unrepentant, telling Michael Medved Friday that Paul's concerns about a drone attack on U.S. civilians not engaged in violent activity were ""ludicrous"" and ""inappropriate,"" as well as a waste of time.

""We spent 13 hours talking about a scenario that won't happen and can't happen,"" McCain said. He subsequently told Fox News that he does think there should be ""more congressional oversight"" of the drone program, which should be brought under the Department of Defense -- but argued that Paul's filibuster was merely a distraction.

Amash, who has sparred with McCain on Twitter before, replied:

Sen McCain called @senrandpaul @sentedcruz & me ""wacko birds."" Bravo, Senator. You got us. Did you come up with that at #DinnerWithBarack? — Justin Amash (@repjustinamash) March 8, 2013

In a statement obtained by Fox News, an NFL spokesman said the league has ""no plans to engage in this area and (has) had no substantive contact with the administration"" about the implementation.

Earlier in the week, Health and Human Services Department officials said they were talking to the NFL, NBA and others about possible advertising campaigns, in the run-up to the launch of a key part of the health care law.

But Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, on Friday wrote to the heads of six professional sports organizations urging them not to take the bait.

""Given the divisiveness and persistent unpopularity of the (health care law), it is difficult to understand why an organization like yours would risk damaging its inclusive and apolitical brand by lending its name to its promotion,"" they wrote.

The senators suggested the administration was reaching out to them because the law is so ""unpopular.""

The NFL's statement late Friday was in response to lawmakers' concerns.

The letters were sent to the heads of the NFL, Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, National Hockey League, Professional Golf Association and NASCAR.

Republicans, who have been largely opposed to the law ever since they tried to kill the legislation back in 2009 and 2010, have in recent months tried to rein in the administration's promotional efforts.

Several GOP lawmakers want investigations into HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius' effort to solicit support from private groups for a non-profit that is promoting the law.

Some of the biggest elements of the health care law are expected to take effect by early 2014. This fall, enrollment begins for a new marketplace -- called exchanges -- of government-regulated insurance plans. The requirement that nearly everyone buy health insurance kicks in at the beginning of 2014.

Despite the controversy over the possibility of the government partnering with sports leagues, this wouldn't be the first occasion the two have linked up.

The military has long engaged in sponsorships with NASCAR, though that relationship encountered hurdles in this age of fiscal austerity. The Army recently decided to drop its sponsorship, though the Air Force did not follow suit."

http://news.yahoo.com/2016-looms-clinton-keeps-supporters-135836058--election.html,,[],"As 2016 looms, Clinton keeps up with supporters","CHICAGO (AP) — Whether she runs for president or not in 2016, Hillary Rodham Clinton is making sure she stays connected to important Democratic constituencies, from college students and black women to the gay and lesbian community.

Clinton has spoken to a women's institute in Pennsylvania, a prominent black women's sorority in the nation's capital, the American Jewish University in Los Angeles and an organization called Chicago House that helps people with HIV and AIDS.

Her fall itinerary includes speeches before college students at three universities in New York, which she represented in the Senate, an award from the Elton John AIDS Foundation, a speech at a Minneapolis synagogue and an event involving a Mexican-American initiative at the University of Southern California.

For all the talk that the former secretary of state intended to slow down after two decades in national political life, Clinton is keeping a busy schedule that amounts to a training camp for a second presidential campaign, if there is one.

In many of her speeches, Clinton talks about America's role in the world and weighs in on national issues on her own terms. Her words often seem to be aimed at maintaining a connection to the party's base of women, black and Hispanic voters, young people and gays and lesbians.

While her speeches avoid partisan politics, they put her before admiring audiences that relish the notion of a woman leading the country.

""We broke the great race barrier with President Obama but it's time that we also really ask ourselves deep down what it's going to take to elect a woman president,"" Clinton said Thursday in response to a question during a Miami address to travel agents. ""And I will certainly do what I can when that time comes to elect somebody — whoever that somebody might be.""

Clinton's advisers note that she has avoided the circuit of Democratic dinners and events in early voting states such as Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, and focused on issues about which she long has been passionate — the status of women and girls around the globe, early childhood education and the trafficking of wildlife in Africa.

Story continues

She is expected to limit her in-person political activity this year to fundraisers and events for Terry McAuliffe, a friend who's running for Virginia governor.

The former first lady regularly deflects questions about her future, telling audiences there is plenty of time for those considerations. But the significance of a female president is never far from the surface. In a speech Wednesday to Chicago House, for example, nearly 2,000 attendees stood and cheered for a full 40 seconds after Clinton, who narrowly lost the nomination to Barack Obama in the 2008, was asked whether she would try again for the White House.

Clinton's speeches are showing many of her admirers a side they craved to see in 2008 and one they hope will be on display should she run in 2016.

In one of her first public acts after leaving government, Clinton endorsed gay marriage, putting her in line with members of her own party. In July, Clinton told about 14,000 members of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority, the nation's oldest black college sorority, that the not guilty verdict in the death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin had brought ""deep, painful heartache"" for many families.

Her speech to the Delta convention and a separate address to the American Bar Association in San Francisco focused on her critique of the Supreme Court's decision to invalidate parts of the Voting Rights Act, a decision that angered many liberals. Clinton said the ruling could make it more difficult for the poor and elderly to vote, words that were embraced with shouts of ""Run, Hillary, Run,"" at the end of her speech.

""She's doing all the right things to become a candidate, certainly, she's done nothing antithetical to that,"" said former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, who rejected the notion that Clinton should avoid speaking about policy issues for fear of alienating potential voters. ""She's solidifying the enthusiasm of people in the Democratic base who are looking for strong leadership. So I think she's on the right track.""

Clinton most recently backed Obama's threats to use force in response to the use of chemical weapons in Syria and has said it was the reason Russia urged Syria to get rid of its stockpile.

In Chicago, Clinton echoed her husband's recent speech in support of Obama's health care law, saying the overhaul should be implemented and improved where necessary. ""Nobody has a better idea,"" she said.

She also expressed hope that Congress would avoid defaulting on the nation's debt. ""I just hope they realize this could be a terrible self-inflicted wound that would have implications for everything we care about,"" she said.

Clinton's travels also help burnish her centrist credentials. During a June address at the Economic Club of Grand Rapids, Mich., she talked about the characteristics of leadership and sat next to Richard and Helen DeVos, both longtime Republican financial donors and activists. Her private, paid speeches have put her before industry groups that represent financial interests, housing developers and the tourist industry.

Earlier this month, Clinton received the Liberty Medal from the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. The group's chairman, former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., credited Clinton's ""lifelong career in public service."" Famous friends and supporters, including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and tennis star Billie Jean King, praised her in video testimonials.

Her childhood development initiative with the Clinton Foundation, called Too Small to Fail, features a leadership council that includes former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., and Cindy McCain, the wife of Arizona Sen. John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee.

Her travel can often resemble a victory lap, filled with awards and acclaim. In addition to speeches at three New York universities, in the heart of where she built her first campaign for Senate, Clinton will be honored by Yale Law School, where she earned her law degree, and the Children's Defense Fund, where she started her work in the 1970s as an advocate for women and children.

Clinton is fielding offers to teach at universities, including Yale, Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government and New York University, where her daughter, Chelsea, is co-founder of a multifaith center.

Hillary Clinton is writing a book, due out next spring, about her time as the nation's top diplomat, and will discuss her work on health and economic issues related to women and children during this coming week's Clinton Global Initiative meeting in New York.

But some of the events show a lighter side. During a question-and-answer session, Chicago journalist David Viggiano wrapped up his interview by asking Clinton ""five frivolous questions,"" including a request that she pose with him for a ""selfie"" on stage.

After the quick photo, she smiled as she revealed her childhood celebrity crush (1950s teen idol Fabian), her love of the Home and Garden Television Network and the ""therapeutic"" enjoyment of cleaning and organizing closets. But when Viggiano told her a Chicago bar wanted to create a ""Hillary"" cocktail, she was speechless.

""I have been asked nearly everything but I have to tell you, David, nobody ever asked me that and I'm at a loss for words,"" Clinton said, ""which you know is not a common trait for me.""

If there was any doubt about the huge amount of discord within the Republican Party, the three-day Conservative Political Action Conference should put it to rest.

The suburban Washington gathering of the most conservative elements of the GOP this week featured speaker after speaker picking fights with other Republicans and offering criticisms — sometimes indirect and often direct — of party figures such as Mitt Romney, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Karl Rove, former president George W. Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Most of the speakers urged Republicans not to change but rather to double down on conservative principles. They included keynote speaker Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), a leader of the new generation of Republicans whom McCain recently labeled “wacko birds.”

“If standing for liberty and standing for the Constitution means you’re a wacko bird, then count me a proud wacko bird,” Cruz said Saturday. “I think there are more than a few other wacko birds gathered here today.”

Cruz also argued that the party’s new generation is starting to gain traction, pointing to Sen. Rand Paul — who had just won the CPAC straw poll — and his 13-hour filibuster this month against President Obama’s drone program, along with the spending cuts contained in the sequester that took effect at the start of the month.

Former Gov. of Alaska Sarah Palin stopped midway through her CPAC speech on Saturday to take a drink from a Big Gulp, and offer advice to young College Republicans. (The Washington Post)

“For the last three weeks, conservatives have been winning,” Cruz said.

The discord, while not new, is particularly noteworthy as the party seeks its way forward after a disappointing 2012 election.

Republican officials unhappy with their losses have begun to push for a new core message and changes or moderation on social issues and illegal immigration.

Two recent events have inflamed that debate. First was the launch of a new group headed by Rove that seeks to recruit and nominate more electable Republican candidates, which conservatives see as a veiled attempt to elect less-conservative Republicans. Second was Paul’s filibuster, which earned the ire of foreign policy hawks such as McCain and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.).

McCain has since apologized for his “wacko birds” comment, but he was booed several times at CPAC.

The speakers at CPAC were united against the McCain and Rove element in the party, picking on them repeatedly and suggesting that conservative principles would win the day if the party stuck with them.

“We do know deep down, as Ronald Reagan did, that we don’t have to change because . . . we know that we’re right and they’re wrong,” said David Keene, the president of the National Rifle Association and the former chairman of the American Conservative Union, which organizes CPAC.

Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, who has been a frequent critic of Rove’s new Conservative Victory Project, urged Republicans not to change their principles but instead propose new ideas.

“The Republican establishment is just plain wrong about how it approaches politics,” Gingrich said. “The Republican consulting class is just plain wrong about how it approaches politics.”

Former Alaska governor and 2008 GOP vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin was more direct, suggesting Rove head back to Texas, where he helped launched George W. Bush’s political career.

“The last thing we need is Washington, D.C., vetting our candidates,” Palin said. “The architects can head on back to the Lone Star State and put their names on some ballot.”

Palin riled the crowd up more than anybody, delivering a blistering attack on Obama with a string of one-liners.

“Barack Obama promised the most transparent administration ever. Barack Obama: You lie!” she said, alluding to the 2009 incident in which a House member yelled “You lie!” at Obama during a speech before Congress.

The crowd went wild when Palin paused mid-speech, produced a Big Gulp from beneath the lectern and mugged for the camera while taking a long sip. Conservatives have savaged New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (I) for his proposed ban on sugary beverages of more than 16 ounces.

Emerging conservative star and Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon Ben Carson caused a stir by announcing he would soon retire from his practice and alluding to speculation that he could be an outsider presidential candidate.

“I want to quit while I’m at the top of my game, and there are so many more things that could be done,” the 61-year-old said as the crowd rose to its feet.

Carson offered a hypothetical involving an unnamed president — and then suggested that president could be him. “Let’s say you magically put me in the White House,” Carson said as the crowd howled.

Another Republican dipping his toe into the 2016 presidential campaign during CPAC was Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, the winner of a contentious 2012 recall election who earned plaudits from conservatives by curbing collective-bargaining rights for public-sector unions. “Someday, maybe once we get past all this, we’ll take a look at it,” Walker said in an interview.

Paul’s victory in the straw poll was widely expected, especially given the past successes in the CPAC straw poll of his father, former representative Ron Paul (R-Tex.). Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) came in second.

The senators want to link road to citizenship for undocumented immigrants to more border security

They%27re hoping that fees for visas can pay for the increased patrol efforts%2C fences

NOGALES, Ariz. — The top Democratic and Republican Senate negotiators on forthcoming immigration-reform legislation toured the Arizona-Mexico border Wednesday, watching as U.S. authorities apprehended a woman who had scaled a border fence.

They reiterated their commitment to strengthen security along the international line.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., are leading the ongoing bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" talks that many hope will result in the introduction of a sweeping bill when the Senate returns to session after a two-week spring break.

The two veteran lawmakers were joined on the tour, which included a helicopter ride, by two other Gang of Eight members: Sens. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., and Michael Bennet, D-Colo. The senators have been struggling to come to terms on big issues such as the future flow of foreign workers into the country, but the message from the quartet in southern Arizona was that the bill is moving forward.

Schumer, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's immigration subcommittee, was making his first visit to the border and said his observations will make it easier for him to persuade colleagues about the need for additional border measures.

""What I learned today is we have adequate manpower but not adequate technology,"" Schumer said. ""And John has been saying that all along.""

At one point during the border tour, the senators witnessed a woman scaling an 18-foot fence a few yards from the entourage. McCain tweeted about the incident, telling his Twitter audience that the Border Patrol took the woman into custody.

""One of the sad things about all of this is that most of those people who jump over the fence are doing that because they want a better life, and I understand that,"" McCain said to reporters later. ""So we separate the drug cartels from individuals who are simply trying to cross over so that they can improve their lives, but at the same time, we have to have a legal way of doing that.

""And we will be setting up legal ways of applying for visas, green cards, etc. — not through a border that is porous, which only favors those who live closest and disfavors those who live further away,"" he said.

Under a framework of principles announced by Schumer and McCain's group Jan. 28, the measure would link a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the country to enhanced border security. According to the framework, the senators contemplate a commission of governors, attorneys general and other ""community leaders living along the Southwest border"" to gauge border-security progress, but how much authority the panel would have has never been made clear.

President Barack Obama supports comprehensive immigration reform and has encouraged the bipartisan Senate group, which is racing the calendar. The senators have a limited time to pass immigration legislation before Capitol Hill is overtaken by 2014 midterm politics, which could start taking hold as soon as this fall.

Despite continuing deliberations and ""a few little problems to work on,"" Schumer said the Gang of Eight is ""90% there"" and ""we believe we'll meet our deadline."" Schumer declined to identify lingering points of contention, saying the senators won't negotiate in public.

""We have to determine the future flow: How do we determine who comes into this country in the future?"" he said. ""We have to make sure the system, not only at the border, but internally is tighter, so that employers will not hire people who are not here legally. And we have to provide a path to citizenship for the 11 million who are in the shadows.""

Schumer said he hopes the legislation can stay revenue neutral, even though more money will be spent to bolster the border. He said the bill will include new ""specific metrics"" to measure border-security progress but wouldn't go into detail.

""Once the border is secured by specific metrics ... people can become citizens,"" he said. The legislation ideally would generate enough revenue to pay for itself through, for example, fees high-tech firms would pay to bring in foreign employees.

Bennet said the nation's broken immigration system is having ""all kinds of negative effects"" in his home state of Colorado, mentioning that he has heard concerns from peach growers, cattle ranchers, the immigrant-rights community and school officials.

""Not everybody is going to get everything they want in this bill,"" Bennet said. ""Not one person is writing this by themselves. But if we can get the kind of bipartisan cooperation that's been demonstrated by the negotiators in this group of eight, I think we can be successful, and I think we can fix a lot of the issues that ail us.""

The senators' visit to the border drew reaction from immigration-reform activists.

A group called the Dream Action Coalition countered that the border already is effectively secured.

""We hope that Senator Schumer, who has been calling himself a 'friend' to the immigrant and Latino community for many years, stops focusing on what is happening at the southern border and calling for more enforcement,"" the group said in a statement. ""Instead, we ask for his leadership on the real problem we are facing in this country. The reality is that there are more than 1,000 deportations every day and atrocious family separation that is hurting children, parents and our community as a whole.""

Outside McCain's Phoenix office, about 30 people gathered as part of an event organized by the Arizona Worker Rights Center to spotlight the abuse of immigrant workers, such as unsafe working conditions and ""wage theft."" Advocates called on McCain and Flake to addresses those problems in the legislation.

""If you legalize workers, it will raise wages for all workers,"" said Nick de la Puente, of the Arizona Worker Rights Center, a non-profit labor-rights organization. ""We need to be in favor of immigration reform, regardless of your immigration status.""

De la Puente said his group has documented more than $2 million in unpaid wages in the past four years stemming from 320 cases involving undocumented workers.

Unscrupulous employers who exploit undocumented workers lower wages for all workers, including legal immigrants and U.S. citizens, he said.

The protesters also delivered letters to McCain's staff opposing a guest-worker program, which they said could lead to further exploitation of workers. De la Puente said he opposes the program unless it allows immigrant workers to move to other jobs and also gives them the option to apply for permanent residency.

Schumer suggested the Arizona visit was particularly rewarding for him. The ""amazing tour"" let the senators see the often rugged terrain that the Border Patrol must cover, Schumer said, and how the officials use manned and unmanned aircraft and forward operating bases. But he and McCain said there is a need to upgrade technological surveillance capabilities.

""We saw the various different types of fencing, and then we saw that there were lots of areas where a fence wouldn't be practical,"" Schumer said. ""It would be hugely expensive to build and not practical. ... Then we saw an urban area like Nogales. And so there's not one size that fits all.""

McCain said the bipartisan group has ""not had any differences on this (border security) issue.""

McCain jokingly called the other members of the Gang of Eight — Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill.; Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.; Robert Menendez, D-N.J.; and Marco Rubio, R-Fla. — who did not tour the border on Wednesday ""jerks.""

He then added that the other four have told him that they, too, would like to inspect the border for themselves in the future.

While anything resembling “progress” can seem woefully absent in our nation’s capital (e.g., the ongoing sequester debacle), the First Lady appears to have hit her stride in the now three-year-old campaign to combat childhood obesity and, in general, whip the country into better physical shape.

And no, I’m not just talking about Mrs. Obama’s recent media blitz (presenting at the Oscars via satellite; dancing with Jimmy Fallon; trading “you’re such a beautiful woman” kudos with Robin Roberts on GMA).

Of course, in our media-saturated culture, getting your message on TV once, let alone a gazillion times, is itself generally considered a measure of success.

No, FLOTUS actually seems to be doing something, like, far-reaching and tangible, unlike so many of her predecessors, who were either relegated to hosting feel-good luncheons and obscure White House ceremonies for anodyne causes (“Just Say ‘No’”; childhood literacy), or stymied when they tried to redefine the role (Hillarycare).

It may not be bringing peace to the Middle East, but Mrs. Obama managed to get the fiercely competitive rivals behind some of the most popular food sites on the web to sign on to her initiative, announcing a partnership in which outlets like Allrecipes, Better Homes & Gardens, Cooking Light, Epicurious and Recipe.com will post healthy recipes to Pinterest on collective “MyPlate Recipes” pin boards.

That’s a coup, given the cutthroat nature of the food website world (and yes, behind all those cheery articles on “5 Great Recipes for Boneless Chicken Breast,” the biz can be pretty bloody).

Already the sites have collectively posted almost a thousand “MyPlate-inspired” recipes to such boards as “Chicken Dinners,” “Healthy Casseroles,” “Healthier Desserts” and “Kid-Friendly Meals.”

All recipes are, theoretically, supposed to align with the USDA’s MyPlate program, which replaced the famed Food Pyramid a couple years ago as the federal symbol of nutritious eating.

Story continues

Touting the effort in a news release last week, the First Lady says: “This partnership takes the guess work out of finding healthier recipes and gives parents the information and the tools they need to make healthy choices for their families every day.”

It almost goes without saying, given the mention of “healthy casseroles,” that this campaign is targeted at boosting the nutritional profile of mainstream Middle America (as opposed to, say, those who already get their organic brown rice and wild-caught Alaska salmon filets from Whole Foods).

And despite Mrs. Obama’s success at getting a trove of name-brand healthy recipes in one convenient place, it may take more than appearing on another round of morning shows to really get American’s moving toward the MyPlate goals.

According to a 2011 market research report, the average consumer only comes close to meeting MyPlate’s targets for consumption of dairy, fruit, grains, proteins and vegetables about seven days a year. And (you guessed it) more than 65 percent of the adults surveyed were either overweight or obese.

Tax cuts to the wealthy? Those pay for themselves. Rebuilding destroyed communities populated by millions of Americans? Only if you cut other government programs. In other words, the vast majority of Republicans are assholes.

First lady Michelle Obama speaks at a luncheon at The Chicago Hilton while visiting Chicago for a discussion with Mayor Rahm Emanuel and civic leaders on ways to combat youth violence. She will also make a stop afterward at Harper High School, where students and alumni have been hit hard by gun violence.

First lady Michelle Obama’s remarks to a luncheon meeting at the Hilton Chicago on Tuesday to address ways to combat youth violence: MRS. OBAMA: Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you so much. Thank you. It’s good to be home. It is. (Applause.) Even though it’s freezing cold in April, it’s good to be home. (Applause.) It is certainly a pleasure to be here with all of you today. I want to start by thanking Rahm for that very kind introduction and that very powerful statement of what our kids in this city need, and also for his outstanding leadership here in this city. I also want to acknowledge Attorney General Lisa Madigan, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. Thank you all for being here. It’s good to see you. You’re all looking good. It’s very good. (Applause.) And of course, I want to recognize Jim Reynolds as well as Tom Wilson for taking the lead as co-chairs of the Public Safety Action Committee. Thank you both for your leadership, for your words, for your service. We are so very proud of you. And most of all, I want to thank all of you for coming here today on behalf of this city’s young people. I want to thank you for your commitment to their safety, their wellbeing, and their God-given potential. And I know that many of you aren’t new to this work. For years, you have been sponsoring sports leagues, afterschool programs, summer jobs and more. So you in this room know firsthand the impact that we can have when this city truly invests in our children. And that’s something I know from my own experience, which is why it was so important for me to be here today. I’m here today because Chicago is my home. I was born and raised here. I built my career here. Several of my bosses are here -- former bosses are here. (Laughter.) I met and married the love of my life here. I raised my children here, who, by the way, still refer to Chicago as home. They believe it gives them a little more credibility. (Applause.) So let me tell you, when it comes to ensuring the health and development and success of young people in this city, for me, this is my passion, it is my mission. And for me, this is personal because my story would not be possible without this city. And that’s where I want to start today -– by talking about our city and the neighborhoods that make us who we are. As you all know, Chicago is truly a city of neighborhoods, separated by parks and boulevards. It’s a city where walking just a few blocks can put you into an entirely different world of experiences. Cut through a park, and you go from English to Spanish, black to white, Puerto Rican to Polish. Cross a few streets, and you go from historic homes and manicured lawns to abandoned buildings and dark street corners. So the opportunities available to a child growing up in one neighborhood in this city might be vastly different than a child growing up just five blocks away. And that difference can shape their lives and their life prospects from the moment they’re born. That was certainly the case for me. As Rahm said, I was born and raised in South Shore. Our neighbors were teachers and secretaries, city workers; also a few professionals, doctors, lawyers, business owners. Most folks weren’t wealthy. A lot of people never went to college. And we generally couldn’t afford things like private music lessons or tutoring. But thanks in part to this city, our lives were still rich with opportunities. We had decent public schools. I am a product of our public schools. We attended the Chicago Park District summer camps. Got a lot of ribbons from those camps I’m quite proud of. (Laughter.) Played basketball on city courts. Our churches ran programs to expose us to music and the arts. So we didn’t have to be children of privilege to get the opportunity to enrich ourselves. And back then, our parents knew that if they loved and encouraged us, if they kept us off the streets and out of trouble, then we’d be okay. They knew that if they did everything right, we’d have a chance. But today, for too many families and children in this city, that’s simply no longer the case. Today, too many kids in this city are living just a few El stops, sometimes even just a few blocks, from shiny skyscrapers and leafy parks and world-class museums and universities, yet all of that might as well be in a different state, even in a different continent. Because many of our children have never been to the Art Institute or Millennium Park. Many of them don’t even know that the University of Chicago exists, let alone dream of attending that university -– or any university for that matter. They haven’t strolled along Navy Pier. Some of them have probably never even seen the lake. Because instead of spending their days enjoying the abundance of riches this city has to offer, they are consumed with watching their backs. They’re afraid to walk alone, because they might get jumped. They’re afraid to walk in groups, because that might identify them as part of a gang and put them at risk. At Harper High School in Englewood, where I’ll be visiting later on today, a newly-hired teacher noticed that when classes ended in the afternoon, kids would leave the building and walk right down the middle of the street. Now, at first, she thought this was just typical adolescent misbehavior. But one student explained that it’s actually safest that way, even with all the cars whizzing by, because it gives them the best view of any fights or shootings, and they have more time to run. Thousands of children in this city live in neighborhoods where a funeral for a teenager is considered unfortunate, but not unusual; where wandering onto the wrong block or even just standing on your own front porch can mean putting yourself at risk.

Those are the odds that so many young people are facing in this city –- young people like Hadiya Pendleton, whose funeral I attended back in February. And we all know Hadiya’s story. She was 15 years old, an honor student at King College Prep. And she came from a good family -– two devoted parents, plenty of cousins, solid godparents and grandparents, an adoring little brother. The Pendletons are hardworking people. They’re churchgoing folks. And Hadiya’s mother did everything she could for her daughter. She enrolled her in every activity you could imagine -– cheerleading, majorettes, the praise dance ministry -– anything to keep her off the streets and keep her busy. And as I visited with the Pendleton family at Hadiya’s funeral, I couldn’t get over how familiar they felt to me. Because what I realized was Hadiya’s family was just like my family. Hadiya Pendleton was me, and I was her. But I got to grow up, and go to Princeton and Harvard Law School, and have a career and a family and the most blessed life I could ever imagine. And Hadiya? Oh, we know that story. Just a week after she performed at my husband’s inauguration, she went to a park with some friends and got shot in the back because some kid thought she was in a gang. Hadiya’s family did everything right, but she still didn’t have a chance. And that story -– the story of Hadiya’s life and death –- we read that story day after day, month after month, year after year in this city and around this country. So I’m not talking about something that’s happening in a warzone halfway around the world. I am talking about what’s happening in the city that we call home, the city where we’re raising our kids, the city where your businesses operate. This kind of violence is what so many young people like Hadiyah Pendleton are dealing with every single day. And those two boys charged with her shooting -– this is the violence they were facing as well. And you have to wonder: What if, instead of roaming around with guns, boys like them had access to a computer lab or a community center or some decent basketball courts? Maybe everything would have turned out differently. Maybe they would be doing their homework, or taking jump shots, or learning a new program instead of looking for trouble. Maybe if these kids saw some kind of decent future for themselves, instead of shootings, there would just be fistfights, some angry words exchanged. And then maybe -- just maybe -- today, more of our young people would be in classrooms and at jobs, instead of in custody, facing even worse odds than they started out with. See, at the end of the day, this is the point I want to make -– that resources matter. They matter. That what it takes to build strong, successful young people isn’t genetics, or pedigree, or good luck. It’s opportunity. And I know from my own experience. I started out with exactly the same aptitude -– exactly the same intellectual, emotional capabilities -– as so many of my peers. And the only thing that separated me from them was that I had a few more advantages than some of them did. I had adults who pushed me. I had activities that engaged me, schools that prepared me to succeed. I had a community that supported me and a neighborhood where I felt safe. And in the end, that was the difference between growing up and becoming a lawyer, a mother, and First Lady of the United States, and being shot dead at the age of 15. And that is why this new fund that you’ve created here in Chicago is so important. It is so important. As you’ve heard, this fund will help create those ladders of opportunities for all of our kids. It will give our children mentors who push them and nurture them. It will teach them the life skills they need to succeed. It will give them alternatives to gangs and drugs -- safe places where they can learn something and stay out of trouble. Because we know that every single child in this city has boundless promise no matter where they live. And whether we give them the chance to fulfill that promise and grow into productive adults who lead meaningful lives -– see, that’s on us. That’s our job. And our kids know when we’re fulfilling that obligation. They know. They know the difference between lip service and reality. They see it and feel it every single day. So we can host all the luncheons and make all the announcements we want. But at the end of the day, if our kids keep waking up in neighborhoods where they don’t feel safe on their own front porches, if they’re still attending schools with crumbling ceilings and ripped-up textbooks, if there’s nowhere safe for them to go when that afternoon bell rings, then nothing speaks louder than that. Nothing. So let’s be clear. This is going to take a serious and sustained investment over a very long period of time, people. This is forever. And I am here today to join the call to all of you -– Chicago’s most distinguished business and community leaders -– to take up this challenge with fervor. And I hope that communities across America will follow Chicago’s lead to get our young people off the streets and back on track to successful lives. (Applause.) Right now, my husband is fighting as hard as he can, and engaging as many people as he can, to pass common-sense reforms to protect our children from gun violence. (Applause.) And these reforms deserve a vote in Congress. (Applause.) As he has said, we can’t stop all the violence in the world. But if there is even one thing we can do, even one step we can take to save another child, or another parent from the grief that’s visited families like Hadiya’s and so many others here today, then don’t we have an obligation to try? But we all know that these reforms must be just one part of a comprehensive effort to rebuild our neighborhoods and build a better future for our children. And if anyone can make that happen, it’s all of you. You all are some of the most creative, innovative, influential people not just in this city, but in the entire country. You have brought together folks from all across Chicago to do great things for this city, like build Millennium Park, host the NATO Summit -- quite well, by the way -- make the lakefront the cultural jewel of the Midwest."

Chris Christie of New Jersey unloaded Wednesday on House Speaker John A. Boehner and Republican lawmakers in Washington for putting “palace intrigue” ahead of their official responsibilities.

Washington politicians “will say whatever they have to say to get through the day,” Christie said, adding that, as a governor, he had “actual responsibilities” -- “unlike people in Congress.”

Christie, a potential 2016 GOP presidential contender, reserved his most blistering words for the Republican House speaker. He described Boehner, variously, as selfish, duplicitous and gutless for reversing course at the last minute on Tuesday night and refusing to allow a vote on a $60-billion aid package before the current Congress adjourned.

PHOTOS: Scenes from the fiscal cliff

Christie said that as a result of “the speaker’s irresponsible action,” there will be further delay in federal disaster aid to New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and other areas hit by the October storm. He pointed out that it had been 66 days since the storm hit and that areas struck by other hurricanes in recent years had received relief packages in far less time.

However, as outrage continued to pour in from elected officials in the affected area, Boehner agreed to hold a vote Friday to direct needed resources to the National Flood Insurance Program. And on Jan. 15, the first full legislative day of the 113th Congress, the House will consider the remaining supplemental request for the victims of Hurricane Sandy.

But that came after Christie dished out his cold outrage on members of his own party.

“Shame on you. Shame on Congress,” Christie said at a news conference in Trenton, the state capital. “It’s absolutely disgraceful, and I have to tell you, this used to be something that was not political. Disaster relief was something you didn’t play games with.” But “in this current atmosphere, [it’s] a potential piece of bait for the political game. It is why the American people hate Congress.”

At another point, he said of Republicans in Congress: “We’ve got people down there who use the citizens of this country like pawns on a chessboard.”

“My party was responsible for this,” Christie said, charging “one set of Republicans was trying to prove something to another set,” and that Boehner was trying to “prove something. I hope he accomplished it.”

Christie, whose disaster-relief-themed efforts to reach across partisan lines to President Obama in the days leading up to the election angered many Republicans, said he did not think that was a factor in Boehner’s decision.

But the governor, who delivered the keynote address at last summer’s Republican National Convention and has helped raise money in recent years for fellow members of the party, did not rule out retaliating against his enemies in Washington.

“We’ll see. Primaries are an ugly thing,” he said.

According to the Huffington Post, EIT is running a $250,000 advertising campaign in favor of the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” immigration bill. Even so, EIT admitted to Breitbart News it does not legally exist as an incorporated political entity or non-profit organization but said NIF is the group that “facilitates” its activities.

NIF is a power player in immigration politics, and includes among its leadership some of the most powerful Washington figures on the issue.

In 2009, OSI donated $257,152 to NIF aimed at “implementing immigration reform campaign through communications, policy, and field organizing.”

Also in 2009, OSI donated another $1.5 million to “allow” NIF to “manage and lead Four Pillars Campaign for comprehensive immigration reform, and sustain core policy work supporting and leading policy efforts.”

A year later, in 2010, Soros’s OSI gave NIF another $1.5 million over two separate grants both intended for “general operating support.”

NIF has also received $1 million total from the leftist Ford Foundation, spread over two separate half-million-dollar grants in 2009 and 2011. Those grants were both intended for advocacy in favor of comprehensive immigration reform.

Jim Wallis, the president and CEO of Sojourners, a leading force in the Evangelical Immigration Table group, has admitted to accepting funding from Soros as well.

World magazine writer Marvin Olasky laid out in a 2010 article how Wallis and his organization, Sojourners, had received $325,000 from Soros groups over three grants from 2004, 2006 and 2007. According to OSI’s 2007 990 form filed with the IRS, available publicly through the Foundation Center, the 2007 money–a total of $100,000–was for Wallis’s Sojourners “to support the Christians for Comprehensive Immigration Reform Campaign.”

Wallis originally denied being funded by Soros when he was first confronted with the accusation, and accused Olasky of lying. “It’s not hyperbole or overstatement to say that Glenn Beck lies for a living. I’m sad to see Marvin Olasky doing the same thing,” Wallis said in 2010 interview with Patheos. “No, we don’t receive money from Soros. Given the financial crisis of nonprofits, maybe Marvin should call Soros and ask him to send us money.”

“So, no, we don’t receive money from George Soros,” Wallis added. “Our books are totally open, always have been. Our money comes from Christians who support us and who read Sojourners. That’s where it comes from. In fact, we’ve had funding blocked, this year and last, by liberal foundations who didn’t like our stance on abortion. Other liberal groups were happy to point out to them that our stance wasn’t kosher on abortion, so our funding was blocked.”

After Olasky and the National Review‘s Jay Richards confronted this claim by Wallis, Wallis admitted he made an incorrect statement to Patheos and that he was accepting Soros money. “I should have declined to comment until I was able to review the blog post in question and consulted with our staff on the details of our funding over the past several years,” Wallis said in a statement.

“Instead, I answered in the spirit of the accusation and did not recall the details of our funding over the decade in question. The spirit of the accusation was that Sojourners is beholden to funders on the political left, which is false. The allegation concerned three grants received over 10 years from the Open Society Institute that made up the tiniest fraction of Sojourners’ funding during that decade–so small that I hadn’t remembered them.”

While that original Soros funding may have been almost a decade old when it was uncovered, Wallis has subsequently accepted more money from the leftist billionaire. In a 2011 story, Olasky noted that Wallis had confirmed to him he accepted another $150,000 from Soros for a grant that would take hold in 2012.

Interestingly enough, even though evangelicals are receiving funding from Soros and his groups, his official website notes that he “identifies himself as an atheist.”

TRENTON, N.J. — Rutgers University President Robert Barchi says he wants to bring an end to the school's practice of paying huge settlements to exiting employees. He started Thursday night with disgraced basketball coach Mike Rice.

The school and Rice agreed to cutting the coach's settlement payment to $475,000, less than half of the $1.1 million for termination as stipulated in his contract.

Barchi earlier in the day had testified before the Assembly Budget Committee and vowed to fight Rice's claim to the full amount. Less than three hours later, the school announced the revised terms.

""Tonight's agreement is in the best interests of the university, and I am pleased this issue has been resolved,"" Barchi said.

Rice could not be reached for comment.

Barchi told lawmakers at the hearing that he was willing to challenge the payout because the contract was breached. ""Let me assure you that I signed no settlement whatsoever with Mr. Rice.""

""My personal position — I'm not a lawyer — is that the university was damaged by his actions. My personal position is that his conduct was unethical, not acceptable to the university's standards, and frankly I'll have that discussion in court if I have to. I'm going to be pretty hard to budget,"" Barchi said.

Barchi on April 5 gave little hope that the school could avoid paying the full settlement when he told reporters, ""The coach was not fired for cause. The outside says that could not be done.""

Rice's tenure at the school ended after video surfaced of him throwing basketballs at players and screaming profanities and slurs during practices.

Rice's boss, athletic director Tim Pernetti, resigned and was given a $1.2 million payout, and general counsel John Wolf will receive a $420,000 exit package when he leaves later this year. Wolf advised the school to suspend Rice last fall instead of firing him then.

Barchi said reports that Wolf would also receive free tickets to Rutgers football games in the future are not accurate.

""He would have the opportunity to purchase his tickets, the same seats (he had the past 30 years). Not that we were giving him any tickets,"" Barchi said.

Assemblywoman Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-Mercer, said she was heartened by Barchi's testimony but added, ""I remain very concerned that Rutgers has doled out so much money to ousted top officials. Consider that based on the in-state tuition and fees listed on the Rutgers website, for every $1 million spent on these deals, the university could have provided 76 students with a scholarship covering full tuition and fees for one year. Rutgers needs to do better.""

http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-11-07/news/ct-met-illinois-pension-reform-1108-20131108_1_pension-system-pension-bill-pension-shortfall,2013-11-07 00:00:00,"['Ray Long', 'Hal Dardick', 'Chicago Tribune Reporters']",State pension crisis fix is pushed back again,"— As expected, Illinois lawmakers left the Capitol on Thursday without a resolution to the state's $100 billion public worker pension debt and without a clear time frame for reaching an agreement to rein in the costs of the nation's worst-funded retirement system.

The pressing issue remains on hold as legislative leaders try to negotiate a solution. The message repeated throughout the week is that the next key step is getting answers from number crunchers projecting how many billions of dollars can be saved by each potential tweak to complex pension plans that could affect hundreds of thousands of current and retired government workers.

""We're waiting for the experts,"" House Speaker Michael Madigan said as he walked into his Capitol office.

Before leaving, lawmakers did send Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn a measure to deal with the Chicago Park District's pension shortfall, a win for Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

In Springfield, there are several provisions being discussed. Among them: providing a 401(k)-style option for some current and future workers; phasing in a higher retirement age for many workers; and giving more help to longtime, low-wage workers. The expectation is that the framework of a 401(k)-like option would be roughly cost-neutral, but people familiar with the negotiations say the biggest calculations include the other concepts.

Those ideas come on top of a pension framework put together by a bipartisan, House-Senate panel. The group suggested cost-of-living cuts, a freeze of one-to-five years of those annual pension bumps and limiting how much of a salary could count toward a pension. Also suggested was cutting the amount of money workers would have to kick in toward their retirement in the hopes of passing constitutional muster.

All told, the earlier provisions were estimated as saving as much as $138 billion over 30 years. Now number crunchers are turning their calculators toward the latest ideas under consideration by leaders. Lawmakers also must decide how much of the projected savings could be immediately poured back into the pension system if changes are made.

It was a challenge to get to this point. Madigan had pushed through his chamber a plan worth more than $160 billion that is aimed at bringing the system to full funding in 30 years. Senate President John Cullerton had won passage of his own plan. It came with the endorsement of worker unions but saved the state less: $58 billion over 30 years and funded the system at 90 percent.

Neither plan passed both chambers. Back when Quinn faced a potential primary challenge from Bill Daley, the governor suggested the little-used conference committee approach to the pension problem. The governor continues to want a pension bill, but has toned down his rhetoric with lawmakers since Daley decided not to run.

As with many big issues, any deal requires agreement among the four leaders. Lawmakers are not scheduled to return to the Capitol until January, but a return in a few weeks remains possible. ""Most people feel we should vote on the bill when we have the votes,"" Cullerton said.

But they've learned from experience that they need to get the numbers right.

More than a decade ago, then-Gov. George Ryan and legislative leaders sweetened the pot of benefits to induce workers to retire early. More than 11,000 people took the deal, and the costs went through the roof.

Even after Madigan's latest pension plan passed the House last spring, a mistake in the cost savings estimates was discovered. The savings ended up about $24 billion less than lawmakers believed.

But there's political math involved too. In the Senate, Democrats hold a 40-19 majority, but many Democratic members are reluctant to cut the pension benefits of unionized government workers too deeply.

Cullerton has said he hopes to supply as many as 18 votes and wants Republican leader Christine Radogno to provide 12 to hit the minimum 30 to pass the Senate.

Radogno said it is important to complete a deal soon. ""It will inject some stability into our state economy,"" Radogno said.

Also Thursday, the Senate sent to Quinn a measure to overhaul Chicago Park District pension benefits. The bill, following negotiations between workers and management, would require employees to pay more, the district to put more tax money into the retirement system and raise the retirement age for some workers. The bill also would freeze cost-of-living adjustments every other year for three years beginning in 2015.

Emanuel hopes it's a template for other, larger city pension systems — a view not shared by many unions.

""The cuts in this bill are unfair and unconstitutional,"" said Henry Bayer, the head of the state's powerful American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 31.

Mike Shields, president of the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police, and Tom Ryan, president of the Chicago Fire Fighters Union, also dismissed the idea that the Park District pension overhaul could serve as a model to preserve the system.

""Pension legislation is not one size fits all,"" Shields said.

Obama pays tribute to the 2012 NBA champs

Wade%2C James and Battier played a pickup game with Obama in 2010

LeBron relished the moment%2C saying%2C %22Hey%2C mama%2C I made it%21%22

WASHINGTON — President Obama welcomed LeBron James and the reigning NBA champs to the White House on Monday to celebrate their 2012 title.

In the long-running White House tradition, Obama has honored professional and college champs with White House ceremonies. But the president's bond with James and some of the other Heat players goes back a few years.

James and teammates Dwyane Wade and Shane Battier were among the NBA stars who came to play with Obama in Washington to mark the president's 49th birthday in 2010. The president, tongue-firmly-in-cheek, suggested that he might have helped them get over the hump and win a title.

""I'm not trying to take all the credit, coach, but I think that it's clear going up against me prepared them,"" joked Obama, who roots for his hometown Chicago Bulls.

Obama's admiration for James goes back to at least the NBA star's rookie year.

""I'm LeBron, baby. I can play on this level. I got game,"" Obama told biographer David Mendell in 2004, after his well-received keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention in Boston.

At the time, James had just completed an impressive rookie season with his former team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, and Obama was emerging as the next great hope for his party.

It took Obama four more years to climb to the top and make it to the White House. James needed eight years and had to take his talents to South Beach to win his first championship.

James is also a big Obama fan.

James donated $20,000 to the Democratic National Committee and the White House Victory Fund in 2008 that benefited Obama.

Other Heat players have also been generous supporters of the president:

Battier has given $5,300 to Obama's Senate and presidential campaigns, according to Federal Election Commission records.

Rashard Lewis donated $10,000 to the Obama Victory Fund in 2008, a joint fund-raising committee that supported both the president's campaign and the Democratic National Committee.

Former Heat star and current front office executive Alonzo Mourning has given nearly $130,000 to Democratic campaigns over the years, including a total of $10,000 in the last election cycle to the Obama campaign and the Obama Victory Fund.

After coach Erik Spoelstra offered brief comments thanking Obama, James asked the president if he minded if he spoke.

""You can if you want,"" Obama said. ""It's your world, man.""

James appeared to relish the moment.

""We're in the White House right now,"" James said with a measure of astonishment. ""Hey, mama, I made it!"""
http://news.yahoo.com/sweeping-anti-abortion-bill-goes-kansas-gov-055505494.html,,[],Sweeping anti-abortion bill goes to Kansas gov.,"TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Kansas legislators gave final passage to a sweeping anti-abortion measure Friday night, sending Gov. Sam Brownback a bill that declares life begins ""at fertilization"" while blocking tax breaks for abortion providers and banning abortions performed solely because of the baby's sex.

The House voted 90-30 for a compromise version of the bill reconciling differences between the two chambers, only hours after the Senate approved it, 28-10. The Republican governor is a strong abortion opponent, and supporters of the measure expect him to sign it into law so that the new restrictions take effect July 1.

In addition to the bans on tax breaks and sex-selection abortions, the bill prohibits abortion providers from being involved in public school sex education classes and spells out in more detail what information doctors must provide to patients seeking abortions.

The measure's language that life begins ""at fertilization"" had some abortion-rights supporters worrying that it could be used to legally harass providers. Abortion opponents call it a statement of principle and not an outright ban on terminating pregnancies.

""The human is a magnificent piece of work at all stages of development, wondrous in every regard, from the microscopic until full development,"" said Sen. Steve Fitzgerald, a Leavenworth Republican who supported the bill.

Abortion opponents argue the full measure lessens the state's entanglement with terminating pregnancies, but abortion-rights advocates say it threatens access to abortion services.

The declaration that life begins at fertilization is embodied in ""personhood"" measures in other states. Such measures are aimed at revising their constitutions to ban all abortions, and none have been enacted, though North Dakota voters will have one on the ballot in 2014.

But Kansas lawmakers aren't trying to change the state constitution, and the measure notes that any rights suggested by the language are limited by decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court. It declared in its historic Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 that women have a right to obtain abortions in some circumstances, and has upheld that decision while allowing increasing restrictions by states.

Story continues

Thirteen states, including Missouri, have such language in their laws, according to the National Right to Life Committee.

Sen. David Haley, a Kansas Democrat who opposed the bill, zeroed in on the statement, saying that supporters of the bill were pursuing a ""Taliban-esque"" course of letting religious views dictate policy limiting women's ability to make decisions about health care and whether they'll have children.

And in the House, Rep. John Wilson, a Lawrence Democrat, complained that the bill was ""about politics, not medicine.""

""It's the very definition of government intrusion in a woman's personal medical decisions,"" he said.

Brownback has signed multiple anti-abortion measures into law, and the number of pregnancies terminated in the state has declined 11 percent since he took office in January 2011.

The governor said he still has to review this year's bill thoroughly but added, ""I am pro-life.""

This year's legislation is less restrictive than a new North Dakota law that bans abortions as early as the sixth week of pregnancy and a new Arkansas law prohibiting most abortions after the 12th week. But many abortion opponents still see it as a significant step.

""There is a clear statement from Kansas with respect to the judgment on the inherent value of human life,"" said Senate Public Health and Welfare Committee Chairwoman Mary Pilcher-Cook, a Shawnee Republican and leading advocate for the measure.

The bill passed despite any solid data on how many sex-selection abortions are performed in Kansas. A 2008 study by two Columbia University economists suggested the practice of aborting female fetuses — widespread in some nations where parents traditionally prefer sons — is done in the U.S. on a limited basis.

But legislators on both sides of the issue said the practice should be banned, however frequent it is.

The bill also would require physicians to give women information that addresses breast cancer as a potential risk of abortion. Advocates on both sides acknowledge there's medical evidence that carrying a fetus to term can lower a woman's risk for breast cancer, but doctors convened by the National Cancer Institute a decade ago concluded that abortion does not raise the risk for developing the disease.

The provisions dealing with tax breaks are designed to prevent the state from subsidizing abortions, even indirectly. For example, health care providers don't have the pay the state sales tax on items they purchase, but the bill would deny that break to abortion providers. Also, a woman could not include abortion costs if she deducts medical expenses on her income taxes.

""Every taxpayer will be able to know with certainty that their money is not being used for abortion,"" Pilcher-Cook said.

But Jordan Goldberg, state advocacy counsel for the New York City-based Center for Reproductive Rights, called the tax provisions ""appalling and discriminatory.""

""It's probably, if not definitely unconstitutional, and it's incredibly mean-spirited,"" she said.

The spot by House Majority PAC, a Democratic super PAC, features a close-up of a baby crying, with a narrator saying, ""Speaker John Boehner didn't get his way on shutting down health care reform. So, he's shut down the government and hurt the economy.""

The ad will be airing in Boehner's district, which includes rural and suburban areas around Cincinnati.

""Speaker Boehner didn’t get his way and so, like a child, he threw a Tea Party-inspired temper tantrum and shut down the federal government,” said Andy Stone, communications director of House Majority PAC. ""The American people are sick and tired of the intransigence and manufactured crises that have become all too common from Speaker Boehner and the House Republicans. Speaker Boehner should stop playing politics, end the nonsense and finally focus on the real-life consequences his government shutdown has caused Americans.""

The group has launched a six-figure ad campaign in the districts of the nine Republican members it's targeting in the 2014 elections: Gary Miller (Calif.), Mike Coffman (Colo.), Rodney Davis (Ill.), Mike Fitzpatrick (Pa.), Michael Grimm (N.Y.), Joe Heck (Nev.), Dave Joyce (Ohio), John Kline (Minn.) and Steve Southerland (Fla.).

Meanwhile, the Revive America PAC, a conservative group, has been running an ad on cable news attempting to spark a grassroots campaign to ""fire"" Boehner. But more established conservative groups, such as the Senate Conservatives Fund, Club for Growth and Heritage Action Fund, are standing by Boehner and his strategy."

Another new member was kidnapped, shot and killed for disloyalty; gang leaders wanted his finger severed as a trophy.

These are just two of the incidents traced to the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas, a white supremacist prison gang whose motto is “God forgives, brothers don’t.”

Some fear that the gang may be involved in the recent slayings in north Texas of Kaufman County Dist. Atty. Mike McLelland, his wife, Cynthia, and fellow prosecutor Mark Hasse. Hasse was fatally shot outside the Kaufman County Courthouse the same January day federal authorities publicly thanked county legal officials for their help prosecuting members of the Brotherhood.

After the federal indictment against 34 alleged Brotherhood leaders and other members in November, the Texas Department of Public Safety issued a confidential bulletin that the gang was plotting retaliation.

The bulletin said, in part, “High-ranking members are involved in issuing orders to inflict ‘mass casualties or death’ to law enforcement officials who were involved in cases where Aryan Brotherhood of Texas [members] are facing life sentences or the death penalty.”

One of the federal prosecutors assigned to handle the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas indictment has withdrawn from the case, citing “security reasons.”

“What we’re seeing is that gangs that were for many years confined to prisons are increasingly spilling onto streets around the country,” said Mark Potok, a senior fellow for the Southern Poverty Law Center. “The Aryan Brotherhood of Texas is arguably the most violent white supremacist prison gang in the U.S. right now.”

Some who are familiar with the gang’s history are skeptical that the Brotherhood targeted the prosecutors, noting that such high-profile victims would bring unwanted attention and that the attacks didn’t seem consistent with the gang’s self-styled sense of honor.

“I found the murder of the wife to be slightly out of character,” said Houston-based lawyer Richard O. Ely II. “These are macho guys. These people are into manly things, being tough — that’s why their punishments are beat-downs. They don’t do drive-by shootings.”

And though it sounds counterintuitive for a gang known for violence, some Aryan Brotherhood of Texas members have taken umbrage at being linked to the killings.

“There is some grumbling among the ABT from sources I have. They feel like they’re being blamed for this, that they’re being set up,” said Terry Pelz, a Houston-based criminal justice consultant who worked for more than 20 years in the Texas prison system.

The Aryan Brotherhood of Texas was founded in the mid-1980s by white inmates seeking to band together to fight black gangs.

Advertisement

Founders contacted the original Aryan Brotherhood gang, which had started years before at San Quentin State Prison in Northern California, and asked permission to found an offshoot. The gang’s leaders balked.

The Texas gang formed anyway, and corrections officials dubbed them the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas, or ABT, Pelz said. He said members referred to their California brethren as “surfers.”

Advertisement

Prison officials tried to destroy the gang, shuffling members within the system, but that proved difficult, Pelz said. “When you move them around, they tend to grow because they establish roots somewhere and get new recruits,” he said.

The gang adopted military titles, with soldiers, captains, lieutenants and a leadership “wheel” of five regional generals. Members are trained to communicate in code, or use wives and girlfriends as go-betweens. Generals issue orders such as “SOS” (smash on sight) and a “green light” for killing rivals and rule-breakers, according to court records.

Advertisement

Members have gone by nicknames — “Chopper,” “Bam Bam” and “Ruthless” are some mentioned in court records — and many subscribed to the white supremacist philosophy of “14/88.”

The “88"" is code for “Heil Hitler,” since “H” is the eighth letter of the alphabet. The “14"" represents the 14 words that sum up their beliefs: “We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.”

Advertisement

They call their monthly meetings “church,” have their own “bible,” called the “Book of Life,” and their own constitution, which includes a rule that any member assisting law enforcement be killed. Their business has been a mix of guns, prostitution and drugs, especially methamphetamines — big business in East Texas, Pelz said.

Pelz estimates that the gang has at least 1,500 members and associates, but said it was difficult to pin down, in part because “there’s more members outside than there are locked up.”

Advertisement

There had been schisms within the group over the years, but recently the gang had become more organized, Pelz said. “The ABT was cleaning their own house, getting rid of members who aren’t carrying their load,” he said.

For other gangs, cleaning house might mean murder, but the Brotherhood abandoned its old “blood in, blood out” rule long ago, Pelz said, and it has remained less brutal and disciplined than other prison gangs, such as the Texas Syndicate or Mexican Mafia. It had also become less ideological, he said.

Advertisement

“There’s not the same commitment to white supremacy that there was — they’ll do business with Bloods and Mexican Mafia” and Mexican drug cartels, Pelz said. “The color that matters is green.”

Pelz doubts the recent killings were by the Brotherhood. “This doesn’t appear to be the work of the ABT — it’s not like them, it’s out of character. They might threaten, but to actually carry something out like this.… If so, it’s a giant leap,” he said.

Other experts agreed the gang’s leaders would probably avoid such attacks.

“That’s going to bring the heat on you,” said Jorja Leap, an adjunct professor with UCLA and an appointee to the California Board of State and Community Corrections’ gang expert committee. “Long-running gangs on the street are smart enough to know their own limits and don’t cross them. The ones that go crazy are the ones that don’t survive.”

USA TODAY

House Democratic bill picks up third Republican co-sponsor

Bill mirrors Senate%27s immigration%2C but includes a border security plan drafted by GOPers

Critics say it%27s too little too late%2C give immigration reform little chance of passing this year

WASHINGTON — A Democratic bill in the House to overhaul the nation's immigration laws is picking up Republican support, though well short of the votes needed to pass the measure.

Rep. David Valadao, R-Calif., on Wednesday became the third Republican to co-sponsor the bill, which includes a pathway to citizenship for the nation's 12 million undocumented immigrants.

Valadao, the son of Portuguese immigrants whose family runs a dairy farm, said in an interview with USA TODAY that his background, and that of his district, which is 72% Hispanic, was a big factor in his decision.

""I grew up in an immigrant family, I grew up in an immigrant community and I work in an immigrant-dependent industry. So it's not like this is a stretch for me,"" he said.

Valadao said the slow pace of immigration legislation in the House also contributed to his decision.

""This isn't really a shot at leadership, but more, 'Guys, this is important to me, we have to move and we have to be part of this solution,'"" he said. ""It doesn't matter how conservative of a district you come from - we have a system that we need to fix.""

Valado's decision to join Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., and Jeff Denham, R-Calif., in co-sponsoring the bill comes at a critical time for immigration reform in Congress.

There are 231 Republicans in the House and the GOP leadership has overseen hearings on separate bills tackling individual immigration issues. It has not favored a single bill to handle all issues.

A bill needs 218 votes to pass the House and the Democratic bill has 186 Democratic co-sponsors. Adding three GOP votes still falls well short of a majority for passage.

The Senate passed a sweeping overhaul to the nation's immigration laws in June that provides a pathway to citizenship for the country's undocumented immigrants, doubles the size of the Border Patrol and revamps the legal immigration system to bring in more high-tech and low-skilled workers.

But even Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., one of the architects of that bill, has questioned whether that bill is the best way forward. Rubio said Rubio's spokesman, Alex Conant, said the ""all or nothing"" approach they took in the Senate ""would result in nothing.""

Rubio and House Republican leaders say they would rather move forward with the ""piecemeal"" approach in which Congress considers smaller bills that tackle individual pieces of the nation's immigration laws.

House committees have approved a handful of bills that address border security, grant immigration enforcement powers to local and state police officers, increase the number of visas for high-tech workers and require U.S. businesses to check the immigration status of new hires.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has said he is ""hopeful"" that immigration could be voted on by the full House before the end of the year, but he has given no timetable.

""These guys signing on (to the Democratic bill) are kind of like people left standing when the music stops in musical chairs,"" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which opposes the Senate immigration bill. ""Just as the prospects of a bill passing are declining, these people are signing on.""

Supporters of the Democratic bill see something else happening.

Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, a group that supports the Senate immigration bill, said the increasing support of the Democratic bill puts more pressure on GOP leaders to get moving on immigration.

""Does it mean that this bill is going to be brought up sometime soon? Probably not,"" Sharry said. ""But does it ratchet up the pressure on house leadership to get something going? Yeah. It'll make it harder for House leadership to slow-walk this thing to death.""

The bill, H.R. 15, is sponsored by Rep. Joe Garcia, R-Fla. It is mostly a replica of the Senate's immigration bill, but it eliminates the $46 billion border security plan adopted in the Senate and replaces it with a border security plan authored by Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, and was approved unanimously by the House Homeland Security Committee.

Garcia said he was encouraged by the latest addition to his bill, and said he's pushing to bring more on board. He hopes it will reach a point where House leadership is forced to bring it to the floor, where it could pass with most Democrats and a couple-dozen Republicans, similar to the vote that ended the government shutdown.

""The same way we found votes on the budget, I think Speaker Boehner will see the votes here,"" Garcia said."

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/06/dining/the-lunchrooms-of-capitol-hill.html,2013-03-06 00:00:00,['Jennifer Steinhauer'],The Lunchrooms of Capitol Hill,"WASHINGTON — All American cities have their lunch spots where deals are sealed and careers are upgraded over Cobb salads and tuna rolls. On Capitol Hill, the powerful eat in.

He who can leave for an extensive lunch is not writing a bill, strong-arming a senator, hectoring a committee witness or doing a spot on Fox Business Network. Let the low-level staff members trek to Seventh Street for pizza. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, has his lunch (usually chicken) brought in from the Senate dining room. (That’s a double power play: the dining room is for senators only, yet a staff member carts food to him.)

And so the sprawling Capitol complex is both our nation’s legislative center and its food court. While House members often repair to their partisan clubs for lunch, coffee and post-vote martinis, and senators can sometimes be found eating and drinking at the Monocle restaurant, which has fed generations of them, lawmakers are largely too busy to eat out. For them and their staffs — and the tour guides, reporters, art restoration experts, hairdressers and others among the cast of thousands who work on Capitol Hill — lunch is generally a quick in-house affair.

There are more than a dozen restaurants, cafes, sandwich bars and formal dining rooms on the Hill — most of them prosaic, some a little weird and almost all good for people watching, when you can get in. (The House and Senate dining rooms are generally reserved for members and their guests; many others are open to the public, but those in the Capitol building require an escort from someone who works there.)"

No, this is not snark or satire. It's not an Onion article either..........





Whilst GOP aides are taking the lead and throwing Ted Cruz under the bus, at least one of their Senators is following their lead.

Buried deep in a TPM article on the debt deal, we have this little nugget:"
http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/12/26/1265483/-Racial-Narrative-Of-Knockout-Game-Blown-As-White-Guy-Clobbers-Elderly-Black-Man,2013-12-26 00:00:00,"['This Content Is Not Subject To Review Daily Kos Staff Prior To Publication.', 'Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags']",Racial Narrative Of Knockout Game Blown As White Guy Clobbers Elderly Black Man,"Conrad Alvin Barrett decided that he wanted to play the knockout game. In late November he approached a 79 year old Black elderly man.

According to the press release from the Department of Justice,



According to the complaint, Barrett comments in a video that “the plan is to see if I were to hit a black person, would this be nationally televised?” The complaint further alleges Barrett claims he would not hit “defenseless people” just moments before punching the elderly man in the face. Barrett allegedly hit the man with such force that the man immediately fell to the ground. Barrett then laughed and said “knockout,” as he ran to his vehicle and fled, according to allegations. The complaint indicates the victim suffered two jaw fractures and was hospitalized for several days as a result of the attack.

According to ABC13 Conrad Alvin Barrett was taken into custody this morning. Barrett got caught because he was bragging about the incident in a Fulshear bar on the night of the attack. He allegedly showed the video to an off duty police office.

His phone had 10 other implicating videos. In one of his videos he uses the N-word and said that blacks “…haven’t fully experienced the blessing of evolution.”

Following is the ABC13 story.







CNN reports that George Parnham, Conrad Alvin Barrett’s attorney, said his client has a bipolar disorder and takes medications. He said the affidavit does not pull back Barrett’s layers of mental health.

Earlier today Poppy Harlow appeared as guest on CNN’s Out Front with Don Lemon. She told him she spoke to Barrett’s attorney. She was shock by one of his comments. She said the attorney told her that his client studied anthropology. He said his anthropology professor made almost word for word, the comments Conrad Alvin Barrett made about blacks and evolution. She wonders if that college course would be used as a part of the defense. If Conrad Alvin Barrett is convicted he faced up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

The irony of this incident is that in the last few months many on the Right have been attempting to make this supposed knockout game a black on white crime. They have been using overblown incidents of this type by the media to show some false racial divided. In fact Larry Elder wrote a piece in which he said,



The “knockout game” – and the media underreporting of it – combines the breakdown of the family with the media's condescending determination to serve as a public relations bureau for blacks.

Don Lemon asked Marc Lamont Hill on CNN’s Out Front whether this case turns the stereotype on its head or of there is more to this type of story. Hill said the narrative of the supposed surge of this type of crime of black youth against white people was never the case. He said this vicious crime, the so called knockout game, is perpetrated by people of all races. There is no racial pattern. It is simply irresponsible people executing a violent irresponsible act.

"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-pn-gop-study-20130318,0,5301566.story",2013-03-18 07:00:00,[],GOP study calls for changes to halt presidential losing streak,"WASHINGTON -- A smug, uncaring, ideologically rigid national Republican Party is turning off the majority of American voters, with stale policies that have changed little in 30 years and an image that alienates minorities and the young, according to an internal GOP study.

That blunt assessment on the state of Republicanism at the national level comes from a major new report, out Monday, that will likely shake up an already battered party. It was commissioned by the head of the Republican National Committee in the wake of Mitt Romney’s defeat last year.

Without offering detailed policy prescriptions, the 98-page report calls on the party to “smartly change course,” modernize itself and develop “a more welcoming brand of conservatism that invites and inspires new people to visit us.”

There are extensive lists of proposals, many of them technological and procedural, designed to help the GOP better engage voters, especially women, minorities and the young, and reverse a losing pattern in five of the last six popular votes for president.

“Unless changes are made, it will be increasingly difficult for Republicans to win another presidential election in the near future,” the report concludes.

RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, in remarks in Washington on the release of the study by the party’s “Growth and Opportunity Project,” is unsparing in his analysis of the 2012 election setback.

“Our message was weak. Our ground game was insufficient. We weren’t inclusive. We were behind in both data and digital. Our primary and debate process needed improvement,” he says, according to an advance text of his remarks.

“We know we have problems. We’ve identified them, and we’re implementing the solutions to fix them,” he says.

Most of the criticisms are familiar to those, both inside and outside the GOP, who have watched the party fail to come to grips with changing demographics and, instead, try to rely on older, white voters who represent a shrinking part of the electorate.

“Young voters are increasingly rolling their eyes at what the party represents, and many minorities wrongly think that Republicans do not like them or want them in the country. When someone rolls their eyes at us, they are not likely to open their ears to us,” the report says. Young voters, it says, see the party as “old and detached from pop culture.”

In calling for the GOP to develop “a more welcoming conservatism,” the report rebukes those who remain in denial about the seriousness of the problem and those who are unwilling to broaden the party’s appeal.

A just-concluded gathering of conservatives in Washington cheered speaker after speaker who urged the GOP to stick to its guns and, instead, largely blamed the 2012 defeat on Romney or the way he ran his campaign.

“The Republican Party needs to stop talking to itself,” the study says. “We have become expert in how to provide ideological reinforcement to like-minded people, but devastatingly we have lost the ability to be persuasive with, or welcoming to, those who do not agree with us on every issue.”

The report calls on Republicans to counter the party’s image as an arm of business. It says Republicans should “blow the whistle at corporate malfeasance and attack corporate welfare. We should speak out when a company liquidates itself and its executives receive bonuses but rank-and-file workers are left unemployed. We should speak out when CEOs receive tens of millions of dollars in retirement packages but middle-class workers have not had a meaningful raise in years.”

Beyond that, however, there are no policy details. Indeed, the authors point out that they are not a policy committee, in a section calling on the GOP to “embrace and champion” comprehensive immigration reform without further specifics.

In addition, an extensive set of “inclusion” proposals for minority groups, including Latinos, Asians and African Americans, appears to mimic similar, failed outreach efforts by various RNC chairs over the last 30 years.

The report notes the party’s problems with women voters, especially unmarried women. But its 10-point plan for appealing to women makes no mention of the GOP stance on any social issues, such as abortion and same-sex marriage, that have turned off many of the voters in question.

In a section on campaign mechanics, Republicans are advised to make “a critical cultural shift” on early, absentee, and online voting, trends that the report notes are “here to stay.” The report fails to note, however, that Republican elected officials fought to block and even reverse that trend at the state level in 2012.

Although the RNC study spares Romney any direct criticism, it includes tacit criticism of GOP polling that seems directed at his campaign. Research conducted for the study report found that 70% of Republican pollsters surveyed said that Democratic polling in 2012 “was better than our own. Fully 22% felt the Democrats did ‘much better’ than the Republicans when it came to accuracy and reliability.”

In a section on party primaries, there are thinly veiled attacks on efforts by outside groups, such as those tied to former George W. Bush strategist Karl Rove and organizations like the Club for Growth, that seek to apply litmus tests or weed out candidates considered unelectable.

Advertisement

“It would be a mistake for any one organization to think it can circumvent GOP voters and hand-pick our nominees,” the report says. “Third-party groups that promote purity are hurting our electoral prospects.”

There are also calls for fewer candidate debates during the presidential primaries, a shorter nomination calendar and an earlier national convention.

The report is the product of a committee headed by Priebus’ allies and supporters, including Henry Barbour of Mississippi, the nephew of former governor and RNC chairman Haley Barbour; former George W. Bush White House spokesman Ari Fleischer; and Sally Bradshaw, a longtime advisor to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.

(CNN) - Today is the day lawmakers have known about since August 2011: the day those forced federal spending cuts kick in.

This Friday is also a day many never expected would come. After all, the cuts known as sequestration were designed to be so draconian that lawmakers would be forced to compromise and avoid them.



But they haven’t, and as lawmakers left Washington to begin their weekend on Thursday, so left any prospect of avoiding the cuts that President Barack Obama and his administration have warned will lead to long airport lines and fewer air traffic safety controllers; federal government furloughs and layoffs; cuts to food inspection and border security programs; and education funding decreases that will shut young students out of Head Start programs.

For all of the dire warnings, Obama acknowledged Wednesday that the cuts are “not a cliff, but it is a tumble downward.” He’ll set the cuts in motion on Friday with a stroke of his pen.

He is required to sign an order enacting the spending cuts by 11:59 p.m. Friday and will do so privately, White House press secretary Jay Carney said Thursday.

Before that happens, Obama and Vice President Joe Biden will meet with top congressional leaders: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker John Boehner and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.

But Friday is seen by many as too late to reach a deal averting the cuts, especially with Congress out of town for the weekend.

After Obama signs the order, the Office of Management and Budget will send to Congress a detailed accounting of the cuts – how much from which agencies and which accounts. Every ""program, project and activity"" has to be trimmed without regard for what it is, according to the OMB.

Those who are employed by the government or rely on federal agencies’ spending are expected to feel the effects first. From there, the effects of the sequester will ripple outward across the economy.

The Obama administration has said the law gives them no leeway to spare one budget line at the expense of another, and insiders expect the cuts to be about 9% for nondefense programs and 13% for defense accounts.

What agencies do have some discretion over is how they roll out the cuts. In some cases, furloughs and other cuts could be backloaded, scheduling them to take effect at a greater rate later in the year in hopes that Congress will reach a deal to replace the sequester that has so far been elusive.

OMB sent affected federal agencies a letter on Wednesday reminding them to prepare for the cuts. Some agencies have already given employees their official 30-day notice of upcoming furloughs. Others are expected to follow soon, and budget uncertainty has already caused some agencies to cut back.

Congress delayed the cuts from triggering in January at the time of the fiscal cliff. The two month delay from January 1 to March 1, however, made the cuts steeper than the original 5% for nondefense spending and 8% for defense programs.

Not everyone is convinced these forced spending cuts are a bad idea. Some deficit hawks see them as one way to reduce ballooning federal spending and others who favor reducing military spending see their virtue, too.

Altogether, the cuts will amount to some $85 billion dollars this fiscal year, which ends September 30.

While today means the end to one fiscal showdown, fans of Washington financial wrangling have another date to anticipate: March 27. That’s the deadline for Congress to extend the continuing resolution that’s funding the government.

In a lengthy speech about income inequality in America, Obama declared it the “defining challenge of our time” to make sure the economy works for rich and poor alike.

“I take this personally,” Obama said. “I’m only here because this country educated my grandfather on the GI bill.”

When his father left and his mom hit hard times trying to raise two children while going to school, he said, “this country helped make sure we didn’t go hungry.”

And when Michelle Obama’s working-class parents wanted to send her to college, he said, “this country helped us afford it until we could pay it back.”

“What drives me as a grandson, a son, a father, as an American,” he said, “is to make sure that every striving, hardworking, optimistic kid in America has the same incredible chance that his country gave me.”

In what sounded at times like a preview of a State of the Union address, Obama spelled out his economic priorities and outlined his approach as he enters negotiations with congressional Republicans over budget and fiscal matters.

He lowered deficit reduction on his administration’s priority list, arguing that slashing government programs doesn’t attack the most serious problems facing the nation’s middle class. A “growing deficit of opportunity” is a greater threat to the country’s future than its “rapidly shrinking” fiscal deficit, he said.

Obama also made clear that he will push publicly for an increase to the minimum wage, an initiative that currently doesn’t stand much of a chance of passage.

In his address to the liberal Center for American Progress, Obama called upon Republicans to help fight the growing gap between rich and poor by either supporting his plans or offering alternatives.

“If Republicans have concrete plans that will actually reduce inequality, build the middle class, provide moral ladders of opportunity to the poor, let’s hear them,” Obama said. “I want to know what they are.”

But as Obama spoke, Republican leaders took issue with the remedies he proposed. House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) suggested that Obama’s policies are to blame for the problems he describes.

“He promotes more government instead of more freedom,” Boehner wrote on Twitter. “The American Dream is certainly more in doubt than in decades,” he went on in a linked statement, “but after more than five years in office, the president has no one to blame but himself.”

Pollak'],House Leaders to Educate Voters About Immigration: 'Become America',"House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) will lead a tour of House leaders next week aimed at educating Americans, and each other, about the history and importance of immigration to the United States. The tour, dubbed the “Become America” tour, will feature events and speeches aimed at overcoming opposition to the passage of comprehensive immigration reform, which has stumbled amidst opposition from conservatives.

“The lawmakers will attend events on Ellis Island and at the Museum of Jewish Heritage and the African Burial Ground National Monument, according to an itinerary of the trip,” Politico reported late Wednesday evening. “Leaders will speak at a naturalization ceremony, and the group will also have a breakfast meeting at Gracie Mansion with New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a key advocate of immigration reform.”

In 2009, Cantor led a “listening tour” across the nation, bringing Republican leaders to meet with voters to discuss how the party could improve its policies and its political fortunes. The “Become America” tour, by contrast, will be less about listening to voters and more about educating them, since Republican leaders are convinced that the “nativist” faction within their party is the reason they cannot pass immigration reform.

The trip is being coordinated by the non-profit Faith & Politics Institute, and will include members of both parties, such as Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL), a persistent advocate of amnesty for illegal immigrants. In April, Guiterrez told a wealthy audience in Chicago that they owed it to the people who “wash the dishes” and “take care of your kids and mow your lawn” to support a path to U.S. citizenship for illegal aliens.

Officially, the “Become America” tour is meant to improve relations among the members of Congress who attend. But given the backdrop of pending immigration legislation, it is also clearly aimed at enabling those members to campaign for passage of a bill–any bill–that satisfies President Barack Obama’s demands. The president has said he will not sign immigration legislation that does not include a path to citizenship.

In June, only 6% of Americans said that immigration was the most important issue facing the country, up from 4% in April, according to Gallup polls. The economy, unemployment, dissatisfaction with government, health care, the federal debt/deficit, and family/moral decline were all listed as more important to Americans than immigration reform. No congressional tours have been planned to address those issues."

Gannett Washington Bureau

About %24500%2C000 in loose change was left at airport security checkpoints in fiscal 2012

Money would benefit USO and other groups supporting service members

Measure now heads to Senate

WASHINGTON — The jingle of loose change abandoned at airport checkpoints might soon be sweet music to America's military personnel.

The House passed a bill Tuesday that would require the Transportation Security Administration to give nonprofits such as the United Service Organization the approximately $500,000 in quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies collected every year at airport screening stations. The money would help finance airport programs that support service members as they trek from city to city.

The USO operates lounges in nearly 40 major airports that offer food and other amenities exclusively to military personnel.

""What may seem like a small amount of change left behind... actually amounts to hundreds of thousands of dollars each year,"" said GOP Rep. Jeff Miller of Florida, lead sponsor of the TSA Loose Change Act. The bill ""would ensure that thousands of coins, when bundled together, will be used in support of millions of our nation's warriors.""

Miller, who chairs the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, has introduced the bill for several years, but this is the first time it's made it to the House floor. In a rare show of bipartisan support, the bill passed by voice vote without dissent.

The measure now heads to the Senate.

TSA agents collected more than $531,000 in cash — almost all of it in coin form, and about 6 percent of it in foreign currency — that travelers left behind at airport checkpoints in fiscal 2012, according to the most recent data provided by the agency.

That's an increase over fiscal 2011 ($487,870) and 2010 ($409,086).

Miami International ($39,613), McCarran International serving Las Vegas ($26,900), and O'Hare International in Chicago ($22,116) collected the most change in fiscal 2012, TSA figures show.

But even at airports in smaller cities such as Pensacola, Fla., Des Moines, Iowa, and Reno, Nev., TSA agents emptied at least $1,000 from the plastic tubs passengers use prior to walking through metal detectors.

Travel experts say people abandon change for a number of reasons: They're in a rush, they can't be bothered to repocket a relatively small amount in coins, or they're heading to a foreign country where the change can't be used.

TSA officials say they make every reasonable effort to return abandoned change to its rightful owner.

Under current rules, the TSA gets to keep the money left behind. The agency says it uses the cash ""for the purpose of providing civil aviation security.""

According to the TSA, these 10 airports reported finding the most money left behind by travelers at airport checkpoints during fiscal 2012:

1) Miami International — $39,613

2) McCarran International (Las Vegas) — $26,900

3) O'Hare International (Chicago) — $22,116

4) Los Angeles International — $21,916

5) John F. Kennedy International — $21,201

6) Dallas/Fort Worth International — $20,190

7) San Francisco International — $19,874

8) Washington Dulles International — $16,537

9) Logan International (Boston) — $16,406

""Rodham"" is ""a journey of a woman who was torn between her personal desires and her professional ambition — both literally pulled her thousands of miles apart, because Bill did not want to leave Arkansas, and she did not want to leave Washington, D.C.,” Kim said.

GOP congressmen speaking at a House Judiciary Committee meeting this week were blunt about Obama’s defiance of the traditional negotiation with Congress.

Committee Chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) blasted that Obama “doesn’t have a debate in the Oval Office about what he wants to do … he does what he wants to do, and then you no longer have representative democracy.” GOP members noted that Obama has acted unilaterally on issues ranging from immigration laws, which he ignores, to consistent and enormous revisions of ObamaCare, which was passed as law.

Even Obama supporter Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, had the temerity to question his Obama’s methods, although he felt compelled to include George W. Bush when he commented, “The problem of what the president is doing is that he is not simply posing a danger to the constitutional system; he is becoming the very danger the Constitution was designed to avoid: that is, the concentration of power in any single branch.”

Of course, there are the other Obama acolytes who will defend him. Simon Lazarus, Senior Counsel for the Constitutional Accountability Center, said that Obama’s changes to ObamaCare after it was already passed do not conflict with Article II of the U.S. Constitution, which requires the president to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” Lazarus loftily intoned, “I have to say that hyperventilating about how extraordinary and unprecedented and unconstitutional these delays are is just that, it’s hyperventilation and it’s contrary to obvious historical fact.”

Should we be surprised by Obama’s circumvention? This is the same man who boasted in March 2012, “If Congress refuses to act, I’ll do everything in my power to act without them.”

Although there was a suggestion before the House Committee that the only way to solve the problem would be to impeach Obama, the reality is that the Democratic-controlled Senate would shoot that down. Those who called for impeachment concluded that the only real answer “comes down to elections.”"

WASHINGTON -- After a record-setting Inauguration in 2009, President Obama's second time around later this month is expected to be a bit smaller affair. In fact, there will be just two official inaugural balls that the president and first lady are anticipated to attend.

The Commander-In-Chief’s Ball, started by President George W. Bush, is for members of the U.S. military. The Inaugural Ball is for the general public.

Both events will be held throughout the Walter E. Washington Convention Center on Mount Vernon Square. The public can request tickets for the Inaugural Ball at the event's official site. The tickets are priced at $60 and requesting tickets does not guarantee entrance to the event.

Although Obama will attend the lowest number of official inaugural balls since Dwight Eisenhower, there's no shortage of State Society Inaugural Balls and other celebrations, from the Black Tie & Boots Ball to the Kentucky Bluegrass Ball to the North Carolina Society's big party at Nationals Park.

Update 5:53 p.m. ET

Washington (CNN) - Senate Democrats dropped the filibuster bomb Thursday, and now the question is what kind of fallout will result from the so-called nuclear option.

By a 52-48 vote, the Senate ended the ability of minority Republicans to continue using filibusters to block some of President Barack Obama's judicial and executive nominations, despite the vehement objections of Republicans.



Majority Democrats then quickly acted on the change by ending a filibuster against one of Obama's nominees for a federal appeals court.

Obama later cited what he called ""an unprecedented pattern of obstruction in Congress"" during his presidency for the move led by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

""A deliberate and determined effort to obstruct everything, no matter what the merits, just to refight the results of an election is not normal,"" Obama said of the change. ""And for the sake of future generations, it cannot become normal.""

The man who coined the term 'nuclear option' regrets ever pursuing it

Republicans warned the controversial move would worsen the already bitter partisan divide in Washington, complaining it took away a time-honored right for any member of the Senate minority party to filibuster.

""This changes everything, this changes everything,"" veteran GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona told reporters. He blamed newer Democratic senators who never served as the minority party for pushing the issue, adding: ""They succeeded and they will pay a very, very heavy price for it.""

Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky called Thursday's maneuvering a diversion from the problem-plagued Obamacare issue that has been giving the White House and Democrats political headaches.

""You'll regret this and you may regret it a lot sooner than you think,"" McConnell warned, adding that ""the Democratic playbook of broken promises, double standards and raw power - the same playbook that got us Obamacare - has to end. It may take the American people to end it, but it has to end.""

CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger said Democrats seem to believe that things couldn't get much worse, with judicial vacancies increasing and Republicans increasing their use of filibusters after an agreement earlier this year that cleared some presidential appointees.

Opinion: 'Nuclear option' makes GOP do its job

""I think there is probably a little bit of 'calling your bluff' going on here; that Harry Reid basically threw up his hands and said, enough of this, it's time to do it,"" Borger said. Now, she added, the question was whether angry Republicans would further harden their positions in the already bitter political climate which she said ""will get worse.""

Thursday's change affected presidential executive nominations such as ambassadors and agency heads, along with judicial nominations except for Supreme Court appointees.

It did not affect the ability of Republicans to filibuster legislation.

Under the old rules, it took 60 votes to break a filibuster of presidential nominees. The change means a simple Senate majority of 51 now suffices in the chamber Democrats currently control with a 55-45 majority.

The nuclear option deployed by Reid allowed a procedural vote that required a simple majority to change the threshold for approving presidential and judicial nominees, instead of a super majority typically required.

Opinion: What's at stake in power struggle over judges

""It's time to get the Senate working again,"" the Nevada Democrat said on the Senate floor. ""Not for the good of the current Democratic majority or some future Republican majority, but for the good of the United States of America. It's time to change. It's time to change the Senate before this institution becomes obsolete.""

Reid followed through on threats dating back years after Republicans blocked three judicial nominees to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, known as the highest court in the land after the Supreme Court.

Both parties have been guilty of political hijinks involving filibusters.

In 2005, Republicans who then held the majority threatened the nuclear option to prevent Democratic filibusters of President George W. Bush's judicial nominees. The confrontation was averted thanks to an agreement by a bipartisan group of 14 senators.

Obama, then a senator, opposed the nuclear option at that time.

""I urge my Republican colleagues not to go through with changing these rules,"" he said on the Senate floor in 2005. ""In the long run it is not a good result for either party. One day Democrats will be in the majority again and this rule change will be no fairer to a Republican minority than it is to a Democratic minority.""

Explainer: What's the nuclear option?

Asked about Obama's past stance compared to his support Thursday for Reid's move, White House spokesman Josh Earnest cited increased obstruction of Obama nominees for the need to get the Senate working again.

""The circumstances have unfortunately changed for the worse since 2005,"" Earnest said, noting that there were 50 judicial vacancies when Obama took office compared to 93 today and that many of the President's nominees have bipartisan support but can't get an up-or-down Senate vote.

Furious Republicans accused Reid of reneging on a pledge against using the nuclear option.

""It is another partisan political maneuver to permit the Democratic majority to do whatever it wants to do, and in this case it is to advance the President's regulatory agenda and the only cure for it that I know is an election,"" said veteran GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee.

Until now, Reid hadn't necessarily had support from enough of his own Democratic caucus to pass a rules change. Some Democratic senators were reluctant to change the rules because of reverence for the institution and, more importantly, because they know Democrats will not always be in the majority.

Veterans such as Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who had been opposed to the nuclear option to change the Senate rules, recently decided to back Reid's move. Feinstein and others, like fellow Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, said things were so broken in Washington that the nuclear option was the only way to fix it.

Three Democrats voted with Republicans on Thursday in opposing the nuclear option - Sens. Carl Levin of Michigan, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Mark Pryor of Arkansas.

However, Republicans argued Democrats were just trying to manufacture a crisis in order to create a distraction from the Obamacare rollout debacle.

""Sounds to me like Harry Reid is trying to change the subject and if I were taking all the incoming fire that he is taking over Obamacare I'd try to change the subject too,"" House Speaker John Boehner said Thursday.

On a day that echoed with refrains from the civil rights era and tributes to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Mr. Obama dispensed with the post-partisan appeals of four years ago to lay out a forceful vision of advancing gay rights, showing more tolerance toward illegal immigrants, preserving the social welfare safety net and acting to stop climate change.

At times he used his speech, delivered from the West Front of the Capitol, to reprise arguments from the fall campaign, rebutting the notion expressed by conservative opponents that America risks becoming “a nation of takers” and extolling the value of proactive government in society. Instead of declaring the end of “petty grievances,” as he did taking the oath as the 44th president in 2009, he challenged Republicans to step back from their staunch opposition to his agenda.

“Progress does not compel us to settle centuries-old debates about the role of government for all time — but it does require us to act in our time,” he said in the 18-minute address. “For now decisions are upon us, and we cannot afford delay. We cannot mistake absolutism for principle or substitute spectacle for politics or treat name-calling as reasoned debate. We must act.”"
http://news.yahoo.com/forgotten-man-almost-became-president-lincoln-101033224.html,,[],The forgotten man who almost became President after Lincoln,"On April 15, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln died from his assassin’s wounds. But if John Wilkes Booth’s plot were entirely successful, a little-known senator may have been thrust into the White House.

Booth’s full plot included killing Lincoln, Vice President Andrew Johnson, and Secretary of State William Seward. General Ulysses Grant was another possible target. But only two attacks took place on April 14, 1865, with Seward surviving an assassination attempt and Lincoln suffering from Booth’s single gunshot.

According to the rules of presidential succession in 1865, only Vice President Johnson, and not Seward or Grant, was in line to replace Lincoln if he died. If Johnson had died, an acting president would be appointed until a special election could be held to elect a new president (and not a vice president).

The acting president would have been the president pro tempore of the Senate, Lafayette Sabine Foster of Connecticut.

The Presidential Succession Act of 1792 controlled how the president was replaced if he died in office, quit, or was unable to perform his duties.

The act was changed in 1886 and 1947 to deal with different scenarios. The 20th Amendment addressed what happens if a president-elect can’t take office, and the 25th Amendment cleared up the succession of a new vice president and what happens when a president is temporarily unable to perform his or her duties.

Back in 1865, Booth had convinced George Atzerodt, an acquaintance, to kill Johnson by setting a trap at the Kirkwood House hotel where the vice president lived. However, Atzerodt lost his nerve and didn’t attempt to kill the vice president, even though he had a rented room above Johnson’s and a loaded gun was found in the room.

If Atzerodt or another assailant had succeeded, Senator Foster would have been acting president until March 4, 1866. And if Foster wasn’t available, Speaker of the House Schuyler Colfax would have been next, and last, in line to succeed Lincoln and Johnson.

Story continues

A special election would have taken place in November 1865, with the Electoral College convening in December 1865, and the presidential inauguration being held on March 4, 1866.

The person charged with the official notification of the states to start the special election process was the secretary of state. Luckily, William Seward survived an attack by assassin Lewis Powell.

If Seward had died, that power may have devolved on the assistant secretary of state, who could perform the duties as an acting secretary of state until a new president named a replacement who was confirmed by the Senate.

The assistant secretary of state on April 15, 1865, was Frederick W. Seward, the son of William Seward. Frederick Seward was also seriously injured defending his father during Powell’s assassination attempt. (He would recover after Powell pistol-whipped him.)

From what we know about Lafayette Sabine Foster, he was a conservative Republican who was named as the president pro tempore of the Senate about a month before Lincoln’s death. Foster only remained in the Senate for another two years, failing in a re-election attempt. He was later a judge in his home state until his death in 1880.

According to his obituary, Foster was “a prominent figure in congressional life, as a clear and forcible debater upon great public questions, and as an unsurpassed presiding officer in the Senate, that he was most widely known and will be best remembered.”

Foster also was cited for being above the politics that led to his Senate defeat in 1866.

“He was no seeker after popularity, certainly he never descended to any truckling arts to secure it, and probably to some extent he lost favor by the high tone of both his character and bearing, and by the selectness of his friendships,” the obituary said.

A New York Times article from 1875 sheds some more light on Foster’s loss of his Senate seat. The Republicans picked another nominee at a caucus in 1866, and Foster signaled his agreement to run as a rival candidate supported by Connecticut’s Democrats. Foster dropped out at the last moment to accept a judge’s position in the state.

The Times article said Foster remained bitter about losing his Senate seat.

“He does not appear to be have ever recovered from the disappointment of his defeat in 1866,” the article stated.

And what would have happened in the special presidential election of November 1865? The Republican Party was already split between its Radical and Moderate wings.

General Grant may have run for president as a compromise candidate, but other prominent Republicans included Seward, Colfax, Thaddeus Stevens, and Benjamin Wade.

The Democrats were also divided and had been badly beaten in the 1864 presidential campaign. Former New York Governor Horatio Seymour, the eventual 1868 nominee, was a key player in the party, as was George H. Pendleton, the 1864 vice presidential nominee. General Winfield Scott Hancock had presidential ambitions in later years, and he had personally supervised the executions in the Lincoln assassination case.

The former Confederate states wouldn’t have been involved, since they weren’t readmitted to the union.

Benjamin Wade replaced Foster as Senate president pro tempore in 1867 and nearly became acting president in 1868, when President Johnson avoided removal from office by one vote in a Senate trial.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/05/13/justice-department-secretly-obtains-ap-phone-records/,2013-05-13 00:00:00,[],Justice Department secretly obtained AP phone records,"The Justice Department secretly obtained two months of telephone records of reporters and editors for The Associated Press in what the news cooperative's top executive called a ""massive and unprecedented intrusion"" into how news organizations gather the news.

The records obtained by the Justice Department listed outgoing calls for the work and personal phone numbers of individual reporters, for general AP office numbers in New York, Washington and Hartford, Conn., and for the main number for the AP in the House of Representatives press gallery, according to attorneys for the AP. It was not clear if the records also included incoming calls or the duration of the calls.

In all, the government seized the records for more than 20 separate telephone lines assigned to AP and its journalists in April and May of 2012. The exact number of journalists who used the phone lines during that period is unknown, but more than 100 journalists work in the offices where phone records were targeted, on a wide array of stories about government and other matters.

In a letter of protest sent to Attorney General Eric Holder on Monday, AP President and Chief Executive Officer Gary Pruitt said the government sought and obtained information far beyond anything that could be justified by any specific investigation. He demanded the return of the phone records and destruction of all copies.

""There can be no possible justification for such an overbroad collection of the telephone communications of The Associated Press and its reporters. These records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources across all of the newsgathering activities undertaken by the AP during a two-month period, provide a road map to AP's newsgathering operations and disclose information about AP's activities and operations that the government has no conceivable right to know,"" Pruitt said.

More On This...

The government would not say why it sought the records. Officials have previously said in public testimony that the U.S. attorney in Washington is conducting a criminal investigation into who may have provided information contained in a May 7, 2012, AP story about a foiled terror plot. The story disclosed details of a CIA operation in Yemen that stopped an Al Qaeda plot in the spring of 2012 to detonate a bomb on an airplane bound for the United States.

In testimony in February, CIA Director John Brennan noted that the FBI had questioned him about whether he was AP's source, which he denied. He called the release of the information to the media about the terror plot an ""unauthorized and dangerous disclosure of classified information.""

Prosecutors have sought phone records from reporters before, but the seizure of records from such a wide array of AP offices, including general AP switchboards numbers and an office-wide shared fax line, is unusual.

In the letter notifying the AP, which was received Friday, the Justice Department offered no explanation for the seizure, according to Pruitt's letter and attorneys for the AP. The records were presumably obtained from phone companies earlier this year although the government letter did not explain that. None of the information provided by the government to the AP suggested the actual phone conversations were monitored.

Among those whose phone numbers were obtained were five reporters and an editor who were involved in the May 7, 2012, story.

The Obama administration has aggressively investigated disclosures of classified information to the media and has brought six cases against people suspected of providing classified information, more than under all previous presidents combined.

The White House on Monday said that other than press reports it had no knowledge of Justice Department attempts to seek AP phone records.

""We are not involved in decisions made in connection with criminal investigations, as those matters are handled independently by the Justice Department,"" spokesman Jay Carney said.

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the investigative House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said on CNN, ""They had an obligation to look for every other way to get it before they intruded on the freedom of the press.""

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in an emailed statement: ""The burden is always on the government when they go after private information, especially information regarding the press or its confidential sources. ... On the face of it, I am concerned that the government may not have met that burden. I am very troubled by these allegations and want to hear the government's explanation.""

The American Civil Liberties Union said the use of subpoenas for a broad swath of records has a chilling effect both on journalists and whistleblowers who want to reveal government wrongdoing. ""The attorney general must explain the Justice Department's actions to the public so that we can make sure this kind of press intimidation does not happen again,"" said Laura Murphy, the director of ACLU's Washington legislative office.

Rules published by the Justice Department require that subpoenas of records of news organizations must be personally approved by the attorney general, but it was not known if that happened in this case. The letter notifying AP that its phone records had been obtained through subpoenas was sent Friday by Ronald Machen, the U.S. attorney in Washington.

William Miller, a spokesman for Machen, said Monday that in general the U.S. attorney follows ""all applicable laws, federal regulations and Department of Justice policies when issuing subpoenas for phone records of media organizations."" But he would not address questions about the specifics of the AP records. ""We do not comment on ongoing criminal investigations,"" Miller said in an email.

The Justice Department lays out strict rules for efforts to get phone records from news organizations. A subpoena can be considered only after ""all reasonable attempts"" have been made to get the same information from other sources, the rules say. It was unclear what other steps, in total, the Justice Department might have taken to get information in the case.

A subpoena to the media must be ""as narrowly drawn as possible"" and ""should be directed at relevant information regarding a limited subject matter and should cover a reasonably limited time period,"" according to the rules.

The reason for these constraints, the department says, is to avoid actions that ""might impair the news gathering function"" because the government recognizes that ""freedom of the press can be no broader than the freedom of reporters to investigate and report the news.""

News organizations normally are notified in advance that the government wants phone records and then they enter into negotiations over the desired information. In this case, however, the government, in its letter to the AP, cited an exemption to those rules that holds that prior notification can be waived if such notice, in the exemption's wording, might ""pose a substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation.""

It is unknown whether a judge or a grand jury signed off on the subpoenas.

The May 7, 2012, AP story that disclosed details of the CIA operation in Yemen to stop an airliner bomb plot occurred around the one-year anniversary of the May 2, 2011, killing of Osama bin Laden.

The plot was significant both because of its seriousness and also because the White House previously had told the public it had ""no credible information that terrorist organizations, including Al Qaeda, are plotting attacks in the U.S. to coincide with the (May 2) anniversary of bin Laden's death.""

The AP delayed reporting the story at the request of government officials who said it would jeopardize national security. Once officials said those concerns were allayed, the AP disclosed the plot, though the Obama administration continued to request that the story be held until the administration could make an official announcement.

The May 7 story was written by reporters Matt Apuzzo and Adam Goldman with contributions from reporters Kimberly Dozier, Eileen Sullivan and Alan Fram. They and their editor, Ted Bridis, were among the journalists whose April-May 2012 phone records were seized by the government.

Brennan talked about the AP story and investigation in written testimony to the Senate. ""The irresponsible and damaging leak of classified information was made ... when someone informed The Associated Press that the U.S. government had intercepted an IED (improvised explosive device) that was supposed to be used in an attack and that the U.S. government currently had that IED in its possession and was analyzing it,"" he wrote.

He also defended the White House decision to discuss the plot afterward. ""Once someone leaked information about interdiction of the IED and that the IED was actually in our possession, it was imperative to inform the American people consistent with government policy that there was never any danger to the American people associated with this Al Qaeda plot,"" Brennan told senators."

A terrific ad, if you ask me. And, yes, I'm biased.

The plan was for the ad to run during President Obama's Tuesday appearance as Jay Leno's guest on the Tonight Show. Garofoli writes:



“After a careful review,” a station spokesman said, “it was determined that this ad violates our guidelines. We have communicated that to the advertiser.” Declining to air an ad rarely happens. (A TV station turning down money? C’mon, now.) Here’s where the ad may have run into trouble, according to NBC‘s advertising guidelines, it was seen as an attack of a personal nature. Quipped someone close to the ad team: “Did we hurt the pipeline’s feelings?” No, more like it was directed at TransCanada CEO Russ Girling.

General Standard for Acceptance:

We do not make judgments on an advertiser’s opinions, and we accept issue advertisements that express divergent points of view. We do, however, reserve the right to require substantiation of factual claims made by an advertiser. Advertisements generally will be accepted if there is a basis for the claims and such claims fall within the bounds of reasonable debate. Unacceptable Content:

An advertisement may be rejected if its content, or other content referenced in the ad or otherwise disseminated by the advertiser, is grossly offensive (e.g., on racial, religious or ethnic grounds). An advertisement may also be rejected if: (1) it is merely an attack of a personal nature, a direct attack on an individual business or a comment on a private dispute; or (2) it contains violent or otherwise graphic or potentially offensive content that is deemed incompatible with a network’s viewing environment or general standards; or (3) its content or style of production is otherwise deemed inconsistent with a network’s viewing environment or general standards, as determined by a network in its sole discretion. An acceptance may be subject to limitations regarding time period and type of programming

The guidelines:Lots of wiggle room there to reject just about anything the powers-that-be want to reject. Those powers-that-be include, of course, the fossil-fuel industry with its hefty advertising budget. The industry ads, of course, are all daffodils and tra-la-la-la, never anything offensive in them at all, nuh uh.

Please join Daily Kos and the Natural Resources Defense Council in urging President Obama to keep his promise and reject the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline."

A question from Francoise Maroy in Reunion Island:

Is ""The United States"" considered as a singular or a plural noun?















Ask about English Listen to the answer

Karen Adams answers:

Thank you for your question Francoise; this is a really interesting one. Basically in English, there is a group of nouns which can be either singular or plural depending on what you want to say about them. So for example, if we’re looking at the United States the country we would normally use the singular verb so for example – “The United States is a very big country.”



However, if we’re thinking about the government in the United States we might want to use a plural noun - “The United States are a major power in the World.” This singular plural difference is one that we see reflected in a number of other nouns in English. For example, when we’re talking about the government we can say – “The government has won the election.” Or we can say “The government have won the election.” This depends if we see the government as a collection of individuals - “The government have won the election.” – or if we see the government as one thing - “The government has won the election.”



Another noun that works like this is team. “The team has won the trophy.” It means we’re looking at the team as one unified thing – as one thing. However, if the team have many difficulties, we could be talking about the individuals within the team. So this is a group of nouns that can be singular or plural depending on what you want to say about them.



It’s quite a small group of nouns, and usually the nouns in this group refer to politics or the state – so for example when we are talking about the police, the army, the navy, we can use plural or singular.



The thing to remember, is when we look at them as a collection of individuals, we would normally use a plural noun, and if we want to look at them as a unified institution we use the singular.



So in answer to your question Françoise, the United States can be singular or can be plural, depending on what you want to say about them. However, normally if you’re talking about the country, use the singular verb.



I hope that helps.

Dole said the Republican Party had become a party of idea free ideologues who obstructed too much. He also stated that Ronald Reagan himself could not have made it as a Republican. Bill Maher took exception to that statement. In fact Maher laid out a pretty detail factual observation that would lead anyone to come to the conclusion that in fact Reagan was pretty much the pre-incarnation of the Tea Party.

Bill Maher: Ronald Reagan was an anti-government, union busting, race bating, anti-abortion, anti-gay, anti-intellectual who cut rich people’s taxes in half, had an incurable case of the military industrial complex, and said Medicare was socialism that would destroy our freedom. It sounds to me like he would fit in just fine. …

Besides the possibility that the whole thing might be a ""data-harvesting operation designed to vacuum up contact information and credit card numbers from unsuspecting and largely clueless conservative activists,"" there are already signs that participants are going to number in the tens.

Current head has been criticized for opposing plans for partial forgiveness of mortgage debt

If confirmed by the Senate%2C he would replace Edward DeMarco

Watt%27s nomination comes at a crucial time for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac

WASHINGTON -- President Obama nominated North Carolina congressman Mel Watt on Wednesday to head the government agency that oversees the government-backed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, prompting criticism from Republicans opposed to allowing some principal reductions for struggling homeowners.

""Mel understands as well as anybody what caused the housing crisis,"" Obama said in nominating Watt to be head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. ""He knows what it's going to take to help responsible homeowners fully recover.""

If confirmed by the Senate, Watt would replace acting FHFA Director Edward DeMarco, who has been criticized by Democratic lawmakers and housing advocates for opposing plans for partial forgiveness of mortgage debt.

Republicans have signaled opposition to Watt's nomination, saying proposals to reduce principals are likely to lead to more mortgage defaults and cost taxpayers money.

Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., a member of the Senate banking committee, said, ""I could not be more disappointed in this nomination. This gives new meaning to the adage that the fox is guarding the hen house. The debate around his nomination will illuminate for all Americans why Fannie and Freddie failed so miserably.""

Senate Republicans blocked a previous Obama nominee for the housing job, North Carolina banking regulator Joseph A. Smith Jr.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called on the Obama administration to remove DeMarco as acting director of FHFA, saying it ""has refused repeatedly — often with cold indifference — to work with families struggling to save their homes.""

Warren also said that Watt ""is a thoughtful policymaker with a deep background in finance and a long record as a champion for working families.""

In March, attorneys general from nine states, led by Democrats Eric Schneiderman of New York and Martha Coakley of Massachusetts, sent Obama a letter saying that under DeMarco's tenure, Fannie and Freddie have been a ""direct impediment to our economic recovery.""

Obama made the Watt announcement at the same time he nominated venture capitalist Tom Wheeler to chair the Federal Communications Commission.

Watt has represented the Charlotte area in the U.S. House for 20 years. Obama pointed out that Watt is a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, which handles housing policy.

""Mel has led efforts to rein in unscrupulous mortgage lenders,"" Obama said. ""He's helped protect consumers from the kind of reckless risk-taking that led to the financial crisis in the first place. And he's fought to give more Americans in low-income neighborhoods access to affordable housing.""

Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Tex., who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, said the issue isn't Watt, but what he called the Obama administration's refusal to reform the housing finance system.

Hensarling said DeMarco, the acting director, ""has emphasized protecting the interests of taxpayers and reforming Fannie and Freddie,"" and that ""whoever sits in the FHFA director's chair needs to continue DeMarco's policies. If they simply do whatever the administration wants, they will have failed.""

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government sponsored mortgage-finance enterprises that the government rescued at the height of the financial crisis in September 2008 as they neared collapse from losses on soured mortgage loans.

Taxpayers have spent about $170 billion to rescue the companies. So far, they have repaid a combined $55.2 billion.

Fannie and Freddie together own or guarantee about half of all U.S. mortgages, or nearly 31 million home loans. Those loans are worth more than $5 trillion. Along with other federal agencies, they back roughly 90% of new mortgages.

The White House has been lining up supporters who might hold some sway with GOP senators as they consider Watt's nomination.

Erskine Bowles, a fellow North Carolinian and former White House chief of staff under President Clinton, praised Watt as a first-rate selection, telling the Associated Press that he brings ""a bright mind, great work habits and an understanding of how Washington works to the job.""

(CNN) - The host of a fundraiser and major donor to the Democratic Party complimented President Barack Obama for his hospitality back in Washington but joked about the lack of valet parking at the White House, offering to pay for the addition.

Billionaire Haim Saban, and his wife Cheryl, hosted the President and a group of Hollywood and political elites at their estate in Beverly Hills Monday night for a fundraiser for Democratic House and Senate campaign committees.



""Last Friday, the President and First Lady were very generous and kind with their time, they invited us to the White House for a very small intimate dinner. And we had a wonderful time – great food, great company, very inspiring,"" Saban said while introducing the President, according to reporters who attended the event.

But Haim added: ""No valet parking!""

""You know what? I had to walk to the White House. We have valet parking at the Sabans! So, Mr. President, if you would, please, thank you. Taxpayers' money? I'll fund it, no problem,"" he joked.

The President then took the stage, responding that there was valet parking... just not for him.

""Now, let me clarify something. First of all, there was valet parking for Cheryl,"" he said to laughs.

""We thought it was appropriate for Haim to get some exercise. Cheryl, being the wonderful person that she is, declined the valet parking and so she might have joined him. But I would have been happy to have her drive right up into the South Lawn.""

The Israeli-American media mogul first hit it big in the 1990s, creating and producing the children's show the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Saban owns the Spanish-language media company Univision. In September, Saban's net worth amounted to $3.4 billion, according to Forbes.

The President's stop at the Beverly Hills fundraiser comes as a part of a three-day West Coast swing.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi also spoke at the event, along with DCCC Chairman Steve Israel and DSCC Chairman Michael Bennet, according to a DCCC official. Over one hundred people attended the dinner, paying between $16,200 and $32,400."

Nearly all of them declined to speak for attribution, citing their unwillingness to alienate the Clinton family.

Last Thursday, Mr. Clinton arrived two hours late to an exuberant welcome at a health clinic about 60 miles north of Johannesburg. Children in zebra-striped loincloths sang as Mr. Clinton and Ms. Clinton made their entrance, and the former president enthusiastically explained how his foundation had helped the South African government negotiate large reductions in the price of drugs that halt the progress of HIV. Aaron Motsoaledi, South Africa’s minister of health, heaped praise on the effort. “Because of your help we are able to treat three and a half times more people than we used to,” he told the crowd.

The project is typical of the model pioneered by the Clinton Foundation, built around dozens of partnerships with private companies, governments, or other nonprofit groups. Instead of handing out grants, the foundation recruits donors and advises them on how best to deploy their money or resources, from helping Procter & Gamble donate advanced water-purification packets to developing countries to working with credit card companies to expand the volume of low-cost loans offered to poor inner city residents.

The foundation, which has 350 employees in 180 countries, remains largely powered by Mr. Clinton’s global celebrity and his ability to connect corporate executives, A-listers and government officials. On this month’s Africa trip, Mr. Clinton was accompanied by the actors Dakota Fanning and Jesse Eisenberg and the son of the New York City mayoral candidate John A. Catsimatidis, a longtime donor.

For most of the foundation’s existence, its leadership has been dominated by loyal veterans of the Clintons’ political lives. Ira C. Magaziner, who was a Rhodes scholar with Mr. Clinton and ran Mrs. Clinton’s failed attempt at a health care overhaul in the 1990s, is widely credited as the driving force behind the foundation’s largest project, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, which, among other efforts, negotiates bulk purchasing agreements and price discounts on lifesaving medicines.

Mr. Band, who arrived at the White House in 1995 and worked his way up to become Mr. Clinton’s closest personal aide, standing behind the president on golf courses and the global stage, helped build the foundation’s fund-raising structure. He conceived of and for many years helped run the Clinton Global Initiative, the annual conference that draws hundreds of business leaders and heads of state to New York City where attendees are pushed to make specific philanthropic commitments.

Today, big-name companies vie to buy sponsorships at prices of $250,000 and up, money that has helped subsidize the foundation’s annual operating costs. Last year, the foundation and two subsidiaries had revenues of more than $214 million."

He might as well have been talking to one of the statues in the Capitol. Republicans have made it clear that erecting hurdles for Mr. Obama is, if anything, their overriding legislative goal.

There is no historical precedent for the number of cabinet-level nominees that Republicans have blocked or delayed in the Obama administration. Chuck Hagel became the first defense secretary nominee ever filibustered. John Brennan, the C.I.A. director, was the subject of an epic filibuster by Senator Rand Paul. Kathleen Sebelius and John Bryson, the secretaries of health and human services and commerce, were subjected to 60-vote confirmation margins instead of simple majorities. Susan Rice surely would have been filibustered and thus was not nominated to be secretary of state.

Jacob Lew, the Treasury secretary, was barraged with 444 written questions, mostly from Republicans, more than the previous seven nominees for that position combined. Many were ridiculous and had nothing to do with Mr. Lew’s fitness for office, such as a demand to explain the Treasury’s social media policies, or questioning an infographic on the department’s blog eight months ago.

Gina McCarthy, the nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, is being blocked by Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri until he gets the answers he wants on a local levee project. And Thomas Perez, nominated to be labor secretary, is being held up by Senator David Vitter of Louisiana, who is angry about the Justice Department’s enforcement of voting rights laws. By comparison, there were four filibusters of cabinet-level positions during George W. Bush’s two terms, and one under President Ronald Reagan."
http://news.yahoo.com/high-powered-traveling-companions-air-force-one-213718204--politics.html,,[],High-powered traveling companions on Air Force One,"ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) — As Air Force One made its way from Washington to Johannesburg Monday, a president, a former president and a possible future president were all traveling aboard.

The high-powered traveling partners came together for a transcontinental trip to South Africa for a memorial service honoring Nelson Mandela, the former South African leader who died last week at the age of 95. The unusual manifest required some creative seating arrangements on the presidential plane.

Obama and Michelle Obama occupied the president's stateroom at the front of the plane. Former President George W. Bush and wife Laura were settled nearby in the plane's medical suite, which can function as an operating room. And former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton — a potential candidate for president in 2016 — was given a spot in a cabin normally occupied by senior staff.

The plane's spacious conference room served as a gathering spot for the former president and three first ladies, with the current commander-in-chief popping in between in-flight meetings and calls. And there was no shortage of time for catching up. The flight from Washington to Johannesburg was scheduled to span about 16 hours, including a one-hour refueling stop in Dakar, Senegal.

""It's a very, I think, enjoyable experience certainly for the president and first lady,"" said White House spokesman Jay Carney. ""And they're both grateful to be able to have former president and first lady, former secretary of state on board.""

For Bush, the flight marked the first time he had stepped foot on Air Force One since leaving the presidency nearly five years ago. He and the former first lady were already on board the plane in Washington when Obama arrived, skipping an on-camera greeting with the current president and first lady.

Bush has purposely tried to stay out of the public eye since leaving office. But he wandered back to the plane's press cabin for two lengthy off-the-record conversations with reporters, returning the second time with Laura Bush in tow.

Story continues

Clinton is no stranger to the presidential plane, having traveled aboard Air Force One frequently as both first lady and secretary of state. And many Democrats have visions of her making many more trips aboard the plane, though they hope she'll be the one occupying the front cabin.

The White House invited all of the living American presidents to travel to South Africa on Air Force One. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter were instead traveling on their own, while 89-year-old George H.W. Bush was unable to attend the memorial because he can no longer travel far distances.

Curl reveals that unlike Obama, Bush was concerned with public perception (especially during the war in Iraq) and made an effort to schedule holiday vacations in a way that wouldn’t take others away from their families — even a media that despised him:

“I think playing golf during a war just sends the wrong signal,” [President George W. Bush] said years later. “I don’t want some mom whose son may have recently died to see the commander in chief playing golf. I feel I owe it to the families to be in solidarity as best as I can with them.”

That’s also why Mr. Bush did two other things, without fanfare or praise. First, he never headed home to his Texas ranch until after Christmas, instead going to Camp David for a few days. That way, the hundreds of people revolving around him at all times — White House staff, Secret Service agents, reporters, photographers, all the others — could spend the holiday with their families in and around Washington, D.C. No one ever reported that — until this column.

Second, he rarely attended sporting events, although he once owned a baseball team and was a self-confessed stats junkie. His thinking there was the same: If he went to a baseball game (right down the street from the White House), his mere presence would mean hours and hours of extra security for fans.

Conversely, Obama, who never has to worry about the media turning against him (including lying for weeks about a terror attack in Libya), doesn’t give a damn about public perception — not during a recession; not even during a time when sequester cuts are being blamed for the closing of White House tours and airport control towers:

How else to explain the nonstop vacations the pair keep taking during what Mr. Obama calls the “worst financial crisis since the Great Depression”? In 2013, the First Family has already enjoyed three vacations — that’s one a month. (Sorry, Joe America, you might have to forget your week at the beach again this year, but make sure you get those taxes in on time!)

Curl closes the piece (which you will want to read in full) by making the point about how much this juxtaposition tells you about Obama. And indeed it does. But I would add that it also reveals just as much about our media.

The Military Coalition, some 27 military groups, wrote to leaders in Congress and President Obama late Wednesday about their ""strong objection"" and ""grave concern"" over the budget deal.

The deal cuts pension cost of living raises by 1 percentage point for military retirees who aren't disabled and not yet 62 years old. Cost of living hikes are automatic raises intended to keep up with inflation.

The problem is, most military retirees are a lot younger than private sector retirees. They enlist in their 20's and retire in their 40's. Very few stay on till they are 62 -- those who may be lucky enough to escape major injuries at war, or rose to higher echelons in the military system.

When compounded, the 1 percentage point cut could result in much more than a 20% reduction in retiree pensions over 20 years.

Related: 5 things the budget deal doesn't do

The average cut in pension payouts, including compounding interest, for a retiring Army Sergeant first class, would be about $3,700 each year, according to the Military Officers Association of America. Over 20 years, the total losses could balloon to more than $80,000.

""While portrayed as a minor change, a 20% reduction in retired pay and survivor benefit values is a massive cut in military career benefits,"" wrote groups, including the Air Force Sergeants Association, Iraq & Afghanistan Veterans of America and the Marine Corps League, among others in the letter.

The change is infuriating to military retirees like Army Col. Michael Barron, who retired nearly 4 years ago, after 30 years of service, which included being deployed to both Iraq wars.

""It's not fair at all. I spent a 30 year career in the military. I clearly understood what the (cost of living increases) would be,"" said Barron, deputy director of government relations for the Military Officers Association of America. ""This is the worst kind of example of a shady, backroom deal.""

The cut is forcing some to reconsider how much longer they will continue to work with the military.

Rebekah Sanderlin's husband is two years away from hitting his 20 year retirement mark with the Army and she's wondering if its worth it. He's served in Afghanistan four times, among other places, and has many injuries.

""The war has been very hard on our family,"" said Sanderlin, a writer. ""We'd like to stay in, but it seems stupid to give more time to a government that goes back on their word.""

Military groups say the cut is particularly unfair because the changes will affect those who have already put in their years of service.

""To tax the very men and women who have sacrificed and served more than others is simply a foul,"" the letter stated.

Related: A new normal for government retirees

Washington leaders, and House Republicans, in particular, have been worried about the cost of military retiree benefits.

In 2012, the Pentagon spent $52.4 billion on 2.3 million military retirees and survivors, a cost that is expected to rise over the next few decades, according to the Department of Defense Office of the Actuary.

House budget chief Rep. Paul Ryan's website states that military retirement ""provides an exceptionally generous benefit, often providing 40 years of pension payments in return for 20 years of service,"" as it explains why benefits should be trimmed.

""Current levels of military compensation are incompatible with the overall demands on the defense budget,"" according to a House Committee on the Budget Report.

Military groups say they're open to reforms, but they'd like such changes to go through the normal legislative process that allows time to review and ""assess any recommendations that could significantly impact retention and readiness.""

Barron said groups like his were ""blindsided"" by the cuts to military pensions.

The cut ends up saving the budget $6 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Congress would also make newly hired civilian federal workers contribute 1.3% more of their paychecks to pensions if the budget deal becomes law.

The Department of Defense wouldn't comment on the Military Coalition letter and pointed to a statement by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel saying the budget deal provides greater ""budget certainty,"" while reducing the impact of massive cuts from so-called sequester.

Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly characterized the cost of living cut as 1%. In fact, it is a cut of 1 percentage point."

(CNN) —

The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the bipartisan “Gang of Eight” immigration reform bill on Tuesday, sending the measure to the Senate floor for consideration and giving the bill’s backers their first major legislative victory.

Members of the Democratic-controlled panel voted 13-5 in favor of the measure.

If enacted, the plan would constitute the first overhaul of the nation’s immigration policy since 1986.

“The dysfunction in our current immigration system affects all of us and it is long past time for reform. I hope that our history, our values, and our decency can inspire us finally to take action,” Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, said.

Spectators cramming the committee room applauded and cheered loudly following the vote.

The panel’s 10 Democrats were joined in supporting the bill by three Republicans: Arizona’s Jeff Flake, South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham, and Utah’s Orrin Hatch. Flake and Graham are two of its four Republican authors.

Opinion: ‘Rogue’ DHS unions follow Obama’s lead on deportation

Both party leaders in the Senate appeared supportive of the effort, a positive sign for backers hoping to win a solid majority in the full chamber.

“I think the ‘Gang of Eight’ has made a substantial contribution to moving the issue forward,” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. “I’m hopeful we’ll be able to get a bill that we can pass here in the Senate.”

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, praised the “masterful” job of Leahy in navigating roughly 300 proposed amendments and advancing the 844-page bill to the floor.

Immigration reform is a priority for both parties in Washington and so far is one example of bipartisanship this year on major legislation in a sharply divided Congress.

A key political aim involves Republicans hoping to attract more Hispanics to their side, while Democrats wishing to keep that growing voter bloc squarely in their camp.

Latinos voted overwhelmingly for President Barack Obama’s re-election. He congratulated the committee on its work and urged the Senate to bring the bill to the floor at its earliest possible opportunity.

“The legislation that passed the Judiciary Committee with a strong bipartisan vote is largely consistent with the principles of commonsense reform I have proposed and meets the challenge of fixing our broken immigration system,” he said in a statement. “None of the Committee members got everything they wanted, and neither did I, but in the end, we all owe it to the American people to get the best possible result over the finish line.”

The measure approved by the Judiciary panel would create a 13-year path to citizenship for most of the country’s 11 million undocumented immigrants.

Bipartisan House immigration talks foundering, Republican warns

It aims to strengthen border security while raising the cap on visas for high skilled workers and establishing a new visa program for low skilled workers on America’s farms and elsewhere.

Proponents say the change is necessary to permanently and fairly resolve the status of undocumented residents. Critics insist the proposed change amounts to amnesty, rewarding those who chose to break the country’s immigration laws.

Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, is leading the charge against the “Gang of Eight” proposal and is a tough critic.

He has tried to derail the bill at nearly every turn, arguing that adding millions of newly legalized workers to the mix over the next few years will only hurt the most vulnerable segments of the American work force. He also has raised security and other concerns.

“This will be a hammer blow to the wages and employment opportunities of American workers—both immigrant and native born,” Sessions said in a statement after the vote.

“This bill is bad for workers, bad for taxpayers and—as immigration officers have pleaded for us to hear—a threat to public safety and the rule of law,” he said.

In a defeat for backers of expanded gay rights, the committee did not approve a pair of Leahy-sponsored amendments bolstering federal support for bi-national same-sex relationships.

Specifically, Leahy had proposed recognizing same-sex marriages in which one spouse is an American, and allowing U.S. citizens to sponsor foreign-born same-sex partners for green cards given proof of a committed relationship.

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the most prominent Republican in the “Gang of Eight,” was among those who called Leahy’s amendments a poison pill virtually certain to destroy GOP support for the measure.

Immigration bill is Democratic plot, House conservative says

Leahy’s amendments could be considered again when the bill is taken up by the full Senate. Doing so, however, would be little more than a symbolic gesture, as the proposals have virtually no chance of winning the 60 votes almost certainly needed to clear the 100-member chamber.

Earlier this month, Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Illinois, noted the possibility that an upcoming ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court on the federal Defense of Marriage Act could render the whole issue moot.

“The DOMA ruling could change this whole debate,” Durbin said. “They could eliminate DOMA and impose obligations on our federal government (relating to) same gender marriage, and that would dramatically change what we’re trying to achieve.”

The House is working on its own version of immigration reform."

They argue President Obama cannot be trusted to enforce the laws and that state and local governments across the country have already established roadblocks to enforcement. They point most recently to a study by the Federation for American Immigration Reform showing 103 U.S. cities, towns and counties have resolutions, ordinances, executive actions and other initiatives “designed to thwart federal law enforcement efforts.”

Whether the Republican-led House will vote on immigration reform has become a hot issue on Capitol Hill now that lawmakers have, at least temporarily, resolved their recent fiscal crises and with just 16 more days remaining in this legislative session.

House Speaker John Boehner has expressed interest in allowing votes on several incremental immigration bills, which would likely include one on tighter border security.

However, those concerned about the enforcement of immigration laws also fear House leaders will take their legislation to a conference committee with Senate Democrats and leave with a comprehensive bill that is tantamount to amnesty for many of this country’s 11 million illegal immigrants.

“If the leadership appoints conferees and we go to conference committee with the Senate over the Schumer-Rubio amnesty bill, the odds are pretty good they're going to come out with something that is basically the same as Schumer's bill,” Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, said recently.

That situation might put enough pressure on Boehner to put that bill to a full floor vote, which would likely pass with support from House Democrats and moderate Republicans, critics argue.

In addition, roughly 130 pro-enforcement groups recently sent a letter to Boehner asking him to not allow House immigration legislation to reach the conference committee.

The FAIR study released Friday shows the majority of so-called “sanctuary” policies, 104 including the District of Columbia, have been put in place since Obama took office in 2009 and that almost half were set in the past two years.

“All across the country, local officials are buckling to special interest demands that immigration lawbreakers not only be tolerated, but protected,” group President Dan Stein said.

The sanctuary policies essentially provides leeway for state and local police officers in complying with a 1996 federal law requiring them to assist the U.S. government with illegal immigrants. The policies also essentially say the officers do not question the status of suspected illegal immigrants.

California and Connecticut are among the major states to have sanctuary-type policies, with many East Coast cities having similar ones.

FAIR spokesman Bob Dane said Wednesday he thinks Americans are concerned about Obama not enforcing the law in large part because his administration has issued guidelines on who Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can pursue and because of the president’s 2012 Executive Order that allows young people who entered the country as children to remain for two years without fear of deportation."

http://news.yahoo.com/april-fools-german-america-official-language-102422201.html,,[],Did German almost become America’s official language in 1795?,"For centuries, stories have persisted about Congress almost approving German as our official language, except for one vote by its German-speaking leader. So how close is that story to the truth?

muhlenberg

Frederick Muhlenberg

On April 1, 1789, Frederick Muhlenberg was chosen as the first speaker of the House of Representatives. Muhlenberg’s father, Henry, was born in Germany, and he was considered the founder of the Lutheran Church in the Colonies.

Young Frederick was born outside of Philadelphia; he studied theology in Germany. He began his life of public service as a member of the Continental Congress. He also served as the speaker of Pennsylvania’s House and led the Pennsylvania delegation that ratified the Constitution.

Muhlenberg then emerged as the preferred candidate for the speaker’s role as the House neared a quorum for its first meeting in 1789.

During two terms as speaker, Muhlenberg was the first person to sign the Bill of Rights, but his tie-breaking vote on the controversial Jay Treaty proved to be his undoing. Muhlenberg lost a re-election bid after that, and his national political career was over.

But his “legendary” role in preventing the adoption of German as the United States’ official language gained steam over the years.

The late German academic Willi Paul Adams published a study in 1990 that included an explanation of why so many people believed Muhlenberg acted to block a congressional resolution that would have made German the national language.

“Fascinating for Germans, this imagined decision has been popularized by German authors of travel literature since the 1840s and propagated by some American teachers of German and German teachers of English who are not entirely secure in their American history,” Adams wrote.

“In reality, this presumed proposition was never brought to the congressional floor and a vote was never taken,” he added.

Dennis Baron, professor of English and linguistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, also tells a similar tale in an article he penned for PBS’s website, after the Muhlenberg legend popped up in an Ann Landers column.

Story continues

“On January 13, 1795, Congress considered a proposal, not to give German any official status, but merely to print the federal laws in German as well as English. During the debate, a motion to adjourn failed by one vote. The final vote rejecting the translation of federal laws, which took place one month later, is not recorded,” Baron said, who cites two contemporary sources for the account.

Baron traces the legend to an 1847 book by Franz Löher called History and Achievements of the Germans in America, which Baron says “presents a garbled though frequently cited account of what is supposed to have happened.”

Adams also pointed out that just 9 percent of the early United States was German-speaking, and that the vast English-speaking majority would have had a few problems with the concept of an official language.

“Colonial speakers of English fought only for their political independence. They had no stomach for an anti-English language and cultural revolution,” Adams said.

Muhlenberg’s role in passing the Jay Treaty with Great Britain was much more controversial than his alleged involvement in promoting the German language.

The Senate had passed the treaty by a mandatory two-thirds majority, but the House was needed to fund its provisions. Muhlenberg sided with the Federalists against an opposition led by James Madison.

In 1796, he cast the key vote in recommending the House fund the treaty. According to several accounts, Muhlenberg was stabbed by his brother-in-law several days later for that act. He survived that attack and later died in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1801.

http://news.yahoo.com/five-lessons-learn-george-washington-farewell-address-102413757.html,,[],Five lessons we can learn from George Washington’s Farewell Address,"On September 19, 1796, a Philadelphia newspaper published one of the greatest documents in American history: George Washington’s Farewell Address. Even today, some people in that other “Washington” could learn a few lessons from the first president.

Read the entire Farewell Address

Washington’s letter was significant in two ways: It signaled that he wasn’t running for a third term in office, and it served as a warning—and an inspiration—for future generations.

No less a critic than Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall said the address spoke to “precepts to which the American statesman can not too frequently recur.”

So what makes the Farewell Address such a great speech? Here are five lessons we can learn from the first president about communicating.

1. Use great speechwriters

President Washington first considered a Farewell Address four years earlier, but the infighting between Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson made Washington run for a second term, and he put the speech aside.

At the time, Washington asked James Madison to write a draft Farewell Address for his consideration. Then, in 1796, Washington asked his longtime aide, Hamilton, to do an extensive rewrite based on Washington’s concepts.

In the end, Washington stayed true to the points he felt were important, and he used elements of Madison and Hamilton’s work, too. But Washington wrote out the speech in his own handwriting and he was its final editor.

The University of Virginia has an excellent online analysis of all the drafts.

2. Get right to the point

In the opening paragraph, Washington makes it clear by end of the first sentence that he isn’t running for a third term of office. How often do you hear political speeches today where the major point is addressed immediately?

3. Make sure you thank everyone

In his second paragraph, Washington thanked the American people for the opportunity to serve—even though he was a near unanimous choice for president in two elections.

Story continues

“I am influenced by no diminution of zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful respect for your past kindness, but am supported by a full conviction that the step is compatible with both,” he says.

4. Make sure you unite your audience

After Washington thanked everyone and made sure they understood his decision was best for the country, he reminded the audience that they neededto remain united, despite their many differences.

“The name of American, which belongs to you, in your national capacity must always exalt the just pride of Patriotism, more than any appellation derived from local discriminations,” he says.

He also added a reminder about the then nine-year-old Constitution.

“I shall carry it with me to my grave, as a strong incitement to unceasing vows that heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence; that your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free Constitution, which is the work of your hands, may be sacredly maintained; that its administration in every department may be stamped with wisdom and virtue,” he says.

5. Offer advice in a thoughtful way

Most of the address is an extended policy statement about Washington’s eight years in office, as well some extended statements intended to make a point.

The two most famous statements in the Farewell Address are comments about political parties and foreign alliances. Washington didn’t like the idea of political parties (which he called “baneful”) and made that clear in a concluding statement in a passage about factions. “The common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it,” he said.

The president also famously warned that the United States should stay “steer clear of permanent Alliances with any portion of the foreign world.” Washington didn’t say that the young nation should be isolationist; in fact, he said that it should “observe good faith and justice towards all nations.”

But his advice was that any permanent alliance should be considered greatly, even he wasn’t a big believer in them. “I hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private affairs, that honesty is always the best policy. I repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed in their genuine sense. But, in my opinion, it is unnecessary and would be unwise to extend them,” he added.

After the address was published in David C. Claypoole’s American Daily Advertiser and then republished in countless newspapers and pamphlets, it appeared to be well received by the public.

However, it set off a frantic race to replace Washington that featured John Adams and Thomas Jefferson that helped to permanently create the political party system that Washington despised.

In later years, the Farewell Address letter gained new importance. In 1825, both Jefferson and Madison recommended the Farewell Address to the University of Virginia, as one of the best guides possible to the ideals of American government. During the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln recommended its public reading as a reminder.

And every year, a member of the U.S. Senate is asked to read the Farewell Address in public.

His Latest Book Is', 'Code Red', 'How Progressives', 'Moderates Can Unite To Save Our Country.']",E.J. Dionne Jr.: Religion challenges left and right,"Whenever I write sympathetically about religion, I get bombarded by tweets and notes from readers who normally agree with me but cannot abide by the idea that religious belief should be seen as intellectually serious.

And because I have written favorably about Pope Francis, I get more than my share of angry comments about the Catholic pedophilia scandal, which continues to haunt the church and troubles even its most loyal members.

Getting lambasted doesn’t bother me. On the contrary, citizens talking back to the purveyors of opinion is a glorious aspect of free speech. But my correspondents underscore the existence of a strong anti-religious current within a segment of the liberal community that is both an important political fact and a potential problem for progressives.

Here’s the challenge: Americans who are left-of-center are far more religiously diverse than their opponents on the conservative side. When it comes to matters of faith, liberals and Democrats have a far more complicated task of coalition management — although religion also raises some serious difficulties for the right.

Consider the findings of a survey (in which I was involved) released last month by the Public Religion Research Institute and the Brookings Institution. Using the answers to a wide variety of questions, we created a scale that broke our respondents into four groups: Religious conservatives, moderates, progressives and the nonreligious.

Overall, we found that 28 percent of Americans could be classified as religious conservatives, 38 percent as religious moderates and 19 percent as religious progressives. An additional 15 percent were nonreligious.

Among supporters of the two parties, Republicans were far more cohesive. The analysis found that 56 percent of Republicans were religious conservatives and 33 percent were religious moderates. Only 5 percent were religious progressives and just 6 percent were nonreligious.

Democrats, by contrast, were all over our analytical map: 28 percent were religious progressives, 13 percent were religious conservatives, 42 percent were religious moderates and 17 percent were nonreligious.

Among self-identified political liberals, the proportion of nonreligious — essentially, the folks sending me those messages — was even larger: 31 percent of liberals were nonreligious, 33 percent were religious progressives, 30 percent were religious moderates and 6 percent were religious conservatives.

Two things are thus true simultaneously: Nonreligious Americans are a very important part of the liberal constituency, yet the majority of liberals have ties to religion. The survey found that African Americans, who are deeply loyal to most liberal causes (and to the Democratic Party), are among the most religious people in the country. For liberalism to thrive, there needs to be acceptance and, even better, some respect across the boundaries of belief and nonbelief.

Yet if liberals face obstacles when it comes to faith, conservatives have problems of their own. The most serious? The religious conservatism that is such an important component of the right and the Republican Party is deeply unattractive to the rising generation of voters. In addition, many, across age groups, who are quite conservative in their theological views are rather progressive when it comes to economics, especially on issues such as raising the minimum wage.

The generation gap on religious commitment is stark. In the Silent Generation (Americans 68 and older), 47 percent are religious conservatives, while only 12 percent are religious progressives and 10 percent are nonbelievers. These figures are reversed for Millennials (Americans 33 and under), only 17 percent of whom are religious conservatives, while 23 percent are religious progressives and nearly as many, 22 percent, are nonreligious. (The remainder in both groups were moderates.)

These trends should disturb conservatives looking to the future, but they should also give pause to religious leaders. The association of religion, and particularly Christianity, with conservatism appears to be turning off substantial numbers of young Americans from faith.

On the other hand, a concern for social justice not only unites large numbers of believers across conservative-progressive lines but also appeals deeply to the more skeptical young. This is one reason Pope Francis’s eloquent emphasis on lifting up the poor, so visible during his recent trip to Brazil, could make him a transformational leader.

Conservatives need to pay attention to the power of justice and compassion. Otherwise, they will find their cause undercut, even within their religious base, by a refusal to grapple with the economic system’s unfairness. As for progressives, they would be foolish to push away religious allies who are instructed by scripture of the Almighty’s ambition to “loose the bonds of injustice” and “let the oppressed go free.”

The Board', 'Which Operates Separately The Newsroom', 'Proceeds On The Presumption That Serious']",The power of jury duty,"Assembly Democrats may have hit on an ingenious way to make citizens take their jury summonses more seriously: Last week they passed a bill that would allow noncitizens to serve on juries. Suddenly, outraged commentators and bloggers who feared the loss of a key measure of citizenship were referring to “jury service” instead of “jury duty.” Although the news was generally reported accurately, some went overboard; at foxnews.com, for example, the headline said: “California bill would let illegal immigrants serve on juries.”

No it wouldn’t. This isn’t a story about yet one more unsavory job that must be done by undocumented immigrants because U.S. citizens won’t do it. AB 1401 by Democrat Bob Wieckowski of Fremont would not extend any new powers or duties to anyone without the legal right to be present in the country. It would, however, allow courts to call lawful permanent residents who are not citizens to serve on juries. After all, you don’t have to be a citizen to be a lawyer or a judge in Superior Court; why, lawmakers asked, should you have to be a citizen to serve on a jury?

It’s an important question — and there is an answer.

Jury service is not burdensome drudge work imposed by an overbearing government on an unwilling citizenry. Nor is it a favor that citizens do for their courts. To the contrary, it is a citizen’s chief means of oversight on the judicial branch, allowing him or her not merely to help rule on the facts of a particular case but to keep tabs on the judge, the prosecutors, the public defenders and the court system itself. It’s the place where citizens observe firsthand the effect of court budget cuts.

Just as citizens, and only citizens, have the power to elect their executive branch leaders and their delegates to the legislative branch, citizen jurors have the final check on at least some judicial branch decisions. Yes, we can vote judges out of office, but especially with a court system the size of the Los Angeles County Superior Court, it is difficult at best to know who they are and how they work. Jury duty, or rather jury service — or even better, jury power — is a reminder that the government works for us, and not the other way around.

That check on government is a right and a duty properly exercised by the sovereign, and in a democracy that means the citizens. Plenty of noncitizens make up our society, but citizenship is the norm, as it should be. And if we find that an overwhelming number of residents, workers and taxpayers are not citizens, it should not be seen as a signal to redistribute the powers of citizenship, but rather to step up the speed at which those who want to be fully incorporated into society are naturalized. AB 1401 is an interesting idea, but in the end it would move California in the wrong direction."
http://news.yahoo.com/colo-governor-delays-convicted-killers-execution-211104345.html,,[],Colo. governor delays convicted killer's execution,"DENVER (AP) — Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper indefinitely delayed the execution of convicted killer Nathan Dunlap on Wednesday and said he was unlikely to allow it as long as he is governor.

Hickenlooper stopped short of converting the death sentence to life in prison, as Dunlap's lawyers had requested.

Hickenlooper, a Democrat, said he had doubts about the fairness of Colorado's death penalty system and about the state's ability to get the lethal drugs required for an execution.

Republicans derided his decision as no decision at all, with Attorney General John Suthers saying the reprieve guaranteed ""continued suffering and delayed justice"" for families of Dunlap's victims.

""He took a coward's way out,"" said Melinda Cromar, whose 19-year-old sister Sylvia Crowell was among those killed by Dunlap. ""I am just so angry.""

Dunlap, 38, was convicted and sentenced to die in 1996 for the ambush slayings of Crowell and three others in a Denver-area restaurant. Hickenlooper's action essentially guarantees Dunlap will survive through Jan. 13, 2015, the last day of Hickenlooper's first term. Hickenlooper plans to run for re-election, and the reprieve is sure to be a campaign issue.

Dunlap, whose execution was scheduled for the week of Aug. 18, had requested clemency, which would have removed the possibility of execution and changed his sentence to life without parole.

Dunlap could conceivably be executed one day if a Colorado governor lifts the reprieve.

Hickenlooper's announcement frustrated and angered the current top prosecutor in the district where Dunlap was convicted.

""He could have made a decision I disagreed with. He could have made a decision I agreed with. But to not make a decision is an injustice,"" District Attorney George Brauchler said.

""One person will go to bed with a smile on his face, and that's Nathan Dunlap, and that's due to one person,"" Brauchler said.

Madeline Cohen, one of Dunlap's attorneys, expressed relief.

""I'm very, very glad that the governor has decided not to go forward and has recognized how many problems there are in the system,"" she said.

Story continues

Hickenlooper said he considered the decision carefully.

""We heard a variety of sides and obviously this has weighed heavily on me for well over a year now,"" he said at a news conference.

Dunlap has acknowledged fatally shooting four employees — three of them teenagers — who were cleaning a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant after hours in the Denver suburb of Aurora.

Dunlap, then 19, had recently lost a job there as a cook. On the night of Dec. 14, 1993, he hid in a bathroom until the restaurant closed, then shot and killed Crowell; Ben Grant, 17; Colleen O'Connor, 17; and Margaret Kohlberg, a 50-year-old mother who was on her first day on the job.

Each was shot in the head. A co-worker Bobby Stephens, then 20, was also shot in the head, but he survived and testified against Dunlap.

One victim was down on her knees and begging for her life when Dunlap shot her.

Dunlap lost his last mandatory appeal in February. His lawyers petitioned Hickenlooper for clemency and filed other lawsuits challenging the sentence and execution process.

In his reprieve, Hickenlooper said Colorado's capital punishment system is flawed, citing a study that showed the death penalty was sought and imposed inconsistently across the state.

He also said the state doesn't have the drugs in place to carry out an execution by lethal injection, and that many states and nations are repealing the death penalty.

Hickenlooper's reprieve order mostly referred to Dunlap by his state prison number.

""I don't use his name. I haven't with any of these mass killings because I don't think he needs any more notoriety,"" Hickenlooper said at the news conference.

Dunlap's attorneys previously released a video and written statement in which Dunlap apologized.

They also said he had undiagnosed bipolar disorder at the time of the shootings.

""Mr. Dunlap was grateful,"" his attorney Philip Cherner said after Hickenlooper's announcement. ""His expressions of remorse were genuine. He is truly sad for what happened.""

""This is not a day to celebrate,"" Cherner said.

""Mr. Dunlap faces the rest of his life in a cell that's about the size of two king-sized beds, and he gets out for about an hour a day.""

A source with direct knowledge of these matters told Breitbart News that Boehner has decided to abide by the Hastert Rule in regards to immigration reform. “No immigration bill will be brought to the floor for a vote without a majority of the Republican conference in support,” the source told Breitbart News on Monday.

Around Washington, conservatives have worried that Boehner may back down from conservative principles on immigration and support the Gang of Eight bill. They fear he may rush the bill to the floor if the Senate passes it and try to move it through the House with a majority of Democratic votes.

Even though those rumors continue to fly, signs now indicate that Boehner will not break the Hastert Rule and will only bring a bill to the floor with the support of the majority of Republicans.

Reports from Ryan Lizza at The New Yorker and David Drucker at the Washington Examiner appear to support the idea that Boehner will not break with Republicans. It did take Rep. Steve King (R-IA) banding together more than 50 of his colleagues to call for a special GOP conference meeting on the topic, at which they expressed their dissatisfaction with the Senate bill and their hope that Boehner will stick to the Hastert Rule.

In addition to King’s efforts, conservative groups have circulated letters around Washington calling on the conference to formally codify the Hastert Rule into the House GOP conference rules so that it must be followed, instead of just being a guideline."

Republicans will face strong support%2C and opposition%2C to immigration bill when they return home

Supporters will use marches%2C rallies and political donations to persuade GOP to embrace citizenship

Critics feel they only have to maintain GOP opposition to %22amnesty%22 for undocumented immigrants

WASHINGTON — As they prepare to leave the Capitol for a month-long August recess, Republican members of the House of Representatives are taking with them legislative summaries and informational packets to tackle tough questions in their districts about immigration.

Supporters of a proposal to revamp the nation's immigration laws plan to use the recess to pressure House Republican members in their districts to pass a plan like that which passed the Senate in June.

Those in favor of granting citizenship to an estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants say they will use rallies, marches, coordinated phone calls, social media campaigns and pressure from big-dollar donors.

""This is the beginning of a long, hot summer for the House of Representatives,"" said Eliseo Medina of the Service Employees International Union, a labor union that supports the Senate's immigration bill.

Republicans will also face pressure from Tea Party groups and other opponents of the Senate immigration bill.

Roy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, says his group, which advocates lower levels of legal and illegal immigration, hosted a teleconference with Reps. Steve King, R-Iowa, Steve Stockman, R-Texas, and Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., on Wednesday night to rally opponents to mobilize for the August recess.

Beck said there were 40,000 people on the call.

""Obviously, they've got all of this money and all of these organizations and everything else, but we've got over 2 million members. We're in every district,"" Beck said. ""And they've got a tough road to hoe. They've got to change representatives' minds. We're more in a situation of needing to hold people. It's always better to try to hold people to a position.""

GOP leaders said Republicans are looking forward to facing voters on the issue.

""Our members will be well-prepared to talk with constituents about this important issue,"" said Nate Hodson, a spokesman for Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., chairwoman of the House Republican Conference.

House committees have passed five immigration-related bills that focus on enhancing border security, providing visas for high-tech and agricultural workers and enhancing the ability of state and local law enforcement to enforce immigration laws.

The Senate bill allows the nation's unauthorized immigrants to apply for U.S. citizenship, adds $46 billion to secure the border and revamps nearly every other portion of the nation's immigration laws.

Supporters of an overhaul of immigration laws say House Republicans are focusing too much on border security and not on a pathway to citizenship for the nation's undocumented immigrants, which is a focus of the Senate plan.

On Monday, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to give a pro-immigration speech at the premier of the film Documented, which was directed by Jose Antonio Vargas, an immigration activist. A group of religious leaders will take a bus tour through Republican districts in the Midwest.

Clarissa Martinez of the National Council of La Raza, which supports legalization of all unauthorized immigrants, said a coalition of groups will host 360 different events in 52 congressional districts around the country during the recess.

Meanwhile, some Republican donors and business groups will try to influence GOP members as well.

Republicans for Immigration Reform, a group formed by former GOP Commerce secretary Carlos Gutierrez, sent a letter with other GOP donors this week to members of the House urging passage of a bill. Charlie Spies, a former fundraiser for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, said that was an attempt to add to the ""grass-roots"" approach by swaying members with their ""grasstops"" approach.

""We're going to focus on engagement with constituents and business leaders who have actual relationships with members,"" Spies said. ""You won't see us busing people in to town halls.""

Republicans such as King say the border must be secured first before people in the USA illegally are offered citizenship. And some Tea Party affiliates plan to make sure representatives hear from the opponents to what they say is an ""amnesty"" for people who broke the law to be here.

""It's not a battle that we picked,"" said Tea Party Patriots co-founder Jenny Beth Martin, referring to her group's typical focus on government spending.

""It isn't an issue that was even on the front burner for us. But because of what the Senate has done and the House is now doing, it's something that we have to pay attention to.""

Martin said her group is working closely with NumbersUSA and others to hold rallies, attend town-hall-style forums and ensure that Republican members of Congress know the opposition they'll face if they support any kind of immigration reform they don't approve of.

""We've said all along that we're going to hold people accountable,"" Martin said. ""We're holding them accountable."""

Inside the beltway, the fingers point and the media tuts and struts in glee, and we, the American public, respond by becoming more rigid and divided ourselves. No more “truth springing from argument amongst friends,” as David Hume said. A recent nonpartisan Pew Research Poll finds our knee-jerk partisanship has increased dramatically.

This road we’re on will lead us step-by-step to an extreme: either an autocratic government that functions, or a dysfunctional anarchy. The petty squabbles, bilge in the name of party or principle, will dissolve our self-government.

Abraham Lincoln felt no foreign power could ever defeat the United States. He said, “From whence shall we expect the approach of danger? Shall some trans-Atlantic military giant step the earth and crush us at a blow? Never…No, if destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of free men we will live forever or die by suicide.”

We’re pointing a pistol at our heads. A government of, by, and for the people requires that people talk to people, that we can agree to disagree but do so in civility. If we let the politicians and those who report dictate our discourse, then our course will be dictated.

Why am I alarmed? Because two “scandals” – the IRS tax-exempt inquiries and the Department of Justice’s tapping of reporters’ phones – have become lynch parties. And the congressional investigation of Benghazi may become a scandal in itself.

The IRS scandal has sparked bipartisan outrage that should require a bipartisan solution. The director who oversaw this was a Bush appointee who was confirmed by a Democratic Congress. Even Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein says he doubts very much that Obama was involved

We, the people, need to stay focused on facts, causes and solutions. Let’s begin with the findings of the Treasury’s inspector general who uncovered it: That it was bureaucratic mismanagement, but that there was no evidence of any political motivation or influence from outside the IRS.

And that, according to acting Commissioner Steven Miller, who just resigned, the problem started because the Supreme Court’s Citizens’ United decision created a surge of requests by political groups for tax-exempt status.

Democrats and Republicans agree there’s a problem. Maybe they should focus on solutions.

Let’s demand an end to partisan sideshows or media witch hunts: It turns out that the leaked White House Benghazi e-mails which allegedly show a coverup of a terrorist attack were themselves altered. Those e-mails are, in a word, bogus

Next up on the playbill: The Department of Justice secretly obtained dozens of reporters’ phone records because of a serious security leak. The double contradictory shell game we’re supposed to believe: Obama is not in charge and he has his finger in every pot.

This bamboozling of the American people obscures the main point: How do we safeguard American lives and respect our freedoms at the same time? Maybe working together – Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals – the Media Shield Law, a solution to the problem, can be passed.

Both the Democrats and Republicans have run roughshod over our separation of powers. Both parties have misused and abused their constitutional powers. Democrats blocked, again and again, President Bush’s nominees for federal judges. Today, Republicans aren’t just blocking Obama’s judicial nominees, they’re blocking the Senate from considering laws and blocking Cabinet appointees necessary for the federal government to run.

Why should we allow any political party or personality to render our government unable to govern?

On 9/11 terrorists attacked the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and tried to attack the U.S. Capitol building in order to destroy our institutions, our economic strength, our military and our democratic Congress where “the people rule.”

But in our partisan self-righteousness, we’re destroying our foundations of government more effectively than al Qaeda ever could. Whether it’s the media or the politicians, the churning of partisan passion into anger, indeed hate, has an ulterior purpose: If Obama’s administration is constantly engaged in fighting for its existence, the governing comes to a halt, and his agenda will go nowhere.

Aiming for that and little if nothing else weakens and harms our democratic institutions, both Congress and the presidency. Remember, Obama was elected by a bigger margin than George W. Bush. He deserves to have his appointees, and he deserves to have votes on the issues, to have the government function, and to fight for the policies on which he was elected. By allowing problems to become scandals and scandals to become demagoguery, we’re shooting ourselves in the foot.

If it keeps up, we will all be complicit in weakening our democracy.

Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, appearing today alongside Chicago Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez, said the terrorism events at the Boston Marathon last week have not and should not deter work on immigration reform.



After an appearance at the City Club of Chicago, both men told reporters that despite the fatal bombing and subsequent efforts to capture the suspects, work continued in Washington throughout the week on drafting a proposal.



""If anything, this is an argument for modernizing our immigration laws. We need it for national security reasons. We need it for the economy,"" said Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee.



""It's premature to make any kind of a judgment as to the outcome of this. We just don't know all of the facts. So the last thing we ought to do is make some kind of knee-jerk assessment as to how this affects some other bill in Congress,"" Ryan said.



Gutierrez said the federal government spends $18 billion a year on immigration enforcement — more than is spent on the FBI or on other enforcement agencies.



The Democrat contended a comprehensive immigration reform plan, including employer verification and reviewing the status of those whose temporary visas or work permits run out, would allow the money to ""got after the truly bad guys.""



While the House version of immigration reform has yet to be drafted, Ryan said the fact that Republicans and Democrats are working together on legislation could, for a public distrustful of Congress, provide ""an opportunity to prove that divided government can work.""



""I really believe that we have an opportunity to have a real long-term solution and I'm not talking some quick fix,"" Ryan told an audience of about 300 people. ""I'm talking an enduring system that works, that honors the rule of law, that honors the faith of the immigration system.""



Ryan also said there was a value argument to be made for immigration reform.



""We do not want to have a society where we have different classes of people who cannot reach their American dream by not being a full citizen,"" he said. ""That is a very important part of immigration reform.""

He sang carols, opened presents with his family, and visited a nearby military base to wish the troops “Mele Kalikimaka” — the Hawaiian phrase meaning “Merry Christmas.”

But the one thing the president and his family did not do — something they have rarely done since he entered the White House — was attend Christmas church services.

“He has not gone to church hardly at all, as president,” said Gary Scott Smith, the author of “Faith and the Presidency: From George Washington to George W. Bush,” adding that it is “very unusual for a president not to attend” Christmas services.

Historically, watching the nation’s first family head to church dressed in their Sunday best, especially around the holiday season, was something of a ritual. Yet Mr. Obama’s faith is a more complicated, more private, and perhaps — religious and presidential historians say — a more inclusive affair."

The deal would create the world’s largest airline, reduce competition and undoubtedly lead to higher fares and fewer flights. The two airlines have more than 1,000 overlapping domestic routes and together control a large majority of the traffic at important airports like Dallas-Fort Worth International and Ronald Reagan National near Washington. The Justice Department estimates that consumers would pay hundreds of millions of dollars more in fares and fees if the airlines were allowed to merge.

The airlines have argued that the deal would allow them to compete more effectively against United and Delta, which have come to dominate the industry after merging with other airlines in recent years. But American and US Airways have it backward. Those earlier mergers are precisely the reason this consolidation is a problem. Fares and fees have increased across the industry and especially on routes where mergers reduced competition in the last five years. Since 2008, Delta merged with Northwest, United combined with Continental and Southwest took over AirTran. Allowing another merger would concentrate power in four big carriers, down from five.

Mergers have also increased the dominance of the big carriers in their hub airports. Not surprisingly, the attorneys general of Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and the District of Columbia — most of which have airports with a large number of American or US Airways flights — have joined in the Justice Department lawsuit, knowing the merger would hurt consumers in their states. At Reagan National, for instance, the combined airline would control 69 percent of all takeoff and landing slots."

A new book says President Obama's staff features ""a cadre of idolizers,"" but he is also trying to reach beyond the confines of what he calls the White House ""bubble.""

""Barack Obama has said that the hardest thing about being president is staying in touch with 'the flow of everyday life,'"" says author Kenneth T. Walsh. ""And he has admitted that one of the biggest mistakes he made during his first term was confining himself to the White House too much.""

Walsh, the veteran White House correspondent for U.S. News & World Report, has a new book out Wednesday, Prisoners of the White House: The Isolation of America's Presidents and the Crisis of Leadership.

Walsh discusses the attempts by different presidents to break from the White House, which President Harry Truman described as ""the great white jail"" and President Bill Clinton called ""the crown jewel of the federal penitentiary system.""

Like some of predecessors, Obama's efforts are hampered by a like-minded staff.

""Obama has a cadre of idolizers around him, people such as Chicago friend and confidante Valerie Jarrett, and devoted adviser Denis McDonough, who is now White House chief of staff,"" Walsh says in a note about his book.

Walsh adds that ""this is nothing unusual, since every president tends to reward loyalty and wants to surround himself with admirers even if this risks creating a closed-off inner circle."" This could just as easily describe the staffs of presidents John F. Kennedy, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.

Walsh also says that ""more than most recent presidents, Obama has made a sustained personal effort to break out of the bubble -- a term he uses to describe his life in the White House.""

Writes Walsh:

""He actively browses on his BlackBerry, and takes messages from friends around the country. He pays attention to the polls. He travels outside Washington, reads 10 letters from constituents every weekday, keeps track of what the news media are saying about him, and brings outsiders into the White House to give him ideas.""

Sports provides another respite, Walsh says of Obama:

""He follows sports, which gives him a break from the tedium and keeps him from obsessing about politics, his advisers say. He watches ESPN and frequently will relax by enjoying games on live TV, especially basketball and football.

""But staying in touch requires constant effort, and it's unclear whether Obama will, or can, keep up his current efforts amid all the time constraints, security limitations and pressures of office."""
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/06/04/Rick-Scott-vetoes-bill-that-would-have-given-illegal-immigrants-driver-s-licenses,2013-06-04 00:00:00,['Matthew Boyle'],Rick Scott Vetoes Bill to Give Illegal Immigrants Driver's Licenses,"Gov. Rick Scott (R-FL) on Tuesday vetoed a bill that would have required Florida hand out driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants, a sign he is taking a stand against the left in favor of conservatism.

“Florida is home to immigrants of many nationalities, who add to the cultural fabric of our great state, and whose productivity and hard work have contributed to our economic turnaround,” Scott said in his official letter to Florida Secretary of State Kenneth Detzner announcing the veto. “Still, our nation struggles with immigration issues every day, as Americans seek to reconcile the fact that at one point our families were immigrants who came, as many do today, to work and live the American dream with the fact that the federal government has failed at enforcing the nation’s laws on this topic.”

Scott went on to detail the inconsistencies of immigration policy coming out of Janet Napolitano’s Department of Homeland Security and President Barack Obama’s administration at large.

“Despite the federal government’s inability to enforce the nation’s current immigration laws or to find common ground on how to change them, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced in a June 2012 memo the immediate establishment of a ‘Deferred Action Process for Childhood Arrivals,'” Scott wrote. “Through this process DHS provides that a young person illegally brought to the United States as a child will not be subject to removal if the individual meets certain criteria.”

“Qualifying for deferred action status does not confer substantive rights or lawful status upon an individual; it does not create a pathway to a green card or citizenship; nor does it extend to any family members of the person granted the status either,” he explained. “Deferred action status is simply a policy of the Obama Administration, absent Congressional direction, designed to dictate removal action decisions using DHS agency discretion. It was never passed by Congress, nor is it a promulgated rule.”

The institutional left and Florida Democrats are furious that Scott would make such a move. Democrat state Sen. Darren Soto called Scott’s veto an “anti-Hispanic bomb.”

“Make no mistake about it: This will be an anti-Hispanic bomb if he vetoes this bill,” Soto, a sponsor of the legislation, said before Scott officially vetoed the bill according to the National Journal. “The vast majority of my peers understand we need to encourage immigrants to become working members of our society. It makes no sense that the Scott administration would veto something it’s already doing.”

The Florida House Democrat who also sponsored the bill, Rep. Randolph Bracy, tried to argue Scott’s veto foils plans to move the national Republican party as a whole toward amnesty. “I thought the party was moving in that direction and was behind this bill, and then the governor just comes out of nowhere and does this,” Bracy said according to National Journal. “Republicans have been talking as a party about Hispanic outreach, and this was only a small step.”"
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/25/Boomtown-Special-Assails-D-C-Permanent-Political-Class-for-Extracting-Wealth-from-Taxpayers,2013-01-25 00:00:00,['Tony Lee'],'Boomtown' Special Assails D.C. for 'Extracting' Wealth from Taxpayers,"In a blockbuster one-hour investigative special that aired on Fox News’ “Hannity” on Friday, Peter Schweizer, Steve Bannon, and Sean Hannity exposed how Washington, D.C. has extracted power and money from the United States into a centralized location to become the country’s greatest “boomtown,” despite not creating anything.

Schweizer, the president of the nonpartisan Government Accountability Institute, highlighted how the permanent political class that relies on lobbying and influence peddling makes more money by “growing the size of government,” which leaves no incentive on either side of the aisle to limit government.

As a result, he noted the three richest counties and seven of the top ten wealthiest counties in the nation are in the Washington, D.C. region. The District also consumes the most fine wine in the nation. He asserted the business in Washington is now “not politics” but “money.”

Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News, said the best and the brightest now come to Washington because they see Washington as a Tammany Hall that will allow them to get rich off of influence peddling. He noted that Washington D.C. runs the equivalent of a $4 trillion private equity fund every year and essentially doles out 25% of the country’s wealth to those who are connected.

“Nobody has ever turned a camera on them,” Bannon said, indicating he intends to change that in the future. “This is a permanent political class that has now formed an aristocracy. That’s why nothing has changed in Washington.”

Bannon explained people arrive in Washington as country lawyers and then decide to “turn the business of government into a family business” by having their wives and kids work in lobbying.

“And this is how they become a permanent political class,” he concluded.

Hannity mentioned that Washington politicians “kick money back to family, friends, or people that hire them when they retire.”

And Schweizer concurred. He claimed the permanent political class is bipartisan and those who are a part of this permanent aristocracy either marry or are born into it.

Schweizer noted former Mississippi Senator Trent Lott, a Republican, and former Louisiana Senator John Breaux, a Democrat, partnering up to lobby after they left Congress. He cited Republican Rep. Bill Young of Florida whose daughter-in-law does defense lobbying while he sits on one of the most powerful subcommittees dealing with defense issues.

Schweizer also pointed out that Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) has two sons who have also lobbied for projects in which their father was involved.

According to Schweizer, this type of bipartisan nepotism that would not be tolerated in corporations is why “political debates are like professional wrestling, it’s not always what it appears to be.”

“It’s a massive cultural problem in Washington, D.C.,” he lamented, adding that the problem is going to get worse.

Bannon said if one follows the money, it is clear there is no incentive for the permanent political class to cut spending. And because there is not an incentive to cut spending, Bannon said, Americans are stuck with a party of “big government” and a junior partner that is the party of “little big government.” Unfortunately, Bannon said the country lacks a party that is truly focused on limited government.

“There is no pressure on them to cut. Washington controls the money. They have an industrial logic to the business model,” he explained. “The permanent political class of both political parties are benefiting from it.”

Hannity promised more segments in the future with Bannon and Schweizer as they make Americans more aware of the rampant crony capitalism Washington’s permanent political class tries its best hide."

Gary Bauer, while running for president in 2000.

A few weeks ago I put together this handy chart of the various components of the GOP coalition. While we already know that the various factions have their own pet issues and causes, the current GOP civil war is exposing the actual distaste the various groups have for each other.

Jed already hit the Christian Right's whining of Republicans abandoning them on marriage equality. But I want to refocus on Gary Bauer's comments, because they go beyond simple grousing over a wayward coalition partner:



""If we gave our voters an accurate portrayal of our ideas, that we want to cut the rate of growth on Social Security, give tax cuts to billionaires and then the values issues, the values issues would be more popular than the economic agenda of the current Republican Party,” said [social conservative leader Gary] Bauer...

give tax cuts to billionaires

Ignore the fact that there's nothing popular about the GOP's ""values."" Just note how he portrays his party's economic agenda:That's how we liberals frame the Mitt Romney wing of the GOP. Economic conservatives might pretend that there's more to them than tax cuts for billionaires, but even their own partners disagree. And Bauer can't even be bothered to pretend otherwise anymore.

That's not a characterization that suggests mutual respect and agreement, but one of barely disguised disgust. Theirs is a marriage of convenience—the Gordon Geckos don't care for the Bible Thumbers, the Bible Thumpers don't care for the Gordon Geckos. And now that their collective suck isn't leading to White House victories, the knives are out.

Funny thing is, both those sides are equally to blame for the GOP's woes. Mitt Romney conservatism (aka ""tax cuts for billionaires"") is as unpopular as Rick Santorum conservatism (aka ""hate the gays""). They need each other to amount to something, but that's no longer a nationally viable party.

His Latest Book Is', 'Code Red', 'How Progressives', 'Moderates Can Unite To Save Our Country.']",E.J. Dionne: Boehner’s House implodes over flawed farm bill,"The roof fell in on John Boehner’s House of Representatives last week. The Republican leadership’s humiliating defeat on a deeply flawed and inhumane farm bill was as clear a lesson as we’ll get about the real causes of dysfunction in the nation’s capital.

Our ability to govern ourselves is being brought low by a witches’ brew of right-wing ideology, a shockingly cruel attitude toward the poor on the part of the Republican majority, and the speaker’s incoherence when it comes to his need for Democratic votes to pass bills.

Boehner is unwilling to put together broad bipartisan coalitions to pass middle-ground legislation except when he is pressed to the wall. Yet he and his lieutenants tried to blame last Thursday’s farm legislation fiasco — the product of a massive repudiation by GOP conservatives of their high command — on the Democrats’ failure to hand over enough votes.

He seemed to think he could freely pander to the desire of right-wing members of his caucus to throw millions of low-income Americans off the food stamp program . When that didn’t produce enough votes, he then expected Democrats to support a measure that most of them rightly regarded as immoral. In the end, the bill went down 234to 195, with 62 Republicans voting no and 24 Democrats voting yes — more help, by the way, than Nancy Pelosi usually got from Republicans when she was speaker.

Boehner can’t have it both ways, and he should be called out if he lets his party’s disarray throw the nation into an entirely unnecessary debt-ceiling crisis this fall. The country shouldn’t be held hostage because of Republican chaos.

Start with the food stamp cuts, and let’s remember that this program is a monument to bipartisanship. The current form of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is, in large part, the product of an unlikely alliance between former Sens. Bob Dole and George McGovern in the 1970s. They were far apart ideologically, but both were horrified that too many Americans were going without nourishment. Food stamps have been an enormous success in curbing hunger in our rich nation, while also serving as a powerful stimulus to economic recovery during hard times.

The bill the House voted down would have cut food stamps by $20.5 billion, eliminating food assistance to nearly 2 million low-income people, most of them senior citizens or working families with children.

This alone should have been bad enough to sink the bill. But then Republicans pushed through an amendment by Rep. Steve Southerland (R-Fla.) to toughen work requirements in the program. Work requirements sound reasonable until you look at what Southerland’s amendment was actually designed to do.

As Robert Greenstein, the president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, explained, Southerland’s proposal violated “the most basic standards of human decency” because it made no effort, as other work requirements have in the past, to create employment openings for those who “want to work and would accept any job or work slot they could get, but cannot find jobs in a weak economy.”

In fact, noted Greenstein, a longtime advocate of nutrition assistance, the amendment barred states “from spending more on SNAP employment and training than they do now.” And it created incentives for states to throw people off food stamps by letting their governments keep half the SNAP savings to use for anything they wished (including, for example, tax cuts for the wealthy).

In a more rational political world, progressives and small-government conservatives might join forces to slash subsidies for agribusiness and wealthy farmers while containing market distortions bred by price supports. But when Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) proposed an amendment to restore some of the food stamp funding by reducing spending on crop insurance, it was defeated.

And Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) exposed hypocrisy on the matter of government handouts by excoriating Republican House members who had benefited from farm subsidies but voted to cut food stamps.

The collapse of the farm bill will generally be played as a political story about Boehner’s failure to rally his own right wing. That’s true as far as it goes and should remind everyone of the current House leadership’s inability to govern. But this is above all a story about morality: There is something profoundly wrong when a legislative majority is so eager to risk leaving so many Americans hungry. That’s what the bill would have done, and why defeating it was a moral imperative.

So John Boehner's not conservative enough for the Tea Party. Paul Ryan's apparently not conservative enough for you. Who is?



JAKE TAPPER (12/10/2013): Perhaps another warning shot for the Republican establishment. Texas Congressman Steve Stockman, a Tea Party favorite, just threw his hat into the ring for next year's Senate race in a primary challenge against fellow Texan and incumbent, Senator John Cornyn.

Chuck Hagel as the country’s next defense secretary by saying he is “superbly qualified” but criticized his Republican Party, which has largely being critical of Hagel.

“Most of the national security community that I know -- many secretaries of defense, ambassadors -- think Hagel is a solid guy,” Powell said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “He speaks his mind, is a good supporter of Israel, but he's not reluctant to disagree when appropriate … He’ll do a great job.”

Hagel was under fire on several fronts even before he was officially nominated Monday by President Obama, in part for once saying “the Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people” on Capitol Hill.

Powell, a four-star general who served in the George W. Bush administration, said the former Nebraska senator should instead have said the “Israeli lobby.”

He called Hagel “a very, very strong supporter of the state of Israel,” but said that doesn’t mean one must agree with “every single position that the Israeli government takes.”

Still, Republicans continued Sunday to express concern about Hagel, who must face Senate hearings and confirmation to get the Cabinet post.

New Hampshire Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte told “Fox News Sunday” that she is “very troubled” about Hagel’s foreign policy views but remains undecided.

Other concerns about Hagel include whether he would support a military strike against Iran if the country continues to pursue making a nuclear weapon, and his views on gays, following a comment he made in the 1990s for which he has apologized.

In addition, South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told Fox's ""Weekend Live ANHQ"" on Sunday that Hagel was ""the most antagonistic senator"" of his time.

And Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker said he thinks the bigger issue of Hagel's ""overall temperament"" will come up during the confirmation hearings.

The Republican senator told ABC's ""This Week"" the real issue is whether Hagel is ""suited"" to run a big government department such as the Pentagon. He also said he thinks there are a ""number of staffers who are coming forth now just talking about the way (Hagel) has dealt with them.""

Powell, who voted twice for Obama, said he is still a Republican, but said the party “has an identity crisis” and some factions have a “dark vein of intolerance.”

“They still look down on minorities,” he said.

Powell also said the party’s more recent shift to the right has resulted in “losing campaigns” and “will be in trouble” if it doesn’t change along with the country’s shifting demographics to appeal more to minorities and immigrants.

“You can’t keep saying no immigration policy … it makes it hard for minorities to vote,” he said."

Now, five Christmases later, the presidential daughters are both nearly as tall as their very tall mother, each developing her own style and leading an increasingly independent life. Although they have watched a basketball game, gone for a hike and hit the beach with their dad, he has spent most afternoons here on the golf course with his buddies while the girls have gone about their business without him.

The Obamas’ annual holiday vacation, at a lush and secluded surf-side retreat in Kailua, has underscored just how much their family dynamic has evolved in the five years since they moved into the White House.

As his girls grow into young women, the president has been increasingly nostalgic in public, lamenting how quickly time has slipped by.

“Those of us who have kids know how fast it goes, because Malia and Sasha, they’re like weeds,” Obama said at a November fundraiser. A couple of weeks later, he admitted he was getting “teary” about it.

“They’re just growing up so fast, and they’ve got a busy life of their own,” Obama told People magazine. “You can project out over the next several years how, between school, sports, social life, their community service, they’re not around as much. So that gets me teary sometimes.”

When the Obamas bounded off Air Force One this month to start their vacation, they were greeted by Hawaii Gov. Neil Aber­crombie (D), an old family friend. In an interview a few days later, Abercrombie was asked what he thought of the Obama girls’ growing older. “The word ‘irony’ comes to mind,” he said.

“Their growing up is so different from his growing up,” Abercrombie said of Obama. “His dad wasn’t there. His mom had real challenges. Then being taken to another country. Then growing up here in the islands with an entirely different context and atmosphere, socially and economically, from where those young girls are growing up in the White House.”

Abercrombie added: “I wonder sometimes if they say to him, ‘You don’t understand,’ like a lot of kids.”

Obama said he lives with “three opinionated, strong, tall women” (make that four, if you count Marian Robinson, his mother-in-law, who lives on the third floor of the White House). But Obama said he is “getting kind of lonely in this big house,” telling reporters at a news conference this year, “Now that my girls are getting older, they don’t want to spend that much time with me.” This summer, he said he got a new puppy, Sunny, to fill the void left by his increasingly busy daughters.

Malia, 15, is a high school sophomore and tennis player whom her father describes as lawyerly. She has shed her braces and is allowed to date, although the president joked to comedian Steve Harvey that he’s “got men with guns following them around all the time” to scare off any sketchy boyfriends.

Sasha, 12, is a seventh-grader and basketball player who has been called a “budding style icon” by fashion bloggers. Some of her clothing choices have been highlighted in glossy fashion-magazine columns. She drew notice when she sported ’90s-chic Dr. Martens boots at last month’s turkey-pardoning ceremony, and a whimsical unicorn sweater she wore to a recent basketball game with her parents sold out within hours.

The Obama girls are among the youngest children to live in the White House in modern times. The president and first lady have tried to keep their daughters’ lives as normal as possible under the circumstances — the girls must make their own beds, even though their home is staffed by butlers and maids — and they keep the children off-limits to the news media to give them a modicum of privacy.

Although for all their parents’ efforts at creating normalcy, the Obama teens enjoy a range of experiences unimaginable to their peers. They have become friendly with celebrities including Beyoncé and Jay Z. Malia sat in on an Oval Office meeting with her parents and Malala Yousafzai, the 16-year-old Pakistani education activist. Both daughters invite their friends over for sleep­overs and pajama parties on the third floor of the White House.

The president and first lady have described in recent interviews a set of rigid rules designed to protect the daughters from negative influences (although the president has said that Malia has been pushing back on her parents’ restrictions lately). The girls are not allowed to watch television on weekdays unless it is school-related. Neither daughter was allowed a cellphone before age 12, and their mother has warned them of the risk of having a bratty moment caught on a smartphone and going viral. Their parents say that Sasha is still too young for social media and that Malia’s screen time on Facebook is limited.

“I still am not a big believer in Facebook for young people — particularly for them, because they’re in the public eye,” Michelle Obama told ABC’s Barbara Walters last month. “Some of it’s stuff they don’t need to see and be a part of.”

Still, it was Malia and Sasha who introduced their parents to other social media. “You know, Instagram and Vine, those are things that I first heard from them,” the president told People.

At times, the Obamas have evoked their daughters to make political points. During an appearance last week on the Rev. Al Sharpton’s radio show to promote the new health-care law, Michelle Obama talked about Sasha’s bout with meningitis when she was 4 months old and how fortunate she was that they had health insurance.

Politically, however, the president may need more than family nostalgia can provide at this point, said Elizabeth Mehren, a journalism professor at Boston University who has written about several first families.

“The president’s image needs more help than ‘Father Knows Best’ can give him,” Mehren said. She added: “The public has other things on its mind now, not the Obama girls’ growth chart.”

Even as their daughters grow more independent — this summer they again went to sleep-away camp — the Obamas are trying to reinforce familiar family rhythms. The president still breaks away from the Oval Office most nights to eat dinner with the girls at 6:30, something they have done since moving to Washington in 2009.

“They have tons of opinions,” Michelle Obama told People. “And it’s a joy to hear them think out loud about life. They’re growing into really interesting individuals.”

Around the dinner table, after the Obamas take turns saying grace and praying to “live long and strong,” most of the family’s conversations are focused on the girls’ days at Sidwell Friends, the Washington prep school they both attend.

“What are they doing? And who’s got what practice? And what birthday party is coming up? And did we get a gift for this person?” Michelle Obama told Vogue this year. The president, she said, is “up on every friend, every party, every relationship.”

The experience of watching his kids grow up has helped make Obama relatable to many Americans, regardless of their politics or station in life.

“It humanizes the president,” said presidential historian Robert Dallek. “He’s a parent — a doting, affectionate father. And it’s really quite typical. He has a very human touch. Suddenly you look up and your children are teenagers and those years go by. It’s a familiar kind of lament.”

http://news.yahoo.com/youth-brought-us-illegally-leave-131010641.html,,[],Youth brought to US illegally leave to test law,"LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Three immigrant activists who were brought to the United States illegally as children plan to challenge the country's immigration laws by traveling to Mexico and then trying to come back into the country.

Under U.S. law, all three are in the country illegally even though they grew up in America. The three, members of the National Immigrant Youth Alliance, want to draw attention to the law and the huge jump in deportations carried out under the Obama administration, and to reaffirm their attachment to the country where they were raised.

""I know you're going to think that I'm crazy for doing this, for leaving the U.S., for coming to Mexico but, to be honest, I think it is crazier that I had to wait 15 years to see my family,"" Lizbeth Mateo, one of the activists, said in a video posted on the Alliance's Facebook page.

Mateo traveled to Oaxaca a week ago, while the two other activists — one who has applied for a government program that lets young immigrants live in the U.S. on renewable two-year stays — went to Mexico on Wednesday, said Domenic Powell, one of the Alliance's founders.

Powell declined to provide details on the three, or on how or where they will attempt to re-enter the country, other than to say it will occur Monday. He said the organization doesn't want to divulge information because it wants to see how agents from Customs and Border Protection react when they encounter the three.

""We want them to act in a way as they normally would, as they always do,"" he said.

The activists plan to meet with others who were deported to Mexico or left on their own and will try to return to the U.S. with them, Powell said.

Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Deportations have exploded in recent years, topping 400,000 in 2012, more than double the number seven years earlier. U.S. lawmakers are debating an overhaul to the country's immigration system that could include a fix for immigrants who were brought in illegally as children. Many have grown up in America and have no recollection of life in another country, but they have no legal status in the U.S.

""Whether immigration reform happens or not, they should be here in the U.S. because they live here and this is their home,"" said Powell, whose group in the past has organized sit-ins in politicians' offices over the administration's immigration policies."

Nothing of the sort transpired, as we all know now. Five years later, Obama and his acolytes can’t wait to trash members of the GOP who dare stretch a toe over the ideological line toward the President.

Two new examples: a MoveOn.org effort to paint Paul Ryan (R-WI) as racist for using the term “anchor babies” in an immigration talk, and Organizing for Action branding Marco Rubio (R-FL) a “climate denier.”

Both Ryan and Rubio have been generally supportive of the “Gang of 8” Senate immigration bill, one that most conservatives have unabashedly decried.

This afternoon, a group of liberal Wisconsinites will gather at Monument Square in Racine, WI to demand Ryan apologize for using an “offensive anti-immigrant slur”–anchor babies–while discussing immigration reform. The petition began on MoveOn.org’s online petition platform.

A press release announcing the protest featured this battle cry:

As a former vice-presidential nominee and key player in the GOP’s future, Rep. Ryan knows better than to resort to language that only serves to rile up the fringe, anti-immigrant segment of his party. If he wants to attract Republican voters to truly bipartisan reform efforts, this isn’t the way to do it.

That comes on the heels of Obama’s constant campaign arm saying Rubio publicly mocked basic science by not falling in lockstep surrounding the left’s global warming hysteria. Here’s some of the text Organizing for Action sent to its members:

If we want to make progress on climate change, we need everyone in Congress on board for a solution. It’s our job to show them there’s a price to pay for being a climate denier.

Hope and Change? More like Chicago-style politics powered by a dash of Thought Police enforcement."

They get us all crazy about abortion, gay rights, prayer in schools, ACORN, Planned Parenthood, Britney Spears' couchie peeks, Beyonce's side-boobs while they steal, hoard, subvert and leech the lifeblood from the ideals this country was founded on-- a land by the people, for the people. They hit the hot buttons in all of us, liberals and tea baggers alike so we can waste our precious passions and energies in angry food fights about who's moralities are better than whom.

And Obama, after promising straight-talk and a man-for-the-people assurances if he could just get our cash and votes, now turns out to be just another puppet. Unable to change what is really diseased about our institutions. So it's only two possibilities: he's an impotent president, or one who is complicit in the game.

You know I seem to remember a recent village idiot president who got everything he wanted, when he wanted it regardless which party had what majority. If his decisions made some corporate entity shitwads of money, it got done.

And Obama? Those same entities making even bigger shitwads of cash than even Village idiot.

The key here is that the right’s distinction between criminal law and war powers and the constitutional protections afforded to U.S. citizens in our homeland and the absence of the same for enemy combatants (including Americans who take up arms against their countrymen) has been reaffirmed again and again. Guantanamo is still open. Khalid Sheik Mohammed was not tried in a New York courtroom. And the president drops bombs on the heads of many terrorists.

Unlike better-known programs in which law students take on longer-term pro bono work that focuses on single cases, students at UCLA and Southwestern law schools will write amicus briefs, often known as “friend of the court” documents.

“I have not heard of law schools doing anything quite like this,” said Eugene Volokh, a UCLA law professor who will head the university’s First Amendment Amicus Brief Clinic this fall.

Law schools nationwide have come under fire for graduating too many students who are saddled with debt and unable to find jobs. Michael Epstein, the Southwestern law professor heading the program, said it could make participants more marketable.

“Lots of students do moot court, but this isn’t moot,” he said. “This is the real world.”

Volokh agreed, saying students would get valuable experience.

“For quite a while, law schools have been thinking about how they can teach their students other skills,” Volokh said.

Amicus briefs are filed on behalf of one side of a lawsuit by a third party. They are intended to educate the court about an aspect of the law that might not be well known or to raise awareness about an issue in the case. Judges, often those in appeals courts, consider the documents as they make their decisions.

The students will research and write the papers, but attorneys will sign them and students will be acknowledged in the text.

Students at both schools will receive academic credit. Southwestern’s participants will receive letter grades and UCLA students will get pass or fail marks.

Professors at both schools have begun looking for potential students and cases. UCLA students will focus on 1st Amendment work, and the Southwestern project will consider other parts of the law.

“The ideal case is one that will serve the public interest,” Epstein said.

Advertisement

Volokh said he believes writing amicus briefs will fit better into an academic schedule because the papers have deadlines and are often narrowly focused, making it easier to fit them into one semester.

When Epstein was in law school, he spent one summer interning at the Media Access Project in Washington, D.C., and wrote an amicus brief for a telecommunications case that went before the U.S. Supreme Court.

Epstein wrote most of the nearly 60-page document under the supervision of an attorney and received only a one-line credit. Still, he said, the experience was invaluable.

“It helped me professionally in an intangible way. It showed I had what it took to tackle an issue and to advocate an issue that needed to be addressed,” Epstein said.

Students in both programs will work closely with professors or working attorneys. “It’s going to be a one-on-one experience that should be very intense,” Epstein said.

Volokh said he was looking for about nine students and Epstein had even fewer spots.

Advertisement

“This isn’t for the average student,” Epstein said. “The criteria is not only academic excellence and first-rate writing skills. I’m also looking for demonstrable commitment to public interest.”

One of the best known pro bono programs, the Innocence Project, is affiliated with the Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York, and students there work on criminal cases. Many other law schools have courses or clinics in which students research and sometimes even argue cases.

Will: What Obama and the tea party share,"Much is wrong with Washington these days, including much of what is said about what is wrong. Many Americans say there is “too much politics” in Washington. Actually, there is too little. Barack Obama deplores “politics as usual” here. But recently Washington has been tumultuous because politics, as the Framers understood it, has disintegrated. Obama has been complicit in this collapse.

His self-regard, the scale of which has a certain grandeur, reinforces progressivism’s celebration of untrammeled executive power and its consequent disparagement of legislative bargaining. This is why Obamacare passed without a single vote from the opposition party — and why it remains, as analyst Michael Barone says, the most divisive legislation since the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act.

Obama and his tea party adversaries have something important in common — disdain for the practice of politics within the Framers’ institutional architecture. He and they should read Jonathan Rauch’s “Rescuing Compromise” in the current issue of National Affairs quarterly.

“Politicians,” Rauch notes, “like other people, compromise because they have to, not because they want to.” So Madison created a constitutional regime that by its structure created competing power centers and deprived any of them of the power to impose its will on the others.

The Madisonian system, Rauch says, is both intricate and dynamic: “Absent a rare (and usually unsustainable) supermajority, there is simply not much that any single faction, interest, or branch of government can do. Effective action in this system is nothing but a series of forced compromises.”

Rep. Tom Cole, who represents southwest Oklahoma, has a PhD in British history and studied at the University of London, says some of his colleagues in the House of Representatives “think they are in the House of Commons.” That is, they have not accepted the fact that, in the Madisonian system, legislative and executive powers are separated.

By this separation, Rauch writes, Madison built “constant adjustment into the system.” His Constitution is a “dynamic political mechanism” under which no faction ever prevails with finality. This is because there is no finality:

“Forcing actors to bargain and collaborate slows precipitous change while constantly making negotiators adjust their positions. . . . The requirement to bargain and find allies provides new ideas and entrants with paths into politics and ways to shake up the status quo. But that same requirement prevents upheaval by ensuring that no one actor can seize control, at least not for long.”

Obama, who aspires to be Washington’s single actor, has said of his signature achievement: “I would have loved nothing better than to simply come up with some very elegant, academically approved approach to health care, and didn’t have any kinds of legislative fingerprints on it, and just go ahead and have that passed. But that’s not how it works in our democracy. Unfortunately, what we end up having to do is to do a lot of negotiations with a lot of different people.”

Obama wanted something simple rather than a product of Madisonian complexity. He wanted something elegantly unblemished by “any” messy legislative involvement, other than Congress’s tug of the forelock at final approval. It is, Obama thinks, unfortunate that he had to talk to many people.

He and some of his tea party adversaries share an impatience with Madisonian politics, which requires patience. The tea party’s reaffirmation of Madison’s limited-government project is valuable. Now, it must decide if it wants to practice politics.

Rauch hopes there will be “an intellectual effort to advance a principled, positive, patriotic case for compromise, especially on the right.” He warns that Republicans, by their obsessions with ideological purity and fiscal policy, “have veered in the direction of becoming a conservative interest group, when what the country needs is a conservative party .”

A party is concerned with power , understood as the ability to achieve intended effects. A bull in a china shop has consequences, but not power, because the bull cannot translate intelligent intentions into achievements. The tea party has a choice to make. It can patiently try to become the beating heart of a durable party, which understands this: In Madisonian politics, all progress is incremental. Or it can be a raging bull, and soon a mere memory, remembered only for having broken a lot of china. Conservatives who prefer politics over the futility of intransigence gestures in Madison’s compromise-forcing system will regret the promise the tea party forfeited, but will not regret that, after the forfeiture, it faded away.

USA TODAY

The Toronto City Council on Wednesday urged Mayor Rob Ford to take a leave of absence after he acknowledged buying illegal drugs and said his infamous crack-smoking incident was ""sheer stupidity"" that would not happen again.

""I ask forgiveness, I have apologized, I want to move on, that's all I can say right now,"" Ford said during a bruising debate.

At one point, Councilor Denzil Minnan-Wong, a former Ford ally, asked the 44-year-old mayor point blank if he had purchased illegal drugs in the past two years. After a pause of almost nine seconds, the mayor replied, ""Yes, I have.""

""I understand the embarrassment that I have caused. I am humiliated by it,"" Ford said.

Hours later, an Ontario judge unsealed a 500-page police report revealing that former Ford staffers had told investigators about his use of drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.

The embattled mayor, who took office three years ago, strongly rejected a direct appeal by several council members to step aside, saying he has always carried out his duties and would continue to do so.

""I'm most definitely keeping this job,"" he said. ""I am not leaving here. I'm going to sit here and going to attend every meeting.""

Ford, mayor of Canada's largest city, said he had ""no one else to blame but myself"" for a crack-smoking incident during a drunken stupor caught on video, but that it would never happen again.

""I asked for forgiveness, I have apologized, I want to move on,"" he told the council members. ""That's all I can say right now.""

Nonetheless, the council voted, 37-5, for a non-binding resolution calling on Ford to take a leave.

Councilor Jaye Robinson opened the often heated session by presenting a petition signed by 30 of the 44 City Council members asking the mayor to step down temporarily.

The petition was then formally accepted by the council on a 41 to 2 vote. ""Our city's reputation has been damaged,"" she said, the CBC reports. ""Together we stand to ask you to step aside and take a leave of absence.""

The packed council chamber erupted with applause when Robinson ended her speech, saying, ""Let's get on with city business.""

The petition reads in part:

Toronto is distracted and for good reason. Our city's reputation has been damaged and continues to suffer, and it has become difficult to focus on the pressing and substantive issues facing City Council. Today we stand together to ask that you step aside and take a leave of absence to address your challenges privately, outside of the public eye.

After accepting the letter, the council took up a formal motion by Council member Minnan-Wong, a longtime Ford supporter turned critic, that also called on Ford to apologize for misleading the public and to cooperate with a police investigation.

The mayor, who snacked on slices of apple during the debate, was jovial heading into the council chambers, The Toronto Sunreports. ""We're gonna have some fun today,"" he told reporters.

But the debate frequently turned heated, with people on all sides shouting, prompting Speaker Frances Nunziata to urge council members to ""be civil"" and ""respect each other.""

During one exchange, Minnan-Wong told the council that the mayor, en route to the council chambers, had stepped in front of him in a threatening manner and he demanded that Ford apologize.

In the background, the mayor's brother, Councilor Doug Ford, shouted, ""You're too much, brother.""

Mayor Ford protested, saying, ""I did not threaten him (Minnan-Wong) in any way, shape or form.""

At another point, Ford said he would not speak to police, on advice of his attorney, about their investigation into corruption, drug use and extortion.

Ford, who took office in December 2010, has refused to step aside despite immense political pressure. He says voters should determine his political fate when he is up for re-election in 2014.

The debate by the council, which does not have the power to remove Ford from office, follows months of growing scandal stemming from a report by the U.S. website Gawker and The Toronto Star that Ford had been caught on video smoking what appeared to be crack cocaine.

The mayor initially denied the charge and questioned the existence of the video.

Last week, after Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair announced that investigators had recovered two videos, including the notorious crack cocaine tape, Ford acknowledged his actions, and said that he was drunk.

Police have not released either video, saying they are evidence for use in an extortion case against the mayor's ""close friend"" Alessandro Lisi.

Within days of the police statement, a second video emerged, this one showing a clearly inebriated Ford stumbling around a room, gesticulating angrily. ""I'm gonna kill that (expletive) guy. I'm telling you, it's first-degree murder,"" the visibly agitated mayor says on the video.

Ford later acknowledged his actions on the video, saying he had been ""extremely, extremely inebriated.""

The police report released Wednesday was unsealed by an Ontario Superior Court justice at the request of media organizations. The document was used to get a search warrant in the investigation of Ford and Lisi.

The former staffers ""suspected he was doing a variety of drugs, including lines of cocaine and OxyContin, and drinking at city hall, in public and in his car, as well as spending time with escorts, spewing verbal abuse and assaulting female staff,"" The National Postwrites."

Gov. Peter Kinder says ""We are better than this""

(CNN) —

A rodeo stunt at the Missouri State Fair has come under criticism after a clown donned a Barack Obama mask and stuck on a broom that descended from his backside.

The stunt took place during the bull riding competition on Saturday night.

Rodeo announcer Mark Ficken, president of the Missouri Cowboy Rodeo Association and a school superintendent, announced a special guest: “President Obama.”

Another voice is heard over the loudspeaker working up the crowd and saying, “We’re going to stomp Obama now.”

“As soon as this bull comes out, Obama, don’t you move,” the second voice said. “He’s going to getcha, getcha getcha, getcha.”

“Hey, I know I’m a clown,” the second voice said. “He’s just running around acting like one. Doesn’t know he is one.”

The stunt sickened Perry Beam, who came to the fair in Sedalia with his wife and a student from Taiwan to “give him a little piece of Americana.”

Beam likened the atmosphere to a Klan rally.

Opinion: Racist taunts at Obama should worry us all

“It wasn’t clean; it wasn’t fun. It was awful; it was sickening,” Beam said, “It was racist.”

The student, Jameson Hsieh, recorded a video of the incident, but had little to say afterward.

“He didn’t say anything. We rode all the way home in silence,” said Beam, who lives 50 miles away in Higginsville. “We were just ashamed, and he didn’t ask any more questions. I think he had seen enough. It is just disgusting.”

Condemnation came from organizers and politicians alike. The Missouri State Fair Commission called it “unacceptable” and said the clown has been banned “from ever participating or performing at the Missouri State Fair again.”

“The commission reiterated that the statements and actions Saturday night were inappropriate and not in keeping with the fair’s standards,” the agency said in a written statement. “The Missouri State Fair apologizes for the unconscionable stunt.”

The board of directors at Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Association also issued an apology.

“The Sport of Rodeo is not meant to be a political platform. We are taking measures by training and educating our contract acts to prevent anything like this from ever happening again,” a statement on the group’s website said. “All Members of the Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Association are very proud of our Country and our President.”

And Republican Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder called for those responsible to be held accountable.

“I condemn the actions disrespectful to POTUS” – president of the United States – “the other night,” he said in a post to his official Twitter account. “We are better than this.”

U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill echoed Kinder.

“The state fair is funded by taxpayer dollars, and is supposed to be a place where we can all bring our families and celebrate the state that we love,” she said. “But the young Missourians who witnessed this stunt learned exactly the wrong lesson about political discourse, that somehow it’s ever acceptable to, in a public event, disrespect, taunt, and joke about harming the president of our great nation.”

Under current law, the TSA is allowed to keep unclaimed checkpoint money and spend it on aviation security projects, but one congressional lawmaker is pushing a proposal that would redirect the loose change to members of the military.

Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., has introduced legislation that would require the TSA to transfer unclaimed money recovered from airport security checkpoints to nonprofit organizations that operate airport programs in support of the military.

""The TSA has been keeping the pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters from your change purse to pay for their bloated bureaucracy,"" Miller said in a statement. ""If TSA representatives get to play ""finders keepers"" with your hard-earned cash, what’s the incentive to try to get the loose change to its rightful owners?""

In 2012, more than $531,000 was collected at security checkpoints, up $44,000 from 2011, according to data released by Miller's office. In 2010, passengers left behind $433,000 at TSA checkpoints.

Miller's bill, which recently cleared the Homeland Security Committee, was recently evaluated by the Congressional Budget Office, which said the agency is expected to spend unclaimed money gradually over the next several years.

According to a Bloomberg Businessweek report, earlier CBO estimates of the bill said the proposal would cost $1 million to implement. “I was pretty aggravated that they said it was going to cost money to give money away,” Miller told the magazine.

Below is a rundown compiled by Businessweek of the money travelers left at some airports last year:

Other laws are often violated when spam messages are sent to numbers in the federal “Do Not Call” registry.

The commission said it was pursuing an additional case charging contempt of court against Phillip A. Flora, a serial text-message spammer who was barred in 2011 from sending unsolicited texts. He faces potential felony charges of violating a federal court order, in addition to a new lawsuit filed by the F.T.C. against his company, Seaside Building Marketing. Mr. Flora could not be reached for comment.

The authorities said it was difficult to catch companies that send spam messages because they frequently change the phone numbers used to originate the messages, making them hard to track.

Spam waves have become much more frequent since phone companies began offering unlimited text-messaging plans. Now, spammers buy hundreds of SIM cards, the chips that make cellphones work, allowing them to send a flood of messages and then abandon the phone numbers.

The F.T.C. has received at least 50,000 complaints about spam text messages in the last few years, including 20,000 that related to an offer of a free prize, and the number of complaints is growing rapidly. Mr. Baker said the commission received seven times as many complaints in 2012 as it did in 2011.

Officials advised anyone who receives such a message not to click on any link and not to reply. In particular, they said, consumers should not text “Stop” or a similar direction back to the sender, as spam messages often suggest; that simply lets the sender know the phone number is active and therefore a candidate for sale to other marketers. Instead, consumers are requested to forward the text message to 7726, which is a central repository for spam messages that has been set up by cellphone carriers. The message should then be deleted, the officials said."

The 66 to 34 vote fell just short of the two-thirds majority required to approve a constitutional amendment and submit it to the states for ratification. It marked the latest setback for congressional attempts to supersede Supreme Court decisions in 1989 and 1990. Justices narrowly ruled that burning and other desecrations of the flag are protected as free speech under the First Amendment.

As expected, three Republicans -- Robert F. Bennett (Utah), Lincoln D. Chafee (R.I.) and Mitch McConnell (Ky.) -- voted against the amendment. Fourteen Democrats voted for it. The House approved the measure 286 to 130 last year.

GOP congressional leaders have offered up several measures in recent weeks that are important to their conservative political base -- including an amendment banning same-sex marriage and further cuts in the estate tax -- culminating with yesterday's vote on flag burning.

Polls show that most Americans want flag desecration outlawed, and the amendment's proponents said they were trying to stop justices from thwarting the public's will. They said that burning a U.S. flag in public -- while rare these days -- is a reprehensible insult to the nation's founders and a dishonor to the Americans who died fighting tyranny.

The amendment's opponents agreed that flag burning is repugnant, but argued that U.S. troops died to preserve freedoms that include controversial political statements.

Flag burning ""is obscene, painful and unpatriotic,"" Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii), who lost an arm in World War II, said in a floor speech yesterday. ""But I believe Americans gave their lives in the many wars to make certain that all Americans have a right to express themselves -- even those who harbor hateful thoughts.""

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) summarized the proponents' views. The flag's special symbolic status, she said, makes its desecration different from holding a sign denouncing the president. Burning an American flag in anger, she said, is ""conduct, not speech"" because the flag is ""the symbol of our democracy, our shared values, our commitment to justice, our remembrance to those who have sacrificed to defend these principles.""

Behind the constitutional rhetoric were cold political considerations. Republicans are eager to energize conservative voters this fall, and the flag initiative -- even if doomed to fail -- is seen as a sure-fire way to inspire them, especially a week before Independence Day.

The vote is the closest that advocates have come to banning flag desecration in many years of trying. In 2000, the Senate fell four votes short, and supporters had hoped the GOP's 55 to 44 majority -- there is one independent, James M. Jeffords (Vt.) -- would put them over the top this year.

The GOP-controlled House has repeatedly approved the amendment by wide margins, and advocates say they could have handily obtained ratification by three-quarters of the states if the Senate had followed suit.

The debate divided senators along unusual lines. Opposing the amendment was McConnell, the Senate's second-ranking GOP leader, and Bennett, a quiet, mainstream Republican. Democratic supporters includedMinority Leader Harry M. Reid (Nev.) and Sen. Evan Bayh (Ind.), a presidential hopeful. Maryland's Democratic senators voted against the amendment and Virginia's Republican senators voted for it.

The amendment's chief sponsor, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), disputed assertions that the measure was politically motivated and was an unwise use of the Senate's time in the face of war in Iraq, high gasoline prices and a growing federal deficit.

""Fifty state legislatures have called on us to pass this amendment,"" Hatch told colleagues.

He and his allies had tried for days to pick up one more vote. But virtually all senators had stated their positions publicly, making efforts at negotiation or persuasion fruitless.

The Constitution was last amended -- for the 27th time -- in 1992, when the states belatedly ratified a 1789 bid by Congress to regulate lawmakers' pay increases.

Overturning a Texas law in 1989, the Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 that burning an American flag in protest is a form of political speech protected under the First Amendment. Congress later passed a federal anti-flag-desecration law, and the high court invalidated it on the same grounds.

Ever since, lawmakers have debated whether flag burning is an unsavory cost of political freedom or something more akin to intolerable hate speech or monument defacement.

""All rights enshrined in the Constitution have certain limits,"" said Sen. Mel Martinez (R-Fla.). ""There is no such thing as unlimited rights. Although we treasure and value our right of free speech . . . we protect our national monuments,"" including the flag.

But Russell Feingold (D-Wis.) said Congress must ""defend the right of all Americans to express their views about their government, however hateful or spiteful or disrespectful those views may be.""

The proposed amendment said simply: ""The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States.""

Before the final tally, the Senate voted 64 to 36 to reject an alternative measure designed to provide political cover for those who opposed Hatch's legislation. The measure -- a proposed statute, rather than constitutional amendment -- was offered by Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) and was strongly endorsed by Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.), a possible presidential candidate who has sought a middle ground in the flag-burning debate.

The proposal would have outlawed flag desecration if the perpetrators were also damaging federal property, trying to incite violence or trying to intimidate someone. Opponents called Durbin's measure a political fig leaf that the Supreme Court would rule unconstitutional.

Hours before the votes were taken, Sen. George Allen (R-Va.) thrust the issue into his reelection campaign. Noting that Democratic challenger James Webb had said he opposed the amendment, Allen's campaign issued a press release linking Webb to Sens. John F. Kerry and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who voted against the amendment. The release said Webb is ""totally beholden to the liberal Washington senators"" who backed him in this month's primary."

Are they righting a wrong or wronging the Wrights?

The Connecticut Senate passed a bill just after midnight on Wednesday that would delete the Wright brothers from history, explicitly stripping recognition for the first powered flight from Orville and Wilbur and assigning it to someone else.

'At least in Connecticut, aviation history now appears to have been rewritten.' — Aviation historian John Brown

“The Governor shall proclaim a date certain in each year as Powered Flight Day to honor the first powered flight by [the Wright brothers] Gustave Whitehead and to commemorate the Connecticut aviation and aerospace industry,” reads House Bill No. 6671, which now sits on the Governor’s desk awaiting passage into law.

""There’s no question that the Wright brothers will retain their place in aviation history,"" Republican state Sen. Mike McLachlan told FoxNews.com. ""And rightfully so. They just weren't first.""

The Governor is likely to sign the bill as early as next week, McLachlan said.

Aviation historian John Brown unveiled in March what he calls photographic proof that Whitehead flew over Connecticut in 1901, “two years, four months, and three days before the Wright brothers.”

""At least in Connecticut, aviation history now appears to have been rewritten,” Brown told FoxNews.com Wednesday. “I have no information about whether school books will be reprinted in time for the start of Fall classes.”

The Wright brothers soared into history books on Dec. 17, 1903, following their historic, 852-foot, 59-second flight at Kitty Hawk, N.C. -- an achievement for which the duo are widely described as being “first in flight.” But historians have long known that others were working on a variety of flying machines, including a fellow U.S. resident, German immigrant Gustave Whitehead (born Weisskopf).

Read the fine print

A 1948 contract between the Smithsonian museum and Orville Wright requires the museum to call the Wright Flyer the first real airplane, critics argue. Here, the relevant excerpt from the contract:

“Neither the Smithsonian Institution nor its successors, nor any museum or other agency ... or its successors shall publish or permit to be displayed a statement or label in connection with or in respect of any aircraft model or design of earlier date than the Wright Aeroplane of 1903, claiming in effect that such aircraft was capable of carrying a man under its own power in controlled flight.”

Read the full contract here.

Whitehead flew early in the morning of Aug. 14, 1901, Brown said. His winged, bird-like plane was called No. 21, or ""The Condor""; with wooden wheels and canvas wings stretched taut across bat-like wooden arms, it rose over the darkened streets of Bridgeport, Conn., and covered an estimated 1.5 miles at a height of 50 feet, he said.

Since Brown’s March revelation, controversy has swirled around his claims.

Historians with the Smithsonian Museum in particular -- curators of the Wright Brother’s plane -- continue to express doubts about Brown’s claims.

""I’m still absolutely convinced -- as I think most historians are -- that the Wrights were first, and Whitehead in all probability never left the ground,"" Tom Crouch, senior curator of aeronautics from the museum, told FoxNews.com. Besides, history is factual, not based on laws, he said.

""You don’t legislate history. History is a process. People make up their minds based, I hope, on some thought given to the evidence,"" he said.

""And I think when people do look seriously at the evidence for the Whitehead claims, they’ll see that it falls apart.""

McLachlan told FoxNews.com he found the information convincing enough.

""If more information comes along in history, we always change the history books. That’s been going on for years,"" he told FoxNews.com.

Brown trumpeted the bill, which he said was based not on partisan beliefs but on hard facts.

“These weren't just people cheering the home team,” he told FoxNews.com. “Several legislators -- from both parties -- contacted me before the vote … they'd clearly done their homework and asked hardball questions.”

“It was refreshing for me to see how seriously they took their vote,” Brown added.

While Kitty Hawk, N.C., has become well associated with flight thanks to Orville and Wilbur, Connecticut has a deep history in the aviation world as well. Sikorsky Aircraft Corp., maker of the Black Hawk helicopter, is headquartered mere miles from the site of Whitehead’s achievement.

""North Carolina’s license plate does say first in flight,"" McLachlan told FoxNews.com. ""I think we’ll now have a little bit of a discussion between Connecticut and North Carolina to verify who was first.""

""It’s a big deal that we have dislocated the Wright brothers as number one,"" he said."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/09/30/Cruz-vs-Gregory-5-Lessons,2013-09-30 00:00:00,['Joel B. Pollak'],Cruz vs. Gregory: 5 Lessons,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) put on a masterclass in his appearance on NBC News’ Meet the Press with David Gregory on Sunday. In less than twenty minutes, Cruz not only demolished Democrat arguments–as transmitted by the ever-eager Gregory–but also showed a keen insight into debate tactics that Republicans often lack. Here are the five key tactics, which should be studied and drilled into Republican politicians in media training.

1. Question the premise. On two separate occasions, Cruz pushed back against the implicit assumptions in questions Gregory asked–assumptions designed by Gregory to put Cruz on the defensive. In each case, Cruz challenged the question itself before answering, and then used his answer to return to the offensive.

In the first case, Gregory implied Cruz had not engaged in a “debate” about how to “change” Obamacare:

GREGORY: It’s interesting. Democrats say, “You know, the problem with Senator Cruz’s position is that it’s a purist position.” There are problems with Obamacare. The White House admits that. We talked about polling in some quarters indicating great dissatisfaction with the law, as you’re talking about in Town Hall meetings. But you have to engaged in a debate about how they change the law. What you’ve gone out and said is, “Let’s kill the law all together. Let’s de-fund it.” CRUZ: Actually, with respect, David, I think the premise of your question is wrong. It is the Democrats who have taken the absolutist position. Look, I’ve engaged– I’d like to repeal every word of the law. But that wasn’t my position, even in this fight.

That turnabout created headlines, drawing public attention to the refusal of Democrats to compromise.

In the second case, Gregory brutally distorted a remark by Cruz about Neville Chamberlain:

GREGORY: Do you regret comparing the future of Obamacare to the rise of Hitler in Nazi Germany? CRUZ: Well, the premise of your question isn’t true. I didn’t make that comparison. What I said is that there have been many voices in Washington who’ve said, “We can’t do this, we can’t do this, we can’t do this.” And I went through the contracts where, over and over again, when facing big challenges, Americans have risen to the occasion, whether it was the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World War II, whether it was going to the moon under John F. Kennedy, or whether it was winning the Cold War.

The addition of Kennedy at the end–to counter Gregory’s false Hitler reference–was a nice touch.

2. Stick to the message. Gregory wanted to make the interview all about a government shutdown. Cruz kept his own answers focused on Obamacare. That frustrated Gregory, who nearly lost his composure: “You’re making an argument….You’ve made all these arguments. My goodness, you went and spoke for 21 hours to make these arguments. You haven’t moved anyone.” Cruz, in contrast, looked calm and focused–and kept the debate on terms where he had the distinct advantage, given Obamacare’s unpopularity.

An additional note on this point: Democrats, having been through the talking-points-factory that is left-wing media training (and produces such robots as Debbie Wasserman Schultz), are very good at sticking to their message, but largely because they simply keep repeating it, regardless of the circumstances. What Cruz did was different, and more effective: he found a way to make his message relevant to each context in the debate.

3. Cite your opponents’ supporters in your favor. Gregory came armed with quotes from Republicans and Beltway conservatives who disapprove of what Cruz is doing. Cruz countered, as he did frequently on the Senate floor, with direct quotes from Democrats’ core constituents, including Teamsters Union leader James Hoffa, who has led a new surge of opposition to Obamacare from the left. Cruz’s ready access to the Hoffa quote also shows the importance of research and preparation, and reflects well on his political staff.

4. Never forget your constituency. My favorite moment in the interview was when Gregory read Cruz an extended quote from George Will, and Cruz responded by saying, effectively, that Will only represents his own view, while a Senator from Texas represents millions of voters who knew what they were getting:

GREGORY: George Will, who’s been a conservative columnist for The Washington Post and others, has been very supportive of you in the past. But he wrote this, this week. I want to have you respond to it… CRUZ: Look, I’m just trying to fight for 26 million Texans and for the American people. And I’m pretty sure George Will, in that column, argued that what we should be doing is delaying Obamacare, which is exactly what the House of Representatives just voted to do.

5. Believe that your opponent secretly agrees with you. Gregory is certainly on the left, but Cruz never treated him as an enemy. Rather, he approached the host as if he could be brought ’round, given the true facts. The above quote, about George Will, is instructive. Note that Cruz did not say that Will was wrong–instead, he found a point of agreement within Will’s column and emphasized that. By finding ways to show that his opponents might actually agree with him, Cruz encouraged even skeptical viewers to ask themselves whether they might, as well. And his supporters had plenty to cheer without watching yet another Republican guest try to earn points with the press by backtracking on previous convictions."

Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., was among the Democrats who sharply questioned Holder Wednesday on the controversy. She questioned why and how Holder was able to recuse himself from that case, and said it appears the department's actions ""have, in fact, impaired the First Amendment.""

""Reporters who might have previously believed that a confidential source would speak to them would no longer have that level of confidence, because those confidential sources are now going to be chilled in their relationship with the press,"" she said.

The toughest criticism of Holder is still coming from Republicans. To date, Holder has fended off a succession of Republican-led efforts to oust him. At the hearing Wednesday, he dismissed a recent call from the GOP chairman for his resignation as ill-informed.

And on Thursday, President Obama backed up his long-time ally.

""I have complete confidence in Eric Holder as attorney general,"" he said at a press conference, defending the importance of leak investigations as well as press freedom. Obama added that he would make ""no apologies"" on the issue of pursuing leaks.

But the volume of Democratic complaints may be rising.

Liberal radio host Bill Press took the left's criticism to a new level Thursday when he publicly called for Holder to be forced out.

On his Twitter account, Press wrote: ""What 'breach of national security' are we talking about re the AP story? It's BS and Holder should be fired.""

Making clear the tweet wasn't just a slip of the keyboard, he then wrote: ""I'll repeat what I said earlier. POTUS should fire Eric Holder.""

""POTUS"" is shorthand for the president.

Democratic lawmakers have stopped short of calling for Holder's resignation, but have pressed him for answers on why the department found it necessary to go around the back of AP bosses and obtain their phone records -- which was done as part of an investigation into sensitive intelligence leaks.

Holder, in defending the records grab, has called the leak one of the most serious he's ever seen, while noting that he recused himself from the case and his deputy is actually the one leading the investigation.

Other Democrats have been more defensive of Holder, and suggested the latest controversy would be used for partisan purposes. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said it was Republicans who demanded the leak investigation in the first place.

""Now, of course, it is convenient to attack the attorney general for being too aggressive or the Justice Department for being too aggressive,"" he said.

Holder similarly went after Republicans for their scrutiny on Wednesday. He lashed out at Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., after he accused Holder of purposely and repeatedly keeping information from Congress.

""No, that's what you typically do,"" Holder responded. Following crosstalk, Holder added, ""That is inappropriate and is too consistent with the way in which you conduct yourself as a member of Congress. It's unacceptable and it's shameful.""

Issa led the charge in Congress against Holder and his department over the botched Operation Fast and Furious anti-gun-trafficking program. Republicans eventually voted to hold him in contempt of Congress over resistance to providing certain documents pertaining to that case.

But Holder had since been able to keep his head down -- until the Associated Press revealed this week that Justice had secretly sought its phone records.

Prominent Democrats swiftly joined Republicans in questioning whether that step was necessary.

""The burden is always on the government when they go after private information -- especially information regarding the press or its confidential sources. I want to know more about this case, but on the face of it, I am concerned that the government may not have met that burden,"" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said Monday."

The president addressed Keystone during a speech in Chattanooga, Tenn., as he challenged Republicans to come up with new jobs proposals.

""They keep on talking about this -- an oil pipeline coming down from Canada that's estimated to create about 50 permanent jobs. That's not a jobs plan,"" Obama said.

In citing the 50-jobs number, though, the president was using the smallest possible number attached to the pipeline project. The estimate he used likely refers to a State Department finding that -- after the pipeline is built -- it would take roughly 50 people to maintain it.

But the comment ignores the rest of the State Department report that estimates the project would create nearly 4,000 annual construction jobs -- and potentially ""support"" an annual 42,000 jobs.

More On This...

Obama similarly ignored those findings during an interview he gave recently to The New York Times. In the interview, Obama said the project would create roughly 2,000 construction jobs and maybe 100 additional jobs after that -- calling it a ""blip relative to the need.""

As FoxNews.com reported on Monday, Obama appeared to eschew the higher job-creation estimate from his own State Department, opting instead to use the numbers from a 2011 Cornell University Global Labor Institute study, which opposes construction of the crude-oil pipeline.

A Washington Post fact-check column on Tuesday questioned why the administration would ignore its own numbers.

""Ordinarily, we would expect the president to cite an estimate from his own State Department, rather than a think tank opposed to the project,"" The Post story said.

The paper acknowledged that much of the estimating is ""guess work"" that includes speculation about such ""spinoff"" jobs as suppliers.

""But the president shouldn't pick and choose how he cites job-creation numbers. Perhaps he is tipping his hand on what he secretly thinks of the Keystone XL by citing a low-ball figure, generated by the pipeline's opponents, but he should stick to using the official government estimate,"" the fact-check column concluded.

The Post suggests that Obama should perhaps estimate the job-creation numbers just as he did when touting his stimulus plan. The column gave the president's claim two ""Pinocchios"" -- out of four on the paper's fact-check scale.

Republicans were more critical of the claim.

""A president disparaging private-sector jobs while backstage at a jobs rally is beyond belief,"" Michigan Republican Rep. Fred Upton, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, told FoxNews.com. ""The president's own State Department reported that Keystone would support upwards of 40,000 jobs. In this economy, any source of private job creation should be welcomed with open arms. After nearly five years and 15,500 pages of review, there is no reason to delay these jobs another day. Republicans, Democrats, leading unions, and job creators all agree, it's time to start building.""

Another fact-check site -- one tied to the industry -- also blasted Obama's original comments. A post on the Oil Sands Fact Check blog cited the State Department's total estimates and wrote: ""Um ... that's a little more than a blip. President Obama also could have consulted the many labor union members across the country who need those jobs and have held rallies in support of Keystone XL across the nation."""

A few prominent voices from the industry have voiced unhappiness with some of the group’s hardball tactics, including running controversial TV ads for conservatives to gain their support for comprehensive immigration reform.

Twitter co-founder Evan Williams tweeted a blog post on his new company Medium’s website which accused Fwd.us of “employing questionable lobbying techniques, misleading supporters and not being transparent about the underlying values and long-term intentions of the organization.”

“The leaders of the technology industry (and of Fwd.us) have built their careers on bringing meaningful change to the world. They should be doing the same in Washington,” wrote startup founder Josh Miller.

Fwd.us spokeswoman Kate Hansen said the organization planned to stay the course.

“We recognize that not everyone will always agree with or be pleased by our strategy,” Hansen said in an emailed statement. “Fwd.us remains totally committed to supporting a bipartisan policy agenda that will boost the knowledge economy, including comprehensive immigration reform.”

Fwd.us has tech all-star backers such as Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Google’s Eric Schmidt. It has hired a team of seasoned Washington veterans including Rob Jesmer, who was executive director at the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and Joe Lockhart, a former White House spokesman under President Clinton. But its politics-as-usual gamesmanship seems to be out of step with some in the tech industry, particularly those who invest in clean technology.

“Will Fwd.us prostitute climate destruction & other values to get a few engineers hired & get immigration reform?” venture capitalist Vinod Khosla asked on Twitter, linking to a newspaper article about the controversy over the group’s ads.

Keith Rabois, a partner at Khosla Ventures, is a contributor to Fwd.us. Elon Musk, co-founder of Tesla Motors and chairman of SolarCity, is also a contributor.

Technology entrepreneur Anil Dash reflected in a lengthy blog post on what he thinks Fwd.us gets right and wrong, after meeting with its founder Joe Green.

“The tech industry is going to have to reckon with exactly how real the realpolitik is going to get,” Dash wrote. “If we’re finally moving past our innocent, naive and idealistic lack of engagement with the actual dirty dealings of legislation, then let’s try to figure out how to do it without losing our souls.”

It was intercepted at an off-site facility in Landover where congressional mail has been examined before delivery since anthrax-laced letters were sent to Capitol Hill in 2001.

The letter was addressed to Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and initially tested positive for ricin, but officials familiar with the case said it was undergoing further testing late Tuesday. The officials gave no indication why the letter was sent to the second-term senator.

In a statement, Wicker thanked federal authorities “for their hard work and diligence in keeping those of us who work in the Capitol complex safe.”

During an afternoon briefing on the attacks at Monday’s Boston Marathon, senators were told that there is no suspected link between the letter and the attacks.

Senate Sergeant at Arms Terrance Gainer, who oversees Senate security, said that the suspicious letter was discovered Tuesday and that authorities conducted multiple field tests, followed by laboratory confirmation tests.

“I have confidence in our procedures, our personnel, the United States Capitol Police response personnel, the strength and weaknesses of field testing and the need for laboratory confirmation,” Gainer said in an e-mail.

But FBI spokesman Paul Bresson said late Tuesday that “initial field tests produced mixed results, so the substance is in the process of undergoing further analysis at an accredited laboratory. Only after that test result can a determination be made about whether the substance is ricin.”

A U.S. Capitol Police statement said that preliminary tests indicated the substance found was ricin but that the letter was being forwarded “to an accredited laboratory for further analysis.”

Gainer had briefed senators on the letter and outlined steps they should take to reassure staffers how to handle suspicious mail. “While we have no indication that there are other suspect mailings, it is imperative to follow all mail handling protocols,” Gainer wrote in a letter sent to all Senate staff Tuesday evening.

The off-site facility that screens mail will be closed for several days for further testing and examination by federal investigators, delaying delivery of mail to the Capitol and Senate office buildings.

Previous incidents have led to negative tests of suspicious letters. A false positive happened in 2004, when a letter to then-Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) was believed to contain ricin.

Ricin, a toxin found in castor beans, is poisonous if inhaled, injected or ingested, according to the National Counterterrorism Center. Treatment is available, but long-term organ damage is the likely result of exposure.

Eleven years ago, anthrax spores delivered in letters killed five people, injured 17 and changed how the U.S. Postal Service thinks about mail safety.

In his letter to staff members, Gainer gave no insight into any suspects. He said the letter, postmarked from Memphis, contained no return address and no “outwardly suspicious” markings.

Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), however, told reporters that the investigators are focusing on a person who has regularly written to members of Congress in the past.

The U.S. Postal Service spends about $100 million annually to screen every piece of first-class mail sent or received by U.S. households and mail sent to federal addresses in Washington, say officials familiar with the process.

Mail destined for the White House, Congress and federal agencies requires closer scrutiny. In the past, postal officials have said that once mail with federal addresses is sorted at a Washington facility, it is trucked it to a New Jersey irradiation facility operated by a private firm operating medical sterilization equipment. The Postal Service spends about $12 million annually on irradiation, say officials familiar with the process.

Mark Brady, a Prince George’s County Fire/EMS Department spokesman, said federal authorities notified local crews Tuesday morning that they were investigating a “potential package” at the facility in Landover. Several hours later, federal authorities requested crews come assist in that investigation by having an ambulance on standby to possibly treat those working on the package.

Such incidents, Brady said, are typical — occurring once or twice a day.

An attorney for rodeo announcer Mark Ficken said Tuesday that his resignation from the group is not an acknowledgment of wrongdoing on his part but rather a protest that the association has not banned the rodeo clown from its membership.

Ficken's resignation from the rodeo group comes as he tries to hold on to his job as superintendent of the Boonville School District. The school system announced Monday that it is hiring an investigator to look into whether Ficken was involved in any ""inappropriate conduct"" during Saturday's bull riding event at the Missouri State Fair in Sedalia.

Missouri's elected officials have denounced the rodeo clown act as disrespectful to Obama.

The event featured a man wearing an Obama mask with an upside down broomstick attached to his backside who was positioned on the arena's dirt floor as if he were a dummy. Another clown drew cheers from the audience as he asked if they wanted to see ""Obama run down by a bull"" and made comments about the bull coming to get Obama.

More On This...

Ficken's attorney said a rodeo clown wearing a microphone -- not Ficken -- orchestrated the act and made most of the comments about a bull charging after Obama.

The Missouri State Fair said Monday that it has permanently banned the clown from performing at the fair.

The rodeo association, which was responsible for the event, has not publicly said what -- if any -- action it has taken against participants.

""When he found out that the association had no plans to remove the rogue clown from its membership ranks, (Ficken) felt that the better part of valor - given what was said - was to resign from the association,"" said his Ficken's attorney, Albert Watkins.

Neither the State Fair nor the rodeo association has identified the rodeo clown who made the comments about Obama. But a friend and relative both identified the clown as Tuffy Gessling.

""He was at our house the next day for Sunday dinner and told us that he thought people took it wrong - that it was supposed to be a joke,"" said his cousin, Chrissy Gessling, of Slater, Mo.

Tuffy Gessling has not responded to Associated Press requests for an interview made through Facebook, his cousin and a friend."

Circuit Court of Appeals, Leahy said at an event advocating Millett, currently a Supreme Court appellate attorney. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has already threatened to invoke the so-called nuclear option if Republicans don't let at least one of Obama's D.C. Circuit nominees get a vote. Millett, who will come up for a vote as soon as Thursday, is the first of Obama's three D.C. Circuit nominees to hit the Senate floor. Nina Pillard cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee and is ready for a floor vote, while Robert Wilkins is set for his committee vote on Thursday.

Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) said that he, too, will vote to filibuster Millett and revealed why Republicans want to keep Obama's nominee from getting on the court. ""We're worried about that court being a significant bastion for administrative law cases on Obamacare,"" Kirk said.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is attempting to educate Republicans, but it's not likely to work. As a reflection of just how brazenly political Republican opposition to anything President Obama wants to is, they've brought back the laughable assertion that Obama is attempting to ""pack"" the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit by filling three vacancies. Reid calls that what it is : ""ridiculous."" He's moving ahead with the nominations, and taking the nuclear option out of his back pocket and waving it around in front of Republicans, with some help from Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT).By the way, one Republican senator let the cat out of the bag, and explained just why Republicans are trying to block any more Obama nominees to this critical court:What a shock."

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Sunday that the Republican Party as a whole has abandoned its opposition to allowing a pathway for citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Graham, a member of the group of senators negotiating immigration reform, known as the ""gang of eight,"" guessed there was a 70-30 chance legislation would be enacted.

""The politics of self-deportation are behind us,"" Graham said on NBC's ""Meet The Press,"" referring to a proposal advanced by Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney during the 2012 campaign.

""Mitt Romney's a good man. He ran in many ways a good campaign,"" Graham said. ""But it was an impractical solution. Quite frankly, it was offensive. Every corner of the Republican Party -- from libertarians to the RNC, House Republicans and the rank-and-file Republican Party member -- is now understanding there has to be an earned pathway to citizenship. That gives us leverage on immigration with our Democratic friends.""

On CBS' ""Face The Nation,"" two leading members of the ""gang of eight,"" Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), also expressed optimism about a deal. Schumer said that legislative language is on track to be completed at the end of this week, and McCain said that the bill could go through committee and land on the Senate floor by May.

Graham, however, continued to press forward with a key issue of his, calling for a ""merit-based"" guest worker program. The proposal has been a stumbling block in negotiations, according to people involved, and the outlines of the deal currently tilt more toward family reunification as the central way of handling the future flow of immigrants.

Graham also said that the pathway to citizenship must be tied to certified border security. The nature of that certification could end up being central to the final agreement. Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson (D), also speaking on ""Meet The Press,"" said that it was inhumane to tie a person's pathway to citizenship to uncertain and unrelated border security evaluations, but Graham insisted there would be ""no deal"" without a direct connection."

To attend a taping of TNT's ""Christmas in Washington"" yesterday, the first lady opted to wear her white embroidered J. Mendel crepe jacket -- the very same garment that caused uproar during President Obama's 2012 election. Michelle had first worn the Resort 2013 piece to the pre-Olympics Opening Ceremony reception at Buckingham Palace back in July 2012, prompting criticism for the jacket's $6,800 price tag.

Mrs. O was labeled ""out of touch"" by media outlets, which cited that the average American family was making $4,284 a month, only slightly more than half the cost of FLOTUS' jacket.

News sources like Fox pointed to the fact that Ann Romney, the wife of then-presidential candidate Mitt Romney, was condemned for wearing a $990 Reed Krakoff top for a television interview, asserting that a possible bias existed in Michelle's favor. Other outlets pointed to the fact that nobody seemed to be tallying the prices of the men's clothing during the presidential race.

Whatever side you take in this argument, Michelle certainly risks reigniting the debate by bringing back the now-infamous jacket. But hey, can you blame her for wanting to get another wear out of the thing after dropping that much cash?

Jewell said the logjam on Capitol Hill has created a conservation backlog, and she warned that the Obama administration would not “hold its breath forever” waiting for lawmakers to act.

“The president will not hesitate,” Jewell said in an interview in San Francisco last week. “I can tell you that there are places that are ripe for setting aside, with a tremendous groundswell of public support.”

Congress has not added any acreage to the national park or wilderness systems since 2010. Jewell blamed ramped-up rhetoric in Washington for the impasse. She said the appetite for preserving American historic and cultural sites remains high but some officials seek to avoid the appearance of publicly embracing more government protection.

Jewell, who has been on the job scarcely six months, came to California to promote several intiatives and tour a site that could be added to a national monument along the Mendocino coast.

She began with a meet and greet at the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. On a bright day with gulls wheeling against a backdrop of the Golden Gate Bridge — the velvety green Marin headlands in the distance — Jewell stood in one of the nation’s most-visited national parks and made the case for the value of public lands.

Among the public events on Jewell’s schedule was a visit to the 1,255-acre Stornetta Public Lands site on the Mendocino County coast, north of Point Arena. Several members of the California congressional delegation have proposed adding the site to the California Coastal National Monument.

It’s one of many pending federal bills that would conserve land in California. One bill would expand the boundary of Yosemite National Park, and another would create a national monument in the San Gabriel Mountains.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has proposed sweeping legislation that would add thousands of acres to Joshua Tree and Death Valley national parks and the Mojave National Preserve, protect 74 miles of waterways as wild and scenic rivers, designate 248,000 acres as wilderness and create the Sand to Snow National Monument running from the floor of the Coachella Valley to the peak of Mt. San Gorgonio.

The conservation community has a long list of places that it believes require protection, but activists complain that with sequestration budget cuts on top of congressional reluctance to promote conservation, little is getting done.

“It’s been nearly impossible to figure out how to get more funding for conservation work, whether it’s just getting money to run agencies or getting full funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund,” said Kristen Brengel, who lobbies Congress for the National Parks Conservation Assn. “There is almost no hope for the wilderness or monuments bills — they are being held up.”

Brengel said Jewell’s willingness to recommend that Obama act unilaterally, using powers granted to presidents under the Antiquities Act of 1906, gives hope to conservationists who see the administration as indifferent to environmental issues.

“The take-away is she’s kind of teed herself up to make those recommendations to the president,” Brengel said. “They are capable of making decisions on conservation. They just haven’t made many of them.”

The Antiquities Act gives presidents authority to name new monuments — a power generally residing with Congress. Presidents going back to Theodore Roosevelt have used the act to set aside natural wonders, including the Grand Canyon in 1908, which was later named a national park against the wishes of local officials.

But use of the act in recent years has sparked strong protest. Most notabley was President Clinton’s decision to designate the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah in 1996, putting one of the nation’s largest coal reserves off limits to mining.

Utah lawmakers, led by then-Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, a Republican, bitterly complained that federal authorities failed to consult with local communities before elevating protections on 1.8 million acres of rugged red-rock canyons. Further antagonizing opponents, Clinton signed the act while sitting at a ceremonial desk placed on the rim of the Grand Canyon in Arizona.

Cinton used the Antiquities Act more than any other president. Obama has used the law to designate nine new monuments, focusing mainly on historic sites such as the Charles Young Buffalo Soldiers National Monument in Ohio, the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument in Maryland and the Cesar E. Chavez National Monument in Kern County, which is poised to become a National Historic Park.

Amazingly enough, it turns out there were no jars of urine and/or feces brought into the Texas Capitol during the abortion bill debate.

Documents released Monday by the Texas Department of Public Safety's provided no new evidence that officers found one jar of urine and 18 containers of feces at the Capitol before a July 12 debate on a controversial abortion bill. DPS released a press statement the day of the debate that said officers had discovered one jar suspected of containing urine and 18 jars suspected to contain feces. After initially resisting requests for additional information about the reported discoveries, DPS on Monday released 144 pages of documents about the alleged incident. But the documents contain no official reports of the findings, and several DPS officers said they had not seen any of the suspected items. [...] DPS director Steve McCraw indicated he was frustrated about media reporting on the incident, and in a July 14 email he asked DPS officers to give the media photos of the suspected items. ""I'm tired of reading that we made this stuff up,"" Steven McCraw wrote in an email. ""Let's get the photos we have to members and the media. Does anyone realistically believe we would fabricate evidence to support a political agenda. Amazing.""

As a result, I have created such a list here, using the opinions that I have heard from tens of thousands of men during my years working as a matchmaker. The fact is, if you are a woman and you want to get married, you need to be smart about your dating. This means avoiding certain male types, but it also means recognizing what you are doing wrong in your dating and whether the type of woman you are putting out there to the male population attracts or repels them. To figure this out, you can start by considering the list below and whether you, at times, are any of these quite unattractive female types:

Miss ""Bossy Pants"": This woman usually can't help herself; she has bossy in her DNA. When a man first meets her, he might think this character trait is cute, for awhile. However, once he starts to feel like he is in grammar school being told what to do by his second grade teacher, he will give this woman her walking papers.

Miss ""Playing Games With His Heart"": This woman thinks that being a game player will help her land a man. However, even though a man might be intrigued by a hard to get lady in the beginning, as soon as he decides that he is interested in her, all he wants is an honest straightshooter. If this woman doesn't remove Battleship from her repertoire quite quickly, she will be shown the door before she can even sink his vessel.

Miss ""I Want To Change You"": This woman is lurking everywhere. She is the type of woman many men are the most leery of. (Of course, there are some men who love this woman because of their own insecurities.) She claims that she loves her guy just the way he is, but little by little, she chips away at just about everything about him. First, it's his wardrobe, then it's his taste in music. However, when she gets to his friends and his hobbies, she is usually kicked to the curb.

Miss ""Suspiciously Jealous"": This woman is on edge all the time because she is very distrusting. Many times, she has been burnt in the past, so she is on guard for anything that looks or feels wrong. When a man first meets this woman, he sees her as a damsel in distress and wants to reassure her that he is nothing like that guy in her past. However, once she accuses him one too many times, he will have no choice to leave her because he can't go through his life being prosecuted for somebody else's crimes.

Miss ""I Live For You And I Have Nothing Else Going On"": This woman is very difficult for a man to date, let alone marry. At first, he is flattered that she is so into him, but very quickly, he feels overwhelmed and suffocated by her. As a woman, you must have something going on in your own life so that you are not just waiting by the door for him to come home.

Miss ""I Have Daddy Issues"": This woman usually dates older men and deep down is looking for a father figure, not a boyfriend or husband. Initially, her guy might like how she looks to him for approval and the answer to all of her questions, but soon, he realizes that he wants to have sex with a real woman, not someone who is stuck in her teen years trying to get Daddy to notice her.

Miss ""I Speak To My Mother Five Times A Day About Everything"": This woman has her mother on speed dial and can't seem to make a decision or do anything without getting her opinion. When a guy first meets her, he thinks it's nice that she is so close to her family, but soon, he finds it to be way too much. A man just doesn't want to have to ask her mother's permission about things in his life.

Miss ""Shhh, I Shouldn't Really Be Saying This, But..."": This woman is like a human Page Six. She loves to gossip and talk about other people and she loves to hear things about other people as well. Initially when a guy meets her, he might be entertained by her anecdotes but eventually, he begins to wonder what she is saying behind his back.

Miss ""Keeping Up With The Joneses"": This woman needs to be at least as good as everyone else she knows. She is constantly talking about what the other people do and what the other people have. This places a lot of undue pressure on her guy and eventually, he justs gets fed up that she can't appreciate what they have instead of wishing she was someone else.

Miss ""I Don't Eat"": This woman picks at her food, is on a never-ending diet or doesn't eat pretty much everything that most people eat. When a man first meets her, he thinks to himself, at least she will never become overweight, but eventually he realizes that it's no fun to eat alone. The fact is men like to eat; they like steak, they like trying different foods, they like dessert and women should be eating too, at least sometimes.

Keep in mind that most men just want a happy and easy going woman who has good values, so just focus on putting the best YOU out there.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) introduced a bill Tuesday that would prevent employers from discriminating against job applicants who have poor credit.

The legislation, co-authored with six Democratic senators, prohibits credit checks in the hiring process.

In an MSNBC interview on Tuesday, Warren explained that outlawing credit score disclosure would allow potential employees to compete on their ability to do a job, not on their economic standing.

""People ought to be able to get out there and compete for a job based on whether or not they can do the job, not based on whether or not they can pay their bills or whether or not they've had a problem in the past: a divorce, a job loss, a death in the family, the kinds of things that cause people to have financial problems,"" Warren said.

Warren, a defender of the middle class, argued that mandatory credit score disclosure is one way ""the game is rigged"" in favor of the financially stable.

""This is a problem that hits hardworking families who are struggling to get back on their feet,"" Warren said. ""It's not one that hits the rich and I think that's just wrong. It's how we fight for people who have been hit by one economic blow or another and are out there trying to compete in the job market and just want a level playing field.""

Bush On Legacy: 'There's No Need To Defend Myself',"Former President George W. Bush steered clear of any detailed reflection on his legacy during a recent interview with USA Today, saying that his actions over eight years in the White House largely speak for themselves.

""There's no need to defend myself,"" Bush said in an interview published over the weekend, in anticipation of an opening ceremony for his presidential library at Southern Methodist University. ""I did what I did and ultimately history will judge.""

In the 30-minute interview conducted before last week's Boston Marathon bombing, Bush also urged people not to forget ""the lessons of 9/11,"" saying that it was still evident that ""evil exists still in the form of people who murder innocent people to advance a point of view.""

Bush will be in Dallas on Thursday when the doors of his presidential library officially open, along with his father, George H.W. Bush; President Barack Obama; and every other living president. He's spoken repeatedly over the past month about the presidency that facility is meant to honor and has left the impression that he is content with focusing on being a new grandfather, golfing and painting, while avoiding public scrutiny over his decisions.

Speaking with the Dallas Morning News recently, Bush addressed his leadership on the Iraq War -- one of the most highly criticized chapters of his presidency -- saying that he was ""comfortable"" and ""confident the decisions were made the right way.""

USA Today also caught up with close friends and family of the former president, who said that Bush ""feels totally at peace"" with his record. Former Bush strategist Karl Rove said that he ""has an inner confidence ... that what he did was right.""

And while Bush and some of his closest allies suggest that there is nothing about his legacy that needs defending, other sources close to the former president have suggested that the $500 million presidential library is an attempt to patch up his scarred reputation.

A longtime Bush counselor told National Journal in a piece published Monday that the former president was ""confident"" he could improve his reputation.

“How else could he be?"" the counselor said. ""But he’s got a ways to go to mending his record -- if it can be done."""
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/30/opinion/america-in-2013-as-told-in-charts.html,2013-12-30 00:00:00,['Steven Rattner'],"America in 2013, as Told in Charts - The New York Times","Trust in many American institutions has been declining, but few institutions have fallen so far out of grace as Congress. Last year, I showed that the previous Congress was the least productive Congress in modern times, including the famous Do-Nothing Congress of 1947-48, passing just 238 laws, 37 percent of the average of the 32 Congresses that preceded it. In 2013, the first year of this Congress, the number of new laws passed fell further, to 55 (as of Nov. 30), seven fewer than during the same period in 2011. As a result, Congress now stands dead last in approval rating among key American institutions – below other braches of government, below news outlets, below banks and even below big business.

Congress well deserves that poll standing, in significant part because of the damage that it has done to the federal budget. The combination of Republican determination to cut spending and Democratic insistence that none of the entitlement programs (such as Medicare and Social Security) be meaningfully affected has resulted in the utterly inane policy of starving key domestic programs, including education, infrastructure and research and development. The recent budget fight and subsequent agreement did nothing to change that trajectory. As shown by the red line above, all that resulted was avoiding the worst two years of forced budget cuts to these programs; for the 10 years beginning in 2008, this important spending will rise slightly in nominal numbers but will fall by 5 percent, after adjusting for inflation.

The dysfunction in Washington has taken its toll in other important ways. Not only has business confidence been shaken, but each new political battle has also been terrifying for consumers. Back in the summer of 2011, when the United States had its AAA credit rating removed by S.&P. after it flirted with default, consumer confidence recorded the second biggest two-month drop ever, behind only the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. A smaller decline occurred at the end of 2012 when Congress nearly went over a fiscal cliff. Beginning this past July, consumer confidence dropped to its lowest level in nearly two years as a result of the government shutdown, the A.C.A. problems and related battles. Now, a two-year budget nearly in hand, Americans’ moods seem to have improved. At a time when we need consumers to spend (prudently), these periods of faltering confidence have real economic consequences.

In contrast to the mood in most of the country and the still slow economy, Silicon Valley is partying again, albeit not quite like 1999. The Facebook initial public offering in May 2012 helped usher in a resurgence of excitement among investors for anything that looks like a sexy new high-tech service. This year’s poster child I.P.O. was Twitter, which set a new record of one kind among recent major technology I.P.O.'s: its valuation of more than 28 times its revenues. That didn’t daunt investors; the stock promptly more than doubled and now trades at 66 times revenues. (Of course, there are no profits.)"
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/10/Public-revolts-against-political-Obama-s-and-establishment-s-amnesty-efforts,2013-11-10 00:00:00,['Matthew Boyle'],"Public Revolts Against Obama, Political Establishment's Amnesty Efforts","According to new national polling data from Pew Research, the American people have revolted against President Barack Obama’s and the GOP establishment’s efforts to grant amnesty to America’s at least 11 million illegal immigrants through comprehensive immigration reform.

“Only about a third of the public (32%) approves of the job Obama is doing on immigration policy; 60% disapprove,” Pew wrote. “Obama’s ratings for this issue among Democrats are mixed: About half (53%) approve of his handling of the issue while 42% disapprove.”

Obama’s 60 percent disapproval rating on immigration from the American people is an all-time high for him on the issue and puts him on par with former President George W. Bush’s immigration polling numbers. Obama’s immigration disapproval rating has skyrocketed as he has ramped up his efforts to lobby Congress for the passage of an amnesty–particularly the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” immigration bill.

As the American people have learned more and more about the Gang of Eight bill and the effects which amnesty and a drastic influx of millions of new workers would have on the hurting economy, they have grown more and more outraged with what Washington, D.C., is doing regarding immigration reform. In February–before Obama and lawmakers like Sens. John McCain (R-AZ), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and DIck Durbin (D-IL) began their push for immigration reform–the President’s immigration policy approval rating among the American people, according to Pew, was higher than his disapproval rating. His approval rating on immigration then was 44 percent, whereas his disapproval rating was 43 percent.

Over the next several months, the Obama administration worked with the Senate Democrats and a handful of Senate Republicans to develop the more-than-thousand-page-long Gang of Eight bill. The administration helped Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid rush the bill to the floor with hardly any substantive review from members, staffers, the media, and the American people.

In mid-June, before the Senate bill passed and as its ultimate passage became questionable, Obama’s Pew Research disapproval rating on immigration spiked up to 47 percent, and his approval rating on the issue dropped to 43 percent. With the public beginning to turn against amnesty, the Senators pushing for it cobbled together a series of amendments designed to win over extra votes in the Senate–like the Corker-Hoeven plan for their votes, casino kickbacks for Sen. Dean Heller’s vote, “Lobster Bait” for Susan Collins’ vote, and a seafood processing deal for Lisa Murkowski’s vote, among others–and rammed the bill through to final passage in the Senate.

Since then, Obama’s immigration disapproval rating, according to Pew, has skyrocketed to 60 percent. That disapproval rating is higher than George W. Bush’s ever was, according to a Pew chart on page 12 of the report, save one exception: in April 2006, Bush’s immigration disapproval rating reached 62 percent.

As Obama’s disapproval ratings reach all-time highs because of his support for amnesty, Republicans keep the issue alive. While House Majority Whip Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) says the issue will not receive any votes in the House in 2013, which is probably true, the effort to grant amnesty from House GOP leadership is alive and well–and likely to continue in early 2014.

Officials like Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman Reince Priebus and House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) keep offering Obama cover by continuing to push for some kind of immigration package. In an interview this week with Bloomberg’s Al Hunt, Priebus continued pushing for amnesty.

“I think it can happen, and I think people like Paul Ryan and others still want something like that to happen,” Priebus said this week. “It could happen next year, I don’t think there’s any sort of midnight hour here.”

Ryan is in the process of drafting a bill that would grant America’s at least 11 million illegal immigrants legal status. “A lot of people are saying, just pass the Senate bill,” Ryan said this summer at a town hall event in Racine, Wisconsin. “That’s not what the House is going to do. I think we can make it better.”

Priebus and Ryan, if they keep pushing down this road, face the fate of what happened to Senator Rubio after he pushed for amnesty. Rubio has since backed off the push and publicly undercut the efforts of House GOP leadership to pass any group of piecemeal bills with the goal of getting to a conference committee negotiation with the Democratic Senate–from which a comprehensive immigration reform conference report like the Senate bill would arise. Rubio’s backtracking on the issue, and complete reversal of support for his own bill, came after the American people turned on him for supporting such a plan. Polling data over the past several months showed the once-promising presidential candidate tanking among Republican voters.

House GOP leadership could technically kill this once and for all by promising publicly what Homeland Security Committee chairman Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) has advocated: that there will never be a conference committee with the Senate bill. However, they have left the door open, as pressure from lobbyists and groups funded by left-wing billionaire George Soros ratchet up pressure on House Republicans to pass an amnesty.

If such legislation as the Gang of Eight bill were ever to become law, it would be considered President Obama’s signature second-term legislative achievement, much like Obamacare is his first term’s signature achievement. The difference from Obamacare is that Republicans like Priebus and Ryan are helping him achieve it, at least for now–largely because the donor community on Wall Street wants this policy.

Despite all the pressure from donors and special interests to do what Ryan and Priebus are doing, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, offers a different pathway forward for the GOP: flip this whole debate on its head, undercut amnesty, and make the Democrats wear the blame for having fought against the interests of American workers.

“In changing the terms of the immigration debate we will not only prevent the implementation of a disastrous policy, but begin a larger effort to broaden our appeal to working Americans of all backgrounds,” Sessions wrote in a memo to his GOP colleagues this summer."

WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court declared California prison overcrowding unconstitutional and upheld an order by a 5-4 vote that could force the transfer or release of more than 30,000 convicted felons over the next two years.

California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation officials insisted Monday that a new state law, allowing some offenders to serve sentences under local county supervision, could significantly cut the need to release inmates.

""It's our hope that, overall, we will see a pretty significant reduction in the prison population due to"" the new law, said Matthew Cate, secretary of the corrections department. Cate and other officials in a teleconference with reporters deflected questions about convicts who could be freed because of the ruling.

State legislators are still considering how to finance the shift to local incarceration. On Monday, it was unclear how quickly the court's decision might impact prisoners and public safety in California. Under a lower court's order, officials have two years to reduce the inmate population.

Prisoners' advocates said the high court's decision should force the state to reconsider harsh sentences that filled its prisons beyond capacity. ""The massive prison buildup in California in recent decades is the result of overly punitive policies such as 'three strikes and you're out' along with ineffective parole revocation polices,"" Marc Mauer, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Sentencing Project said in a statement.

In the ruling, Justice Anthony Kennedy, joined by the court's four liberals, declared that inmates' medical care and mental health had been severely compromised. Their decision upheld an order from a special three-judge panel in lawsuits brought on behalf of inmates who alleged prison conditions amounted to a violation of the Eighth Amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment.

In a decision that affects only California, Kennedy, often a swing vote, emphasized that the state's prison ills had been well-documented and that officials had faced court orders to fix the problems for more than 10 years.

""For years the medical and mental health care provided by California's prisons has fallen short of minimum constitutional requirements and has failed to meet prisoners' basic health needs,"" Kennedy said, noting that as many as 200 prisoners had lived in a gym and as many as 54 prisoners had shared a single toilet.

The four more conservative justices dissented. Justice Antonin Scalia took the rare step of reading portions of his statement from the bench. He described the lower court's order requiring release of tens of thousands of felons as ""perhaps the most radical injunction issued by a court in our nation's history. Scalia said the order allowed judges to go ""wildly beyond their institutional capacity.""

He and the other dissenters predicted the decision would affect public safety in California. Scalia said ""terrible things (were) sure to happen as a consequence of this outrageous order.""

In earlier decades, federal courts were more involved in helping correct societal problems and ensure civil rights, whether in prison overcrowding, school segregation or environmental concerns. That era faded in part because the increasingly conservative high court believed judges were treading on the domain of legislators.

Monday's case, Kennedy stressed, grew out of especially dire conditions. He noted that the prison population at one point was 156,000, nearly double the number that buildings were designed to hold. The special panel that heard the prisoners' challenge ordered the state to reduce prison population to 137.5% of design capacity.

The current population is 143,435, prison officials said, and under the judges' order it would have to get down to about 109,805 in two years.

Lawsuits at the heart of Monday's case were filed in 1990 and 2001. Among the claims from prisoners' lawyers were that ""mentally ill prisoners have been found hanged to death in holding tanks where observation windows are obscured with smeared feces, and discovered catatonic in pools of their own urine after spending nights in locked cages.""

Kennedy appended pictures to his opinion, including of ""dry cages"" used for inmates awaiting beds in a mental health unit.

""As a consequence of their own actions, prisoners may be deprived of rights that are fundamental to liberty,"" Kennedy said. ""Yet the law and the Constitution demand recognition of certain other rights."" Kennedy noted that most of the prisoners who would be released would not be the ones with medical problems, rather those who would be eligible for good-time credits and early parole.

Kennedy was joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.

Kennedy said the lower court would have to continue to monitor the situation. He said that the state may be able to show that progress in lowering the population makes the overall situation ""less urgent.""

California officials had urged the high court to reverse the order, saying violations of prisoner rights could be addressed through new construction, some prisoner transfers out of state and the hiring of more medical personnel. The three-judge panel said earlier such vows had failed to sufficiently improve the system.

Scalia's dissent in Brown v. Plata was signed by Justice Clarence Thomas. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel A`lito dissented separately. Alito, joined by Roberts, said the lower court's decree violates federal law.

""The Constitution does not give federal judges the authority to run state penal systems,"" Alito wrote. ""Decisions regarding state prisons have profound public safety and financial implications, and states are generally free to make these decisions as they choose."""

Community leaders on both sides of the immigration debate, however, agreed that the president’s plan didn’t stray much from a proposal outlined Monday by a bipartisan group in the Senate.

The fate of any sort of immigration reform will rely on the fine print, which is yet to be sorted out. Obama said he wants a program that would create a path to citizenship.

One key difference between both plans is that the Senate proposal says the federal government must first certify that the U.S.-Mexico border is secure before there is a pathway to U.S. citizenship for the estimated 11 million who are in the country illegally.

Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer welcomed the border enforcement portion of the Senate plan, spokesman Matthew Benson said.

“The governor is very encouraged that for the first time in a long time there is bipartisan agreement that border security must be the linchpin in immigration reform, specifically before… a pathway to citizenship,” Benson said.

Pat Sexton, president of the Tucson chapter of the Arizona Latino Republican Assn., said she agrees that securing the border must come first but doesn’t believe citizenship should be given to the millions here illegally.

The 60-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen, who is originally from Guatemala, said there is already a clear path to residency and eventual citizenship.

“The pathway is for them to go back to their country and do it the way it’s supposed to be done,” Sexton said.

Arizona immigrant rights leaders and community organizers said they were generally encouraged by Obama’s proposal, stating that the announcement is a testament to the growth and influence of Latinos in the country.

Latino voter turnout in November’s election likely played a key role in the renewed interest in addressing immigration reform, said Petra Falcón, executive director of Promise Arizona.

“That’s why we are at this moment right now,” she said.

Some called the proposals set forth by Obama and the group of senators a recycled endeavor.

“This is nothing new or novel,” John Hill, executive director of Stand With Arizona, said.

“It’s the same empty promises of 1986,” he added, referring the immigration bill signed by President Ronald Reagan. That legislation led to the legalization of about 2.7 million people.

Hill, who heads the Phoenix-based anti-illegal immigration group, said that law, the Immigration Reform and Control Act, also pledged to secure the border and to compel employers to verify that job applicants were in the country legally. Neither effort, however, was enforced vigorously. Meanwhile, millions received legal status and millions more followed and remained in the country illegally, Hill said.

Since large Latino voter turnout in the November election, lawmakers have faced mounting pressure to confront immigration reform.

Promise Arizona, and other immigrant rights group in Arizona were part of a contingent of Latino advocacy groups in the state that made a huge push to register Latinos in Maricopa County, enrolling 34,000 who had never voted before.

These groups also signed up thousands of eligible Latinos to become permanent early voters, meaning they would be sent a mail-in ballot automatically in each election. In 2008, 90,000 Latinos were on the early voting list. In 2012, it increased to a record 225,000, according to Francisco Heredia, state director for Mi Familia Vota in Arizona.

Falcón said the plan is to mobilize the thousands they enrolled to vote and have them call and email their congressional representatives in Arizona to push for immigration reform.

“We are going to go back and knock on those doors…"" she said. “We need to make sure that every day our members of Congress hear from us .. .to make sure we get our message out there.”

Hill said his group -- an estimated 240,000 members strong -- plans to do the same.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/02/14/Exclusive-Judicial-Watch-USDA,2013-02-14 00:00:00,['Breitbart News'],Exclusive: Judicial Watch Breaks USDA Training Video Labeling Pilgrims 'Illegal Aliens',"Wednesday night on The O’Reilly Factor, Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, broke a series of previously unreleased US Department of Agriculture Videos featuring required “Cultural Sensitivity Training.” The program required employees to chant, “The pilgrims were illegal aliens,” never to use the word “minorities” and to replace it instead with “emerging majorities,” and other similarly leftist tripe.

The sensitivity training sessions taped here were held on USDA premises, and is part of what Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack termed the department’s “new era of Civil Rights” and “broader effort towards cultural transformation at USDA.” The training sessions were created by diversity awareness trainer Samuel Betances at a cost of approximately $200,000.

The video highlights include:

Betances explaining to USDA employees that “If you take a look at all of you here and you think about your salaries and your benefits and what you have left undone – plus my fee – plus the expense of the team that putting the video together, this is a huge expense.”

Betances urging to repeat the leftist version of American history: “I want you to say that America was founded by outsiders – say that – who are today’s insiders, who are very nervous about today’s outsiders. I want you to say, ‘The pilgrims were illegal aliens.’ Say, ‘The pilgrims never gave their passports to the Indians.”

Betances stating, “By the way, I don’t like the word ‘minorities.’ How about ’emerging majorities’?”

The complete video is available through the Judicial Watch website.

Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, told Breitbart News, “This was a pretty straightforward attempt at psychological reconditioning. Underlying the whole program is the theory that white males especially are inherently racist, sexist, or homophobic. It’s a huge waste of taxpayer dollars.

“This is as objectionable or as significant as the GSA Las Vegas scandal. This is a program blessed at the highest levels of the USDA. We found out about it because of a whistleblower who was forced to undergo this type of training. They’ve obviously selling this left-wing diversity cult,” said Fitton.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/02/honolulu-police--tattoo-ban_n_4206377.html,2013-11-02 00:00:00,[],"Honolulu Police Department Tattoo Ban Follows National Trend, But To What End?","Police departments all over the country are imposing tattoo bans of various scope on their officers, but it is unclear what difference these bans make on their abilities to enforce the law.

Most recently, the Honolulu Police Department announced a ban on any visible tattoos, piercings or “dental ornaments.” Existing tattoos must be covered with a long sleeve uniform or with makeup. (Yes, makeup.)

The new ban raises multiple concerns. Tattoos are a huge part of Hawaii culture, Polynesian tattoos in particular. Many see tattoos not as a fashion statement but as a statement of heritage. Similar issues were raised last year when the London Metropolitan Police banned some tattoos, since a portion of their force came from Pacific islands.

The New Orleans police department is in the process of reviewing its proposed tattoo ban in light of this concern. ""As we reach temperatures close to 100 degrees on some days, it just seems like cruel and unusual punishment, just because you are proud that you served in the U.S. Navy or you put the name of your child on your arm,"" a Fraternal Order of Police spokesman said during this summer’s debate over the ban.

Finally, on an island where every branch of the military has at least one base, no doubt the Honolulu PD will also face the problem of a large portion of their officers having military backgrounds. The military has a strong tattoo culture, and veterans wear their ink with pride. Retired military members provide one of the best pools from which police departments could and should recruit.

Baltimore, Los Angeles and New York all have tattoo bans of varying degrees, and smaller departments are clearly trying to follow suit. But what effect do tattoo bans have on the success of the officers? “The absence of visible tattoos gives a more professional appearance to law enforcement officers,"" an NOPD spokesperson argued.

Some officers agree, believing a tattoo-less police force will aid in their community interactions. Jeffrey Yzquierdo, who has a full-sleeve tattoo on his arm, had been with the Phoenix Police Department for 11 years when he told the New York Times that he had no problem with a tattoo ban. “Some people want nothing to do with me,” Yzquierdo said, indicating he was frustrated with the public’s negative response towards him because of his tattoos.

But many police departments’ bans involve an incredible amount of bureaucracy and nitpicking that possibly takes focus away from much more important concerns. Department bans specify the size of the allowable tattoos, “no greater than 3"" X 3"" size each” and only one on each arm for new hires in Palm Beach County. (For veterans, a little leeway: “No larger than a notecard.”) In Phoenix, tattoos could not be larger than a “3x5 index card.”

In departments where the ban only applies to new hires, like Des Moines, current officers had to document by photograph and report every tattoo they already had so that no new tattoo went unnoticed -- or unpunished.

As Honolulu moves forward with its tattoo ban, NOPD continues to reconsider its ban. It may be one of the few departments heeding the argument that the police have bigger fish to fry. According to The Advocate, New Orleans loses an average of one police officer every three days.

“I think it’s bad for the city,” Police Association of New Orleans President Mike Glasser said. “It accomplishes nothing. I don’t know if it makes for a more professional appearance, but it doesn’t make for more professional policing.”

In fact, when the Des Moines Police Department banned tattoos in 2009, police union president Stewart Barnes argued that his tattoos actually helped him do his job. Then 48 years old, Barnes said his ink helped local youth relate to him. “""They come up to me and talk to me about tattoos.”"

Details of the measure were unclear today and its prospects of passing remained uncertain. But both Democratic and Republican leaders said they agreed on a proposal, the first such sign of progress in more than two years of discussions spurred by a continued downgrading of the state's credit rating.



The debate has centered on how to reduce costs while balancing the legal protections to public employee retiree benefits laid out in the state constitution. The public employee unions have repeatedly threatened to challenge in court any pension proposal that lacked their support, and they were quick to criticize today's announcement.



Negotiations among the four legislative leaders had centered on plans to slow compounded annual cost-of-living adjustments for public employees—the biggest driver of the state's $100 billion unfunded pension liability.



""We got it done,"" said Senate Republican leader Christine Radogno, who said ""the goal"" is to vote on the measure next week.



A top aide to Democratic Senate President John Cullerton concurred.



""There is a deal,"" said Rikeesha Phelon, spokeswoman for Senate President John Cullerton, D-Chicago, in an email. ""We are asking our members to return on Tuesday. We are going to spend the next week reviewing the plan with our caucus.""



The senators will join House lawmakers, who were told yesterday to return Dec. 3 to Springfield for a one-day session. The Dec. 3 date is politically significant because it is the day after the filing deadline for the March 2014 primary election, and lawmakers will know what competition they have.



Radogno said the proposal would save about $160 billion and the goal is to fully fund the pension system over the next 30 years.



The proposal would raise retirement ages, create an optional 401(k)-styled plan and scale back the cost-of-living increases.



Increasing the retirement age, now set at various levels based on the type of work, would impact the youngest workers the most. Younger workers could see up to five years added to their retirement ages, Radogno said.



The cost-of-living adjustments would be altered ""to be sure that the lower-paid, longest-serving employees have the biggest protection,"" said Radogno. It would be largely patterned after a provision she pushed and was included in a bill that Speaker Michael Madigan passed in the House.



Currently, retirees get an automatic 3 percent compounded increase every year.



The plan that passed the House included a formula that gave weight to the number of years a person worked, a way to rein in the size of the annual pension increases of employees that worked only a few years but got huge salaries



Radogno said that proposal has been ""tweaked"" slightly but would not go into the details



Gov. Pat Quinn issued a statement saying the plan meets his ""standard"" to eliminate the unfunded pension debt and give the retirement systems financial stability.



""We have more work to do,"" Quinn said. ""I look forward to working with the leaders and members of the General Assembly over the coming days to get this job done for the people of Illinois.""



Officials for public employee and teachers' unions, while unfamiliar with the details, said in a statement that they believed the proposal was ""an unfair, unconstitutional scheme that undermines retirement security"" since it was based on previous proposals that they had fought.



""It's no compromise at all with those who earned and paid for their retirement benefits,"" said the ""We Are One"" coalition, an umbrella organization for the state AFL-CIO, the Illinois Education Association, the Illinois Federation of Teachers, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the Service Employees International Union and the Illinois Nurses Association.

(CNN) – Two Republican lawmakers are asking a government agency to look into a recent trip to Cuba by Beyoncé and Jay-Z, suggesting the superstar couple violated restrictions on travel to the communist island.

“Despite the clear prohibition against tourism in Cuba, numerous press reports described the couple’s trip as tourism, and the Castro regime touted it as such in its propaganda,” Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Mario Diaz-Balart, both of Florida, wrote in the letter to the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control.



Beyoncé and Jay-Z were photographed in Havana last week, apparently celebrating their fifth wedding anniversary on the island. While Cuba was a popular getaway for Americans in the 1950s, spending money there was outlawed after Fidel Castro took power in 1959.

In 2012 the Obama administration lifted some of the restrictions on travel to Cuba, instituting a “people-to-people” travel program that requires a strict itinerary for vacationers.

""Each traveler must have a full-time schedule of educational exchange activities that will result in meaningful interaction between the travelers and individuals in Cuba,"" U.S. Treasury Department guidelines read.

Asked about Beyoncé's and Jay-Z's recent trip, Treasury Department Spokesman John Sullivan said only ""I can't comment on specific licenses.""

Americans have been known to get around travel restrictions to Cuba in the past by stopping first in a country with flights to the island. Cuban customs officials are familiar enough with the practice to not stamp American passports when they cross their desks.

In their letter the Treasury Department, Ros-Lehtinen and Diaz-Balart noted their connection to “a community of many who have been deeply and personally harmed by the Castro regime’s atrocities, including former political prisoners and the families of murdered innocents.”

“The restrictions on tourism travel are common-sense measures meant to prevent U.S. dollars from supporting a murderous regime that opposes U.S. security interests at every turn and which ruthlessly suppresses the most basic liberties of speech, assembly, and belief,” they wrote. “We support the Cuban people by refusing to sustain their jailers.”

Other lawmakers held different views, such as Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona.

""So, @Beyonce and Jay-Z @S_C_ are in Cuba? Fine by me. Every American should have the right to travel there,"" he wrote on Twitter.

Frustrated with the lack of progress, Ms. Collins, a Republican, two Saturdays ago quickly zipped out a three-point plan that she thought both parties could live with, marched to the Senate floor and dared her colleagues to come up with something better. A few days later, two other Republican female senators eagerly signed on — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who overcame the Tea Party to win re-election in 2010, and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who benefited from the Tea Party wave.

Together the three women started a bipartisan group whose negotiating framework formed the centerpiece of a tentative Senate deal nearing completion Monday to reopen the federal government and avert a disastrous default.

“Before I went to the Senate floor, no one was presenting any way out,” Ms. Collins said. “I think what our group did was pave the way, and I’m really happy about that.”"

The consequences were costly.

California dioceses paid $1.2 billion in settlements and released thousands of confidential documents that showed their leaders, including Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles, had made plans to shield admitted molesters from law enforcement.

Now, state legislators are considering a bill that would give some alleged victims more time to sue. But this time, the church is waging a pitched battle in Sacramento to quash it.

A group affiliated with the church has hired five lobbying firms and spent tens of thousands of dollars fighting SB 131. Opponents argue that the bill unfairly opens the church, the Boy Scouts, and other private and nonprofit employers to lawsuits over decades-old allegations that are tough to fight in court. Two bishops have visited the Capitol to argue their case to the bill’s chief author.

In the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, the campaign extends to the very top. Archbishop Jose H. Gomez warned parishioners last month in the church newspaper that the proposal “puts the social services and educational work of the Church at risk” and urged them to press their lawmakers to scuttle it.

The church, Gomez said, “faces deep challenges from the government” and cited the proposal as an example without explaining what it would do. “Let’s pray for our religious freedom … and let’s exercise that freedom by contacting our legislators about SB 131,” he wrote.

The current battle has roots in 2002, when lawmakers were searching for a way to respond to the unfolding clergy scandal. At the time, California’s civil statute of limitations — or the time limit for plaintiffs to file lawsuits — was relatively strict for child sex-abuse claims.

Plaintiffs could sue alleged abusers or their employers until age 26. After that, they could sue within three years of finding links between past molestation and present psychological problems, but they could no longer sue employers who may have failed to protect them from known molesters.

The 2002 bill extended the three-year discovery rule to employers and lifted the statute of limitations on lawsuits against them for all of 2003, allowing a slew of claims related to decades-old abuse. Church leaders didn’t mount a campaign against the bill. They didn’t testify at hearings. They didn’t write a single letter in opposition. The legislation zipped through both chambers of the Legislature — not one lawmaker voted against it.

“At the time it didn’t seem like too unfair of a response to the sexual abuse of children,” said Edward Dolejsi, executive director of the California Catholic Conference, the church’s political arm. “I don’t think anybody anticipated the exposure that would be there.”

In 2007, the L.A. Archdiocese alone settled with more than 500 plaintiffs for $660 million. Church officials were also forced to make public a trove of confidential papers in January of this year. In an acknowledgment that the documents had sullied the church’s reputation, archdiocese attorneys tried this year to get upcoming sex-abuse trials moved to another part of the state, saying the media firestorm had tainted the Southern California jury pool.

Since the California law took effect, lawmakers in other states have introduced similar bills, arguing that civil lawsuits are a key way for abuse victims to seek justice. But only three states — Delaware, Hawaii and Minnesota — have passed such laws, said Marci Hamilton, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York and an expert on child sex-abuse statues of limitation.

That’s partly because of the Catholic Church’s opposition efforts, she said, which have included hiring lobbyists and dispatching bishops to try to sway legislators. “The 2002 bill caught the church off-guard,” said Hamilton, who supports lengthening the time child sex-abuse victims have to sue. “Now the Catholic bishops are bringing their A-game to California.”

Their target is a bill introduced by Sen. James Beall Jr. (D-San Jose). Its key provision would again lift the statute of limitations for one year, but only for a group who were 26 or older and missed the previous deadline because they more recently discovered abuse-related psychological problems.

Advertisement

Advocates say loosening time limits is crucial in sex-abuse cases because it often takes decades for victims to admit that they were molested and seek legal recourse. Supporters of SB 131 include the National Center for Victims of Crime and the California Police Chiefs Assn.

“There are victims out there who deserve justice and accountability,” said Joelle Casteix, western regional director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests. Casteix sued the Diocese of Orange during the 2003 window, alleging abuse at the hands of a lay choir director at Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana.

Casteix not only won a $1.6-million settlement, but she also received documents that showed administrators knew about — and ignored — the abuse. “It gave me my dignity back,” she said.

Opponents argue that it’s hard to mount a defense against decades-old accusations because key witnesses are often dead or infirm and evidence may have vanished. They also say that legislation that temporarily suspends the statute of limitations encourages people to make false claims in hopes of walking away with a settlement check.

Because Beall’s bill doesn’t apply to schools and other public agencies, church lobbyists also say they’re being scapegoated. The California State Alliance of YMCAs and the California Assn. of Private School Organizations, whose members include Catholic dioceses, oppose the bill as well.

“We’re not going to open up a window again. We have done that once,” Dolejsi said. “Are you going to open another window five years from now? When does it end?”

Advertisement

A group linked to the church, the California Council of Nonprofit Organizations, spent $75,000 in the first three months of the year to oppose SB 131, according to papers filed with the secretary of state. The ties between the group and the church, including Dolejsi’s affiliation with both, were first reported by the Orange County Register.

Beall said two high-ranking church officials told him that the bill could financially hobble schools and parishes: Auxiliary Bishop Gerald E. Wilkerson of the L.A. Archdiocese and Bishop Jaime Soto of the Diocese of Sacramento, who are president and vice president of the California Catholic Conference. Other bishops have urged their flocks to help defeat the bill.

In Southern California, at least one parish, St. Timothy in West Los Angeles, rounded up letters signed by parishioners to send to Sacramento. An archdiocese spokeswoman did not respond to questions about whether other churches did the same.

It’s unclear what effect the campaign has had, though a posting on the California Catholic Conference’s website said that it persuaded some lawmakers to either vote against the bill or abstain from weighing in.

The bill recently squeaked through the Senate and passed the Assembly Judiciary Committee. It goes to the lower house’s Appropriations Committee next. Because of the church’s lobbying efforts, Beall said, he was concerned about its survival.

“If people don’t like a bill, they kill it in appropriations,” he said.

Republicans seem determined to change the rules so Democrats will no longer be able to stop judicial nominations with the threat of a filibuster. If they're acting out of frustration, it's understandable. In the past we've been frustrated when legislators tried to stop important bills from passing by resorting to the same tactic. The filibuster, which allows 41 senators to delay action indefinitely, is a rough instrument that should be used with caution. But its existence goes to the center of the peculiar but effective form of government America cherishes.

Since George W. Bush first became president, Democratic senators have used the filibuster 10 times to block the confirmation of nominees for federal court judgeships. They chose their targets cautiously -- more than 200 other nominees were confirmed, some of them men and women whose records were extremely conservative. But surely it is not a matter of life and death to the White House if, for instance, a former lobbyist for mining interests with a reputation for anti-environmentalism cannot get a seat on the federal bench out West. The president might have taken this opportunity to fulfill his long-deferred promise to be a uniter, and replaced the rejected nominees with other candidates from the very large pool of competent people available. Instead, Mr. Bush has drawn a line in the sand and resubmitted some of the same unworthy nominees. If the Democrats resist, the Republican leaders have vowed to change the rules and eliminate the right of filibuster for judicial nominations.

They may not have the votes to make this happen. Many of the wisest Republicans are well aware that their leaders are playing a dangerous game and that they are doing it for frivolous reasons. The judicial nominees can easily be replaced. But the sense that there are certain rules that all must play by, whether to their advantage or not, is something that cannot be restored. Senators need only to look at the House to see what politics looks like when the only law is to win at any cost.

The Senate, of all places, should be sensitive to the fact that this large and diverse country has never believed in government by an unrestrained majority rule. Its composition is a repudiation of the very idea that the largest number of votes always wins out. The members from places like Rhode Island, Maine or Iowa know that their constituents are given a far larger say than people from New York simply by virtue of the fact that each state has two votes, regardless of population. Indeed, as a recent New Yorker article pointed out, the Democratic senators who have blocked that handful of judicial nominees actually represent substantially more Americans than the Republican majority that wants to see them passed."

There is little debate that Ryan defined the scope and character of the budget negotiations that played out in November and early December. Yes, he would have gone further if Senate Budget Committee chair Patty Murray (D-WA) and other Democrats had not been in positions to constrain his ambitions. But Ryan bragged that the deal reflected his bottom line: no new taxes on the extraordinarily wealthy, no closing of loopholes for corporations, no economic stimulus, continuation of many of the worst of the sequester cuts and an austerity calculus that unburdened billionaires, while resting the responsibility for reducing debts and deficits on the shoulders of federal employees and military personnel who must pay more for their benefits. Though Murray and many of the leading lights of the Republican and Democratic caucuses in the House and Senate were involved in the budget negotiations, Ryan was the definitional player. And he shaped a plan that embraces his fiscal ethic of erring consistently on the side of Wall Street speculators, “golden parachute” CEOs and million-dollar campaign donors.

A recent Pew Research poll finds that historically high numbers of Americans want their government to do less abroad. That worries many foreign policy elites, who fear that bad wars and growing debt are reviving old-fashioned isolationism.

But the public is neither isolationist nor misguided when it comes to foreign policy. Americans do not want to withdraw from the world; they just prefer not to try to run it with their military. A security strategy made to match those preferences — what we and others call restraint — would keep us out of avoidable trouble and husband our resources, ultimately making us safer and richer.

Conservatives live in constant fear of ""wussification"": That is the lesson one would learn from watching Fox News in 2013. Media Matters compiled a hilarious list of the top 10 times the word wussification—usually attached to the phrase of America—cropped up on Fox News this past year. The metaphorical testicles of America were lost to a myriad of causes, including the move to change the name of the Washington, D.C., NFL team and the push to end unpaid internships. Unmentioned as a symptom of wussification, interestingly enough, was the use of the term wussification in place of the grittier street alternative that starts with a p. Considering that Fox worried that suspending a cop for cursing at a bunch of children leads to wussification, you would think they would summon the testicular fortitude to use the word that they really mean. Lest you think this is simply Fox News employees overcompensating for working within a stone's throw of so many Broadway musicals, rest assured that this nonstop conservative anxiety about keeping things manly is hardly limited to Fox. For their last great push of freaking out over nothing this year, the culture warriors all over the right-wing media threw a major fit because an ad for Obamacare online pictured a man wearing eyeglasses and pajamas. Real men sleep in cargo pants and forsake being able to read rather than admit to needing the assistant of an optometrist, which is a word that nearly rhymes with gynecologist, after all.

In “The Mandela Barbie,” BBC journalist and investigative reporter Greg Palast’s eulogy of Nelson Mandela provides a rare breath of sanity in the media stampede to remake a legendary Marxist revolutionary into an icon of free market capitalism. According to Palast, “The ruling class creates commemorative dolls and statues of revolutionary leaders as a way to tell us their cause is won, so go home.” Al Jazeera America also offers a fairly balanced assessment of Mandela’s accomplishments. In “Mandela Sought Balance Between Socialism and Capitalism,” Martin O’Neill and Thad Williamson acknowledge that Mandela and the African National Congress totally failed to deliver on economic provisions – freedom from poverty, genuine equality of opportunity and a fair share of national wealth – in the ANC’s 1955 Freedom Charter. They also note that despite the advent of majority rule, poverty and living standards are much worse for black South Africans under the ANC. I frankly expected Democracy Now, The Nation, Mother Jones and other “alternative” media outlets to do a better job of distinguishing between superficial ballot box democracy and the genuine freedom that can only come from true economic democracy. Instead they were all happy to ape CNN and the New York Times in celebrating the cosmetic reforms masking the reality of brutal South African living conditions.

The incarceration of vast swaths of the American public is now an aging issue. Our prisons have increasingly become homes for the aging, as there are now some 125,000 prisoners age 55 or older, nearly quadruple the number there were in 1995. Many of these prisoners are serving life sentences, but others soon will be released into society facing special hardships because of their age. They will join a massive and steadily increasing population of aging ex-offenders who always will bear the scars to their mental, physical and financial well-being that come with having been a prisoner in America. [...] While many vulnerable older Americans can turn to public assistance programs for help, the options for former felons are often much more limited. Certain felons cannot receive federal housing assistance in many jurisdictions. Twelve states, including two of the three states with the largest prison populations in the country, ban people convicted of a drug felony for life from SNAP (formerly food stamps). Twenty more have modified disqualification, such as by requiring a drug test or restoring eligibility after a specified number of years. [...] In effect, our country's broken criminal justice system has condemned substantial parts of whole generations to impoverishment and ill-health of mind and body in their old age. Add to this voter disenfranchisement laws in many states, and we have fashioned a human rights disaster - a permanent under-caste of poor old people who are denied even the tiniest voice in our democratic system.

A strange new condition has seized the political imagination across our broken land. Let us call it “mayoralphilia,” a newfound faith in the office’s redemptive powers that would have made “Big Bill” Thompson, who treated the city of Chicago as his personal fiefdom, break out in belly laughs. It can be detected in a rash of recent books, including Bruce Katz and Jennifer Bradley’s The Metropolitan Revolution. And it has kindled unlikely mayoral ambitions, as when Rahm Emanuel ditched Washington for a post as hizzoner of Chicago and when billionaire Michael Bloomberg—who had the means to do whatever he wanted—lunged at an unprecedented third term as boss of New York City. Then there’s Thomas Friedman—bellwether of neoliberal groupthink—declaring flatly in a recent New York Times column, “I Want to Be a Mayor.” Benjamin Barber’s If Mayors Ruled the World: Dysfunctional Nations, Rising Cities is perhaps the most giddy among the growing pile of briefs on the subject."

USA TODAY

So how did well-known heckler and war protester Medea Benjamin -- leader of the activist group Code Pink -- get into President Obama's counterterrorism speech on Thursday?

With a press pass.

Politico reported that a photographer who stood in line with Benjamin at the National Defense University saw her wearing a bright green pass pass adorned with her original name, Susan Benjamin.

Security officials eventually escorted Benjamin from the hall after she continually yelled at Obama in protest over drones and the terrorism prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

The Atlantic recited Benjamin's history of heckling: ""She's been seen and heard at many big political events over the last year: at CIA chief John Brennan's confirmation hearing, the NRA's Wayne LaPierre's press conference, the Republican National Convention."" It quoted a ""Senate source"" as saying she also used the media pass trick to get into one of its events.

In statement, the National Defense University confirmed Benjamin's strategy:

""The individual who continued to attempt to interrupt the President's speech at the National Defense University was given access via the list of media attendees expected.

""When it was apparent this individual would not be deterred by the President's effort to address her concerns, officials from the National Defense University staff and Base Police asked her to leave and escorted her from the venue. She has been questioned by Join Base Myer-Henderson Hall police.

""This speech was not open to the general public. Attendance for non-media was limited to invited guests from the National Defense University faculty, staff, and student body, along with those invited by the White House."""

Congress allows tax breaks to lapse almost every year and eventually retroactively renews them

Trade groups and tax experts say this makes it hard for businesses and individuals to plan for the future

While some of these tax breaks are big ones%2C others are more obscure

WASHINGTON (AP) — In an almost annual ritual, Congress is letting a package of 55 popular tax breaks expire at the end of the year, creating uncertainty — once again — for millions of individuals and businesses.

Lawmakers let these tax breaks lapse almost every year, even though they save businesses and individuals billions of dollars. And almost every year, Congress eventually renews them, retroactively, so taxpayers can claim them by the time they file their tax returns.

No harm, no foul, right? After all, taxpayers filing returns in the spring won't be hurt because the tax breaks were in effect for 2013. Taxpayers won't be hit until 2015, when they file tax returns for next year.

Not so far. Trade groups and tax experts complain that Congress is making it impossible for businesses and individuals to plan for the future. What if lawmakers don't renew the tax break you depend on? Or what if they change it and you're no longer eligible?

""It's a totally ridiculous way to run our tax system,"" said Rachelle Bernstein, vice president and tax counsel for the National Retail Federation. ""It's impossible to plan when every year this happens, but yet business has gotten used to that.""

Some of the tax breaks are big, including billions in credits for companies that invest in research and development, generous exemptions for financial institutions doing business overseas, and several breaks that let businesses write off capital investments faster.

Others are more obscure, the benefits targeted to film producers, race track owners, makers of electric motorcycles and teachers who buy classroom supplies with their own money.

There are tax rebates to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands from a tax on rum imported into the United States, and a credit for expenses related to railroad track maintenance.

A deduction for state and local sales taxes benefits people who live in the nine states without state income taxes. Smaller tax breaks benefit college students and commuters who use public transportation.

A series of tax breaks promote renewable energy, including a credit for power companies that produce electricity with windmills.

The annual practice of letting these tax breaks expire is a symptom a divided, dysfunctional Congress that struggles to pass routine legislation, said Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, a senior Democrat on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee.

""It's not fair, it's very hard, it's very difficult for a business person, a company, to plan, not just for the short term but to do long-term planning,"" Lewis said. ""It's shameful.""

With Congress on vacation until January, there is no chance the tax breaks will be renewed before they expire. And there is plenty of precedent for Congress to let them expire for months without addressing them. Most recently, they expired at the end of 2011, and Congress didn't renew them for the entire year, waiting until New Year's Day 2013 — just in time for taxpayers to claim them on their 2012 returns.

But Congress only renewed the package though the end of 2013.

Why such a short extension? Washington accounting is partly to blame. The two-year extension Congress passed in January cost $76 billion in reduced revenue for the government, according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. Making those tax breaks permanent could add $400 billion or more to the deficit over the next decade.

With budget deficits already high, many in Congress are reluctant to vote for a bill that would add so much red ink. So, they do it slowly, one or two years at time.

""More cynically, some people say, if you just put it in for a year or two, then that keeps the lobbyists having to come back and wine-and-dine the congressmen to get it extended again, and maybe make some campaign contributions,"" said Mark Luscombe, principal tax analyst for CCH, a consulting firm based in Riverwoods, Ill.

This year, the package of tax breaks has been caught up in a debate about overhauling the entire tax code. The two top tax writers in Congress — House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp, R-Mich., and Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont. — have been pushing to simplify the tax code by reducing tax breaks and using the additional revenue to lower overall tax rates.

But their efforts have yet to bear fruit, leaving both tax reform and the package of temporary breaks in limbo. When asked how businesses should prepare, given the uncertainty, Camp said, ""They need to get on board with tax reform, that's what they need to do.""

Further complicating the issue, President Barack Obama has nominated Baucus to become U.S. ambassador to China, meaning he will soon leave the Senate, if he is confirmed by his colleagues.

As the Senate wound down its 2013 session, Democratic leaders made a late push to extend many of the tax breaks by asking Republican colleagues to pass a package on the floor of the Senate without debate or amendments. Republicans objected, saying it wasn't a serious offer, and the effort failed.

So should taxpayers count on these breaks as they plan their budgets for 2014?

""The best thing I would say is, budget accordingly,"" said Jackie Perlman, principle tax research analyst at The Tax Institute at H&R Block. ""As the saying goes, hope for the best but plan for the worst. Then if you get it, great, that's a nice perk. But don't count on it."""

Several states are adding laws on registering%2C licensing%2C insurance%2C DUI for moped riders

As gas prices rise%2C more people are turning to the slow-moving%2C often unregulated two-wheelers

Two-wheelers get great gas mileage but can pose a hazard to riders if auto drivers aren%27t cautious

Several states are moving to tighten regulations on mopeds, slow-moving two-wheelers that are popular for their gas mileage but are often exempt from laws governing vehicle registration, licensing, insurance, helmets and even drunken driving.

Mopeds average 80-100 miles or more per gallon. But in most states, they can have engines no larger than 50cc and usually a maximum speed of about 30 mph. That leaves them vulnerable on roads they share with much faster, heavier automobiles, says Sgt. Kelley Hughes of the South Carolina Highway Patrol.

It's difficult to quantify increases in moped use because owners are not required to register them in all states. The Motorcycle Industry Council, a non-profit industry association, does not track moped sales. However, sales of scooters, which are generally faster, larger and more regulated, rose 7.7% last year over 2011 among 19 manufacturers tracked by the association.

In South Carolina, the number of mopeds has increased sharply over the last few years. So have moped road deaths: The state saw a 54% increase in moped fatalities last year, from 24 in 2011 to 37 in 2012, he says. Higher gas prices and a spike in drunken driving convictions are fueling the trend in the Palmetto State. Currently, police there can't cite moped operators for drunken driving, and a driver whose license has been suspended for a first-time DUI can get a license for a moped.

""With gas prices once again on the rise, mopeds will likely increase in popularity,"" says Jonathan Adkins of the Governors Highway Safety Association. ""Mopeds … are hard to see, particularly at night. The small lights tend not to be very bright. Riders are confused whether helmet laws apply and assume they don't.""

One major risk: Because mopeds move so slowly, automobile drivers approaching them often don't realize how quickly they are closing in, especially at night.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/21/senate-filibuster-reform_n_4316325.html,2013-11-21 00:00:00,"['Former Washington Bureau Chief', 'Senior Congressional Reporter']",Senate Votes For Nuclear Option,"WASHINGTON -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) pulled the trigger Thursday, deploying a parliamentary procedure dubbed the ""nuclear option"" to change Senate rules to pass most executive and judicial nominees by a simple majority vote.

The Senate voted 52 to 48 for the move, with just three Democrats declining to go along with the rarely used maneuver.

From now until the Senate passes a new rule, executive branch nominees and judges nominated for all courts except the Supreme Court will be able to pass off the floor and take their seats on the bench with the approval of a simple majority of senators. They will no longer have to jump the traditional hurdle of 60 votes, which has increasingly proven a barrier to confirmation during the Obama administration.

Reid opened debate in the morning by saying that it has become ""so, so very obvious"" that the Senate is broken and in need of rules reform. He rolled through a series of statistics intended to demonstrate that the level of obstruction under President Barack Obama outpaced any historical precedent.

Half the nominees filibustered in the history of the United States were blocked by Republicans during the Obama administration; of 23 district court nominees filibustered in U.S. history, 20 were Obama's nominees; and even judges that have broad bipartisan support have had to wait nearly 100 days longer, on average, than President George W. Bush's nominees.

""It's time to change before this institution becomes obsolete,"" Reid said, before citing scripture -- ""One must not break his word"" -- in accusing Minority Leader McConnell (R-Ky.) of breaking his promise to work in a more bipartisan fashion.

McConnell responded to Reid by changing the subject to the Affordable Care Act and accusing Democrats of trying to distract Americans from the law's troubled rollout. Getting around to fidelity, McConnell noted that Reid had said in July that ""we're not touching judges,"" yet he was now choosing to do so. Reid casually brushed off his suit coat and sat down.

McConnell compared the alleged duplicity to another Democratic piece of rhetoric. ""If you like the rules of the Senate, you can keep them,"" he quipped, as the GOP side laughed heartily, which encouraged a pleased McConnell to turn directly to his colleagues and repeat the joke.

He then turned to the Democratic side and said he understood why inexperienced young members who'd never been in the minority might want to change the rules. ""The rest of you guys in the conference should know better,"" he said.

Obstruction, McConnell said, began with the Democrats when they decided to filibuster Circuit Court nominees under Bush. ""They made it up. They started it,"" he said, arguing that Republicans were only following their lead. His argument, though, raises the question of why eliminating the filibuster on such judges, if it was never used before 2000, should be seen as an historic development in the first place.

""Stop trying to jam us,"" McConnell said, warning that it would come back to haunt them. ""You may regret it a lot sooner than you think.""

Normally rules changes in the Senate need 67 votes, but the majority can challenge an existing rule, and if the presiding senator rules against the challenge, the majority can then ask for a vote on the chair's ruling. If a simple majority votes to overrule the chair, it sets a new precedent.

Sens. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) broke with their party and joined Republicans in opposing the move. Pryor is in an uphill reelection contest, which may explain his vote, but Sens. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) and Mark Begich (D-Alaska), who are also top GOP targets in 2014, backed the rules change.

Levin, a Senate traditionalist, has long been the most outspoken opponent of rules reform, and led a successful effort to stymie the movement earlier this year. Manchin, meanwhile, has great reverence for the late Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), a fierce champion of Senate tradition, likely explaining his vote. (Byrd did make several attempts to change the rules himself when he served as majority leader.)

Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), who has long been skeptical of changing the rules, cast a critical vote very late in the process supporting the move. That left Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), a recent convert to reform, to cast the 51st vote, with Reid casting the 52nd.

The move marks a significant win for the newer crop of Democrats -- like Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, the lead proponent of going nuclear -- who have grown increasingly frustrated as McConnell expertly employed parliamentary procedures to stall Democratic nominees and initiatives. Sens. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Tom Udall (D-N.M.) have also been longtime champions of filibuster reform, with Harkin's effort dating back more than two decades.

Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who chaired the Judiciary Committee back when it was Democrats trying to stall Bush's nominees, echoed McConnell, suggesting newer Democrats such as Merkley, who have never been in the minority, were not taking the long view.

""They're -- I want to say this the right way -- they're rustling their inexperienced feathers,"" Hatch said, calling the historic move a ""charade just to try and get off Obamacare.""

""It's raw power that they're exercising, that, like I say, is a very dangerous thing for them to do,"" Hatch said. ""They're going to rue the day they do it.""

But Merkley disagreed, arguing the reform is ""about clearing the decks of the Senate so we can actually spend time on legislation, we can actually address the cost of college, actually have job-creation bills on the floor, that we can address issues related to retirement security.""

""I feel great,"" Merkley said. ""Since I came here in 2009, I've been absolutely appalled by the dysfunction of this body."""

Fwd.us told The Huffington Post that a second funder also had decided to withdraw. Several media outlets have reported that David Sacks, founder of the business networking site Yammer and a former colleague of Musk's, had dropped off the list of the group's supporters.

Zuckerberg started Fwd.us to press for comprehensive immigration reform. But the group has been heavily criticized by some immigration reform supporters in recent weeks for its television ad campaign praising lawmakers for backing projects like the Keystone XL pipeline and drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Fwd.us has argued that the ads were meant to give home district support to lawmakers backing immigration reform.

In a statement to AllThingsD on Friday, Musk, the founder of the electric carmaker Tesla Motors, made clear he was unhappy with the pro-oil ads.

“I agreed to support Fwd.us because there is a genuine need to reform immigration,"" Musk said. ""However, this should not be done at the expense of other important causes. I have spent a lot of time fighting far larger lobbying organizations in D.C. and believe that the right way to win on a cause is to argue the merits of that cause. This statement may surprise some people, but my experience is that most (not all) politicians and their staffs want to do the right thing and eventually do.”

Fwd.us retains the backing of other Silicon Valley heavyweights, including Bill Gates.

The withdrawal of Musk and Sacks comes just days after a coalition of progressive groups announced that they were temporarily pulling all their ads from Facebook in protest.

“Leaders in the technology community have every right to talk about how immigration reform will benefit their businesses,"" former Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) said in a statement on Tuesday. ""But instead, Fwd.us has chosen a strategy that’s condescending to voters and counterproductive to the cause of reform.""

The seven-figure Fwd.us ad campaign ran for a week in seven states, but it is no longer on the air.

Fwd.us spokeswoman Kate Hansen told HuffPost, ""We recognize that not everyone will always agree with or be pleased by our strategy -- and we're grateful for the continued support of our dedicated founders and major contributors. Fwd.us remains totally committed to supporting a bipartisan policy agenda that will boost the knowledge economy, including comprehensive immigration reform.""

As The Huffington Post reported in February, Musk is a significant -- but not top-tier -- donor to Democrats. He also contributes to Republicans."

""We will pledge to oppose, all eight of us, provisions that would destroy the fragile agreement that we have,"" Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a member of the group, told reporters. ""But we're certainly open to amendments, we're certainly willing and glad to have votes on them. This is the beginning of the process, not the end.""

The so-called gang of eight -- McCain, Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) -- will release the result of its months-long effort, the full text of immigrant reform legislation, by the end of the day Tuesday.

Senators will begin to consider the bill during Judiciary Committee hearings on Friday and Monday, and members of the gang of eight have said they want to give their fellow lawmakers plenty of time to consider the bill and offer suggestions to improve it. But they also know their own agreement was hard won, and any tweaks could damage the balance.

""I want to make sure that we do this the right way, and what we have now is a starting point,"" Rubio told reporters. ""From that point, I encourage my other 92 colleagues to get involved and to offer ideas. I hope sincerely that those that have problems with it don't just offer objections but offer solutions.""

There are a number of compromises in the bill, with perhaps the most important over the question of border security and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. The bill would allow undocumented immigrants to gain legal status and eventual citizenship, but that pathway is tied to specific border triggers meant to prevent future unauthorized immigration. This requirement is aimed to reassure lawmakers that the legislation won't be a repeat of a 1986 bill under President Ronald Reagan that was followed by an increase in the number of undocumented immigrants.

Legalization under the bill would begin with a new ""registered provisional immigrant status,"" that would allow some undocumented immigrants who entered the U.S. before 2012 to stay and work without federal benefits, after a $500 fine and criminal background check. Then nothing can move forward until after certain ""triggers"" that guarantee a plan for and then the implementation of increased border security measures. The bill would put $3 billion toward that effort, and another $1.5 billion toward fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border. If the triggers are met, immigrants would be able to apply for lawful permanent status 10 years after beginning the process, then eventually citizenship.

There are other controversial provisions as well. The bill would mandate E-Verify, an already existing system to check whether potential employees are eligible to work in the United States. It would eliminate the diversity visa lottery, which allows up to 55,000 people each year to immigrate to the U.S. without work or family ties. While the current legal immigration system places emphasis on family visas, the bill would shift to give half of all visas based on merit, USA Today reported.

For now, senators have mostly remained quiet on what amendments they plan to offer, particularly before the full text is released. Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) hasn't yet made a decision, but may offer amendments to improve due process in immigration if in his view the bill doesn't adequately address the matter.

""They're all written,"" Coons spokesman Ian Koski said of the possible amendments. ""It's just a matter of seeing the final legislation and determining which are necessary.""

Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) has previously said he will push for same-sex couples to be included in the bill, but as of Tuesday afternoon had not seen the final text of the bill to make a decision on amendments, his spokeswoman said. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who opposes mandating an employment verification system on civil liberty grounds, said he hadn't seen enough of the bill to know whether he'd oppose such provisions.

Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who opposes key parts of the bill such as a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, said he hasn't yet determined whether he'll try to amend the bill or just attempt to block it. He told reporters he thinks it's ""very possible"" it will fail, and that his concern about the lack of hearings isn't assuaged by the two planned so far, since they're planned for days when some senators will be out of town.

""That gives the indication we're going through the motion of hearings,"" Sessions said. ""And besides, it does appear that the core members of the gang of eight have sort of an agreement that they'll defend all the key provisions of the bill and vote against any amendment. So I don't know how valuable a hearing is if they all agree to stick together.""

The White House seems prepared to put its weight into helping the bill pass, which McCain said earlier would be ""very important, particularly with the Democrats.""

After meeting with McCain and Schumer, President Barack Obama said in a statement Tuesday the legislation does not include everything he wanted, but he will push for reform.

""This bill is clearly a compromise, and no one will get everything they wanted, including me,"" Obama said. ""But it is largely consistent with the principles that I have repeatedly laid out for comprehensive reform. ... I urge the Senate to quickly move this bill forward and, as I told Senators Schumer and McCain, I stand willing to do whatever it takes to make sure that comprehensive immigration reform becomes a reality as soon as possible.""

Even if the bill passes the Senate, it could be a non-starter in the House, where lawmakers are working on their own compromise for immigration reform. When asked whether he could imagine the House picking up the Senate's bill, Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho), one of those working on a deal, said they're more likely to do their own.

""The scenario would be assuming the Senate passes it, and I'm not sure the Senate can pass it,"" Labrador said. ""We'll just have to see what they do, we're going to have our own regular order, our own process."""

http://news.yahoo.com/why-harry-reid-sidelined-joe-biden-185717368--politics.html,,[],Why Harry Reid Was Sidelined for Joe Biden,"The critical conversation between the offices of Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell came early Sunday afternoon, about 36 hours before Congress was set to teeter over the fiscal cliff.

Reid, the majority leader, had been negotiating and trading ideas with McConnell, his minority counterpart, since Friday evening. But the soft-spoken Nevada Democrat drew a bold line in the sand midday Sunday: He had no more counteroffers to give.

Suddenly and irreversibly, the talks veered into a new direction. Within minutes, the Kentucky Republican was dialing up Vice President Joe Biden, elevating his old colleague to the Democrats' new negotiator-in-chief. It was the fateful decision that put the Senate and White House on the pathway to the deal eventually approved by the Senate and the House, ending weeks of drama over the fiscal cliff. It also left Reid standing on the sideline stewing.

“We know that when McConnell has hit a wall with Reid, he calls Joe Biden to get some more candy,” said a senior Senate Democratic aide, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the vice president.

It was a good-cop, bad-cop routine that Reid wanted no part of. “We thought it was unnecessary,” the aide said of Biden’s involvement. “We had a lot of leverage.”

Reid and McConnell had been bargaining about how to avert the cliff ever since a White House summit on Friday, when they agreed to take charge of negotiating an accord. Talks between President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner had collapsed by then. The president and congressional leaders had agreed that a last-minute compromise, if there was to be one, had to be forged in the Senate.

The opening Senate GOP offer from McConnell to Reid came at 9:30 p.m. on Friday night, only hours after the White House meeting, according to congressional officials with knowledge of the negotiations.

Reid’s team sent back its first counteroffer at around 3 p.m. on Saturday. A flurry of activity followed as McConnell was cloistered in his office on Capitol Hill. Aides shuttled between the leaders’ offices, as a GOP counterproposal was drafted by 4 p.m. A Democratic reply to that arrived only an hour and a half later, according to the sources. At 7:10 p.m. on Saturday, McConnell said he sent yet another offer to Reid and the Democrats.

Story continues

Then, radio silence.

Reid’s office had suggested that another counteroffer would come in the morning, but the clock ticked to afternoon without one.Instead, Reid’s office told McConnell’s at about 1 p.m. that the majority leader was done with the back and forth.“At this stage, we are not able to make a counteroffer,” Reid announced soon after on the Senate floor.

Reid was playing hardball. With polls showing that the public was far more likely to blame congressional Republicans than the president if the nation jumped off the fiscal cliff – and billions in automatic tax hikes and spending cuts went into effect – Reid rightfully knew that McConnell wanted a deal – and badly.

Reid felt that he’d compromised enough, according to a senior Senate Democratic aide with knowledge of the discussions and the senator’s thinking. Besides, if no accord was reached, Obama and Reid had said they would push the president’s plan to stop tax hikes for those earning below $250,000 and extend unemployment insurance to the floor. Republicans could block that and be responsible for everyone’s taxes spiking at their own peril.

About the same time on Sunday, a story popped about a “major setback” in talks – that McConnell had demanded that a reduction in the Social Security benefits formula, known as “chained CPI,” be included in a deal. True, that had been part of the 7 p.m. Saturday GOP offer. But Reid was now using it as political cover to withdraw from talks. “We are not going to have any Social Security cuts. At this stage, that just doesn't seem appropriate,” the Democratic leader announced later Sunday on the floor.

McConnell’s negotiating options with Reid had narrowed. He could either let Congress veer off the cliff, take Reid’s latest offer, or accept the president’s tax-hike package for those earning more than $250,000. Instead, McConnell sought a familiar and friendlier face across the negotiating table – his old colleague Joe Biden. He called and left a message to open talks with the vice president.

“We have yet to receive a response to our good-faith offer. I am concerned about the lack of urgency here. I think we all know we are running out of time,” McConnell said on Sunday of his talks with Reid. Then he revealed on the floor that he’d called Biden “to see if he could help jump-start the negotiations on his side.”

“I need a dance partner,” McConnell said.

Those words appeared to be a swipe at Reid, echoing Reid’s comments the day after the election when he had said, “It's better to dance than to fight. It's better to work together.” McConnell was saying that Reid wasn’t willing to dance, after all.

In his negotiating two-step, McConnell had found a willing partner in Biden. The call to Biden set off a fresh round of offers, counteroffers, and concessions. They spoke as late as 12:45 a.m. on Monday, retreated for a few hours of sleep, before another call that began before 7 a.m. Within about 24 hours, Biden and McConnell had settled on what amounted to the framework for an agreement – although they never engaged face to face.

At 9:15 p.m. on New Year’s Eve, Biden trekked to the Hill to huddle with Senate Democrats to pitch the compromise he had reached with McConnell. The plan would make permanent the Bush tax cuts for those earning less than $450,000, expand certain tax credits for low-income Americans, set the estate tax at 40 percent, and revise the Alternative Minimum Tax.

Reid didn’t plan to do the heavy lifting of selling the deal that he didn’t cut. That job was left to Biden. “I suspect he’s doing most of the talking,” Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson said of the vice president as the meeting was underway.

The final package, which cleared the Senate in the early hours of 2013, also included concessions that Reid had refused, including a delay of the automatic cuts, known as the sequester, for only two months instead of at least a year.

“We gave too much away,” the Senate Democratic aide said of the accord. It passed in an 89-8 landslide, including Reid’s aye vote, anyway.

For Biden, it was a triumphant moment. It was his latest major compromise crafted with McConnell, following the two-year extension of the Bush tax cuts in 2010 and the debt-limit deal in the summer of 2011. Biden has earned the nickname the “McConnell whisperer” across Washington.

“McConnell is far more comfortable cutting deals with the vice president than he is with Senator Reid,” said Jim Manley, a former top Reid adviser.

Biden is considered a possible 2016 presidential candidate, and the episode amounted to a presidential moment: He was called to swoop in at the last minute to save taxes from rising on nearly all Americans, and he succeeded. “No doubt about it, this could be very helpful to him if he decides to run in 2016,” Manley said.

But just beneath the surface, there is some quiet grumbling among some Senate Democrats and the Left that Biden was as interested in striking a deal as its details.

Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, one of the eight no votes, has been one of the few to speak out publicly against the concessions that Democrats made to strike a compromise. He complained that the administration traded permanent GOP-friendly tax policy– the extension of tax rates for those below $450,000 – for temporary Democratic priorities. “In essence, this agreement locks in a tax structure that is grossly unfair to middle-class Americans,” Harkin said in a statement after the vote.

But with Obama’s and Biden’s imprimatur, it passed the Senate with ease. Asked on New Year’s Eve what he was telling Democratic senators to win their support, Biden told reporters, “I said, ‘This is Joe Biden, and I’m your buddy.’ ” He was back the next morning doing the same with House Democrats."

The ruling against the Maricopa County sheriff came in response to a class-action lawsuit brought by Hispanic drivers that tested whether police can target illegal immigrants without racially profiling U.S. citizens and legal residents of Hispanic origin.

U.S. District Court Judge Murray Snow ruled that the sheriff's policies violated the drivers' constitutional rights and ordered Arpaio's office to cease using race or ancestry as a grounds to stop, detain or hold occupants of vehicles - some of them in crime sweeps dubbed ""saturation patrols.""

""The great weight of the evidence is that all types of saturation patrols at issue in this case incorporated race as a consideration into their operations,"" Snow said in a written ruling.

He added that race had factored into which vehicles the deputies decided to stop, and into who they decided to investigate for immigration violations.

The lawsuit contended that Arpaio, who styles himself ""America's toughest sheriff,"" and his officers violated the constitutional rights of both U.S. citizens and legal immigrants alike in their zeal to crack down on people they believe to be in the country illegally.

The ruling came days after a U.S. Senate panel approved a landmark comprehensive immigration legislation that would usher in the biggest changes in immigration policy in a generation if passed by Congress.

The bill would put 11 million immigrants without legal status on a 13-year path to citizenship while further strengthening security along the porous southwestern border with Mexico.

Arpaio declined comment on the ruling. A sheriff's spokesman referred a request for comment to attorney Tim Casey, who said he was reading the ruling and had no immediate comment.

'ILLEGAL AND PLAIN UN-AMERICAN'

Cecillia Wang, director of the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants' Rights Project and plaintiffs' counsel, called the judge's ruling ""an important victory that will resound far beyond Maricopa County.""

""Singling people out for traffic stops and detentions simply because they're Latino is illegal and just plain un-American,"" Wang said after the ruling was made public.

""Let this be a warning to anyone who hides behind a badge to wage their own private campaign against Latinos or immigrants that there is no exception in the Constitution for violating people's rights in immigration enforcement.""

During testimony in the non-jury trial last year, Arpaio said he was against racial profiling and denied his office arrested people because of the color of their skin.

The sheriff, who won re-election to a sixth term in November, has been a lightning rod for controversy over his aggressive enforcement of immigration laws in the state, which borders Mexico, as well as an investigation into the validity of President Barack Obama's U.S. birth certificate.

The lawsuit was brought against Arpaio and his office on behalf of five Hispanic drivers who said they had been stopped by deputies because of their ethnicity.

The plaintiffs, which include the Somos America immigrants' rights coalition and all Latino drivers stopped by the sheriff's office since 2007, were seeking corrective action but not monetary damages.

Arpaio has been the subject of other probes and lawsuits. In August, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona said it had closed a criminal investigation into accusations of financial misconduct by Arpaio, and it declined to bring charges.

A separate U.S. Justice Department investigation and lawsuit relating to accusations of civil rights abuses by Arpaio's office is ongoing.

Arizona has been at the heart of a bitter national debate over immigration since Republican Governor Jan Brewer signed a 2010 crackdown on illegal immigration.

The federal government challenged the crackdown in court and said the U.S. Constitution gives it sole authority over immigration policy. The U.S. Supreme Court, however, has allowed to stand the part of the law permitting police to question people they stop about their immigration status.

Snow scheduled a hearing in the case for June 14 at 9:30 a.m. at the Sandra Day O'Connor U.S. Federal Courthouse in Phoenix. (Reporting by Tim Gaynor and David Schwartz; Editing by Cynthia Johnston, Eric Walsh, Toni Reinhold)"

Chụp lại hình ảnh, Lon Snowden (bên phải) và luật sư của ông đã nói chuyện với các nhà báo

Luật sư cho hay ông Lon Snowden, cha của Edward Snowden, đã nhận được visa và sẽ sớm đi Nga thăm con trai.

Ông Snowden cha nói với kênh truyền thông ABC của Mỹ rằng ông mong muốn con mình trở về Mỹ với điều kiện hệ thống pháp lý được bảo đảm công minh trong trường hợp này.

Ông nói thêm rằng con trai ông ""đã nói lên sự thật"" và hy sinh nhiều thứ.

Edward Snowden đã được Nga cho tỵ nạn mặc dù Mỹ yêu cầu dẫn độ ông về nước để xử lý.

Lon Snowden đã xuất hiện với luật sư của ông là Bruce Fein trên kênh ABC.

Luật sư Fein nói về kế hoạch đi Moscow: ""Chúng tôi đã có visa, đã có ngày tháng nhưng chúng tôi không muốn tiết lộ vì sợ bị săn đuổi"".

Edward Snowden tới Moscow ngày 23/6 từ Hong Kong, sau khi rò rỉ thông tin về chương trình do thám mật của Mỹ cho báo chí.

Sau đó ông đã trải qua hơn 5 tuần ở khu quá cảnh sân bay Sheremetyevo, Moscow. Ông rời sân bay hồi tuần trước sau khi được Nga cho quy chế tỵ nạn tạm thời.

Luật sư Fein cho hay đã nói chuyện với luật sư Nga của Edward Snowden, Anatoly Kucherena, và được biết là ông Snowden vẫn an toàn.

""Tất nhiên anh ấy mệt mỏi. Anh ấy cần một thời gian để hồi phục và suy nghĩ xem anh ấy muốn làm gì.""

Xét xử công minh

Ông Lon Snowden thì nói rằng với tư cách một người cha, ông muốn con mình được về nhà, nhưng lo ngại liệu sẽ có một phiên tòa công minh hay không.

Ông nói: ""Vào thời điểm này, khi mà xem xét các phát biểu mà lãnh đạo chúng ta đưa ra... thì thấy là họ hoàn toàn vô trách nhiệm"".

Vụ Snowden đã gây ra hậu quả ngoại giao khá nặng nề, và Hoa Kỳ đã hủy cuộc gặp thượng đỉnh với Nga mà theo dự tính sẽ diễn ra vào tháng Chín này.

Quyết định của Nga cho Snowden tỵ nạn bị cho là đã làm tổn hại quan hệ vốn đã căng thẳng giữa hai bên.

Tuy nhiên, giới ngoại giao hai nước vẫn gặp nhau hôm thứ Sáu tuần trước để thảo luận một số vấn đề khác.

Edward Snowden là cựu nhân viên một công ty làm thầu cho Cơ quan An ninh Quốc gia Mỹ (NSA), và ông cũng từng làm việc cho CIA.

Hồi tháng Sáu, ông rò rỉ thông tin cho các báo Guardian và Washington Post về chương trình thu thập dữ liệu các cuộc gọi điện thoại và email của NSA."

The findings are part of a 19-month investigation by the nonprofit group on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s “Communities Putting Prevention to Work Program.”

Beyond potentially breaking federal law, the communities also appear to have violated CDC guidelines, according to the 36-page report titled “How the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s … Grant Program Became a Front for Lobbying, Government Propaganda and Cronyism.”

Congressional hearings in 2011 and follow-up letters to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius addressed a potential violation in a South Carolina community.

However, the April 16 report found seven other potential violations and states the CDC’s one recorded violation “was worse than disclosed.”

The CDC could not respond Sunday to a request for comment.

The group identifies five of the states in which the violations allegedly occurred -- Arizona, Alabama, Florida, Georgia and California.

The findings are based on such information as internal emails, meeting notes and CDC grant applications that “blatantly show systemic corruption and use of taxpayer dollars for lobbying,” according to the report.

In one example, California’s Santa Clara County Public Health Department allegedly used taxpayer money to hire a tobacco-retail-license coordinator to lobby for a workplace smoking ordinance and also used program funds to support a state-wide tobacco tax increase.

In the South Carolina case, the CDC found the state violated rules by using program money to plan a press conference to lobby a city council to support a pending, clean-indoor-air ordinance with no exemptions.

The group is asking for further investigation of the program and says the request is timely, considering the scheduled release of $2 billion annually, starting in 2015, for a similar program under President Obama’s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act."

In his deposition, Gray who has a history of abusing Alexander, admitted it, stated he intended to hurt her had she not fired the warning shot, and said she did the right thing. He also said Alexander did not aim he gun at him. Gray then changed his story once the case went to trial. He walked out a free man - Marissa Alexander, the battered wife, received 20 years. The Florida Stand Your Ground Law did not work for Alexander because she fired a warning shot. Had she shot and killed Rico Gray that day, she would have most likely served no time at all.

My source who was in the courtroom today, reported new evidence has been brought forth - a text message of Rico Gray asking Marissa to come over for sex while there was an order of protection. Rico Gray claims Marissa should not be let out on bond because he is afraid of Marissa; he fears/feared for his life. Does asking her for sex sound like someone who feared for his life?

“I was in a rage. I called her a whore and bitch and . . . I told her, you know, I used to always tell her that, if I can’t have you, nobody going to have you. It was not the first time of ever saying it to her.”~ Rico Gray in his deposition on November 22, 2010.

Marissa Alexander's case has been highly publicized from the start, and the Free Marissa Now campaign has grown throughout social media. The case was catapulted into even more national spotlight, following the George Zimmerman case. In July 2013, Zimmerman was set free after killing teenager, Trayvon Martin, even though Zimmerman was the aggressor. Ironically, the same state attorney that failed to successfully prosecute George Zimmerman, is the same attorney that sent Marissa Alexander to prison. State Attorney Angela Corey 'twisted the knife' by refusing to drop Alexander's case,even after it was overturned in September.

Unless something changes, it doesn't look as though Marissa Alexander and her three children will be having happy holidays, as she awaits a new bail hearing, and then a whole new trial in March 2014. Supposedly the next trial will be different. This time, Florida courts say the burden of proof will be placed upon them rather than Marissa Alexander. Isn't that how it's supposed to work, Florida?

For the month of December, two-thirds of the Fox News primetime lineup came in second to MSNBC (in the critical 25-54 year old demographic). The Rachel Maddow Show's monthly average came in 4% above the formidable Fox fixture, Sean Hannity. Lawrence O'Donnell had an even better advantage of 11% over his weaker competition, Greta Van Susteren.

This was a stark difference from last year when Hannity comfortably led Maddow by 46% and Van Susteren outpaced O'Donnell by the same amount. Those leads have now completely evaporated. Only Bill O'Reilly has managed to keep his fat head above water, although his 69% December 2011 lead over Ed Schultz was cut nearly in half in 2012 to 40%.

December 2012 was an affirmation of the superior performance MSNBC has shown since the election in November. Maddow and O'Donnell have consistently defeated Hannity and Van Susteren since President Obama did the same thing to Mitt Romney. This can no longer be explained away by Fox defenders as mere depression on the part of conservative viewers who tuned out after an electoral spanking. That excuse may have made sense for a week or two, but not a full two months later with high profile news events like the ""fiscal cliff,"" new cabinet appointments, Benghazi hearings, the Petraeus scandal, and the Newtown school shooting dominating news coverage.

Happy New Year:

Fox may have to get used to coming in second, or maybe even third if CNN's new president, Jeff Zucker, is able to get that network out of idle. And if MSNBC is smart they will start to firm up their schedule with new shows and dynamic personalities. For instance, they should quickly axe the Hardball rerun at 7:00pm, perhaps moving Schultz to that time slot. Then put in his place a leadin to Maddow that takes advantage of the smart brand of analysis and commentary that she and O'Donnell represent. That would tie up their primetime package and boost the network's reputation generally, which would help draw viewers to other dayparts.

Unsolicited programming advice for MSNBC:

Poach comedian/pundit John Fugelsang from Current TV and pair him up with MSNBC contributor Joy-Ann Reid for a combo news and entertainment hybrid to launch the evening block. A news program that intelligently presents serious issues with a sense of humor could be a compelling option that would ease their audience into a deeper dialog as the night progresses."

President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama visit site of immigration fast

Other administration officials have previously visited

President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama visited Friday with a group of protesters who are fasting in an effort to pressure Congress to pass an immigration bill.

The Obamas praised organizers Eliseo Medina and Dae Joong Yoon and thanked ""all of the fasters for their sacrifice and dedication, and told them that the country is behind them on immigration reform,"" according to a White House statement.

Obama's comments were inaudible to a pool of reporters.

The president said ""it is not a question of whether immigration reform will pass, but how soon,"" according to a White House statement. ""He said that the only thing standing in the way is politics, and it is the commitment to change from advocates like these brave fasters that will help pressure the House to finally act.""

The Obamas spoke for about a half-hour with ""individuals taking part in Fast for Families on the National Mall and offer their support for those who are fasting on behalf of immigration reform,"" according to an earlier White House statement.

The Democratic-run Senate passed an immigration bill earlier this year. The Republican-run House has not taken up the issue. Some Republicans object to a proposed pathway to citizenship for people who are already in the United States illegally, calling it amnesty for lawbreakers.

Rudy Lopez, who has been fasting for nine days, said demonstrators appreciated the president's visit.

""He shared his support and his commitment to keep pushing this (immigration bill) forward,"" said Lopez, a senior organizer with a group called the Fair Immigration Reform Movement. ""He also expressed his concern for our physical health.""

Lopez said he is doing fine, and ""we have good medical care.""

Vice President Biden has previously visited the site of the immigration fast, as have other top administration officials.

Earlier this week, Mrs. Obama tweeted out her support, saying: ""As families begin to gather for Thanksgiving, I'm thinking of the brave #Fast4Families immigration reform advocates. We're with you. -mo.""

At an immigration speech Friday in San Francisco, Obama said, ""Right now, I'm seeing brave advocates who have been fasting for two weeks in the shadow of the Capitol, sacrificing themselves in an effort to get Congress to act.""

The White House said that, in addition to Biden, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, Secretary of Labor Tom Perez, Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, Director of the Domestic Policy Council Cecilia Muñoz and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett have also visited the Fast for Families site in recent weeks.

Said the statement: ""Since Nov. 12, immigration activists comprising Fast for Families have abstained from all food except water and are calling for the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives to take up action on comprehensive immigration reform."""

Bush Presidential Library, President Obama and former President Clinton took to the podium to praise Bush – and in the process, stump for their version of immigration reform. Trying to leverage Republicans into handing over their principles by suddenly singing odes to the president he labeled the root of all evil, President Obama gushed over Bush “reaching across the aisle to unlikely allies like Ted Kennedy” with regard to his immigration reform effort.

He continued: “Seven years ago, President Bush restarted an important conversation by speaking with the American people about our history as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. And even though comprehensive immigration reform has taken a little longer than any of us expected, I am hopeful that this year, with the help of Speaker Boehner and some of the Senators and members of Congress who are here today, that we bring it home.”

By using President Bush as a model of executive policy leadership, Obama betrayed what conservatives have known all along: on a vast variety of issues, Bush was closer to Obama’s position than to the conservative position.

But Obama wasn’t the only occupant of the Oval Office to spontaneously rediscover the greatness of a president so detested by the left that professional Bush-hater Michael Moore once sat in the presidential box with another former President Jimmy Carter. President Clinton used his opportunity at the lectern to praise Bush for his push for immigration reform. “I want to thank you for your efforts, when president, to reform our immigration system, and keep America a nation of immigrants, and I hope that Congress will follow President Obama’s efforts to follow the example you’ve set,” he drawled.

The shutdown comes just four days after I reported exclusively about a briefing at Mississippi’s Camp Shelby that labeled the American Family Association as a domestic hate group.

“On several occasions over the past few months, media accounts have highlighted instances of Army instructors supplementing programs of instruction and including information or material that is inaccurate, objectionable and otherwise inconsistent with current Army policy,” Army Sec. John McHugh wrote to military leaders in a memorandum I obtained.

McHugh “directed that Army leaders cease all briefings, command presentations or training on the subject of extremist organizations or activities until that program of instruction and training has been created and disseminated,” Army spokesman Col. David Patterson, Jr., tells me.

[pullquote]

The Chaplain Alliance for Religious Liberty welcomed the news and said it was about time the Secretary of the Army intervened.

“Men and women of faith – who have served the Army faithfully for centuries – have been likened to those who regularly threaten the peace and security of the United States,” said Ron Crews, executive director of the Chaplain Alliance. “It is dishonorable for any U.S. military entity to allow this type of improper characterization.”

The Camp Shelby incident led five congressmen to fire off a letter to the Pentagon expressing their grave concerns.

“This most recent mislabeling of a Christian organization reflects what appears to be a troubling trend of religious intolerance in the military,” Rep. Doug Lamborn wrote in a letter signed by Reps. Tim Huelskamp, Steve Scalise, John Fleming and Joseph Pitts. “We are very troubled.”

The Army issued a statement refuting the claims made and photographed in the briefing after it was reported in my column.

The Camp Shelby briefing was one of a number of incidents on Army bases around the nation where soldiers were instructed that groups like the American Family Association and Family Research Council should be considered domestic hate groups because of their support for traditional marriage.

Last week soldiers at Fort Hood were warned that participating in or donating money to evangelical Christian groups or Tea Party groups could result in military punishment.

And last May an Army Reserve training brief listed Catholics and Evangelical Christians as examples of religious extremism. That incident prompted 34 members of Congress to raise objections.

The Army repeatedly told me the briefings were isolated incidents where instructors used materials that were not approved by the military.

McHugh said the instructors used material that is “inaccurate, objectionable and otherwise inconsistent with current Army policy.”

He referenced recent “high-profile” cases where Army instructors found information online and included it in their presentations.

“The groups identified in the instruction were not ‘extremist’ organizations as that term is defined in Army Regulation,” McHugh wrote in his memorandum.

So where did the Army instructors get their talking points?

“None of these slides were produced by the Army, but by soldiers who included information found during an Internet search,” Patterson told me.

“The Army does not maintain or publish a list of organizations considered extremist; and after a similar incident earlier this year, commanders and other leaders were cautioned that they should not use lists of ‘extremists,’ ‘hate groups,’ ‘radical factions’ or the like compiled by any outside non-governmental groups or organizations for briefings, command presentations, or as a shortcut to determining if a group or activity is considered to be extremist.”

But the Army does provide a list of organizations that do list groups like the AFA and FRC as domestic hate groups – specifically the Southern Poverty Law Center. And the SPLC is featured in the military’s Equal Opportunity Advisor Student Guide.

The Chaplain Alliance uncovered that information through a Freedom of Information Act request. Crews wants the Army to stop using any materials from the SPLC.

“The SPLC has labeled many mainstream religious organizations as hate groups,” Crews said. “Reliance on lists produced by anti-Christian political organizations violates the apolitical stance necessary in the military.”

So to correct the problem, McHugh has directed leaders to create a standardized program of instruction and training.

“Given these recent developments, it is clear that we must act to standardize such programs of instruction and training plans to ensure consistency with Army policy,” McHugh wrote in his memorandum.

He wants the revised policies to be completed by December 13."

But while unsatisfied marrieds browse the site looking to hookup, the man behind the site -- creator Noel Biderman -- has been happily married for nearly 10 years. HuffPost Divorce spoke to Noel and his wife, Amanda -- who's featured on the company's new billboard campaign -- in separate phone conversations to discuss the secret to their relationship success, how Amanda reacted when Noel initially told her about his idea for the site, and why Noel believes cheating actually saves marriages.

Amanda, how did you react when Noel first told you about his plan to create an infidelity dating site? Were you supportive? Resistant?

Amanda: Originally, I wanted to make sure it wasn’t an emotional or personal issue...an emotional or physical thing that he was grappling with. Once I understood that it was a sound business [idea], that there was a market he felt was under-serviced, I was totally behind him.

Noel: We weren’t even married at the time, so she easily could have said, “I think there’s something flawed with this human being.” Instead, she saw the passion in which I wanted to pursue this and she wanted to match that passion. I knew I had a true partner.

Noel, you've said that your website saves marriage and that an affair can serve as a ""marriage preservation device."" Can you talk a little more about that?

Noel: I definitely believe that. For me, I’m a married man now -- 10 years later, two children later, a really good economic success later, and with an extended family I love, I would be a fool if I said sex was the most important thing in my marriage –- it’s not. [But] it's important to me, I’m not a priest and I didn’t sign up for a life of celibacy. If I woke up today in some kind of sexless marriage like so many Americans do, I would be genuinely upset by that. I would try to change it with my partner, but if I couldn’t change it, I don’t know if I would just walk out the door. I believe the social science, I’ve seen it firsthand, how children raised in single-parent households have more trouble with drugs and alcohol, have fewer educational opportunities, and get in trouble with the law. I don’t want to do that to my family and I certainly don’t want to do that because everything else I have going for me is great. I like my lifestyle, so why would I give it all up because the number five or six thing on my list -– my sex life -– is not where it should be?

So yes, if my brother came to me and said I can't take it anymore, I'm either leaving or I'm having an affair, I would encourage him to have an affair first.

Amanda, would you stay in a marriage where you knew your husband was being unfaithful for the sake of keeping your family together?

Amanda: I wouldn’t just walk into divorce. But, I mean, I also wouldn’t deal with a relationship where I knew there were interpersonal relations going on without me. We definitely differ on that point. I get that some people are doing this to fulfill a need and to make themselves more fulfilled and happier. I’m not here to judge those people. Personally, that’s not how I live my life. That’s not how I live my life and how I define my relationship and what I would accept moving forward.

Has running a site like AshleyMadison informed how you behave in your own marriage in any way?

Noel: Ironically, I talk about infidelity more than any man on the planet, so hopefully I can navigate a monogamous relationship more successfully than a lot of people. But even then, I don’t know if I can, but I’m going to try.

Monogamy is a man-made notion –- it’s not in our DNA. It’s not what we’re engineered for. We might think it’s a noble cause and something worth pursuing, but anything against our DNA is something we’re going to struggle with... I’ve seen study after study showing that the longer a couple is together, the more their sex life diminishes. I’ve yet to see any one where it says, “Twenty years later, those two are still hot and heavy” -– it just doesn’t play out that way. We’re working against something... So it's with that knowledge base that I keep coming back to my own marriage in a different way. While we don’t have an open marriage in a sexual sense, we have a very open marriage in the sense that we can challenge and ask a lot of things of one another because we understand how important our marriage is and how often it can become turbulent.

My wife and I have a very honest relationship with each other -- blunt almost. I think getting things off our chests is the approach we took, knowing that it won’t always go our way but at least it’s out there for the other partner to deal with. That’s kind of suited us. We’re very passionate and when things are great, we ride really high. We also have our moments, but we definitely don’t sleep on the issue –- and I think that’s the secret to our success today.

Amanda: I think we’re lucky that his role as CEO of Ashley Madison has helped us understand the pitfalls more than anybody else. I also walked into this marriage open-eyed about the realities of relationships because my parents divorced when I was relatively young. I’ve had to deal with the aftermath of that and it wasn’t a nice divorce... I’m 38 years old and I’m still dealing with aftermath of that. I just always wanted to have a relationship where I never ended it in divorce."

She Joined The Paper In', 'Has Written About Criminal Justice', 'Immigration', 'Gentrification. She Grew Up In Nogales']",L.A. Diocese’s Archbishop Gomez pushes immigration overhaul bill,"As a child, L.A. Archbishop Jose Horacio Gomez traveled back and forth across the border from his home in Monterrey, Mexico, to his uncle’s in San Antonio, Texas. He made the trip so often that he hardly distinguished between Mexico and the United States.

“It was easy to cross in those times,” says Gomez, now 61, who became a citizen in his mid-40s. “I guess my first impression was that people could live in both countries at the same time.”

When he talks about the border, he slips into the Spanish slang of his childhood. He uses migra for U.S. immigration officials and mica for the old-style border-crossing cards he needed to visit his American cousins in Texas.

“I’m an immigrant myself,” he says, squinting behind his rimless glasses as he smiles.

Gomez’s two-year tenure as the leader of the nation’s largest archdiocese has been marked by a decidedly quieter and more cautious style than that of his predecessor, Cardinal Roger Mahony, who was quick to chime in on hot-button issues such as illegal immigration and workers’ rights.

But in recent weeks, as debate over the most comprehensive immigration reform bill in a generation reaches a head, Gomez is taking a firm and public stand.

Advertisement

He has released a book that touches on his experiences as an immigrant and in an impassioned sermon he affirmed his support for the immigration reform bill, which would create a 13-year path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants living in the country without legal status.

From inside and outside the Catholic Church, Gomez’s new public persona is drawing attention. Some who saw Gomez as unwilling to take on issues in the same way Mahony did are now praising Gomez for campaigning on behalf of immigrants. And many church observers see Gomez as trying to use his position as the highest-ranking Latino in the U.S Catholic Church to effect change on a deeply personal issue.

“I’m glad that he has added his voice to this dialogue,” said Jorge-Mario Cabrera of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles. “When he speaks, people will listen.”

But with a topic as nuanced as immigration, Gomez’s stance has also opened him up to criticism. Frank DeMartini, a practicing Catholic who runs a blog called “A Hollywood Republican,” said he interpreted the book as something of a scolding for members of the church who don’t support a path to citizenship for people who are in the country illegally.

“Instead of taking a political stance on it, he made it seem anti-Catholic,” he said.

But Gomez seems undeterred.

Two Sundays ago, he celebrated a special Mass in recognition of immigrants at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in downtown. Busloads of people from the dioceses in San Bernardino and Orange attended, as did Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and U.S. Reps. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles) and Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-East Los Angeles).

In his homily — delivered seamlessly in poetic Spanish and slightly slower English — Gomez reminded the congregants to think of immigration in terms of souls, not statistics.

“We are talking about fathers who, without warning, won’t be coming home for dinner tonight,” he said.

Then, a student visiting from a parish in the Valley stood before the standing-room-only crowd and shared her story.

Her parents brought her to the U.S. from Guatemala when she was 6. She worked hard in school but always knew that without the right immigration documents she probably couldn’t attend her dream college. But, in what her mom would later describe as a miracle, she applied for President Obama’s “deferred action” and got it. Now, she told the congregation, she has a full-ride scholarship to Harvard for this fall.

Toward the end of the Mass, Gomez made a spirited plea. He asked everyone to, please, contact their congressmen and push them to pass comprehensive immigration reform.

“Soon,” he said, his voice billowing. “Now. As soon as possible.”

In Gomez’s new book, “Immigration and the Next America: Renewing the Soul of Our Nation” — 116 pages of historical context, personal anecdotes and calls for grace dedicated to the new pope — the archbishop asks pointed questions.

Advertisement

“Do we really believe that America is one nation under God, made up from every other people?” he writes. “Or is America instead a nation that is essentially white, Anglo-Saxon, and Protestant, but permits the presence of peoples of other races, colors, and religions?”

Father Allan Figueroa Deck, who teaches theological studies at Loyola Marymount University, said he liked the tone and message of Gomez’s book and was happy to hear him speaking up on the topic. As the most powerful Latino in the U.S. Catholic Church, Deck said, anything Gomez says carries an extra weight.

Advertisement

“We’re delighted,” Deck said. “Much is at stake and the archbishop is being very proactive in trying to get the message out.”

Gomez has also taken steps to minister in his native tongue. Once a month, he records “Diálogo de Fe,” a Spanish-language radio and TV show aimed at engaging and growing the Latino Catholic community. And he often visits the parish in Santa Monica where many of the city’s Oaxacan immigrants worship.

“I think the big difference is Mahony could speak out of compassion and teaching, and Gomez can speak from being Hispanic himself,” said John Allen, senior correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter.

That rings true for Roberto Magaña, an immigrant from El Salvador who attends Mass at the cathedral downtown almost every day. It’s not uncommon, he said, for the congregation to break into applause on days when Gomez broaches the topic of immigration.

Advertisement

“He’s very influential in the way that he’s a Spanish-speaking person and a Mexican,” Magaña said.

As Gomez sits at a long table in the cathedral’s conference room, a red crucifix and a photo of fellow clergymen in black robes frame his round face. He sighs, puts his hands together and reflects on a realization he had after moving to the U.S. in the 1980s.

Advertisement

The views of the come-and-go-as-you-please border he knew growing up looked different from this side — a tone shift punctuated by the amnesty law of 1986.

Mexican Americans told him they often felt rejected and mistreated. During his ministry in San Antonio, he met desperate immigrants who explained that waiting even one week for permission to come to the U.S. meant that their kids would skip meals. And while he worked in the Houston diocese in the early 1990s, a fellow priest told him about how la migra pulled over a van full of people on their way to Mass and deported most of them to Mexico.

Advertisement

Having had all of those experiences — and knowing that many people in the U.S. will never get them — inspired him to write the book, he said.

“I’m trying to … explain to people so they can understand why they came here without papers and broke the law,” he said. “There is a reason for that, and we have to be understanding and compassionate and find a solution.”

There is no reason to believe — with this court — that recess appointments will be permitted,” [Communications Workers of America President Larry] Cohen said in a conference call.

A new microsite went live today to highlight the job-killing overreach into the private sector of the National Labor Relations Board. (NRLB) The NRLB is an anti-business, pro-union operation masquerading as a watchdog for “labor issues.” The board is supposed to function fairly rather than as an advocate for union interests against private businesses. In reality, nothing could be further from the truth.

The NRLB caused quite a stir a few years ago, when they launched a job-killing complaint against Boeing as the company attempted to build a 787 Dreamliner plant in South Carolina. The Board asserted that opening a plant in non-union South Carolina was retaliation against union workers at their Washington state plant. There was no regard for potential new jobs for South Carolina when the NRLB decided to insert itself into a private business’ decision.

The NRLB has been in the news of late. Notably last week, Cablevision filed an emergency application with the Supreme Court to suspend actions against the company, as the board was continuing to function despite a court ruling declaring Obama’s appointments to the board unconstitutional.

At this very moment, the NRLB is continuing to function despite the fact that two courts have ruled that members on the board were put there unconstitutionally by Obama. There are no fewer than SIXTY lawsuits against the NRLB’s rulings with these unconstitutional appointments."

U.S. Capitol Hill Police and the FBI are looking into series posts made against the Texas Republican by a person identifying himself as Troy Gilmore Jr., who used the Twitter handle @ArmyVet54 and described himself as a military veteran.

""Take down Ted Cruz, at his home,"" read one post. Another post said, ""What goes around comes around CRUZ!!""

Many of the messages were posted while Congress was negotiating to raise the nation's borrowing authority and to find a way to reopen the government after a two-week shutdown.

Cruz, a favorite of the conservative Tea Party movement, has been a leading critic of President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law which was a focal point of the fiscal fight in Congress.

""It's an active investigation,"" said Officer Shennell Antrobus, a spokesman for the Capitol Police. He declined to elaborate on the credibility of the threats.

It is often routine policy for authorities to look into potential threats that are made on social media sites and directed at members of Congress.

Cruz's office confirmed that they had referred the matter to the police last week.

The first time Barack Obama filled out an NCAA tournament bracket as president, he ended up picking the eventual national champion. He's hoping to have the same luck with the first try of his second term, as ESPN released the president's 2013 Final Four picks.

The commander-in-chief likes Louisville, Indiana, Ohio State and Florida to make it to Atlanta, with Baylor, Connecticut, Notre Dame and California advancing in the women's bracket.

Obama revealed his entire men's bracket Wednesday morning on Sportscenter, picking Louisville and Indiana to advance to the men's national title game, with Indiana winning the whole thing. The president picked a few potential upsets in the second round, taking two 11 seeds over sixes, with Belmont defeating Arizona and Minnesota beating UCLA.

He likely hopes to improve on his performance last year, when he picked North Carolina to beat Kentucky, with Missouri and Ohio State rounding out his Final Four. Missouri's opening round loss to Norfolk State ended up ruining that prospect, while North Carolina lost to eventual runner-up Kansas in the Elite 8.

In 2010 and 2011, Obama picked Kansas to win the title, with the Jayhawks suffering early losses in both tournaments. He certainly proved his proficiency in the early rounds in 2011 though, nailing 29 of the first 32 games to rank 492nd out of 5.9 million brackets heading into the Sweet 16 that year.

The president correctly picked North Carolina to win the title in 2009, the only one of his Final Four teams to advance that year.

http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/02/23/1189384/-Hearing-No-Evil-The-Amazing-Obtuseness-of-Campus-Conservatives,2013-02-23 00:00:00,"['This Content Is Not Subject To Review Daily Kos Staff Prior To Publication.', 'Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags']",Hearing No Evil: The Amazing Obtuseness of Campus Conservatives,"In any event, during the Q&A period things got more interesting. Two conservative students asked me questions -- good, tough questions (and indeed the kind I like getting at these sorts of events) -- and my answers, and our interactions proved grist for the right-wing ""undercover video"" mill, despite how incredibly mild and obviously true my remarks were, to which they took such offense.

One of these was a young woman of color who wanted to know -- given my ""dislike for conservatives and Republicans"" -- what I would say to people of color who were also conservative, such as herself. I explained that I wouldn't say anything different to her than any other conservative. Rather, I asked her, as I would anyone on the right, how she would explain the persistent racial disparities between whites and people of color, if she rejects (as the right does, and as she admitted she did), the notion that racism and discrimination, either past, present, or a combination of the two, were largely to blame.

At no point did she even try and answer my question, because like most conservatives, she cannot; at least not without sounding incredibly racist in the process. Because the only possible answer, if one rejects the discrimination thesis as an explanation for ongoing and glaring disparities in income, wealth, education, and elsewhere between whites and black folks, is inherently racist: namely, that those persons of color must in some way be inferior, either biologically or culturally, relative to whites. I waited with baited breath for her -- a woman of color -- to actually admit that was what she thought. But instead of grappling with the question honestly, she said nothing, beyond her amazing admission that she refuses to accept the simple statement that people of color had ever been disadvantaged in the U.S., or that whites had ever been advantaged, due to racism. In other words, it wasn't just that she insisted America was an equal opportunity society now (say, because of the civil rights revolution), which is at least an understandable and honorable argument, however wrongheaded I might view it to be. Rather, she refused to so much as acknowledge that the history of racism and white supremacy had ever mattered at all. She was the moral equivalent of a Holocaust denier, so fundamentally irrational and uninformed about basic social reality as to call into question how and why a school as good as Providence would have admitted her as a member of its student body. And to think that she was chagrined by affirmative action ostensibly lowering the academic standards of the school on behalf of the other black kids there? Ah, methinks the lady doth protest too much.

But her friend and conservative colleague's question -- actually it was a statement -- was even more interesting. She claimed that I was ""anthropologically reductionist"" (one of those word casseroles that we learn in college and that some sadly deploy just to show how smart they are), for even noticing something like race. She, on the other hand, in the throes of a deeper (and Scriptural) enlightenment merely saw ""people"" when she looked around, not colors, and especially ""people made in the image of God."" Cue the harps and Vienna Boy's Choir.

In response, I told her first that such a sentiment was lovely, but, I thought naive. Mostly because even if we accept the notion that we are all merely individuals made in the image of God, the fact is, our identities as whites or people or color, men or women, straight folks or LGBT, have mattered, and have resulted in advantages for some and disadvantages for others. In other words, we can't treat people as abstractions, removed from their social context and consider that justice. If racism has had consequences -- which of course her black friend refused to admit, so no doubt one can understand her confusion -- then one must deal with that, and attempt to rectify the injustices that have brought us to this point, not merely gloss over them in the name of some colorblind ecumenism, thereby leaving in place all the unearned advantages obtained by some and unearned disadvantages visited upon the rest. She was, in short, guilty of viewing individuals using a dictionary definition of the term, when what we actually experience in this world in the lives we lead, is an encyclopedic version of ourselves, far more complex than either the dictionary, or certainly the Bible might lead us to believe.

But what I also said -- and which apparently created such a firestorm -- was the part where I noted that however nice it was to prattle on about people being made in the image of God, that even there, we have a problem in this culture, given how we have created the image of that God to match whiteness. In other words, we have made God white, and Jesus white, as could be seen on any number of crucifixes (or is it crucifi?) around this Catholic campus, including one that was hanging right behind my head while I spoke: a lily-white, Europeanized savior, devoid of any relationship to what first century Jews would have looked like. Until my questioner was prepared to deal with that, and why we had done that, and what it meant, she really was in no position to lecture me about my anthropological reductionism or anything else.

One would think that any reasonably educated person would realize that the whitening of Jesus was an act of white supremacy, undertaken down through many centuries for the purpose of inculcating western and European domination. Constantine, after all, said that the cross was the sign under which he would conquer, not liberate, the world. My comments are not remotely contestable by rational people. But in the eyes of Providence College conservatives, they were heresy of the highest order.

And so today I discovered that someone in the crowd apparently provided a video of my talk to well-known white nationalist (as in, openly so), and Providence resident, Tim Dionisopoulos, and that he had written about it and uploaded it to the web. Therein, Dionisopoulos took special umbrage at my discussion of the white Jesus issue, as if my comments were the height of craziness. And he made special note of the part where I joked that the school should make Jesus black for a year, just to show that his color ""really doesn't matter"" (which is what white Christians always tell me when I bring up his whitening, as if to suggest I shouldn't make a big deal of it). Apparently, some folks think I was being serious and that my comment (obviously intended to lampoon their own unblinking devotion to his pasty whiteness on their campus crosses) suggested some kind of anti-Catholic bias.

The videographers also found it shocking, just shocking that I would suggest the Catholic Church (and really, Christendom more broadly), had been deeply implicated in the genocidal mistreatment of indigenous peoples throughout the Americas. This revelation comes as no surprise to anyone who has studied the history of native peoples, or the church for that matter; indeed, even the Church no longer denies it, though they rarely deal honestly with its implications. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, for instance, has itself noted the history, however bloodlessly as such:

Catholicism's spread to Native people across the United States resembles in many ways the settling of the country itself. From the earliest days French and Spanish missionaries who came to this world newly discovered by Europeans came as extensions of the colonizing powers. The approach was, in many cases, to force the Natives to accept the faith as part of the process of servitude…

The history of the Alta California missions are instructive here. These were settlements established by Spanish colonizers so as to rapidly assimilate native peoples there into both European culture and Catholicism, under the belief of the Church that it had a moral right to evangelize and that the Spanish crown had a legal right to land. The missions operated by forcibly resettling indigenous persons around the mission itself so as ""convert them"" not only from so-called heathens into Catholics, but from savages to civilized peoples, in European terms. Once Indians were Baptized they were disallowed the right to move about the country; rather, they were forced to work at the missions, under the rigid control of the Friars. Indian women, in particular, were housed in such unsanitary conditions at the missions that diseases spread rapidly, resulting in the deaths of thousands. Contemporaries writing at the time noted without compunction that the labor conditions at the missions resembled slavery, and since the native peoples were unpaid for their work -- work that ultimately enriched the Catholic Church and the colonial powers with which the Church was entwined -- such an analogy is obviously warranted.

Elsewhere the Church contributed directly to the cultural and even physical evisceration of indigenous Americans, in ways that any truly educated person in this country would know, were our schools dedicated to the teaching of anything remotely comporting with truth. For a comprehensive accounting of the evil done in the name of God to indigenous peoples, one need only read George Tinker's Missionary Conquest: The Gospel and Native American Cultural Genocide, or David Stannard's meticulously documented, American Holocaust, to see that my comments at Providence, far from indicating a bias against Catholicism, fully dovetail with historical fact, however inconvenient those facts may be for a school that has chosen ""Friars"" as its sports mascot.

That today's campus conservatives think challenging the phony whiteness of Jesus, or noting the history of the church's role in racism makes one a radical is instructive. It speaks to what an utterly sheltered, provincial and fundamentally ignorant world view these persons have been given heretofore, by their parents, high schools, priests and preachers, and by a larger society that has no room for any understanding of America and Christianity that isn't laudatory. Their inability to hear of evil, let alone address it, is rendered all the less likely by such a sheltering, and their ability to engage in even the simplest rational dialogue with others, or even with history, is made almost impossible.

The good news is, the school is pushing forward with its diversity initiative, and nearly everyone in attendance at the talk cringed and groaned openly at the foolishness of their classmates, there on display. So one can only hope that even at a school like Providence, this too shall pass."

Overton volunteered for service in his 30s

Vet is expected to have breakfast with President Obama on Monday

He%27s the oldest known living veteran of WWII

WASHINGTON – Last May, when he was in town with a veterans' group touring the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial and the World War II Memorial, Richard Overton wondered out loud what it would take to meet President Obama.

The president was out of town that day, but in Overton's case, all it took to arrange the meeting was a phone call and another trip back to the nation's capital.

Richard Overton is not just any veteran. At 107, he's believed to be the oldest known American veteran of World War II.

A member of the Army's 188th Aviation Engineer Battalion, Overton was in his 30s when he volunteered for service in 1942 and saw combat while ""island hopping"" in the Pacific with an all-black unit, says Allen Bergeron, chairman of Honor Flight Austin, the Texas group that brings local veterans to Washington to tour the monuments. It was Bergeron's group that arranged for Overton's return trip to Washington.

On Monday, nearly 70 years after he returned from the Pacific, he'll meet President Obama at the White House for breakfast before accompanying the president to Arlington National Cemetery for a Veterans Day ceremony, Bergeron said.

""War's nothing to be into,"" Overton said during a brief interview Sunday. ""You don't want to go into the war if you don't have to. But I had to go. I enjoyed it after I'd went and come back, but I didn't enjoy it when was over there. I had to do things I didn't want to do.""

Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell calls Overton ""a regular guy and an extraordinary gentleman. His story is the story of veterans everywhere who leave their peaceful lives to fight in far-off lands for our future.""

On Sunday afternoon at Reagan National Airport, Overton got a hero's reception when airport personnel announced his arrival. The crowd surprised Overton, sitting in a wheelchair, who said, ""I didn't think I was worth that much.""

Still living in the house he built when he returned from the war, Overton has been a widower for the past 22 years. He still starts his day each morning with ""a tablespoon"" of whiskey in his coffee and still smokes a dozen cigars a day, two indulgences that he says are the secret to his longevity.

Beside him for the trip was his ""lady friend,"" as he calls her, 89-year-old Earlene Love, who quietly counseled him through a brief interview before a small group from Austin whisked him away to his hotel.

Asked how it feels to be meeting the President on Monday, Overton quips, ""I ain't met him.""



Asked what he'd tell Obama, Overton says, ""Whatever he asks me.""

And if the President asks Overton to talk first?

""I'll just keep my mouth shut — I wouldn't know what to tell him. I've never thought of that. For one thing, I'd talk about (how) we're proud to have him. I wish him good luck all the way through. We have to pray for him. We have to pray for him and help him because we all need help."""

Inaugurations are momentous things.

And then, after the benediction, I opened an e-mail from my friend Matt, who had extracted another unalienable truth from the proceedings:

“Biden is a testament to the transforming power of successful hair plugs.”

Well yes, he is, though the hair plugs are not a new Biden phenomenon. What’s telling here is that at a spectacle so potent and on a stage so crowded, the eye would be so naturally drawn to the goofball understudy. In that sense, Matt represents a cultural wave.

“Transforming” is the key word. In a few short months, the motor-tongued, muscle-car-loving heartbeat-away hell raiser has been transformed from gaffe-prone amusement to someone whose star shines as brightly as his teeth. He is the subject of viral C-Span videos, sitcom infatuations and an “autobiography” of his Onion-inspired alter-ego, “Diamond” Joe Biden, “The President of Vice.” (In his spare time, Mr. Biden also helped avert the fiscal cliff, is spearheading the White House plan to reduce gun violence and might even run for president in 2016.)"

According to the Hollywood Reporter, the same research that reportedly found that Hasselbeck's conservative perspective was alienating some viewers also found that co-host Joy Behar's liberal stances were not sitting well with audiences.

Last week, Behar made headlines when she announced she would be leaving ""The View"" when her contract expires in August. Behar cited her 16-year history on the show and said she looked forward to working on her stand-up and other projects. ""You can't stay forever on a show,"" she said on ""Good Morning America.""

One day after Behar's announcement, reports surfaced that Hasselbeck was also leaving ""The View"" after research revealed that her conservative perspective was clashing with audience members. On Monday's show, co-host Barbara Walters insisted that Hasselbeck was not leaving the show, but many in the media still believe that her contract will not be renewed. Walters also said that the program values Hasselbeck and her conservative points of view.

The Hollywood Reporter's Marisa Guthrie looked further into the research behind the sudden influx of announcements. She reported:

Earlier this TV season, ABC's The View commissioned a study that showed many viewers are turned off by the political debates that have defined the morning talk show ... Longtime panelists Behar and Hasselbeck on the left and right, respectively, were deemed too ""polarizing,"" according to several sources.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s move to schedule votes on the first five amendments was rejected by Republicans who opposed the Nevada Democrat’s plan to require 60 votes for passage.

“There is no reason, particularly in this first week, at the beginning of the process, to be blocking our amendments with a 60-vote margin,” said Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, who is leading the debate for Republicans. “It really looks like the fix is in, and the bill is rigged to pass basically as it is.”

Senators from both parties have suggested changes that could boost the chance of adding GOP votes needed to pass the legislation, or could erode the fragile bipartisan balance that now exists on the bill.

Many of the Republican amendments take aim at the cornerstone of the compromise: a 13-year pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million people living in the United States who entered illegally or have stayed on expired visas.

The GOP proposals would stop immigrants from making the transition to legal status until various border security and immigration enforcement goals are reached. Under the bill as written, a plan to halt 90% of all illegal crossings must be in operation before legal status is set in motion, but a security plan does not have to achieve that target.

Republican senators said the changes were needed to encourage action in the GOP-led House, where the conservative majority is less inclined to provide a route to citizenship.

Democrats argued that these proposals could prevent immigrants from ever gaining legal status. And they said the costs of security measures beyond the $6.5 billion already in the bill could prove unpopular.

“Its cost goes through the roof,” said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), a chief architect of the bill, who was joined on the Senate floor by another coauthor, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), in an unusual display of bipartisanship. “It’s not going to strengthen the bill, but could indeed kill it.”

Democrats, though, also have amendments that could cost votes, including one from Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) that would give gay Americans the same right to obtain visas for their foreign-born spouses as straight couples have.

When the bill was in committee, Leahy shelved the amendment rather than risk losing Republican votes. But his effort got a boost Wednesday from one of the eight senators in the bipartisan group that drafted the bill, Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.).

“I think that amendment should get a vote,” Bennet, who is also the chairman of his party’s campaign arm, said at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor.

As the senators sparred, advocacy groups fanned out across the capital and online for what is expected to be a lengthy process of moving the bill through Congress.

Former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, a Republican, headlined an event hosted by a coalition of religious, law enforcement and small-business leaders — “Bibles, Badges and Business” — that supports the effort to rewrite immigration laws.

The Senate Conservatives Fund, an advocacy organization that opposes the bill, urged voters to call “amnesty Republicans” who voted Tuesday to allow the debate to begin. “If this bill passes, they will be largely responsible,” the fund’s executive director wrote to supporters.

Senate leaders and those involved in the immigration overhaul effort are somewhat divided over how much to alter the bill to gain GOP support.

Some believe they should aim for the biggest vote possible to put pressure on reluctant House Republicans. But others counter that there is no need to give more ground than what is absolutely needed to get the 60 votes required to pass. They say Republicans already have an incentive to support the effort because they need more support from Latino and minority voters.

But even starting the debate has proved daunting, despite an overwhelming vote Tuesday to do so. And exchanges between Republicans and Democrats on the Senate floor Wednesday grew testy.

Leahy, who is leading the floor debate for Democrats, gently reminded senators that any delays could keep them in Washington through the Fourth of July holiday.

“I’d like to start voting on something,” he said.

Four years ago, the buzz was all about the arms when the White House unveiled the official photo portrait of first lady Michelle Obama. Now it is all about the bangs.

For Mrs. Obama’s new portrait for her husband’s second term, which the White House released on Wednesday, the photographer got in closer to the first lady; in the earlier portrait, she is shown standing at more of a distance. The latest pose accentuates the bangs that Mrs. Obama had cut in time for President Obama’s inaugural festivities in January.

The president’s second-term portrait was unveiled last month, and it also seemed to capture a more casual, confident subject. But in his case, the comparisons focused on the president’s evident increase in gray hairs after four years in office.

Mrs. Obama’s portrait makes for a more casual, if still elegant, look. She is wearing a navy dress with three-quarter-length sleeves, a contrast with her 2009 portrait, for which she wore a sleeveless black dress by Michael Kors that showed off her well-toned arms, signaling what became her signature style.

This year’s dress looks to be the same one and with the same pearls that she wore recently on the Rachael Ray television show, where the 49-year-old Mrs. Obama said of her new bangs, “This is my midlife crisis, the bangs. I couldn’t get a sports car. They won’t let me bungee jump. So instead I cut my bangs here.”

In the new photo, by Chuck Kennedy, she is shown from the waist up, leaning against a green patterned chair in the Green Room of the White House. The 2009 photo, taken by Joyce N. Boghosian, has Mrs. Obama standing in the Blue Room."

Journalists and celebrities gathered in D.C. for the annual event, where the president takes the stage to roast the White House press corps.

""I know CNN has taken some knocks lately, but the fact is I admire their commitment to cover all sides of the story just in case one of them happens to be accurate,"" Obama joked on Saturday.

He also took aim at MSNBC, noting, ""Now David Axelrod works for MSNBC, which is a nice change of pace, since MSNBC used to work for David Axelrod.""

Later on, Obama's remarks turned more serious as he remembered the bombings at the Boston Marathon. He praised the Boston Globe for its coverage of the tragedy, saying, ""If anyone wonders if newspapers are a thing of the past, all you need to do is pick up or log on to papers like the Boston Globe.""

He also gave a shoutout to NBC News' Pete Williams, who drew accolades for his reporting during the bombings. People in the newsroom refer to him as ""Big Papi,"" Obama joked.

Earlier, Obama zinged NBC News, saying that he played basketball after this year's Easter Egg roll. He said he made ""2 hits, 20 misses. The executives at NBC asked, 'What's your secret?'""

He speculated that the History Channel was not at the dinner because they were ""embarrassed"" for comparing him to Satan in ""The Bible."" ""Of course, that never kept Fox News from showing up,"" Obama joked.

The president's first target after walking out on stage to rap music was none other than Rush Limbaugh, who he joked ""warned you about this — second term, baby. We're changing things around here a little bit."" BuzzFeed also got a mention when Obama cracked, ""I remember when BuzzFeed was just something I did in college around 2am."""

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/25/Whos-Afraid-of-Michele-Bachmann,2013-01-25 00:00:00,['Anita Moncrief'],Who's Afraid of Michele Bachmann?,"Who’s afraid of Congresswoman Michele Bachmann? The entire range of far-left activists, apparently.

Bachmann (R-MN) is currently the target of an aggressive campaign sponsored by a leftist organization, People for the American Way. Its immediate objective is to get House Speaker John Boehner to strip her of her Intelligence Committee seat.

According to the Watchdog Wire, the group–affiliated with ACORN, George Soros, and United for Peace and Justice–has taken a rather vocal stance against Bachmann.

People for the American Way (PFAW) has launched a new campaign against Representative Michele Bachmann (R-MN), who, after her recent re-election to Congress, has been re-appointed to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI).

A PFAW-sponsored petition with 178,000 signatures is to be presented to House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) on Monday 21 January 2012 to protest Bachmann’s HPSCI appointment.

Citing what PFAW calls “ugly Islamophobic fear mongering,” the petition decries what it alleges are Bachmann’s “unfounded and irresponsible attacks on dedicated public servants.”

Michele Bachmann has represented the people of Minnesota’s 6th Congressional District since 2007. She is the Chairwoman of the Tea Party Caucus in the House of Representatives.

Bachmann’s supporters consider her a staunch conservative who is a champion of the cause of limited, constitutional government. They admire her for her commitment to low taxes and fiscal discipline, as well as her opposition to socialized medicine.

In matters of national defense, Bachmann is a stalwart advocate of Ronald Reagan’s philosophy of Peace through Strength. Rep. Bachmann has spoken many times regarding the threat of radical Islam and Obama administration policies that are exacerbating it.

The petition was not PFAW’s first assault on Bachmann, as the group spent most of 2012 producing propaganda to make people distance themselves from the Congresswoman and her startling revelations.

Bachmann is credited with leading a 2012 effort to launch official investigations into the activities of federal employees in five executive branch agencies allegedly tied to the Muslim Brotherhood.

From FrontPage Magazine:

Last June, Rep. Michele Bachmann and four Republican colleagues sent letters to the Inspectors General at the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, and State, asking them to investigate whether the Muslim Brotherhood–the ideological wellspring from which such terrorist outfits as al Qaeda and Hamas first emerged–might be gaining undue influence over high-level U.S. government officials. One letter, for instance, noted that Hillary Clinton’s closest aide, her deputy chief of staff Huma Abedin, “has three family members… connected to Muslim Brotherhood operatives and/or organizations.”

Critics viciously attacked Bachmann for asking these questions. Many on the right consider her treatment unwarranted, ad hominem criticism from left-leaning establishment media and Islamist organizations–and even from some fellow Republicans–and that it decreased the margin of her very narrow reelection in 2012.

Why the special interest from PFAW? According to Discover the Networks:

People for the American Way (PFAW) was established in 1981 as a Tides Foundation project designed to counteract the allegedly growing influence of what its founder, television producer and political activist Norman Lear, denounced as the ‘religious right.’

In July 2011, PFAW published a Right Wing Playbook on Anti-Muslim Extremism, whose theme is that: “Under the guise of defending freedom and American values, right-wing anti-Muslim activists are campaigning to prevent Muslim-Americans from freely worshiping and practicing their religion, curtail their political rights, and even compel their deportation.”

Bachmann is also despised on the left because of her role in taking down ACORN. Bachmann went after ACORN for its role in the federal census before the group received national media attention, and the far left has never forgotten it. ACORN received over $100,000 from the foundation started by the wife of PFAW founder Norman Lear. PFAW also shares other funders with ACORN and has worked with Project Vote for years on “election protection.” PFAW boasts celebrity board members like Alec Baldwin and Seth McFarlane. The board also consists of several members with connections to the Communist Party of the USA and the usual suspects of radical millionaires.

Would PFAW’s interest have anything to do with Deborah Rappaport and her husband Andrew?

Discover the Networks provides a very clear profile:

A committed Democrat and a socialist, Rappaport has established himself (along with his wife, the philanthropist and political activist Deborah Rappaport) as one of the largest donors to Democratic Party candidates and causes. Between 1999 and 2008, he contributed $340,139 to candidates and political action committees at the national level. In addition, he and his wife have given millions of dollars to organizations that promote Democrat objectives and policies…

Andrew Rappaport is secretary of the Rappaport Family Foundation (RFF), which he and his wife established in 2002 as a vehicle by which to administer their charitable donations. Between 2004 and 2008, RFF gave $850,000 to People for the American Way, $700,000 to the Center for American Progress, and $323,000 to the anti-war group Project Billboard. In 2006 RFF sent $100,000 to the Tides Center, which in turn (on instructions from RFF) funneled the money to Allied Media Projects, an anti-corporate community-media organization where ACORN founder Wade Rathke sits on the board of directors. As of 2006, RFF’s assets totaled $7.6 million.

Other ACORN connected board members of PFAW include the well-connected radical Margery Tabankin, the Executive Director of both Steven Spielberg’s Righteous Persons Foundation and The Streisand Foundation.

Bachmann’s enemies at PFAW even originate from her own backyard. Minnesota Secretary of State Mark Ritchie is not only connected to several of the PFAW board members’ radical organizations but he is also a friend of Bachmann’s old foe ACORN.

How close of a friend? While at ACORN, I remember several efforts working with local Democrats to raise money for the Franken versus Coleman efforts. This included a 2008 meeting between Secretary of State Ritchie, ACORN, Project Vote. The subject of the meeting? Ritchie was actively providing fundraising help for Project Vote and ACORN.

PFAW has a long history of partisan political activity that is ignored by the very same mainstream media that have funded–yes, funded them in the past. CBS, NBC, ABC and even the New York Times have failed to note what the Capital Research Center (CRC) pointed out in 2002. During the height of PFAW’s work to stymie all Bush judicial nominees, CRC wrote:

People for the American Way and its affiliates work together as a powerful lobby for leftist ideology and Democratic party politics. Whatever its tax lawyers may say, the scandal of PFAW is that foundations and corporations inflate its budget and pay for its politics. Every dollar contributed to PFAW advances a profoundly political agenda.

To recap, PFAW’s board is comprised of a who’s who of far-left radicals, socialists, and communists. They are tied to ACORN and Project Vote, and the bulk of their funding comes from far-left foundations like Tides. In addition, the Capital Research Center reported that in 2003 and 2004, 98 percent of the organization’s political contributions went to left-wing Democratic candidates.

Do PFAW and its allies aim to inflict further damage in the Alinsky style to one of our country’s most courageous and visionary leaders, to defeat her next year as part of the left’s determined bid to return the House to Democratic control?

Speaker of the House John Boehner and the rest of the country should stand strong behind Michele Bachmann. With those kind of enemies, Bachmann appears to be one of the few in Congress on the right path. We must not allow the Islamists and their allies on the left to deprive our country at this critical moment of Michele Bachmann’s leadership on national security, limited government, and conservative values at a moment when they are needed more than ever. If one woman can bring the entire wrath of the left down on her, one must examine her statements and remember the old adage “the truth hurts.” Well, look who’s howling now."

Editor’s Note: Donna Brazile, a CNN contributor and a Democratic strategist, is vice chairwoman for voter registration and participation at the Democratic National Committee. She is a nationally syndicated columnist, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and author of “Cooking With Grease: Stirring the Pot in America.” She was manager for the Gore-Lieberman presidential campaign in 2000.

(CNN) —

Satire and mockery are part of politics. Sometimes they attack not the policy but the person, going from nuanced to nasty. But surely not “everything goes.” Promoting violence and applauding abuse – there’s just no excuse for it.

The latest uproar occurred at the Missouri State Fair, when a rodeo clown wearing an Obama mask invited the crowd to cheer if they wanted to see “Obama run down by a bull.”

“As they were bringing the bulls into the chute and prepping them,” Perry Beam told USA Today, “…they bring out what looks like a dummy. The announcer says ‘Here’s our Obama dummy, or our dummy of Obama. They mentioned the president’s name, I don’t know, 100 times…” Beam was there with his wife and a foreign exchange student who got a lesson in American political “civility.”

The reaction was bipartisan. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, a and Sen. Claire McCaskill, both Democrats, weighed in with disapproval. And Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder, a Republican, said on Twitter he found the performance “disrespectful.”

That’s an understatement. “We are better than this.” One hopes so.

JUSTIN LAROSE/CNN Donna Brazile

What are we to make, though, of a Slap Hillary website, suspiciously resurrected by an anti-Hillary PAC? The PAC sent out tweets to reporters in hopes, I suspect, of stirring up the red meat base, get publicity, and solicit money. It provocatively asked journalists, “Have you slapped Hillary today?”

First posted 13 years ago, the site shows a cartoon of Hillary’s face. When a button is pressed, a hand slaps her so hard she reacts like a bobble doll, her head bouncing from side to side as her eyes cross.

The “SlapHillary Team,” which hosts the “game,” says they are “a grass roots, nonprofit organization.” BuzzFeed’s Andrew Kaczynski did some research and found its treasurer, Christopher M. Marston, is a Republican campaign finance consultant and former member of the Bush administration.

The Super PAC defended itself and posted a link to a “Slap Palin” website. The PAC isn’t contrite, saying on its website, “We didn’t see the liberal media bemoaning this “Slap Palin” game when it came out! They only care when it’s the candidate they support for president.”

There’s something suspicious about the “Slap Palin” site – a paucity of comments, just 19 in 2008 and only two last year, indicates a set-up. A little more research revealed that the “Slap Palin” is hosted on a computer at the same address in downtown Washington that hosts a “Slap Clinton” and “Slap Obama” site.

We can perhaps relegate the “Slap Palin-Clinton-Obama” anonymous owner to the fringe. But what are we to say when a former administration official and current campaign consultant to one of the major parties promotes violence against public figures?

It doesn’t matter if the website – or rodeo clown – encourages violence against a Democrat or a Republican, a male or female. It’s wrong. It’s vile. It’s one of the few true evils in politics.

Those who promote or approve “slapping” or “shooting” or “running over by a bull” any public official should be shamed and shunned. Virtual violence needs to be denounced and never justified because it’s political.

Still, given the extent of domestic violence – 25% of American women will experience domestic violence in their lives – encouraging people to slap or abuse female elected officials is particularly pernicious. Slapping women so hard their heads bobble is not a game, not even virtually.

We need to go further, and condemn activities that show no respect for elected officials.

Republican U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman of Texas’$2 36th District issued an invitation to the rodeo clown to appear at a rodeo in his district. “Liberals want to bronco bust dissent,” Stockman said. “But Texans value speech, even if its speech they don’t agree with.” This isn’t about liberals or conservatives, Congressman; it’s about respect for elected officials, and coupling violence with ridicule.

It’s one thing to use free speech to parody or satirize a politician, and another to couple violence with a deliberate showing of disrespect.

When Harry Truman was campaigning in his home state of Missouri (where the rodeo clown performed), he took questions from a high school audience. A teenage boy asked him a question about their town councilman, called him, “Our local yokel.”

Truman lit into the boy. Politics is a noble art, Truman said. It’s difficult to forge consensus and lead fighting factions for the common good. But this is what politicians do. They deserve respect. The boy was chastened, and apologized.

Knowing, however, that a public scolding by a man of his stature could affect the boy’s self-esteem for a long time, Truman talked with him after the assembly, and invited him to write and tell him about his grades. They corresponded until the boy graduated college.

We have to make our civic discourse civil again. We have to recognize that virtual violence masquerading as ridicule is vicious; it’s a toxic atmosphere we allow by our silence. We hear a lot about what’s wrong with Washington. What’s wrong isn’t Washington. It’s us.

... which naturally led to actual goddamn stories suggesting that Obama did not go to Gettysburg because of Obamacarez.

I suppose the main question here is which of these various shameless dunderhacks was the one who first came up with this as a plausible attack line—I am loathe to pin that on the Breitbart crowd when it could have been tossed over their transom by an even more eager shit-for-brains, or perhaps there is a collection of fabled shit-for-brains pundits that gets together each evening to determine who among them has the most foam-laden idea for an attack piece and they all clap their little hands together and run with it. That would mean all the others saw it floating around and said I believe I shall run with this, which makes them even more goddamn stupid and hackish than the original stupid hacks.

Now here is the key point, dear reader, and the reason why shit for brains ought not to be considered a crass insult at this point but merely a reasonable medical diagnosis. In all of American post-Lincoln history, only one sitting president has ever gone to Gettysburg on the anniversary of the address. Reagan did not go. The Bushii did not go. JFK did not go. Roosevelt never went, nor Nixon, nor President Biff the Unholy, Destroyer of Worlds. That honor apparently goes to Taft, and it has been a long damn time since anyone in the national press furrowed their brows and pondered what William Howard Taft would do in a given situation.

So no, we do not have to take any of this seriously. Nor do we have to take the purveyors of such obviously stupid faux-scandals seriously. Nor do we have to treat them with respect, or pretend for a bare minute that they have anything worthwhile to say about our political discourse that could not be better said by contemplating the contents of a litter box. The problem here is that there is no shame to be had in peddling conspiratorial trash in public. In better days people would cross to the other side of the street so that they would not have to listen to the nice man on the large box preaching about how President Obama is probably not attending the event only one other president in history (well, two, counting Lincoln himself) attended, and how that probably means the current president resents the tardiness of Brown v. Board of Education, and when a newspaper man walks up to that fellow with a notebook in hand, nodding and scribbling things down, that does not make it suddenly respectable. It only means there are two nuts standing on a street corner instead of one.

Cross to the other side, America. For the sake of pride and patriotism, will you just shun these damn people already?

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

(CNN) —

What do you do for an encore after a landslide re-election victory? How about taking your show on the road.

And that’s just what New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will do later this month, as he takes over as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, giving an already very visible governor with national aspirations even more visibility.

While the high-profile position should enhance Christie’s status as a leader of the GOP, he’s already coming under attack from some potential 2016 rivals.

Christie wins big

With three-dozen states electing governors in 2014, Christie will be crisscrossing the country, supporting some of the party’s brightest stars. But he’ll also be introducing himself to those who know only the larger-than-life figure on TV.

“I’m going to be traveling all over the country trying to elect Republican governors and that’s a pretty good thing to do for the Republican Party,” Christie said Tuesday in an interview with CNN anchor and Chief Washington Correspondent Jake Tapper.

The states that kick off the presidential primary and caucus calendar – Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Florida and Nevada – are among those holding elections next year. That itinerary works out well for someone who’s got an eye on the White House.

“The chairmanship of the RGA allows a governor to run for president before he actually runs for president, building relationships with organizers in key states and expanding his network of national contributors,” said Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist and veteran of numerous GOP campaigns. “It can also warehouse staff that can later move over to a presidential campaign. He can also use the RGA to collect chits by helping fellow GOP governors whom he hopes will eventually help him. It is a great platform for a Republican governor who is being urged to consider a presidential bid.”

But Christie could face intraparty sniping that he’s using the position to further his chances of winning the party’s presidential nomination. Then-Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who chaired the committee in 2006, ahead of his first run for the White House in 2008, and Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who chaired the RGA ahead of his 2012 bid for president, also got such quiet criticism.

Already under attack

Christie is touting his conservative credentials.

“I’m a conservative,” he said in his interview with Tapper, anchor of CNN’s “The Lead with Jake Tapper,” adding “I’ve governed as a conservative in this state.”

But a couple of high-profile Republicans are already trying to define Christie as not being conservative enough. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a favorite of tea party activists and a likely rival in 2016 should Christie decide to run, seemed to be trying to tag Christie with the m-word.

“I think the Republican Party is a big party, and we need moderates like Chris Christie who can win in New Jersey,” Paul told Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday on “The Situation Room.”

“What that means about the national party, I’m not sure there’s an answer. But we do need moderates like Chris Christie in the party.”

Paul also took a not-so-subtle jab Wednesday at Christie for starring in ads aimed at promoting tourism in New Jersey in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. In a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing to review the federal response to last year’s deadly storm, Paul questioned Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan about whether Sandy relief funds should be spent on television ads.

Paul said that “people running for office put their mug all over these ads while they are in the middle of a campaign. In New Jersey, $25 million was spent on ads that included somebody running for political office.”

“You think there might be a conflict of interest there? You know that’s a real problem. That’s why when people who are trying to do good and trying to use taxpayer dollars wisely they are offended to see our money spent on political ads. You know that’s just offensive.”

And Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, another possible GOP candidate, seemed to suggest that the impact of Christie’s landslide victory may be contained within the Garden State’s borders.

“Governor Christie has certainly shown he has a way of winning in New Jersey, in states like New Jersey … so I congratulate him on that,” Rubio said in an interview with CNN Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash.

Rubio: Don’t jump to conclusions about Christie’s win

Will Cain, a Republican analyst and CNN contributor, said he doesn’t buy in to the idea that Christie is a moderate.

“Look, everyone is invested in defining Chris Christie as a moderate. Liberals want to ascribe his victory to a repudiation of conservatism. And his political rivals want to beat him in a primary. But I don’t know that I can accept the premise,” Cain said. “His greatest conservative sin is participating in Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion. On everything else – guns, immigration – he’s given lip service to moderation, not governed that way.

An establishment Republican strategist said that infighting and sniping won’t help the party with those it’s trying to appeal to.

“The best thing that anyone who has their eye on 2016 can do for themselves and the party right now is to work together, show the American people that Republicans can govern responsibly and work to make inroads with sections of the electorate that didn’t support Republicans in the last two presidential elections,” Brian Walsh, former National Republican Senatorial Committee communications director, told CNN.

Ready to run?

Christie’s everywhere in the wake of his landslide re-election. The longtime Bruce Springsteen fan’s on the cover of Time Magazine, with the headline “Born to Run” on the story, and he’s scheduled to do four of the five Sunday talk shows this weekend.

Asked Wednesday by CNN’s Debrorah Feyerick if all the talk about his potential bid for the White House is becoming a distraction, Christie pushed back, saying, “I don’t get distracted very easily. It takes a lot to distract me, and I think the way it won’t be a distraction is I simply won’t let it.”

Christie’s re-election speech Tuesday night sounded like something more – the governor touted his bipartisan successes to an audience far beyond the Asbury Park ballroom and the borders of the Garden State.

“I know tonight a dispirited America, angry with their dysfunctional government in Washington, looks to New Jersey to say, ‘Is what I think happening really happening? Are people really coming together? Are we really working, African-Americans and Hispanics, suburbanites and city dwellers, farmers and teachers? Are we really all working together?’ Let me give the answer to everyone who is watching tonight: Under this government our first job is to get the job done, and as long as I’m governor that job will always, always be finished,” said Christie, to loud applause.

What Christie’s win says about 2016

Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and current co-host of CNN’s “Crossfire,” knows some things about running for the White House.

“I think it was an introductory speech,” the one-time 2012 GOP frontrunner said.

Castellanos added, It wasn’t an acceptance speech, that was an announcement speech.”

Numbers to brag about

Christie’s victory was never in doubt. And as the polls in the Garden State closed Tuesday night, CNN and the other news networks rushed to project that the high-profile governor would win a second term in Trenton.

But the big questions heading into Election Day 2013 were how large a victory Christie would capture over Barbara Buono, his little-known Democratic challenger, and how Christie would perform with voters who tend to cast ballots for Democrats.

With just about all the ballots counted, Christie won 60% of the vote, the most by a Republican statewide in more than a quarter-century

And according to CNN exit polls, Christie performed well with groups that the GOP needs to win if it wants to win national elections.

Christie carried nearly six in 10 women and won all age groups other than those 18-29, which he just missed winning. Christie also won the Latino vote and took just more than a fifth of the African-American vote, a much better performance than most Republicans in recent elections.

Christie also grabbed two-thirds of independents and a third of Democrats in a state where Democrats and independents made up nearly three-quarters of Tuesday’s electorate.

Christie, McAuliffe took different paths to victory

The exit polls appear to bolster Christie’s case that he’s among the most electable of the potential GOP White House hopefuls heading into 2016.

But if he runs for president, Christie will have to get through a battleground of conservative voters in the Republican primaries and caucuses similar to those he faced in blue-state New Jersey this year.

[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

(CNN) - Did you miss the president's interview on ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno""?

Here are five things you need to know about the interview, which marked his sixth sit-down with Leno.



1. Obama: Embassy closings aren't an overreaction

The decision to close a broad swath of American embassies and diplomatic posts across the Middle East in response to a terror threat was not an overreaction, Obama said.

The U.S. security posture throughout the Middle East, and especially in Yemen, was heightened after officials intercepted a message from al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri to a top ally in Yemen telling him to ""do something."" A worldwide travel alert was issued, along with the slate of embassy and consulate closings.

Read more: Prison breaks are among reasons for heightened security

The latest threat, Obama said, was a reminder that violent extremism still exists in the world. He stressed the importance of using caution and common sense while traveling abroad.

""The odds of dying in a terrorist attack are a lot lower than they are of dying in a car accident, unfortunately,"" Obama said.

2. Obama will attend G-20 summit in Russia

The White House announced Wednesday the president won't sit down with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, but Obama confirmed in Tuesday night's interview that he'll still attend the G-20 summit in St. Petersburg.

Read more: Obama cancels talks with Putin ahead of G-20 summit

Multiple lawmakers–Republicans and Democrats alike–called on the president to skip the meeting with Putin after Russia granted temporary asylum to the former government contractor Edward Snowden.

Asked Tuesday about Snowden, who admitted to leaking details of U.S. classified surveillance programs, Obama said he was disappointed with Russia's decision.

""Traditionally we have tried to respect if there's a lawbreaker or alleged lawbreaker in their country,"" he said. ""We evaluate it, and we try to work with them. They didn't do that with us. And in some ways it's reflective of some underlying challenges that we have had with Russia lately.""

Russia's leaders, he said, have a proclivity for slipping into a Cold War mindset; though he added essential cooperation between the two nations continues.

But will Obama call him a whistle blower?

""We don't know yet exactly what he did, other than what he said on the internet,"" the president said. ""And it's important for me not to prejudge something. Hopefully at some point he'll go to trial and he will have a lawyer and due process and we can make those decisions.""

3. Do Obama and McCain have a 'bromance'?

The president offered a laughing assessment of Sen. John McCain. The budding ""bromance"" between Obama and McCain – manifested Tuesday in the Republican senator's trip to Egypt at Obama's request – is akin to a romantic comedy, the president said.

Read more: McCain visits Egypt

""Initially, you're not getting along and then you keep bumping into each other,"" he joked.

In his opening monologue, Leno joked that McCain had been working with Egyptian leaders since ""the King Tut administration.""

But that 'bromance' may have been short-lived. After the White House announced Obama was nixing the meeting with Putin, McCain zinged the president on Twitter.

Remember: Tell Vladimir ""after my election I have more flexibility"" AP: ""Obama Cancels Meetings With Putin"" http://t.co/TVM18HFpR8 #Russia — John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) August 7, 2013

His tweet referenced a moment when Obama was heard last year requesting Putin for space on the issue of a planned U.S.-led NATO missle defense system in Europe.

""This is my last election,"" Obama told then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. ""After my election I have more flexibility.""

""I understand. I will transmit this information to Vladimir,"" Medvedev said. Putin was the incoming president at the time.

4. Hillary Clinton not measuring the White House drapes

Saying Hillary Clinton was enjoying a ""post-administration glow"" at their White House lunch last week, Obama said she doesn't need to scope out the Oval Office ahead of an anticipated 2016 presidential bid. When Leno joked the former first lady may be measuring the drapes, Obama pointed out she has plenty of experience in the executive mansion.

""Keep in mind she's been there. She doesn't have to measure them,"" he said.

5. Obama has 'no patience' for anti-LGBT laws in Russia

Responding to a question about recent legislation in Russia that cracks down on gay rights, the president said he has ""no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgender persons in ways that intimidate them or are harmful to them.""

""Do you think it will affect the Olympics?"" Leno asked the president, whose own views on the subject have evolved in the course of his presidency. Russia is slated to host the Winter Olympics in 2014, in the city of Sochi.

Obama was adamant. ""Every judgment should be made on the track, or in the swimming pool, or on the balance beam, and people's sexual orientation shouldn't have anything to do with it.""

This was the first time Obama had commented on Russia's new anti-LGBT laws, which have come under increasing scrutiny as questions mount about the country's intentions during the Olympic Games.

But the president was careful to avoid singling out Russia, pointing out that many leaders he meets with support similar legislation in their nations.

""When I traveled to Africa, there were some countries that are doing a lot of good things for their people, who we're working with and helping on development issues, but in some cases have persecuted gays and lesbians. And it makes for some uncomfortable press conferences sometimes."""

Johnson is a former high-ranking Pentagon official who was key in the repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell.""

Below, more from the AP:

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama has chosen former Pentagon lawyer Jeh (jay) Johnson as the new secretary of the Homeland Security Department.

Obama plans to announce Johnson's nomination Friday. He must be confirmed by the Senate before taking over the post most recently held by Janet Napolitano (neh-pahl-ih-TAN'-oh). Napolitano stepped down in August to become president of the University of California system.

A senior administration official on Thursday confirmed Johnson's selection, first reported by The Daily Beast. The official said Obama chose Johnson because of his experience as a national security leader.

The official was not authorized to speak about the nomination on the record and spoke on condition of anonymity.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/10/14/rollback-cuts-fuels-claims-that-government-inflated-impact-partial-shutdown/,2013-10-14 00:00:00,[],Rollback of cuts fuels claims that government inflated impact of partial shutdown,"Two weeks into the partial government shutdown, the Obama administration is increasingly easing off some of its most painful cuts -- fueling the perception among critics that the government initially imposed visible, but ultimately unnecessary, cutbacks as a way to pressure Republicans.

The Department of the Interior late last week agreed to let states use their own money to reopen some national parks. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel also determined football and other sports could continue at service academies through October.

Following outrage from military groups, the Pentagon contracted with a charity to provide death benefits to the families of fallen soldiers, before President Obama abruptly signed legislation to do just that.

Earlier, the Pentagon also announced most of its 350,000 furloughed civilian military personnel would return to their jobs. And CIA Director John Brennan said he would begin bringing back employees deemed necessary to the agency's core missions.

""It appears they are truly just making this up as they go along, as they have put out one inconsistent policy after another,"" House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings, R-Wash., said in a statement, accusing the administration of playing ""political games.""

Charges that the Obama administration exaggerated the cutbacks from the outset were amplified Sunday when hundreds of vets marched in Washington to protest the closure of popular war memorials, including open-air sites.

The group organizing the protest charged in a statement that the closure was implemented ""in a mean-spirited fit of selfish anger"" -- though the Park Service says it's trying to operate within the bounds of the law.

Congress is now entering a vital week as lawmakers try and craft a way out of the partial shutdown, with a debt-ceiling deadline looming on Thursday. With the impasse lasting perhaps longer than many anticipated, the administration's move to roll back some of the cuts has done little to staunch criticism that President Obama is making Americans feel the pain in hopes of forcing House Republicans to cave.

The criticism began when military veterans were blocked from visiting the WWII memorial on the National Mall. It hit a flash point last Wednesday when Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, who represents the District of Columbia in Congress, criticized Obama, a fellow Democrat, in a White House meeting for not allowing her city during the partial government shutdown to spend revenue controlled by the federal government.

""The president's point of view I had to take issue with"" she told Fox News after the meeting, in which she interrupted Obama a few times, according to others in attendance. ""The city is running out of its contingency funds.""

The Republican-led House agreed to free up the money, but the proposal was rejected by the Democrat-controlled Senate.

Hastings was among the first to suggest Obama was picking and choosing his targets. He pointed out that while high-profile sites like the Lincoln Memorial were closed, low-key monuments scattered throughout the District were open.

""It appears as though only the highly visible monuments and areas are being closed to the public -- further proof that the Obama administration is only playing politics and purposely choosing to make this shutdown as painful as possible,"" he said soon after the partial shutdown began.

And a National Park Service ranger told The Washington Times: ""We've been told to make life as difficult for people as we can. It's disgusting.""

The administration, in rolling back some of its cuts, argues it was compelled to act with a heavy hand at the beginning of the budget impasse.

As hundreds of thousands of Defense Department civilians were furloughed, Pentagon officials said they were waiting on a legal opinion on whether they were permitted under a recently signed law to bring back the workers.

However, they also acted as major defense contractors announced impending furloughs, including Lockheed Martin Corp. saying days earlier that it was poised to send home 3,000 workers.

The cuts themselves are supposed to be rooted in agency-by-agency plans submitted to the White House Office of Management and Budget before the partial shutdown began. Those plans are based on the legal standard that the federal government only spend money on items necessary for ""the safety of human life or the protection of property.""

Perhaps the most problematic of the cuts implemented so far for the Obama administration was the decision to withhold death benefits for the families of more than two-dozen military service members.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney last week said the president was ""very disturbed to learn of this problem"" and that he expected it to be fixed that day.

However, the administration later determined it didn't have the authority to pay the money, and a charity group would cover the cost.

The president, though, then reversed course and signed a bill authorizing the payments.

William A. Thien, national commander of Veterans of Foreign Wars, blasted Congress and the administration over its treatment of veterans during the stalemate.

""We also have a hypocritical National Park Service that closes our nation's war memorials to veterans and a federal government that continues to make foreign aid payments while our own national security is threatened because Congress has failed to pass a defense budget or put an end to the sequester,"" he said."

USATODAY

Americans are naturally suspicious of any immigration plan that promises to stop undocumented workers in the future while granting normal status to those already here.

There's good reason for that suspicion. The last major overhaul of immigration law, in 1986, granted amnesty with little enforcement. Within 20 years, the number of people in the United States illegally had swelled from 3 million to 11 million.

That failure helped torpedo a fresh effort, six years ago, to fix the nation's broken immigration system. And it explains why enforcement is the linchpin to the latest effort, announced Tuesday by a bipartisan group of eight senators.

Like the failed effort of 2007, the new measure would enhance efforts to stem illegal immigration while creating an arduous route to citizenship for the estimated 11 million. The ""Gang of Eight"" plan also changes rules for legal immigration and creates a guest-worker plan for labor-intensive industries that have relied on undocumented workers.

All these elements are important, but enforcement is the key. Politically, it is needed to get a law passed. Practically, it is needed to ensure that today's 11 million aren't followed by another 11 million.

Evidence from the past few years suggests that better enforcement is already having an impact. Demographers have been struck by the rapid decline in illegal immigration as Washington has beefed up its presence on the Mexican border and increased deportations. Also playing a part: the soft economy in the United States and the declining birth rates in Latin America.

The proposal released Tuesday includes a number of enforcement targets to be met before undocumented workers could apply for permanent residency:

It would require that all of the border with Mexico be under surveillance and that law enforcement agencies apprehend at least 90% of those trying to cross illegally in areas designated as ""high risk."" The most dubious part of the plan would provide $1.5 billion for more fencing, which has proved to be something of a boondoggle. But if this one-time expense is the price of comprehensive immigration overhaul, so be it.

It would take on the most promising area of enforcement by cracking down on illegal immigration at the workplace. Employers would be required to participate in E-Verify, a federal program that matches a prospective employee's Employment Eligibility Verification form, or I-9, with government records. Currently, the program is voluntary, though some states require it.

It would require a better system to track visitors to the U.S. For all the attention on border crossings, as many as 45% of the undocumented population enter the country legally, then simply overstay their visas.

This kind of multipronged assault on illegal immigration is necessary to prevent the tide from picking up again once the economy improves.

The Gang of Eight plan will undoubtedly undergo changes as it wends through the legislative process. But it's a good starting point for addressing one of the nation's most vexing problems."

He's a good kid—according to one of his teachers ""an A and B student who majored in cheerfulness""—although he's not above making the foolish teenaged mistake of getting caught with an empty baggie with marijuana residue inside it. But he has no criminal record. The worst anyone can say about him is that he smokes some pot, which puts him in the company of nearly half of all American high school students, something more than half of all American adults would legalize. But he's a good student and has no criminal record. In other words, he's a pretty typical teenager. A good kid.

Then one night this typical teenager is walking alone in a strange neighborhood, munching on some junk food and talking on his cell phone. And remember that we're reversing the races here, so now he's a white kid walking alone in a strange neighborhood, and it's a black man who steps out of an SUV and starts following him. A black man who outweighs the teen by nearly a hundred pounds. A black man who steps out of an SUV, pulls up a hoodie, and starts following the teen. The kid tells his friend on the cell phone that someone is following him. He tells her because he doesn't understand why someone is following him. He's nervous. He's just walking along, munching on junk food, and someone has started following him.

Finally, he decides to confront the guy. Even though he is nervous, he probably can't imagine that simply walking in a strange neighborhood would lead to someone shooting him dead. He's standing up for himself, but the thought of violence, the thought of gunfire, doesn't even enter his head. But when he confronts the big guy who had been following him, and asks why he has been following him, the big guy pulls a gun. It happens so suddenly, the teen probably barely has time to realize that something serious is now happening. This was just an innocent evening stroll, a big guy had started following him for no reason, and now his life is being threatened. This was just an innocent evening stroll, and now he's looking at a gun. Pointed at him. By a big guy who had been following him for no reason. A big guy who now shoots him dead.

Three witnesses later report having heard the boy's desperate cry for help. The police report (pdf) says he was found face down, with his hands under him. He was carrying no weapon. He was carrying no drugs. He was carrying the type of junk food typical teenagers carry. In our reversal of races scenario, the story then is that a lanky white teen was walking in a strange neighborhood, snacking on junk food, talking to a friend on his cell phone, when a large black man stepped out of an SUV, started following him, frightened him, and shot him dead. Imagine the reaction.

Now suppose we find out that the teen's killer had a history of race-based paranoia. Suppose we find out that the teen's killer's neighbors had complained of his aggressive behavior. Suppose we find out that the teen's killer had once been arrested for ""resisting arrest with violence and battery on an officer."" Suppose we find out that the teen's killer that night had ignored a police dispatcher who had told him to stop following the teen. And suppose that after all that, the much larger black man who had stepped out of an SUV, pulled up a hoodie, and started following the white teen had ended up shooting the white teen dead. What would have been the official response? What would have been the right-wing reaction?

Would a police officer have tried to coach a witness to change her story? Would the local state attorney and police chief have overruled even the lead homicide investigator, who recommended that the killer be charged with manslaughter? Would the police have neglected even to give the killer a routine drug and alcohol test? Would the police have neglected to contact whomever the kid was talking to on the phone just moments before he was shot, ignored the witnesses who contradicted the killer's story, and later reported that the killer had been bloodied in a confrontation with the dead teen, even though the real time reports suggested no such thing, and even though the police surveillance video shows the killer had no discernible wounds or discomfort, and even though the funeral director who prepared the dead teen's body for burial says there was no evidence he had been in a fight?

If Trayvon Martin had been white and George Zimmerman black, this would not have become a national story. If they had reported it at all, the right-wing media would have praised Martin for trying to stand his ground before a dangerous violent thug. It defies credulity to think they would be dismissing the killer's behavior, making despicable excuses such as blaming the kid's clothing, or if— unthinkable in this reversing-the-races scenario—there had been no criminal charges filed against the killer, dismissing the story altogether. The questions here don't even need answers. The questions answer themselves.

Had Trayvon Martin been white and George Zimmerman black, Zimmerman would be headed for death row. Right-wing media would be hailing Martin as a hero. A martyr who had stood his ground against a dangerous predator. They would be saying that it's too bad Martin hadn't somehow fought back against Zimmerman, and that if he had somehow succeeded in fighting a man so much larger than him, it would have been justifiable if he had left Zimmerman dead.

There is no polite way to explain what has happened. There is no polite way to explain the reflexive defensive rationalizations by the right-wing media and their right-wing fans. This was a racist killing with a racist cover-up and the right wing's reaction has been virulently and viciously racist. To understand the depth of the right wing's racist depravity, all it takes is to consider the very different reaction to this horror had the races of the victim and his killer been reversed.

Welcome to post-racial America."

Washington (CNN) - One day before President Barack Obama gives a prime time speech to make his case against Syria, a new national poll indicates the president's approval rating on foreign policy has hit an all-time low. And only three in ten approve of how he is handling Syria.

But according to a CNN/ORC International survey, the number of Americans who approve of how Obama is handling his job in general remains steady.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Only four in ten approve of the job Obama is doing on foreign policy, with 57% of those questioned giving the president a thumbs down. The 40% approval rating on foreign policy is Obama's lowest level ever on that issue in CNN polling.

The CNN poll's Monday release comes as the president sits down for interviews with the country's major broadcast and cable news networks, including CNN, to push for congressional authorization for U.S. military action to punish the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for allegedly using chemical weapons against its own citizens.

""President Obama's approval rating on foreign affairs has continued its steady decline - from 54% in January to 49% in April, 44% in June, and just 40% now,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""This may be a troubling sign for a president who in past polls had always scored his highest ratings for his handling of foreign affairs.""

Specifically on Syria, only 31% of the public approves of the president's policies and actions, with 63% giving him a thumbs down. Four in ten Democrats say they disapprove of the job Obama's doing on Syria, with 54% saying they approve.

There is a wide partisan divide on this question, with only 26% of independents and just nine percent of Republicans approving of how Obama is handling the situation in Syria, which is suffering through two years of a bloody civil war between government forces and various rebel factions.

""The number of Democrats who disapprove of how the president's handling Syria may cause problems for the White House,"" adds Holland. ""Given his low approval scores on Syria among independents and Republicans, the 40% of Democrats who disapprove may mean there is no base to rally on this key issue.""

The president's overall approval rating stands at 45%, with 52% saying they disapprove of the job he's doing in the White House. The 45% approval rating is unchanged from CNN's previous poll, which was conducted in June.

""An unchanged overall approval rating perhaps comes as a surprise to some observers, but arguably the unpopularity of military action against Syria is balanced by the fact that the public wanted the president to consult with Congress before taking action on Syria, and that's exactly what he did,"" adds Holland.

The 45% approval rating is not Obama's lowest mark in CNN polling. His all-time low was a 43% approval rating in September of 2011.

The poll also indicates the president's approval rating on the economy stands at 43% on the economy, 42% on health care, and 36% on the budget deficit, all basically unchanged from earlier this year.

While the president's overall approval rating is nothing to brag about, it's still soars above Congress. According to the CNN poll, only one in five give federal lawmakers a thumbs up on the job they're doing on Capitol Hill, with 78% saying they disapprove.

The CNN poll was conducted by ORC International September 6-8, with 1,022 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points."

The jobs of most of the workers who used to make Twinkies and other Hostess cakes, and their union, are not coming back. Which the Associated Press presents as just another way for a company to compete for profits. (Shoot, the race to the bottom on wages and benefits is pretty muchway companies compete for profits these days.) Media Matters highlights how the AP presents the story of the Hostess bankruptcy largely from the viewpoint of the company's executives. You know, workers say this, management says that, the workers lost their jobs and/or their union, but hey, look over here at the creamy filling and the dark cocoa being added to the cupcakes.

So since, with the brand's reappearance on convenience store shelves, we're going to be hearing a lot of these management-view thumbnail sketches of how Hostess went under, let's recap some of what you won't hear as much:

Unionized Hostess workers made major concessions, taking pay and benefits cuts. That money was supposed to be reinvested into the company. It wasn't.

As the company was struggling, its CEO pay skyrocketed, and as it was going into bankruptcy, Hostess pushed to give $1.75 million in bonuses to top executives.

Hostess claimed it had to close plants because workers went on strike, but in fact, the company was already planning to close nine bakeries and wasn't telling which ones.

Hostess stole its workers' pension money to fund itself and still went bankrupt.

went bankrupt. And, as Media Matters points out, ""while the AP story claims that ""workers"" are blaming the company's woes on mismanagement and a failure to adapt to evolving consumer tastes, this has actually been the opinion of informed and objective third parties.""

This is the real story of Hostess: high pay and mismanagement at the top, concessions at the bottom, blame to the workers despite those concessions. Don't forget that as you're sinking your teeth into a creamy retro treat."

Because compared to what?,” Pelosi said during a press briefing in the Capitol. “Compared to Republicans saying Medicare should wither on the vine? Social Security has no place in a free society?” Citing a Kaiser Foundation analysis indicating that raising Medicare's eligibility age would cost the government money, Pelosi said such a move is simply ""trophy-taking."" “It's just a scalp,” she said. “It doesn't save money.”

“Why are we doing this?” Dem Rep. Keith Ellison, a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said to me in an interview today. Asked which is worse, continued sequestration or a grand bargain that cuts entitlement benefits, Ellison said: “It’s like saying, `Which of your kids do you want to sacrifice to the monster?’ Neither one.” [...] “Once we do that we’re already in the territory of bargaining away Chained CPI,” Ellison said. “We’re already saying we’re open to negotiating on Chained CPI. And we’re not.” [...] Ellison pointed out that Republicans aren’t as quick as Dems to signal a willingness to trade away core priorities at the outset. “Republicans don’t do that,” he said.

President Obama told Republicans he means it when he says he wants to cut Medicare and Social Security, and now he's got Nancy Pelosi backing him up, at least on cutting Social Security benefits through the chained CPI.We've been through this ""protect the most vulnerable"" business before on the issue of the chained CPI, and the question remains, how do you define that ? By the time you exempt all of the people who should be kept safe from this cut, the savings would be trivial to the pain caused. Which sounds an awful lot like a meaningless trophy for the Republicans. Pelosi could just be showing that Democrats are reasonable compared to Republicans, blah, blah, blah, blah. But she's also undercutting what has been key rhetoric for Democrats in all of these budget fights: we won't reduce the deficit on the backs of poor/elderly/middle class/working Americans. So why even go near breaking that promise? That's what liberals in the House are asking, too. Here's Rep. Keith Ellison talking to Greg Sargent Ellison has got more than 100 House Democrats with him, who have signed pledge to President Obama to oppose any of these cuts. They need to cc Pelosi on that letter, and perhaps to remind her that her path to regaining the speakership lies in not pissing away the core Democratic base.

Send an email to the White House telling President Obama to immediately stop proposing any cuts to Social Security."

(CNN) —

Dr. Mehmet Oz is being sued for injures sustained by a New Jersey man. Was this person under Dr. Oz’ care? Was he someone Dr. Oz had spoken with about a medical issue? Did Dr. Oz, in an uncharacteristic fit of anger, punch the Jersey guy?

Nope. This man is simply one of the millions of people who have watched Dr. Oz on TV over the years. So why is he suing? Because, the plaintiff claims, he was injured when he tried Dr. Oz’ home sleep remedy known as the “Knapsack Heated Rice Footsie.”

Shake your head in disbelief all you want, but this is far from the most ludicrous lawsuit we have seen in recent years.

Dean Obeidallah

Who can forget the Michigan woman who filed a lawsuit in 2011 against the producers of the film “Drive”? Her complaint alleged that she was misled by the movie’s trailer which promised “Fast and the Furious” type driving, which, alas, the film didn’t deliver.

And then there was the lawsuit filed last year against the Dallas Cowboys by a woman claiming she sustained burns on her legs. What did she say the Cowboys did wrong? She claims they failed to warn her that sitting for an extended period of time on a black bench outside the Cowboys’ stadium on a hot August day could cause burns.

More? Well, while in Tennessee, a couple sued Steak ‘n Shake after their son ingested a sauce labeled “Mega Death Hot Sauce.” It should be noted that the sauce bottle bears the image of a skull engulfed in flames.

And that brings us to Dr. Oz. On his April 17, 2012, show, he offered advice about how to sleep better. One suggestion was filling the toe of a pair of socks with uncooked rice. The socks were then to be placed in the microwave and heated until warm. However, Dr. Oz expressly warned viewers, “Don’t get it too hot, just warm.”

The heated footsie was then to be worn for 20 minutes. The reasoning being that the heated socks will cause blood to be diverted to your feet, which in turn will cool the rest of your body. As Dr. Oz explained, “you’re going to be able to sleep better because your body has to be cold in order to be sleepy.”

However, the plaintiff claims that he suffered third degree burns from this remedy. How? Well, he apparently fell asleep with the socks on and didn’t realize his feet had been burned until he woke up in the middle of night and tried to walk. The plaintiff also claims that Dr. Oz should have offered a specific warning to avoid using this remedy to people who, like him, have diabetes and hence less feeling in their feet.

Let’s be honest: These above lawsuits are at best legally questionable and at worst frivolous. But don’t blame the person seeking the money. Blame the lawyers.

Personal injury lawyers have enticed people for years with their TV commercials and ads on the walls of buses and trains telling us that if you have been wronged, you might be entitled to a big cash award or settlement. This is, of course, followed by the line: “We don’t get paid unless you do.”

So, understandably, people flock to these lawyers with complaints about every imaginable wrong seeking a payday. The lawyers then file lawsuits, hoping for a quick settlement so that they can do as little work as possible before seeing their own payday.

Full disclosure: When I practiced law, I represented corporations against lawsuits. Consequently, I’m a bit biased against plaintiffs’ lawyers. But it’s easy for even a non-corporate lawyer to see that these ridiculous lawsuits give the reputable plaintiffs’ attorneys – and, frankly, all lawyers – a black eye.

It’s not that I’m without sympathy for the growing number of lawyers out there struggling to make ends meet. The practice of law has grown increasingly competitive and challenging. I can understand the lure of taking a questionable case that will reap you some media coverage and money.

But that’s not a good enough reason to do it. Lawyers need to collectively rein in these types of cases. If they don’t, the government will do it for them under the guise of “tort reform.” The new laws that result would in all likelihood make it harder to file a lawsuit and would limit damages in personal injury cases. And this will make it even more challenging for lawyers to earn a living. Worse, these reforms may prevent some truly injured people from receiving the full compensation they deserve because of caps on damages.

As for Dr. Oz, I hope that he doesn’t settle quickly out of court. Instead, I hope they fully litigate this case. In all likelihood he will prevail. But even if the plaintiff does ultimately win, it still will have sent a clear message to plaintiffs’ attorneys who take these legally questionable cases: If you want money, you are going to have to really earn it.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Almost one year ago, the blond stunner married the ""R.I.P.D."" actor in a secret ceremony. The style icon and former ""Gossip Girl"" star covers the September 2013 issue of Lucky magazine, and inside its pages she dishes about life as a new wife.

“I was recently asked how my style has changed since I got married, as if I was living under some sort of dictatorship,” Lively told Lucky. “I should hope I dress differently at 25 than I did when I graduated high school. I hope I never stop changing.”

Lively, 25, and Reynolds, 36, dated for almost a year before they tied the knot in Charleston, S.C., last September. Her fashion sense was as on-point as ever for her wedding day. She opted for a Marchesa ""cloudlike silk tulle"" gown featuring crystals and rose-gold embroidery.

Of course, her red carpet moments are no less fabulous now that she's a married woman, but some things are different. These days, you are more likely to see her in the aisles of Home Depot than in the front row at a fashion show. She is in the process of decorating the Bedford, N.Y., abode she shares with her hubby. Currently, she has her heart set on ""a handcrafted Rosemary Hallgarten rug and the perfect midcentury Danish side table from Etsy."" She credits Reynolds with having ""better taste"" (although we find that hard to believe), but says they influence each other in different ways.

“Work is important, but my greatest passion is my personal life,” she added.

Earlier this month, Reynolds told Details magazine that ""words are too clumsy"" to accurately express how he feels about his love. However, the notoriously private actor -- who has had very public romances and breakups with Alanis Morissette and Scarlett Johansson -- did reveal that he and Lively might be parents to a large brood someday.

""We'd love to have a big family,"" he said. ""We both come from big families -- my parents did four, Blake's did five. A lot of people say it's crazy, but we'll only know when we're there, you know? We'll walk through that fire pretty happily, I think.""

http://news.yahoo.com/five-lessons-learn-george-washington-farewell-address-102413757.html,,[],Five lessons we can learn from George Washington’s Farewell Address,"On September 19, 1796, a Philadelphia newspaper published one of the greatest documents in American history: George Washington’s Farewell Address. Even today, some people in that other “Washington” could learn a few lessons from the first president.

washington1795

Link:

Read the entire Farewell Address

Washington’s letter was significant in two ways: It signaled that he wasn’t running for a third term in office, and it served as a warning—and an inspiration—for future generations.

No less a critic than Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall said the address spoke to “precepts to which the American statesman can not too frequently recur.”

So what makes the Farewell Address such a great speech? Here are five lessons we can learn from the first president about communicating.

1. Use great speechwriters

President Washington first considered a Farewell Address four years earlier, but the infighting between Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson made Washington run for a second term, and he put the speech aside.

At the time, Washington asked James Madison to write a draft Farewell Address for his consideration. Then, in 1796, Washington asked his longtime aide, Hamilton, to do an extensive rewrite based on Washington’s concepts.

In the end, Washington stayed true to the points he felt were important, and he used elements of Madison and Hamilton’s work, too. But Washington wrote out the speech in his own handwriting and he was its final editor.

The University of Virginia has an excellent online analysis of all the drafts.

2. Get right to the point

In the opening paragraph, Washington makes it clear by end of the first sentence that he isn’t running for a third term of office. How often do you hear political speeches today where the major point is addressed immediately?

3. Make sure you thank everyone

In his second paragraph, Washington thanked the American people for the opportunity to serve—even though he was a near unanimous choice for president in two elections.

Story continues

“I am influenced by no diminution of zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful respect for your past kindness, but am supported by a full conviction that the step is compatible with both,” he says.

4. Make sure you unite your audience

After Washington thanked everyone and made sure they understood his decision was best for the country, he reminded the audience that they neededto remain united, despite their many differences.

“The name of American, which belongs to you, in your national capacity must always exalt the just pride of Patriotism, more than any appellation derived from local discriminations,” he says.

He also added a reminder about the then nine-year-old Constitution.

“I shall carry it with me to my grave, as a strong incitement to unceasing vows that heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence; that your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free Constitution, which is the work of your hands, may be sacredly maintained; that its administration in every department may be stamped with wisdom and virtue,” he says.

5. Offer advice in a thoughtful way

Most of the address is an extended policy statement about Washington’s eight years in office, as well some extended statements intended to make a point.

The two most famous statements in the Farewell Address are comments about political parties and foreign alliances. Washington didn’t like the idea of political parties (which he called “baneful”) and made that clear in a concluding statement in a passage about factions. “The common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it,” he said.

The president also famously warned that the United States should stay “steer clear of permanent Alliances with any portion of the foreign world.” Washington didn’t say that the young nation should be isolationist; in fact, he said that it should “observe good faith and justice towards all nations.”

But his advice was that any permanent alliance should be considered greatly, even he wasn’t a big believer in them. “I hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private affairs, that honesty is always the best policy. I repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed in their genuine sense. But, in my opinion, it is unnecessary and would be unwise to extend them,” he added.

After the address was published in David C. Claypoole’s American Daily Advertiser and then republished in countless newspapers and pamphlets, it appeared to be well received by the public.

However, it set off a frantic race to replace Washington that featured John Adams and Thomas Jefferson that helped to permanently create the political party system that Washington despised.

In later years, the Farewell Address letter gained new importance. In 1825, both Jefferson and Madison recommended the Farewell Address to the University of Virginia, as one of the best guides possible to the ideals of American government. During the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln recommended its public reading as a reminder.

And every year, a member of the U.S. Senate is asked to read the Farewell Address in public.

Story highlights Ted Cruz does not play by Senate rules, irritating traditionalists on both sides of the aisle Unapologetic, Cruz says he was elected to do a job that includes shrinking government Cruz ups ante in battle to derail Obamacare, but will he chart new course or stumble? Latest crusade that threatens gov't shutdown frustrates many -- including some in his own party

(CNN) —

Ted Cruz says he wasn’t elected to the Senate to stay quiet. And his refusal upon entering Congress to observe its protocol to sit back and learn like a freshman, as expected, rubbed some of his more senior colleagues the wrong way.

And while he has angered much of his party over his crusade against President Barack Obama’s health care law and the potential government shutdown it could cause, Cruz says he’s standing for the same principles that got him elected.

On Tuesday, he took that edict to the Senate floor in support of his plan to defund Obamacare, saying he would speak “until I am no longer able to stand.”

But his marathon appearance will not do anything to block Obamacare funding with a key procedural vote on the issue still scheduled for Wednesday. Instead, Cruz said his speech was to simply “make D.C. listen.”

Critics question his motives, though — is this about his principles or about presidential aspirations?

CNN political analyst Gloria Borger said his Republican detractors think Cruz is putting his political career above all else.

“While many others have, no doubt, come to the Senate in the past as a springboard to the presidency, it’s hard to recall someone who has created as much controversy within his own party,” Borger said.

Cruz has been in Washington for less than a year, but his short stint has been an effective lesson in partisan politics. Only history will tell, however, if his tactics will be worth repeating.

The Texas Republican’s counterparts in the House of Representatives have tried 42 times to roll back Obamacare, but their efforts have gone nowhere in the Democratic-controlled Senate.

Cruz has upped the ante. His latest battle to disrupt Obamacare is tied to funding the government in the new fiscal year that starts on October 1. The House passed the measure last week. But Senate Democrats are not about to allow the health care bill to be unraveled, therefore putting at risk a government shutdown.

Cruz’s refusal to give up the fight has rankled many of his fellow Republicans, widening divisions in a splintered party. Democrats, meanwhile, are sitting back and watching the intraparty fight.

Who is this guy?

His effectiveness at political debate has landed Cruz in many successful places. He was elected to the Senate in 2012, after rebuking the Republican establishment and winning the Republican primary, paving the way to a general election victory.

Previously, he was the youngest solicitor general of Texas and has argued multiple cases before the Supreme Court. He got his start at Princeton as head of the debate team and then honed his skill at Harvard Law School.

What’s his fight?

Cruz did not take his Senate responsibilities lightly. As a freshman, he refused to stand on the sidelines until he’s gained a measure of seniority, a common tradition in Washington. Instead, he was loud and opinionated.

“I find it amusing that those in Washington are puzzled when someone actually does what they said they would do,” Cruz told CNN in February. “At the end of the day, I was elected to represent 26 million Texans and to speak the truth. You know, I think a lot of Americans are tired of politicians in Washington in both parties who play games.

Cruz was elected, promising to shrink government, especially the new health care law. That battle has been embraced by most Republicans in Congress, but his latest tactic has frustrated many.

Political novice...?

New York Rep. Peter King has been an outspoken critic of Cruz’ latest crusade — at one point calling him a “fraud.”

“Whether it’s Custer, whether it’s kamikaze, or whether it’s Gallipoli or whatever, we are going to lose this,” the New York Republican said on CNN’s “The Situation Room” last week.

And Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee tweeted that he “didn’t go to Harvard or Princeton” but that he “can count” that Democrats outnumber Republicans in the Senate.

But Cruz said to let his critics talk.

“If you get outside of Washington, D.C., there is a frustration with Washington that is palpable. When you ask your constituents what are the problems you’re facing, over and over again, the answer that comes back is Obamacare is killing jobs, is taking away my health insurance, is driving up my premiums, is causing small businesses to shrink, to go out of business. If we listen to the American people, that should be our priorities,” he told CNN this week.

Still, Republicans are frustrated by his insistence at fighting a divisive, losing battle.

’Don’t break filibuster’

“We are giving Obama the escape out,” Republican strategist Ana Navarro said on CNN’s ‘AC360.’ “Instead of now focusing on the problems with Obamacare, everybody’s focused on the civil war in the Republican party.”

Navarro also noted that the numerous polls, including CNN’s latest poll, that while the public is concerned with Obamacare, they don’t support shutting down the government over it.

“If you want to fix Obamacare or repeal it or fix it or change it, the best way to do it is to elect more Republicans. And the political cost of a government shutdown is really going to affect any – any possibility of electing more Republicans,” Navarro added.

…or political genius?

While Cruz is ruffling the feathers of his colleagues in Washington, he is mobilizing the grassroots outside the Beltway.

Conservative groups are praising Cruz.

“Senator Cruz came to Washington to advance conservative policies, not play by the same old rules that have relegated conservatives, and their ideas, to the back bench,” Michael Needham, president of Heritage Action, recently said about Cruz.

His group helps activate grass roots Republicans for conservative candidates and political causes.

And Republican candidates running against Republican incumbents in the primaries are using Cruz’ crusade in their races.

Matt Bevin, who is running for Senate to replace top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell, said in a statement that he would support “conservatives like Sen. Ted Cruz in his fight to defund Obamacare.”

Obamacare: Can it be stopped?

Bevin bashed McConnell for coming out against Cruz’ effort to shut down the government in order to stop Obamacare.

Like so many other crucial fights, Mitch McConnell has caved to (Senate Majority Leader) Harry Reid on Obamacare and is refusing to fight to defund this disastrous legislation.”

And long-time Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming came out in support of Cruz. He is facing Liz Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, in a contentious primary.

Will Cruz be scarred or be a star?

Cruz could alienate his colleagues to a point where he becomes marginalized and completely ineffective in Washington.

He has also hinted at a possible presidential run in 2016. If he has no support of the Republican Party, he risks being cut off from its resources and financing.

On the other hand, Cruz’ principled stand can help to grow a movement of disenchanted conservative voters. If a groundswell of conservative grassroots activists grows between now and 2016 – and their financial support - Cruz could have carved out a path to the Republican nomination.

“I think what Senator Cruz understands is that he has more to gain from adhering to his principles, staying in touch with the grass roots here and around the country than he does being friends with other senators,” Brendan Steinhauser, a leading Texas tea party activist who worked to get Cruz elected, said.

Elizabeth Warren calls for the release of trade documents,"President Barack Obama’s administration should release documents the U.S. and 10 other Pacific-region nations are using as they negotiate a new trade agreement, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said. In a letter to Michael Froman, Obama’s nominee to lead the U.S. Trade Representative’s office, the Massachusetts lawmaker said releasing details of what is being considered by the parties would give citizens a chance to evaluate the deal before negotiations are completed. “I appreciate the willingness of the USTR to make various documents available for review by members of Congress, but I do not believe that is a substitute for more robust public transparency,” Warren wrote to Froman, who is now an assistant to the president. “If transparency would lead to widespread public opposition to a trade agreement, then that trade agreement should not be the policy of the United States.”

Trade rules affect nearly every aspect of our lives -- the food we eat, the air we breathe, the water we drink, the price of medicines we may need, the jobs we depend on. It is therefore absolutely critical that the public has a say in how trade rules are formulated and implemented. Today, trade rules are usually written under a cloud of secrecy. For example, the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- potentially the largest free trade agreement ever -- has been under negotiation for over three years and may conclude as early as this October. And yet, not a single word of draft text has been released to the public. Without draft text, the public is left to guess what may be included in trade deals and is unable to meaningfully engage. Responsible trade begins with public participation.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren continues to fight for government transparency. This time, she's taking on the U.S. Trade Representative’s office: She seems to be hinting that if the general public knew the details of these secret negotiations, they would be staunchly opposed to the new deal. When Michael Froman was nominated for the post of U.S. Trade Representative in early May, Ilana Solomon at the Huffington Post said his #1 priority should be transparency: Hats off to Sen. Warren for once again demanding transparency and action.

Want to see more transparency in trade negotiations? Sign our petition backing up Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s request that all documents being used to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership be released for review by the public."

President Barack Obama may find opposition from inside his own party if he is serious about making changes to the way Social Security benefits are distributed in order to pass a deal to replace sequestration.

A majority of the House Democrats -- 107 members -- sent Obama a letter on Friday stating that any changes to entitlements will be opposed by members of his own party.

""We remain deeply opposed to proposals to reduce Social Security benefits through use of the chained CPI to calculate cost-of-living adjustments,"" reads the letter, which was the idea of Reps. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), John Conyers (D-Mich.) and Donna Edwards (D-Md.).

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney recently said the president would be open to implementing chained Consumer Price Index (CPI), which would alter the annual adjustment in how benefits are paid to Social Security recipients by using a less generous baseline of inflation.

""He has put forward a technical change, as part of a big deal,"" said Carney. ""A technical change of CPI is possible as part of a big deal.""

He added, however, that the president is opposed to raising the eligibility age of Medicare.

Progressives have opposed chained CPI because it would reduce the benefits that senior citizens receive.

The letter stated that while House Democrats are ""committed to making the changes that will extend solvency for 75 years,"" Social Security has not negatively contributed to any of the country's fiscal problems so ""it should not be on the bargaining table.""

House Democrats reiterated in the letter their ""vigorous opposition to cutting Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid benefits in any final bill.""

In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama stressed the need for ""modest reforms"" to entitlements. This was met by a positive response by congressional Republicans who have long wanted changes to entitlement programs.

Ellison, co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, also told The Huffington Post on Tuesday after Obama's SOTU speech that he was concerned about possible changes to entitlements.

""I think there are things that can be done to reform social insurance, such as to engage in competitive bidding for prescription drug prices. But he didn't mention that. He just sort of raised the issue, which raised a lot of questions about what did he have in mind,"" said Ellison, who added that he liked the overall speech's focus on income inequality and concern for low-wage workers.

Lawmakers want to avoid a series of automatic deep spending cuts due to kick in March 1 unless Congress comes up with an $85-billion replacement plan.

All Democrats on the committee, along with Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and gang of eight Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), voted in favor of the bill, which will now go to the Senate floor. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who voted against the bill out of committee, said he would support allowing it to move forward for debate -- rather than joining a filibuster -- once on the Senate floor. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who was also a ""no"" vote, said if it had been between his vote and moving the bill to the Senate floor, he would have voted in favor.

The crowd in the room erupted into applause when the final vote tally was read, rising to their feet and chanting ""Yes we can!"" then ""Si se puede!""

Democrats seemed equally pleased to vote the bill out of committee.

""The dysfunction in our current immigration system affects all of us and it is long past time for reform,"" Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said before the bill's passage. ""I hope that our history, our values, and our decency can inspire us finally to take action. We need an immigration system that lives up to American values and helps write the next great chapter in American history by reinvigorating our economy and enriching our communities.""

Of 300 amendments offered to the gang of eight immigration bill, the committee debated more than 200.

The bill came out of months of work from the gang of eight, which in addition to Graham and Flake includes Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.). It includes a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, a streamlined legal immigration process, tougher interior enforcement and increased border security.

One of the final issues to settle was over high-skilled worker visas called H1-Bs. An amendment that simplifies the process for companies to bring in workers in science, technology, engineering and math eventually passed on a voice vote. Hatch and Schumer came to a compromise that led Hatch to agree to vote the full bill out of committee, although he did not commit to supporting its eventual passage.

It was a tough vote for Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who has previously been wary of expanding H1-B visas. He voted in favor, however, citing the need for compromise and to get the bill through.

""We've made concessions I never thought we'd have to make ... but we've made those concessions to win your support,"" Durbin said to Hatch. ""We need your support, and we want to pass this bill.""

The amendment came under fire from the AFL-CIO labor federation, which said the measure would hurt American workers.

""There is no reason why this strong coalition should accept anti-worker amendments,"" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a statement. ""And let's be clear: Senator Orrin Hatch's H-1B amendments are unambiguous attacks on American workers.""

Some measures praised highly by immigrant rights advocates never went to a vote. Leahy brought up his amendment to allow LGBT couples equal protection under immigration law, but withdrew it ""with a heavy heart"" when it became clear Democrats were willing to drop it so the bill would pass.

A number of provisions lauded by advocates did make it in. The committee voted on Monday to approve Blumenthal's amendment that would block immigration raids in sensitive areas such as schools, hospitals and places of worship, except in extreme circumstances. A separate Blumenthal measure to restrict the use of solitary confinement in immigrant detention also passed on Monday, also on a voice vote.

Although many Republican amendments failed, some GOP senators, such as Hatch, were more successful than others. The committee voted on Monday to require a mandatory biometric exit system at airports with the highest volume of international air travel -- something Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) wanted to do nationwide but without success.

Amendments deemed poison pills failed, unsurprisingly. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) attempted to add a change that would strip the bill of its path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, which is considered absolutely necessary to the bill by President Barack Obama, Democrats and some Republicans. Five Republicans voted for that amendment, while three -- Hatch, Graham and Flake -- joined Democrats in opposing it.

Leahy said the amendment would gut the bill, while Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said ""it goes against everything America stands for."" Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) similarly disparaged another failed Cruz amendment, this one to bar currently undocumented immigrants from ever being eligible for welfare benefits such as Medicaid and food stamps, saying he doesn't think such an America is one he'd want to live in.

Sessions was also unsuccessful in his efforts to amend the bill, offering 49 amendments and seeing nearly every one that went for a vote fail. On one amendment last week Sessions was the sole ""yes"" vote, with all of his Republican colleagues abandoning him in his effort to limit legal immigration.

Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) was one of the rare Democrats to offer an amendment that the gang of eight took down. Schumer and Durbin told her they had to reluctantly oppose her attempt on Tuesday to add a change that would expand family visas so that people in extreme hardship could petition for green cards for their adult children or siblings. It failed with 7 votes in support and 11 against, including Democrats Schumer, Durbin, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), all of whom said it was a good amendment but would upset the delicate balance of the gang of eight bill.

""Your heart's in the right place, your amendment's in the wrong place,"" Durbin said to Hirono.

President Barack Obama applauded the committee for passing the bill.

""None of the Committee members got everything they wanted, and neither did I, but in the end, we all owe it to the American people to get the best possible result over the finish line,"" he said in a statement. ""I encourage the full Senate to bring this bipartisan bill to the floor at the earliest possible opportunity and remain hopeful that the amendment process will lead to further improvements.""

Now that the bill passed the Senate Judiciary Committee, it has to go to the Senate floor, where gang of eight members are hopeful it will pass. Schumer and McCain, who is not on the Judiciary Committee, have said they would like to win over a majority of both parties -- around 70 votes in total."

(CNN) – Two Republican lawmakers are asking a government agency to look into a recent trip to Cuba by Beyoncé and Jay-Z, suggesting the superstar couple violated restrictions on travel to the communist island.

“Despite the clear prohibition against tourism in Cuba, numerous press reports described the couple’s trip as tourism, and the Castro regime touted it as such in its propaganda,” Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Mario Diaz-Balart, both of Florida, wrote in the letter to the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control.



Beyoncé and Jay-Z were photographed in Havana last week, apparently celebrating their fifth wedding anniversary on the island. While Cuba was a popular getaway for Americans in the 1950s, spending money there was outlawed after Fidel Castro took power in 1959.

In 2012 the Obama administration lifted some of the restrictions on travel to Cuba, instituting a “people-to-people” travel program that requires a strict itinerary for vacationers.

""Each traveler must have a full-time schedule of educational exchange activities that will result in meaningful interaction between the travelers and individuals in Cuba,"" U.S. Treasury Department guidelines read.

Asked about Beyoncé's and Jay-Z's recent trip, Treasury Department Spokesman John Sullivan said only ""I can't comment on specific licenses.""

Americans have been known to get around travel restrictions to Cuba in the past by stopping first in a country with flights to the island. Cuban customs officials are familiar enough with the practice to not stamp American passports when they cross their desks.

In their letter the Treasury Department, Ros-Lehtinen and Diaz-Balart noted their connection to “a community of many who have been deeply and personally harmed by the Castro regime’s atrocities, including former political prisoners and the families of murdered innocents.”

“The restrictions on tourism travel are common-sense measures meant to prevent U.S. dollars from supporting a murderous regime that opposes U.S. security interests at every turn and which ruthlessly suppresses the most basic liberties of speech, assembly, and belief,” they wrote. “We support the Cuban people by refusing to sustain their jailers.”

Other lawmakers held different views, such as Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona.

""So, @Beyonce and Jay-Z @S_C_ are in Cuba? Fine by me. Every American should have the right to travel there,"" he wrote on Twitter.

http://uk.news.yahoo.com/boston-bombings-wrong-suspect-reveals-fears-102911067.html,,[],Boston Bombings: Wrong Suspect Reveals Fears,"A teenager says he fears for his safety after internet vigilantes wrongly identified him as a suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings and he was pictured on the front of the New York Post.

Boston student Salah Eddin Barhoum, 17, was pictured near the finish line with his friend Yassine Zaime wearing baseball caps and carrying bags.

The images were published on several websites which claimed their demeanour was suspicious and they could be responsible for the attacks.

The New York Post published one of the pictures on their front page under the headline ""Bag Men"" and claimed federal agents were hunting for them.

The front page set off a wave of speculation on Twitter as users began re-tweeting the pictures and a massive search began for the boys.

Salah said he suddenly began receiving messages from people who recognised him and began blaming him for the attacks.

One person from Oregon reportedly asked him: ""How could you do that? Did you even think about the consequences?""

He was so frightened by being wrongly implicated that he ran back to school on Thursday when he saw a man staring at him, he said.

The New York Post later admitted the men were not suspects. But Salah says the damage has been done and people will still blame him for the attack.

""I'm going to be scared going to school,"" he said. ""Workwise, my family, everything is going to be scary.""

His father moved his family to the US from Morocco five years ago. He says he is worried his son could be shot and fears for his wife and two young daughters.

""Right now, we are not secure,"" he said. ""When the news put something out they should be sure about the information.""

Salah - a track runner at Boston's Revere High School - said he was only identified as a suspect because he was carrying a shoulder bag and has dark skin.

He was at the marathon with Yassine as they hoped to run a portion of it behind the official field of runners. Salah said his bag contained his running gear and shoes.

The New York Post has said it stands by its story. The paper’s editor Col Allan, said: ""The image was emailed to law enforcement agencies yesterday afternoon seeking information about these men, as our story reported. We did not identify them as suspects."""
http://news.yahoo.com/2-years-immigration-laws-ga-143745728.html,,[],"2 years after immigration laws, Ga., Ala., stable","VIDALIA, Ga. (AP) -- Two years after Georgia and Alabama passed laws designed to drive away people living in the country illegally, the states' agricultural areas are still heavily populated with foreign workers, many of whom don't have legal authorization to be here.

There are still concerns over enforcement and lingering fears among immigrants, but in many ways it appears that people have gone on with life much as it was before the laws were enacted.

Farmers say many of the foreign workers have returned because the laws are not heavily enforced and it once again seems safe to be here.

But the story is more complicated than that: Some are still staying away or have gone underground, according to community activists, and some farmers say they are filling labor shortages not with returning immigrants but with workers hired through a program that grants temporary legal visas.

Meanwhile, employers and workers in both states are watching as Congress wrestles over plans that aim to simultaneously prevent future illegal immigration and offer a chance at citizenship for millions now living in the country illegally.

Georgia and Alabama were two of five states to pass tough crackdowns on illegal immigration in 2011, a year after Arizona made headlines for a hard-line immigration enforcement law that ended up being challenged in the U.S. Supreme Court.

Immediately after the laws were passed, farmers in both states complained that foreign workers who lived there had left and that the itinerant migrants who generally came through were staying away. American workers weren't stepping forward to perform the back-breaking work immigrants had done for years, and crops were rotting in the fields because of a lack of laborers, they said.

An informal survey conducted in Georgia showed that farmers of onions, watermelons and other hand-picked crops lacked more than 11,000 workers during their spring and summer harvests of 2011, Georgia Department of Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black told a U.S. Senate subcommittee hearing on immigration enforcement and farm labor.

Story continues

But then as courts began blocking significant elements of the law and some loopholes became apparent, some of the workers who had fled for fear of arrest and deportation returned. Others were drawn back by their longstanding ties to the communities.

Victor Valentin, 25, and his wife, Maria Gonzales, 23, came to the Vidalia onion growing region in south Georgia five years ago and found work quickly. But when the state passed its law cracking down on illegal immigration, they feared they would be caught and deported, and left for neighboring North Carolina.

They didn't last long. With two young children and no support network there, life was difficult. At the same time, the situation in Georgia seemed to have calmed down.

""We still talked to people here, and we heard there weren't really any problems, that things hadn't really changed,"" Valentin said, explaining that the family decided to return to the Vidalia area after about nine months. He's found work harvesting pine straw since his return.

This year, Black and a number of industry leaders in Georgia told The Associated Press they haven't heard of any labor shortages.

The situation in Alabama is similar.

""No one seems to be having any problems,"" said Alabama's agriculture commissioner, John McMillan, who added that he has spoken with farmers who saw migrants return once it became clear the law passed in Alabama was, in practice, mostly toothless. Courts blocked most of the law's toughest sections, including one that required public schools to check students' citizenship status, and the massive arrests envisioned by some simply didn't happen.

Also, according to government statistics, thousands of employers in Alabama have been ignoring a provision in the state's immigration law that requires them to register with the federal E-Verify system, a program to electronically verify workers' legal status.

And yet, at least in Georgia, the story is a bit more complicated than it may seem on the surface.

Some migrant families — both legally and illegally in the country — are indeed still avoiding Georgia because they fear discrimination and profiling, said Andrea Hinojosa, a community organizer who has worked with Latino workers in the Vidalia area for more than 20 years.

Other laborers who had worked their way up from the fields into more stable factory or construction work have turned to less stable jobs because businesses are starting to use E-Verify, a key provision of the Georgia law, Hinojosa said.

""I think it has probably put people back into hiding, put them back in the shadows,"" Hinojosa said. ""It doesn't mean they're not working. It could mean that they have just found a job where they can't be detected.""

Maria Barbosa, a legal permanent resident from Mexico, opened Los Olivos, a store that caters to the Vidalia area's Latino population, in July 2008. She estimates that her profits at the store, which stocks international phone cards, traditional foods and party supplies, dropped by about 30 percent after Georgia's law passed. It has rebounded somewhat in the past two years, but it's still not as strong as it was, she said.

One reason labor shortages in the fields have subsided — in addition to the return of migrant workers who had fled — is that some of the biggest farms in the area have started using or increased their use of a federal guest-worker program to bring in foreign workers legally.

Farmer R.T. Stanley of Stanley Farms, which grows more than 1,000 acres of onions, as well as other crops and vegetables in the area, is one of them.

Stanley said he has started to use more legal guest workers, who are brought into the country on a visa for a defined period of time, because he is not able to find as many experienced migrant workers locally as he used to.

For Barbosa, that can hurt business, because guest workers aren't nearly as reliable as customers as those who settle in and develop attachments to a community.

""They'll come in and buy some beans and tortillas and then send $1,000 to Guatemala,"" she said of the guest workers.

Many farmers have long complained the federal guest-worker program is too rigid and difficult to use.

""We know we've got to deal with the rules, and we do,"" said Bob Stafford, director of the Vidalia Onion Business Council. ""We do the best we can with them.""

Now farmers and workers both are turning their attention to the debate over national immigration reform and are hoping for provisions that will help them.

""We need a real good guest-worker program,"" Stafford said, ""something that will work ... for the growers and for the workers and for the community.""

Barbosa, whose husband works as a crew leader recruiting and overseeing field workers for farmers, is also watching Washington.

""People have hope,"" she said. ""But there's been a lot of talk about immigration reform before and nothing has happened, so there's still a lot of doubt.""

Katherine Russell is undergoing a federal probe by investigators

She has added a New York criminal lawyer to her defense team

Tamerlan Tsarnaev%2C 26%2C died April 19 after a shootout with police

PROVIDENCE, Rhode Island (AP) — A new criminal defense lawyer for the widow of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev says his client will continue to cooperate with investigators but says he plans to keep quiet about the details of her case publicly because that could hurt the investigation.

New York lawyer Joshua Dratel, who has represented several terrorism suspects, joined Katherine Russell's legal team last week. He joins two Rhode Island-based lawyers who typically focus on civil cases.

Russell hasn't been charged with any wrongdoing, but she is under intense scrutiny by the FBI as it investigates the deadly April 15 bombing, which killed three people and injured more than 260. Authorities say the attack was carried out by her husband and his brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.

Dratel told The Associated Press on Tuesday that he joined Russell's legal team because Russell needed someone who could navigate the criminal justice system and to protect her interests. He said she had spoken with investigators and planned to keep cooperating.

""I don't see that changing in the foreseeable future,"" he said. ""There's no inconsistency between that and her interests at this point.""

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, is in a prison hospital facing charges that could bring the death penalty. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died April 19 after a shootout with police.

Russell, 24, had been living in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with her husband and 2-year-old daughter, but has been staying with her parents in North Kingstown, Rhode Island, since the day her husband was killed. She has reverted to using her maiden name, switching from her married name of Tsarnaeva.

Among the questions about Russell is what she knew or saw in the weeks leading up to the bombing, and in the days after it. Two U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have told the AP that Dzhokhar told investigators the bombs were assembled in the small apartment Russell shared with her husband. One of her Rhode Island lawyers has previously said she was working long hours and was frequently away from the apartment.

Dratel would not discuss details of Russell's life or relationship with her husband, and would not be specific when asked about her contact with federal investigators, such as when she had spoken with them. He said in his experience, investigators do not want people speaking to the media and publicizing what they are focusing on.

""It would be counterproductive for the investigation and for Katherine's interests for us to be more forthcoming at this time with any of the details,"" he said. ""We wouldn't want to impair the investigation in any way.""

The sole focus of Russell and her legal team, he said, was on the investigation.

""It's a fluid situation,"" Dratel said. ""We're not at the end of it."""

Probably some of each: brave, because he’s trying to sell himself and fellow Republicans to African Americans, a singularly resistant demographic; and crazy, because he based his pitch on revised history and airbrushed facts — and the Howard kids weren’t fooled.

“No Republican questions or disputes civil rights,” the senator from Kentucky proclaimed. “I’ve never wavered in my support for civil rights or the Civil Rights Act.”

Howzat?

As a candidate in 2010, Paul questioned the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act’s Title II, which prohibits private discrimination. “I don’t want to be associated with those people,” he said when MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow asked him about private businesses that refuse to serve black customers, “but I also don’t want to limit their speech in any way in the sense that we tolerate boorish and uncivilized behavior because that’s one of the things freedom requires.”

Asked by the moderator to explain his claim that he never spoke out against the Civil Rights Act, Paul provided the creative rationale that he was talking “about the ramifications of certain portions of the Civil Rights Act beyond race, as are now being applied to smoking, menus, listing calories and things on menus and guns.”

Paul acknowledged that his wooing of African Americans “is an uphill battle,” and his hour with the students confirmed this. Talking about the Republicans’ historical support for civil rights, he said: “I’ll give you one example. The first, one of the African American U.S. senators was a guy named, uh, I’m blanking on his name, from Massachusetts — ”

“Edward Brooke!” several in the audience called out.

“Edwin Brookes,” Paul repeated.

The students broke out in hysterics. The laughter had barely subsided when Paul posed a question. “If I were to have said, ‘Who do you think the founders of the NAACP are?’ . . . would everybody in here know they were all Republicans?”

“Yes,” several could be heard grumbling. “Of course they would,” one woman informed him.

Paul dug himself in deeper. “I don’t know what you know,” he said.

They knew enough to be suspicious of his central argument: that Abraham Lincoln’s Republican Party is the same Republican Party that now dominates the South. This analysis glossed over the civil rights era, when Democrats and Republicans essentially switched sides as southern Dixiecrats left for the GOP.

“Democrats in Louisville were led by Courier-Journal Editor Henry Watterson and were implacably opposed to blacks voting,” Paul argued. Watterson died in 1921. “Meanwhile,” he continued, “Kentucky’s Democrat-controlled legislature voted against the 13th, the 14th and the 15th amendments.” In the 1860s.

A student questioner sought clarification. “Are we discussing the Republican Party of the 19th century?” he asked, to applause. “Or are we discussing the post-1968 Republican Party?”

“The argument I’m trying to make is we haven’t changed,” Paul proposed.

The Howard students weren’t hostile to the senator as much as indifferent. Campus police swarmed outside the hall and erected barricades, although they proved unnecessary. Doors opened an hour early, but seats didn’t fill up until the last minute, and many spent their time texting and fanning themselves in the overheated hall.

Paul elicited a few chuckles when he requested that the school newspaper go with the headline, “A Republican came to Howard, but he came in peace.” But he got only silence when he ad-libbed a joke about how his Civil Rights Act comments in 2010 didn’t “go so well for me.”

“My hope is that you will hear me out,” Paul asked, and all appeared to — except for senior Brian Menifee, who raised a hand-lettered banner announcing that “Howard University Doesn’t Support White Supremacy.” Police threw him out roughly, and other students cheered.

But Paul got no cheers for most of his ideas: criticizing Democrats’ “unlimited federal assistance,” calling private-school choice “the civil rights issue of our day” and saying that “there are Republicans who don’t clamor for war.” He did better with his proposal to repeal mandatory minimum sentences, but he drew boos when he defended voter-ID laws.

“I come to Howard,” Paul said, “to say I want a government that leaves you alone.” He argued that “objective evidence shows that big government is not a friend to African Americans.”

Freshman Keenan Glover disagreed. “I want a government that’s going to help me,” he said. “I want a government that’s going to help me pay for my college education.”

“We can disagree,” the senator said, then upgraded his pessimism. “Probably, we’re going to end up disagreeing.”

Haley Barbour at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2011, where he might not be so welcome this year.

Last week, at a closed-door retreat in northern Virginia, Barbour told a large gathering of congressional staffers, including several leadership aides, that party officials should discourage donors from funding the high-profile conservative group [...] Many in the audience applauded Barbour for his remarks, according to two sources in the room.

While Karl Rove is off doing battle against the tea party, Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour (a top figure in his party) has opened a new front in the GOP Civil War.Mainstream Republicansbe upset at the Club for Growth's self-destructive tendencies. They had their heyday in the 2010 GOP wave by backing conservative insurgents like Sens. Ron Johnson, Marco Rubio, (former CfG prez) Pat Toomey, and Rand Paul. On the other hand, they help cost the GOP the Senate by helping Sharron Angle and Ken Buck defeat more electable candidates in their primaries.

In 2012, they were one of the earliest backers of Richard Mourdock's primary challenge in Indiana, an effort that cost Republicans the seat in the general. On the other hand, they backed the more electable candidate in Arizona's Senate race (Jeff Flake, who ended up winning in the general), and were a major factor in Ted Cruz's primary victory in Texas. Cruz, of course, is now auditioning for the role of ""2013's Allen West"" to great conservative acclaim.

Compared to Karl Rove's track record, the Club has been a success!

But ""success"" and ""elections"" are all relative terms when it comes to the GOP, a party that has now lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections, lost seats in a year where the map was theirs for the taking, and lost the popular vote in the House, holding it by virtue of their own aggressive gerrymandering.

This is a party getting blown out of the water by the nation's fastest-growing demographics—Asians, Latinos, and millennials, not to mention women, the largest single voting block. They are a party that claims to ""reinvent"" itself in weekly confabs, only to find itself trapped in a political Groundhog Day.

Barbour is right when he says, ""Politics can’t be about purity. Unity wins in politics, purity loses."" Problem is, they created a monster designed solely to instill such purity, and they can't put that genie back in the bottle. This isn't like the old days, when the John Birchers were kept outside the GOP tent. These days, the crazies run the joint."
http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/movies/20restrepo.html,2010-06-20 00:00:00,['David Carr'],‘Restrepo’: One Platoon’s Deadly Post in Afghanistan,"ASK almost any American, even those opposed to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and they will state that they “support our troops.”

It’s a lovely thought, that we care for the soldiers who do the fighting regardless of politics at hand. But for the most part public interest and understanding of what American soldiers do on our behalf remains remarkably limited in wars that go mostly untelevised and undernoticed. American men and women fight, die and kill a long ways from home, and many want it to stay that way. “Restrepo,” a documentary directed by Sebastian Junger and Tim Hetherington, which will open on June 25 in Los Angeles and New York, is a 94-minute tutorial on life at the tip of that very sharp spear. Specifically, Mr. Junger, a veteran war correspondent and author of several books, including “The Perfect Storm,” and Mr. Hetherington, a longtime war photographer, spent 14 months, beginning in May 2007, with a platoon of United States soldiers in the Korangal Valley of Afghanistan.

“Restrepo” avoids the conventions of documentary film: there is no back story, no drive-bys with experts for context, no underlying ideology or obvious message. The viewer is dropped into war, with a hard jolt, and resides, along with 15 soldiers from Second Platoon of Battle Company of the 173rd Airborne Brigade, in a remote and raw outpost called Restrepo, so named after one member of the platoon who is killed early in their rotation. In practical terms the soldiers of Second Platoon hump up a mountain with lots of bullets and some shovels and dig in. During the day they make efforts at outreach, handing over food and sometimes cash to local people, many of whom return at night to shoot at them. “It is a weird sort of anti-paradise,” Mr. Junger said in a phone call from Houston, where he was on a book tour for “War,” his best seller based on the same reporting. “They were in the most extreme place in the valley, which was the most extreme place in Afghanistan. By 2007 a fifth of the fighting in Afghanistan took place there.”

The Korangal Valley, full of giant peaks and hidden enemies, has a bit of reputation inside the military."
http://news.yahoo.com/irs-apologizes-targeting-conservative-groups-144349480.html,,[],IRS apologizes for targeting conservative groups,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Internal Revenue Service inappropriately flagged conservative political groups for additional reviews during the 2012 election to see if they were violating their tax-exempt status, a top IRS official said Friday.

Organizations were singled out because they included the words ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" in their applications for tax-exempt status, said Lois Lerner, who heads the IRS division that oversees tax-exempt groups.

In some cases, groups were asked for their list of donors, which violates IRS policy in most cases, she said.

""That was wrong. That was absolutely incorrect, it was insensitive and it was inappropriate. That's not how we go about selecting cases for further review,"" Lerner said at a conference sponsored by the American Bar Association.

""The IRS would like to apologize for that,"" she added.

Lerner said the practice was initiated by low-level workers in Cincinnati and was not motivated by political bias. After her talk, she told The AP that no high level IRS officials knew about the practice.

Agency officials found out about the practice last year and moved to correct it, the IRS said in a statement. The statement did not specify when officials found out.

About 75 groups were inappropriately targeted. None had their tax-exempt status revoked, Lerner said.

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky called on the White House to investigate.

""Today's acknowledgement by the Obama administration that the IRS did in fact target conservative groups in the heat of last year's national election is not enough,"" McConnell said. ""I call on the White House to conduct a transparent, government-wide review aimed at assuring the American people that these thuggish practices are not under way at the IRS or elsewhere in the administration against anyone, regardless of their political views.""

Many conservative groups complained during the election that they were being harassed by the IRS. They accused the agency of frustrating their attempts to become tax exempt by sending them lengthy, intrusive questionnaires.

Story continues

The forms, which the groups made available at the time, sought information about group members' political activities, including details of their postings on social networking websites and about family members.

Certain tax-exempt charitable groups can conduct political activities but it cannot be their primary activity.

IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman told Congress in March 2012 that the IRS was not targeting groups based on their political views.

""There's absolutely no targeting. This is the kind of back and forth that happens to people"" who apply for tax-exempt status, Shulman told a House Ways and Means subcommittee.

Shulman was appointed by President George W. Bush. His 6-year term ended in November. President Barack Obama has yet to nominate a successor. The agency is now being run by acting Commissioner Steven Miller.

""The Ways and Means Committee has persistently pushed the IRS to explain why it appeared to be unfairly targeting some political groups over others — a charge they repeatedly denied,"" said Rep. Charles Boustany, R-La., chairman of the Ways and Means oversight subcommittee.

""The IRS's 'too little too late' response is unacceptable, and I will continue to work to ensure there are protections in place so no American, regardless of political affiliation, has their right to free speech threatened by the IRS,"" Boustany said.

Tea Party groups were livid on Friday.

""I don't think there's any question we were unfairly targeted,"" said Tom Zawistowski, who until recently was president of the Ohio Liberty Coalition, an alliance of tea party groups in the state.

Zawistowski's group was among many conservative organizations that battled the IRS over what they saw as its discriminatory treatment of their effort to gain non-profit status. The group first applied for non-profit status in June 2009, and it was finally granted on Dec. 7, 2012, he said — one month after Election Day.

During the 2012 election, many tea party groups applied for tax-exempt status under section 501 (c) (4) of the federal tax code, which grants tax-exempt status to social welfare groups. Unlike other charitable groups, these organizations are allowed to participate in political activities but their primary activity must be social welfare.

That determination is up to the IRS.

Lerner said the number of groups filing for this tax-exempt status more than doubled from 2010 to 2012, to more than 3,400. To handle the influx, the IRS centralized its review of these applications in an office in Cincinnati.

Lerner said this was done to develop expertise among staffers and consistency in their reviews. As part of the review, staffers look for signs that groups are participating in political activity. If so, IRS agents take a closer look to make sure that politics isn't the group's primary activity, Lerner said.

As part of this process, agents in Cincinnati came up with a list of things to look for in an application. As part of the list, they included the words, ""tea party"" and ""patriot,"" Lerner said.

""It's the line people that did it without talking to managers,"" Lerner. ""They're IRS workers, they're revenue agents.""

In all, about 300 groups were singled out for additional review, Lerner said. Of those, about a quarter were singled out because they had ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" somewhere in their applications.

The IRS statement said that once applications were chosen for review, they all ""received the same, even-handed treatment.""

Lerner said 150 of the cases have been closed and no group had its tax-exempt status revoked, though some withdrew their applications.

""Mistakes were made initially, but they were in no way due to any political or partisan rationale,"" the IRS said in a statement. ""We fixed the situation last year and have made significant progress in moving the centralized cases through our system.""

Marcus S. Owens, who spent a decade leading the IRS division that oversees tax-exempt organizations, said Friday that it made sense that the problem arose among workers in Cincinnati because the agency ""really has delegated a lot of authority"" to local offices to make decisions about handling their workload.

But Tea Party groups weren't buying the idea that the decision to target them was solely the responsibility of low-level IRS workers.

""It is suspicious that the activity of these 'low-level workers' was unknown to IRS leadership at the time it occurred,"" said Jenny Beth Martin, national coordinator for Tea Party Patriots, which describes itself as the nation's largest tea party organization. ""President Obama must also apologize for his administration ignoring repeated complaints by these broad grassroots organizations of harassment by the IRS in 2012, and make concrete and transparent steps today to ensure this never happens again.""

In a speech to the National Urban League in Philadelphia this week, Attorney General Eric Holder said the Department of Justice will ask a federal court in San Antonio to require advance approval for voting changes in Texas. Perry called the move an ""end-run around the Supreme Court,"" claiming the Obama administration is casting ""unfair aspersions"" on Texas' voting rights efforts.

In June, the High Court struck down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, the provision of the landmark civil rights law that designates which parts of the country must have changes to their voting laws cleared by the federal government or in federal court.

Holder's announcement marks the administration's first response to the Supreme Court's ruling on the Voting Rights Act. Holder said the action ""will not be our last.""

Once again, the Obama Administration is demonstrating utter contempt for our country's system of checks and balances, not to mention the U.S. Constitution.

It also may not mean much that the White House press corps got teed off when they weren’t allowed access to President Obama as he played golf with Tiger Woods. This, too, would be an oversight.

Though not comparable — one appeared to be a veiled threat aimed at one of the nation’s most respected journalists and the other a minor blip in the scheme of things — both are part of a pattern of behavior by the Obama administration that suggests not just thin skin but a disregard for the role of the press and a gradual slide toward a state media.

This is where oversight can become dangerous.

Understandably, everyday Americans may find this discussion too inside baseball to pay much mind. Why can’t the president play a little golf without a press gaggle watching? As for Woodward, it’s not as though the White House was threatening to bust his kneecaps.

Add to these likely sentiments the fact that Americans increasingly dislike the so-called mainstream media, sometimes for good reason. Distrust of media, encouraged by alternative media seeking to enhance their own standing, has become a tool useful to the very powers the Fourth Estate was constitutionally endowed to monitor. When the president can bypass reporters to reach the public, it is not far-fetched to imagine a time — perhaps now? — when the state controls the message.

To recap: Woodward recently wrote a commentary for The Post that placed the sequester debacle on Obama’s desk and accused the president of “moving the goal posts” by asking for more tax increases.

Before his piece was published, Woodward called the White House to tell officials it was coming. A shouting match ensued between Woodward and Gene Sperling, Obama’s economic adviser, followed by an e-mail in which Sperling said that Woodward “will regret staking out that claim.”

Though the tone was conciliatory and Sperling apologized for raising his voice, the message nonetheless caused Woodward to bristle.

Again, Woodward’s kneecaps are probably safe, but the challenge to his facts, and therefore to his character, was unusual, given Woodward’s stature. And, how, by the way, might Woodward come to regret it? Sperling’s words, though measured, could be read as: “You’ll never set foot in this White House again.”

When reporters lose access to the White House, it isn’t about being invited to the annual holiday party. It’s about having access to the most powerful people on the planet as they execute the nation’s business.

Inarguably, Woodward has had greater access to the White House than any other journalist in town. Also inarguably, he would survive without it. He has filled a library shelf with books about the inner workings of this and other administrations, the fact of which makes current events so remarkable.

Woodward, almost 70, is Washington’s Reporter Emeritus. His facts stand up to scrutiny. His motivations withstand the test of objectivity. Sperling obviously assumed that Woodward wouldn’t take offense at the suggestion that he not only was wrong but was also endangering his valuable proximity to power.

He assumed, in other words, that Woodward would not do his job. This was an oversight.

This is no tempest in a teapot but rather the leak in the dike. Drip by drip, the Obama administration has demonstrated its intolerance for dissent and its contempt for any who stray from the White House script. Yes, all administrations are sensitive to criticism, and all push back when such criticism is deemed unfair or inaccurate. But no president since Richard Nixon has demonstrated such overt contempt for the messenger. And, thanks to technological advances in social media, Obama has been able to bypass traditional watchdogs as no other president has.

More to the point, the Obama White House is, to put it politely, fudging as it tries to place the onus of the sequester on Congress. And, as has become customary, officials are using the Woodward spat to distract attention. As Woodward put it: “This is the old trick . . . of making the press . . . the issue, rather than what the White House has done here.”

Killing the messenger is a time-honored method of controlling the message, but we have already spilled that blood. And the First Amendment’s protection of a free press, the purpose of which is to check power and constrain government’s ability to dictate the lives of private citizens, was no accident.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

http://inamerica.blogs.cnn.com/2013/04/30/d-c-council-member-pushes-name-change-for-washington-redskins/,2013-04-30 00:00:00,[],D.C. council member pushes name change for Washington Redskins,"By Moni Basu, CNN

(CNN) - David Grosso, 42, was born and raised in the metropolitan Washington area so it's not tough to see why he's a diehard Washington Redskins fan. Been going to games since he was a boy. Season ticket holder.

But Grosso, like so many others, objects to the name and mascot of his favorite team.

""The term Redskins is a racist and derogatory term,"" he says.

These days, Grosso has the power to do something more than air his opinion. He was elected to the D.C. Council in November, and he plans to introduce a resolution Wednesday to rename the team to the Washington Redtails. That's a tribute to the Tuskegee Airmen, though, Grosso says, there are plenty of redtail hawks in the area.

He's open to other suggestions. He just wants the current name gone.

""District residents and their elected representatives should not tolerate commercial or other use of derogatory terminology relating to any people’s racial identity, or which dishonors any person’s race, or which dishonors the name Washington,"" Grosso's resolution says.

Grosso says his hometown, named after the nation's first president, has been dishonored by association with what many Native Americans call the R-word because it's just as offensive as the N-word.

“A good many Americans don’t know any Indians,” says Kevin Gover, who heads the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of the American Indian. “The Indian you see most often in Washington, D.C., is at a football game - at the expense of real Indians, real history, real culture. The petty stereotype has become expected.”

Grosso says he has the support of eight of the council's 13 members; two more are leaning his way, he says. He has been circulating his proposed resolution to them ahead of a formal introduction. Grosso expects the resolution to pass, after which he will make sure team owner Daniel Snyder sees it.

Snyder has been quiet on the issue and thus far resisted, though efforts to get the name changed have gathered steam in recent months.

Amanda Blackhorse, a 31-year-old Navajo social worker, went to Washington in March to attend a hearing of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. She has petitioned to cancel the Redskins trademark on grounds that the name is racist. Suzan Shown Harjo filed a similar petition in 1992 and won, but later lost in the appeals process.

Also in March, several lawmakers introduced a bill in Congress that would amend the Trademark Act of 1946 to ban the term “redskin” in a mark because it is disparaging of native people. Among the sponsors of the bill is civil rights activist Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia.

If passed, the bill would force the Washington football team to discard its trademarked name and ban the use of any offensive term in any future trademarks.

At least one player felt the name change campaign was going overboard. Star quarterback Robert Griffin III said this on Twitter: ""In a land of freedom we are held hostage by the tyranny of political correctness.""

As of 6 p.m., more than 3,000 people had retweeted it.

County Department of Children and Family Services social workers and two supervisors the county intends to fire over the death of an 8-year-old Palmdale boy can appeal their dismissals.

DCFS head Philip Browning said letters had gone out Tuesday to the four employees most involved in the case, notifying them of the department’s intent to fire them. Other employees who were “peripherally involved” received warning or reprimand letters.

The four to be fired have the right to appeal, Browning said.

Paramedics were summoned to the home of Gabriel Fernandez on the evening of May 22 and found the boy barely breathing with numerous injuries, including a fractured skull, broken ribs and burns.

He died in the hospital two days later. His mother and her boyfriend were arrested and charged with murder and torture.

Browning said the quick move to fire the employees marked a departure from past processes. In the past, the department would have looked through the entire history of Gabriel’s involvement with DCFS before taking action.

In this case, the initial investigation focused on the last two years or so to come to a swifter resolution on the fate of the four employees, who were put on desk duty soon after Fernandez’s death.

In the wake of Gabriel’s death, the county also convened a blue-ribbon commission on child protection, which is slated to begin meeting this week.

Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich, whose district includes Palmdale, announced the firing of the workers Tuesday during a board meeting in response to public comments from child advocates, some of whom said they were related to Gabriel.

Advocates cheered at the announcement, but also called out, “What are their names?”

Before his second NFL season began last September, Ryan Kerrigan came across a typed, one-page piece of fan mail. The first paragraph grabbed him:

My name is Ryan D’Emidio. I am 16 years old with seven brothers and sisters. My Mom and I got into a car accident and I had to come three months early. I was critical for 21 / 2 years. The doctors said I would die several times, and if I did live, I would be a vegetable (I eat vegetables now!). I do have cerebral palsy and some learning difficulties. I have two belly buttons on my body. The little flower is where the feeding tube was for seven years.

The boy went on to tell Kerrigan how he was hired as the team manager of the Woodbridge High School football team, how he played a blind child in a school play called “The Miracle Worker.”

I love the way you sack and take it all the way. . . . I make people happy and laugh and I have a dream to meet you. . . . Please write back to me.

The big, strong 6-foot-4, 260-pound linebacker, about to embark on his first Pro Bowl season with Washington, held the letter and thought about the difference between the courage shown on an NFL field and the courage shown in life.

“As a player, you’re always getting things sent to you, tons of mail,” Kerrigan said. “I always try to be nice, but I just can’t write everybody back. But I saw his letter. It . . . it did something to me.”

Kerrigan found a pen, a piece of paper and started writing in neat cursive, putting the letter in the mailbox two days before last season’s opener:

Dear Ryan,

Thanks for your kind letter! I am terribly sorry to hear about your car accident + your condition. But I am inspired by your upbeat personality! Keep that attitude and you can do whatever you dream! Thanks for being a Redskins fan + for your support. God Bless!

Ryan Kerrigan #91

This is a story about two people named Ryan who inspired each other, and it would end here except Ryan D’Emidio is more relentless than any locked-in Pro Bowl linebacker at the snap count.

See, Kerrigan’s note gave the kid an opening, a gap to shoot. He wrote Kerrigan back, working it, appealing to his ego, “Sack Tony Romo!” He thanked him for the handwritten letter in another note, soberly adding, “I would hand write but my hands don’t work so well and I was afraid you would not be able to read it!”

When I asked Kerrigan two months ago whether he would be up for meeting his fan Ryan, he didn’t hesitate. “That kid? He’s amazing. Sure. I’d be honored. His story was so uplifting.”

Ten days before Christmas on a cold, rainy night in Woodbridge in 1995, Susan D’Emidio got in her car and headed out for some last-minute holiday shopping. “I was being silly, I know, but with seven kids I just thought I had forgot something,” she said. By the time she turned onto busy Minnieville Road, the rain had turned to black ice. An out-of-control car hurdled the barrier and came into her lane. Hers was the first vehicle involved in a 15-car pileup.

At 28 weeks pregnant with Ryan, she was deemed healthy enough to return home. But within a week, her body went into toxic shock and her baby was suddenly in grave danger.

“Basically the doctor said the baby was killing her and she was killing the baby and it would have to come out early,” said John D’Emidio, Ryan’s father. She had an emergency cesarean section to save her child.

Ryan was born a mere 1 pound 12 ounces, three months ahead of schedule. He lived most of the first year of his life in an incubator. He had multiple surgeries and was fed through his nostrils. Every time Ryan was taken home those first few months, doctors told the family he had to come back to the hospital because his lungs weren’t strong enough to be unhooked from a respirator.

“He died several times in the first two years of his life, and they brought him back,” Susan said.

Ryan kept fighting. And growing. And always embracing the good instead of cursing the havoc an awful disorder had wreaked on his life.

“I am home from surgery,” he wrote on his Facebook page Tuesday night after he had filler inserted in both legs to keep his knee and his femur from rubbing together, his second of four planned surgeries this year alone. He has to have Botox routinely injected into his hips, thighs and lower back to loosen the areas.

Cerebral palsy is not a progressive disorder, and people afflicted often have a normal life expectancy. But the constant tightening of his muscles — contracture — is one of the recurring symptoms that disrupt Ryan’s life.

The Ryan-meets-Ryan spot was designated as Reston Town Center after Kerrigan had biked 20 miles in former teammate Lorenzo Alexander’s annual charity bike ride.

D’Emidio could barely contain his excitement, almost skipping toward the player he had first written over a year ago.

“Hi, I’m Ryan,” Kerrigan said.

“I’m Ryan,” D’Emidio shot back, laughing and wearing Kerrigan’s No. 91 jersey. “How are you?”

“I’m doing well.”

Instinctively, D’Emidio went in for a hug. Kerrigan wrapped him up, snugger than Eli Manning.

“I appreciate that,” the player said as the two shared a few minutes.

D’Emidio walked away for a few minutes and returned with a 70-page, self-published book he had written, titled “My Life — Ryan D’Emidio.”

“Read this book to your family,” he said, handing it to Kerrigan. “It’ll make you cry.”

“I don’t want to cry,” Kerrigan said.

Not to worry, he was told, it’s a good cry: the story of a baby who almost didn’t make it, who survived a 15-car pileup in his mother’s womb, an incubator, thousands of tubes and needles thrust into his body and, as a young boy, bullying in school. Oh, and the awkwardness of adolescence. He beat all of them, answering fear with faith.

One Sunday night recently, John picked up the phone and saw the word “ESPN” on the caller ID. Neil Everett, the “SportsCenter” anchor, was on the line. “He said Ryan had sent him a letter, and he was so touched he had to call,” John said.

Ryan has gumption and then some. He occasionally crosses boundaries — “Can I have your cellphone number?” or “Can you go to my birthday?” or “Can you get me an announcing job at Fox or ESPN?” — but he’s pretty much been a mover and shaker since becoming a memoiristat 15 for The Washington Post magazine.

Susan handed me a folder that contained letters of correspondence between Kerrigan and her son and a letter Ryan sent to the NFL during the lockout, urging the league to play. The folder also contains numerous letters to people Ryan has found inspirational, like Tim McGraw, Joel Osteen and Alfred Morris.

He thinks they’re inspiring him “when it’s actually the other way around,” Kerrigan said. “He makes me feel I can do anything.”

The same goes for his mother, who recently underwent the same kind of chemotherapy given to breast-cancer patients in order to treat a hyperactive thyroid condition connected to rheumatoid arthritis. “He’s my inspiration,” Susan said. “If it wasn’t for Ryan and his hurting, I don’t think I could endure mine.”

Six months ago, Susan read some of her son’s writing relating to his several brushes with death as an infant. She came across something she had never read before: “He wrote that when he went to go see God, God told him he couldn’t stay and had to come back and he had to go make people happy and he was going to have a wonderful life.”

Ryan D’Emidio’s mother covers her mouth for a moment.

“It gave me shivers,” she finally said. “I said, ‘Ryan, you never told me about that.’ He had that little secret in him for a long time.”

The award, created by President John F. Kennedy, recognizes significant achievements in politics, world peace, science, culture and other fields and is the nation’s highest honor presented civilians.

Here are five of Lynn’s many cultural contributions since Butcher Holler, Ky.’s most celebrated resident arrived not only as one of the most distinctive singers in country music but also as a songwriter who reshaped what a woman could think, say and do in song and in life.

PHOTOS: Concerts by The Times

“Coal Miner’s Daughter”: No. 1 country hit that spawned her bestselling 1976 autobiography and the 1980 Academy Award-winning biopic, this is Lynn’s theme song. Lynn told the story of her hardscrabble but loving upbringing in the Appalachian coal-mining country of eastern Kentucky from which she made her remarkable rise to worldwide fame and acclaim.

“Don’t Come Home A’Drinkin’ (With Lovin’ on Your Mind)”: Lynn’s first No. 1 hit on the country chart, “Don’t Come Home A’Drinkin’ ” slammed the door on the passive female victim of wayward boyfriends and husbands who’d populated so many country songs before she came along. “Just stay out there on the town and see what you can find/Cause if you want that kind of love well you don’t need none of mine.” This was a woman who knew what she was worth and wasn’t about to be devalued by a lout -- powerful stuff in country music in 1966.

“One’s on the Way”: As the women’s liberation movement grew and promoted the idea that women had a right to control their own bodies, Lynn took that message written by satirist Shel Silverstein to rural America in 1971. Lynn emphasizes Silverstein’s wry observational skill and sense of humor over outrage or stridency in pointing out the differences between the nation’s haves and have-nots and the effect that child-bearing had on most women’s lives.

But here in Topeka the rain is a fallin’

The faucet is a drippin’ and the kids are a bawlin’

One of them a-toddlin’ and one is a-crawlin’ and one’s on the way

“Rated X”: In 1972, with the Motion Picture Assn. of America’s recently instituted movie ratings system the subject of endless controversy, especially when it came to films with sexual themes that earned the feared “X” rating, Lynn scored another No. 1 hit with her examination of the way women, far more than men, were stigmatized by divorce in society’s eyes: “The women all look at you like you’re bad and the men all hope you are/But if you go too far you’re gonna wear the scar of a woman rated X.”

“Miss Being Mrs.”: Lynn stopped making music for years when her husband Oliver “Mooney” Lynn’s health was declining. After his death in 1996, she slowly resumed her career, then in 2004, surprised much of the world by teaming with brash young songwriter, guitarist and producer Jack White of the White Stripes, a longtime admirer of her music. He produced her album “Van Lear Rose” that demonstrated she had plenty left to say in music. For all the songs she wrote or sang about the inequities, injustice and abuse that women endure on behalf of the institution of marriage, she stayed with her husband from the day she became his teenage bride, and in this song, reflected on what it meant to continue without him.

http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/15/news/economy/military-recruiting/index.html,2013-05-15 00:00:00,['Annalyn Kurtz'],Getting into the military is getting tougher,"In a typical week, about 10 applicants will walk into a recruiting center in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, hoping to enlist in the United States Army. Sergeant First Class Israel Herrera doesn't like to turn them away, but he often finds that six out of 10 simply don't measure up to military standards.

Just like private-sector employers, the military is seeking higher-skilled recruits these days.

It's no longer enough to be a patriotic, able-bodied young person. A high-school diploma, above-average score on the military entrance exams, and a clean slate -- free from prior drug use or criminal conduct -- are practically required now. Thanks to high youth unemployment and the drawdown from both Iraq and Afghanistan, Uncle Sam can afford to be a bit pickier.

""There's a lot more competition,"" said Herrera, who signed up himself 13 years ago. ""There are not many opportunities out there, but the Army provides employment and stability, and that makes it an attractive option.""

The Pentagon estimates that only one in four of today's youth are fit for military service. More than 20% of high-school students fail to graduate. Obesity and other medical conditions disqualify about 35% of candidates. Prior drug and alcohol involvement disqualify another 19%, and criminal records disqualify 5%.

It wasn't always this way. Just six years ago, during the Iraq war surge, the military had lower standards. Only about 86% of new recruits had high-school diplomas, and just 67% of recruits scored in the top 50th percentile on the Armed Forces Qualification Test. Waivers excusing health issues and prior misconduct -- even felonies -- were not uncommon.

Those waivers were needed to hit enrollment targets. The Army fell short of its recruiting goal by about 7,000 people in 2005, but like the other military branches, it has had a surplus of recruits every year since then.

""Before 2009, we would probably be able to give you an example of a young man or young woman who got in with a simple possession of marijuana charge,"" Herrera said. ""They would not get a waiver these days.""

Over the last couple years, the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines have enlisted their highest-quality recruits since at least 1973, when the military discontinued the draft.

Now a whopping 99% of recruits have a high-school diploma -- an all-time high. Even candidates with GEDs are often turned away and encouraged to complete at least 15 college credits before re-applying.

There are roughly two applicants for every slot the military is trying to fill.

Two key factors are driving the trend. First, the military is recruiting fewer active-duty soldiers overall, as it reduces troop levels in both Iraq and Afghanistan. In fiscal 2012, the military enlisted about 155,000 new recruits, the smallest cohort on record in the post-World War II period.

Top military officials also credit the sluggish job market for their hiring success. A slow economy ""makes recruiting less challenging, and operates to the advantage of those who are hiring, including the U.S. military,"" Acting Under Secretary of Defense Jessica Wright said last month in a prepared statement before the Senate Armed Forces Committee.

The weak economy over the last few years was enough to convince Tony Coleman II, an 18-year-old from East Stroudsburg, Pa., to enlist. In his hometown, the unemployment rate is hovering near 10%.

""After high school, I figure not a lot of jobs will open for me,"" he told CNNMoney. ""Money is tight around here, and there are fewer kids getting jobs. Plus, it's a gateway to college.""

Coleman works at McDonald's now, but dreams of eventually working as a detective for the FBI. He expects to graduate from high school in June and is already preparing to ship off to basic training in Ft. Jackson, S.C., in July. He says he enlisted for three main reasons: ""to make mom proud,"" to fund his college education, and to avoid the weak civilian job market.

As of April, the national unemployment rate for 16- to 24-year-olds was 16.1%, more than double the national average for the broader U.S. population.

Military pay also works in the recruiters' favor. It tends to exceed that of comparable civilian jobs, once you factor in all the extra benefits like health care, tuition assistance, housing and food allowances.

For new recruits, the starting pay is around $1,400 a month. By the time they've reached 18 months of service, their pay is often boosted to about $1,800 to $2,000 a month.

The housing allowance is substantial. For even the most junior enlistee, an E1 with less than six months of service, it ranges from about $800 a month in Fort Hood, Texas, to $2,300 a month in New York City.

Compare that to the average 16- to 19-year-old civilian worker's monthly pay of about $1,400, according to Labor Department data -- and it's safe to say most of those jobs don't include health insurance or housing, much less tuition reimbursement.

As the economy improves, will the military need lower its recruiting standards again? Officials are keeping a watchful eye on their candidate pool.

""As we see signs of economic improvement, we must remain vigilant and continue to monitor impacts on our recruiting efforts,"" Wright told Congress."
http://news.yahoo.com/bulgers-defense-begins-testify-070624513.html,,[],As Bulger's defense begins: Will he testify?,"BOSTON (AP) — Lawyers for James ""Whitey"" Bulger acknowledged he ran a lucrative criminal enterprise that took in millions through illegal gambling, extortion and drug trafficking. Now, they must defend him against those crimes and charges of 19 murders at his racketeering trial.

But one big question remains: Will Bulger testify in his own defense?

Some lawyers not connected to the case say Bulger has too much baggage to testify, including a previous criminal record and a long reputation as an organized crime figure.

But others say Bulger's case is different because, at age 83, he knows he is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison and may be more interested in settling scores than being acquitted.

Boston attorney Martin Weinberg said because Bulger's lawyers have admitted to some charges, he is likely to be convicted of enough counts to keep him in prison for the rest of his life.

""He's going to have a narrower set of objectives,"" Weinberg said. ""It makes it more likely for him to testify if his objectives are something other than a complete acquittal because he can admit to things that other defendants couldn't and attempt to persuade a jury that, 'You heard what I admitted to, please respect those specific areas as to which I deny guilt.'""

Bulger as much as said he wanted to settle scores in letters he wrote to a friend from prison after he was captured in Santa Monica, Calif., following 16 years on the run.

Bulger told his friend he wanted to set the record straight on two fronts: First, he was not an FBI informant, as prosecutors and many trial witnesses have claimed, and second, he did not kill women, according to a book called ""Whitey Bulger: America's Most Wanted Gangster and the Manhunt That Brought Him to Justice,"" written by Boston Globe reporters Shelley Murphy and Kevin Cullen.

""This whole trial is an effort on his part to overcompensate for his informant label,"" said Boston attorney Anthony Cardinale, who helped expose the corrupt relationship between the FBI and Bulger while he represented former New England Mob boss Francis ""Cadillac Frank"" Salemme.

Story continues

""He's doing anything he can to have some shred of a reputation left,"" Cardinale said.

But despite the impulse to want to rebut testimony that he ratted on the Mafia and members of his own gang, Bulger would open himself up to even more damaging evidence if he decides to take the witness stand, Cardinale said. He said prosecutors could then bring in evidence that when he was charged in a string of bank robberies in the 1950s, he ratted out his co-defendants in that case.

""He would be a grease spot on the floor after cross-examination,"" Cardinale said.

In the months before the trial, Bulger's lawyers said he was eager to testify to support his claim that he received immunity from crimes from a former federal prosecutor. But after Judge Denise Casper ruled that Bulger couldn't use that as a defense, his lawyers sidestepped the questions about his possible testimony.

On Friday, when the judge asked attorney J.W. Carney Jr. if Bulger might testify, he said only that he would let her know after his other witnesses testify. The first defense witnesses are to be called Monday.

Late Sunday, Bulger's attorneys filed a motion to have the jury sequestered when it begins deliberations.

The motion urged Casper to keep jurors away from media coverage, saying articles published about the defendant ""have extended far beyond mere recounting of testimony and have characterized the defendant in an extremely prejudicial manner.""

The motion said the defense wants ""to ensure that deliberations are not tainted by the opinion of anyone outside of the jury"" and singled out some statements made by media columnists.

During the prosecution's case, Bulger's lawyers spent a great deal of time trying to knock down the informant claim by suggesting that Bulger's FBI handler, retired Special Agent John Connolly Jr., attributed information from other informants to Bulger in an attempt to advance his own career. At the time, bringing down the Mafia was a national priority for the Justice Department, and Connolly's recruitment of top-echelon informants against the group won him numerous accolades. Connolly is now in prison.

Bulger has vehemently denied being an informant. Carney told the jury that it went against Bulger's Irish heritage to be an informant and that Bulger loathed anyone who ratted on friends or enemies.

So it would not be a complete surprise if Bulger wanted the jury to hear that from his own mouth.

But Bulger runs a high risk of prosecutors bringing in more damaging evidence if he testifies.

""He might insist that he wasn't a rat, he wasn't an informant. ... But is it worth it for him to hold his head high and say, 'I wasn't an informant for the government, or I never killed women' when he will be forced to admit other things on the stand?"" said Boston College law professor Michael Cassidy.

Ultimately, the decision will be up to Bulger.

Cassidy said Bulger could decide to testify simply to deny claims made by three once-loyal cohorts who became government witnesses and testified against him.

""He has to sit and listen to them without telling his version of the story,"" Cassidy said. ""Maybe he just insists on (testifying). 'You know, I'm going to jail for the next 10 years anyway, I'm going to die in prison. At least I'm going to have my time on the stand.' That's his right."""

A question from Francoise Maroy in Reunion Island:

Is ""The United States"" considered as a singular or a plural noun?















Ask about English Listen to the answer

Karen Adams answers:

Thank you for your question Francoise; this is a really interesting one. Basically in English, there is a group of nouns which can be either singular or plural depending on what you want to say about them. So for example, if we’re looking at the United States the country we would normally use the singular verb so for example – “The United States is a very big country.”



However, if we’re thinking about the government in the United States we might want to use a plural noun - “The United States are a major power in the World.” This singular plural difference is one that we see reflected in a number of other nouns in English. For example, when we’re talking about the government we can say – “The government has won the election.” Or we can say “The government have won the election.” This depends if we see the government as a collection of individuals - “The government have won the election.” – or if we see the government as one thing - “The government has won the election.”



Another noun that works like this is team. “The team has won the trophy.” It means we’re looking at the team as one unified thing – as one thing. However, if the team have many difficulties, we could be talking about the individuals within the team. So this is a group of nouns that can be singular or plural depending on what you want to say about them.



It’s quite a small group of nouns, and usually the nouns in this group refer to politics or the state – so for example when we are talking about the police, the army, the navy, we can use plural or singular.



The thing to remember, is when we look at them as a collection of individuals, we would normally use a plural noun, and if we want to look at them as a unified institution we use the singular.



So in answer to your question Françoise, the United States can be singular or can be plural, depending on what you want to say about them. However, normally if you’re talking about the country, use the singular verb.



I hope that helps.

Is ""The United States"" considered as a singular or a plural noun?"

Chen']","Weiner’s Record in House: Intensity, Publicity and Limited Results","A few minutes later, Mr. Schwartz called back to say that his motivation for the large donations in 2007 and 2008 was to repay what he called a personal debt to Mr. Weiner’s father.

Single-Payer Hero

To his detractors, Mr. Weiner’s showy style was not just annoying. It revealed a willingness to risk upsetting a delicate consensus to elevate his own profile.

In July 2010, members of the New York City delegation were working quietly to line up some Republican support for a bill to pay for the treatment of Sept. 11 rescue workers. In a moment that became famous on cable TV, Mr. Weiner blew up at Representative Peter T. King, a Republican from Long Island, on the floor over Republican opposition to the bill, though other Democrats saw Mr. King as still on their team.

Mr. King said the explosion antagonized other Republicans, impeding the bill. “That was really his first and last venture into it,” he said. “He really never seemed to comprehend the nuances and complexities of it.”

Mr. Weiner called it a moment of honest anger, and said there was “resentment,” among colleagues who “worked much harder and longer on it than I did,” that this “became a kind of definitional turning point in that debate.”

But it was on health care, in 2009, that Mr. Weiner first, and most indelibly, broke through as a camera-ready, forceful hero to liberals. He became the de facto champion of a single-payer system, attacking Republicans and criticizing Mr. Obama’s compromise strategy. He prided himself on his relentlessness.

“If there was not someone out there doing what I was doing, someone who was fighting every day for the voice of that left contingent, you’d have to create one — or two, or three, or four,” he said."

“The point is some would have to lose their lives,” said the 70-year-old retired administrator, who sings in his church choir. “But when they realized that they can’t cross without being shot, they would stop.”

Talk about boosting border security, albeit with less extreme measures, is common in Escondido, a working-class city in northern San Diego County, 40 miles from Mexico. But the decades-long patchwork of remedies to halt the flow of illegal immigrants has proved so frustrating that residents like Gazzara expressed qualified support for broad reforms such as those championed by President Obama in his immigration policy speech Tuesday.

They include a path to citizenship for those brought to the United States illegally as children and the possibility of legal status for millions of other undocumented immigrants, provided they pass a background check and meet other criteria.

An estimated 2.5 million illegal immigrants live and work in California, embedded in such bulwarks of the state economy as agriculture and the service industry. The state’s voters tilt toward Democrats for president, but in some regions elect conservative Republican congressmen -- such as Darrell Issa (R-Vista), whose district includes Escondido, and Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield). Their support will be key to getting any immigration plan through a fractious House of Representatives.

Immigration reform activists greeted Obama’s speech with broad enthusiasm. The president was tackling nothing less than “a defining civil and human rights issue of our time,” said Wade Henderson, president and chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.

But the mixed reactions of Californians suggest the fraught terrain legislators must navigate to bring an immigration reform bill to Obama’s desk.

“Anyone applying for citizenship should pay a penalty,” said Gazzara, the retired administrator. “If you don’t respect our laws then you should pay the consequences.”

Gazzara was getting a haircut at Del’s Barber Shop in Escondido in the company of other self-described conservative Republicans, while immigrant women pushed baby strollers by the American flag that fluttered outside.

Escondido is one of the few cities in the country where immigration enforcement agents monitor and respond to police traffic stops, resulting in hundreds of deportation proceedings.

One passing woman, an illegal immigrant with three children who gave her name only as Maria, said she didn’t drive in the city because she feared getting pulled over at a traffic checkpoint.

But she has common ground with the men in the barbershop, and with Obama’s proposal, in calling for background checks.

“I tell my friends that everyone should get the opportunity to apply for citizenship, but there must be conditions,” she said. “They can’t be pushed through really fast. They need to check people’s backgrounds thoroughly.”

At El Gallo Giro restaurant in Huntington Park, a heavily Latino city, the tables and chairs reflect the colors of the Mexican flag, and the Virgin of Guadalupe has a shrine.

But only one man in the lunchtime crowd showed interest when Obama’s speech came on the TV on Tuesday, interrupting a Spanish-language celebrity talk show.

Felipe Velasquez, 56, who came from Sinaloa, Mexico, said he crossed into the country illegally in the early 1980s. Years later he was among millions of immigrants who received amnesty in the last major overhaul of immigration law.

He applauded Obama’s call for broader paths to citizenship. “People come here thinking it means a future. It’s a fantasy,” Velasquez said. “The only ones who do well are banks and big companies. The rest of us struggle all our lives to get ahead.”

Farther north in Kern County, a place both heavily Republican and heavily dependent on farm labor, reaction was mixed.

Randy Hubble, 55, a construction worker who was having lunch at Cope’s Knotty Pine Cafe in Bakersfield, has clear views on what to do with the country’s estimated 11 million illegal immigrants: “Put them on the bus, and put them back where they came from.”

The local congressman, McCarthy, is a staunch conservative and the House majority whip, and he will alienate voters like Hubble if he supports Obama’s plan.

However, other locals, including Kyle Steinberg, who works as a Caltrans supervisor and votes Republican, expressed support for a citizenship plan, provided applicants joined mainstream America. “They just need to accept our way of life and not try to make this into Mexico,” Steinberg said.

Dennis McDonnell, a retired schoolteacher and a Democrat, worries that immigration reform will create a flood of illegal crossers. “Too many people forgot what the ‘il’ in ‘illegal’ means -- it means ‘not,’ ” he said.

Since deporting 11 million people isn’t possible, he said, he could live with a legalization plan with the conditions Obama articulated -- pay taxes, learn English and go to the back of the line.

William Mashburn, 62, a small-business owner who voted for Republican Mitt Romney in the November election, believes that wages have been depressed because illegal immigrants settle for less.

“If they became citizens, it would eliminate that, which is good for them and for the prosperity of the country,” he said.

USA TODAY

The powerful National Automobile Dealers Association is facing a backlash over its choice of Hillary Rodham Clinton as the keynote speaker for its big annual convention.

At least a dozen dealers are raising objections about the former secretary of State and possible 2016 Democratic presidential contender as the keynoter at the NADA convention in January. One dealer says he's not only going to boycott the confab in New Orleans, but is canceling his membership, Automotive News reports.

""When I see the announcement that the 'Honorable Hillary Rodham Clinton' will be giving the keynote address, the hair on my back just sticks up,"" the News quotes Jon Lind, general manager of a Ford-Lincoln dealership in Burlington, Colo., as saying.

Not all auto dealers are Republicans. President Bill Clinton's former chief of staff, Thomas ""Mack"" McLarty, is a top executive in an auto dealer group based in Arkansas. But it appears the 16,000-member NADA leans conservative when it comes to speaker choices.

Among former presidents who have addressed the NADA, Bill Clinton has been the only Democrat. Others have included Gerald Ford, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. Another former secretary of State, Colin Powell, addressed the group a couple of years ago. Powell, of course, served in the Cabinet of President George W. Bush.

Perhaps to head off a backlash, the NADA tried to put the Hillary Clinton choice in context when it announced her as keynoter on July 10.

""NADA has a long history of inviting high-profile speakers who have provided diverse perspectives on a wide range of issues,"" Desmond Roberts, chairman of NADA's convention committee and a Chevrolet dealer in Hodgkins, Ill., said in the statement. ""We've hosted U.S. presidents from both parties, as well as prime ministers and other dignitaries who have offered interesting insights and opinions.""

Her speaking fee was not disclosed."

http://news.yahoo.com/social-security-head-program-fraying-neglect-084818485--finance.html,,[],Social Security head: Program fraying from neglect,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Outgoing Social Security Commissioner Michael J. Astrue has some parting shots for Congress, the White House and advocates for seniors. They have all ""really walked away from Social Security,"" he says, leaving the program ""fraying because of inattention to its problems.""

Instead of making the hard choices to fix Social Security's financial problems, policymakers ""use it as a tool of political rhetoric,"" Astrue said.

Astrue, 56, has headed the federal government's largest program since 2007 — he was nominated by former President George W. Bush. By law, Social Security commissioners serve six-year terms, so President Barack Obama will now have the opportunity to choose his own nominee, who must be approved by the Senate. Astrue's last day on the job was Wednesday.

The trustees who oversee Social Security say the program's trust funds will run dry in 2033, leaving Social Security with only enough revenue to pay about 75 percent of benefits. Already the program is paying out more in benefits than it collects in payroll taxes.

As commissioner, Astrue served as a trustee. He regularly urged Congress to address Social Security's long-term financial problems but refrained from publicly weighing in on various options to cut benefits or raise taxes — until now.

In an interview with The Associated Press, Astrue said benefit cuts and tax increases are inevitable — despite fierce opposition to both. Yet he questions whether Congress is up to the task.

Q: The president and Republican leaders in Congress have both embraced changes to Social Security as part of negotiations to reduce government borrowing. Should Social Security be part of the deficit and debt discussions?

A: My general perspective is that Washington broadly, and I include the Congress, both parties, the executive branch, the major interest groups, have really walked away from Social Security. ... I think that Social Security is a gem. I think it is the most successful domestic program in the history of the United States government and it is fraying because of inattention to its problems. And I think it's a shame that Washington cannot get its act together to look at Social Security in detail in isolation and say, What do we need to do?

Story continues

Q: There are some in Congress who say only benefit cuts should be considered — no tax increases. Others say benefit cuts should be off the table. Where do you come down?

A: Nothing is going to happen if you establish preconditions for the conversation. I do think that for the people who simply want to tax more, you need to be very mindful of the fact that that tax will fall disproportionately on the younger generation and that if you're not careful, that could be a huge economic drag.

Q: One of the few issues that the president and Republicans in Congress agree on is changing the way the government measures inflation. As you know, this would reduce the annual cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, for Social Security recipients. Advocates for seniors hate the idea. They want bigger COLAs, not smaller ones. What do you think?

A: As a general matter I do think that the president and the Congress are right that before you start talking about increases in the retirement age and things like that it's appropriate to try to have a conversation about what we might be able to do in terms of COLA adjustments.

Q: The age when retirees can receive full benefits is gradually increasing from 66 to 67. There are proposals to increase it gradually even more, perhaps as high as 70. What do you think of those proposals?

A: I think there's some historical inevitability that we will move in that direction. How far, I don't think is historically inevitable. Part of this we need to remember is not that the system is flawed or that there are evil people around here. I mean, we should celebrate a little bit of good news. Most of the pressure on the system comes from the fact that we've had great medical advances and people are living a lot longer than before.

Q: Social Security payroll taxes only apply to the first $113,700 of a worker's wages. There have been proposals to increase this threshold or even eliminate it, applying the tax to all wages. What do you think of those ideas?

A: I think there's some historic inevitability on at least some lifting of the (payroll tax) cap. I think that most politicians and I think most economists I've talked to generally think that that would have less of a negative impact on the economy than raising the rate itself.

Q: Applications for disability benefits increased dramatically when the economy went bad. Why did that happen?

A: I think a lot of people applied out of economic desperation. Very few of those people actually ended up getting benefits. If you look at the numbers, it's one of the reasons why our approval rates have dropped dramatically in the last few years.

Q: Aren't most disability claims initially denied?

A: Yes.

Q: Why?

A: Because the statutory standard is so stringent. In terms of the percentage who get on, both in the beginning and at the end of the process, it's somewhere usually in most years in the 35 to 40 percent range. Sometimes people talk like nobody gets approved initially, and that's not true. Some people say, Oh, everybody gets on, and that's not true, either. But the statutory standard is you have to be unable to do work that exists in the national economy for 12 months or more.

Q: If your claim is denied, you can appeal to an administrative law judge, but the process can take a year or more. Tell me about your efforts to reduce these backlogs.

A: We've done, I think, some yeoman's work in reducing the backlogs. ... If you look at time to a hearing, what we call average processing time, it peaked very shortly after I started at 542 days and it got down to about 340 (days) and then drifted up a little bit with all the budget cuts in the last couple of years. But it's still about a year on average, and that's a big improvement.

Q: Are you getting enough resources from Congress to address these backlogs?

A: No.

Q: The Association of Administrative Law Judges says that in order to reduce backlogs some judges are deciding more than 500 cases a year. Is that too many cases to do a thorough job on each one?

A: No, not at all. We set for the first time productivity standards in 2007. It was actually done by the chief judge, and it was done looking at best demonstrated practices of existing judges. At that point in time about 40 percent of the judges were doing 500 to 700 cases a year. And so that's what we set as our goal, and that's what it is, it's a goal to shoot for. ... Now, about 80 percent of the judges hit that goal.

Under the latest proposed terms of a four-year labor pact, a pay hike of up to 4% in October 2016 would be reduced to about 2%, City Administrative Officer Miguel Santana, a high-level budget analyst, wrote in a confidential memo to the City Council.

After discussing the proposal behind closed doors, Los Angeles City Council President Herb Wesson said Tuesday that Garcetti and the council are “really, really, really close” to reaching agreement on the contract.

“The council is optimistic that there will be a partnership with the mayor,” he said. “You can feel it on the hair on the back of your neck.”

Garcetti said last week that he would not sign an earlier version of the proposed agreement, even though it included three consecutive years of zero raises and reduced pension benefits for future DWP employees. Compensation at the city-owned utility became a major campaign issue in this year’s mayoral race when the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and its affiliates spent $2 million to defeat Garcetti.

On Monday, Garcetti sought to ramp up pressure for more concessions by launching an online petition asking Angelenos to support his efforts to secure new language allowing elected officials to seek changes to costly or inefficient work rules.

The newly revised labor agreement would reduce entry-level pay for 34 categories of DWP employees, or about 870 employees or 11% of the utility’s workers, according to Santana’s memo.

The proposal also would give the mayor and council more power to re-examine agreements affecting DWP bonuses, overtime and work rules, according to the memo. Garcetti has taken aim at those agreements, which can cost ratepayers millions annually, particularly one that requires DWP workers to be offered overtime pay when outside contractors are hired.

Wesson and Garcetti both sought the latest changes, which were supported in recent days by the chief negotiator for the DWP union, the memo said.

Garcetti spokesman Yusef Robb would not say if the mayor would support the revised deal, but noted that “important progress” had been made. Wesson said negotiations had seen “movement” in the last 48 hours and talks were continuing.

“Did the council want to take a vote? Yes,” he said. “But there’s still things that you need to iron out. And that’s what we’re doing now.”

Councilman Paul Koretz, who previously signaled his support for the salary proposal, said he expected Garcetti to find common ground with the council. “I thought even the original deal was incredibly positive for the city,” he said. “I’ve been pleasantly surprised that it’s been slightly improved as negotiations go along.”

Garcetti told a room full of neighborhood activists at City Hall on Monday that he was not satisfied that enough progress had been made on work rules, the size of the 2016 raise and employee contributions toward health insurance costs. On Tuesday, he sent out an email blast to supporters laying out his case for additional contract changes.

“You elected me mayor to reform DWP, and just six weeks after taking office, your vote is making a difference,” Garcetti said in the email. “Right now, there is a new DWP contract proposal on the table and I want to make sure it delivers real reform to save money for you.”

The latest salary reductions would save $15.4 million over four years, according to Santana’s memo. Overall, the proposal is projected to save $4 billion over 30 years, chiefly from reduced pension outlays, according to the council’s policy advisors.

It's a complicated situation that most people coming to Daily Kos know about, but in the last few weeks, the Capitol Police have begun arresting people for singing....and often for simply observing.

We hemmed and hawed about going to the Capitol. We knew in our heads that we could be arrested, but didn't believe it would really happen.....

We found parking, walked around the beautiful building and went in the State Street doors. People were outside singing and they said as we walked by: ""Are they still arresting people in there?"" We went in and of course stopped at the bathroom...because that's what we do. Then on we went to get closer to the singing. We stood by one of the pillars near the outer edge of the crowd, and there was a song I kind of knew...I sang a bit (four or five words) but I didn't really know the words. I turned to my friend and there were three officers behind me. Yikes!

It's a bit fuzzy already (that is what age does to us!), but one of the officers said we had to leave or risk being arrested. Then he asked me if I would leave because I risked being arrested. I said that I was staying. The young woman officer was reluctant to arrest me, but the older officer seemed to be in charge. They put handcuffs (real ones, not the plastic ties) on me with my hands behind my back after taking my purse off my shoulder. It's a very full and colorful purse, and I was worried about it the whole time! It's funny what we worry about at times.

People were taking pictures and videos and calling out, ""Hero!"" It felt good and very odd all at the same time.

They walked me to the elevator and we rode down to the former cafeteria in the basement...now used as a place to fill out citations. I asked about my purse a few times, but otherwise there was no talk. I did make eye contact with the young woman officer a few times. She seemed to be embarrassed....at least I thought so.

First she asked me if I had anything on me that would hurt her! I said no. Then I was patted down. Other than the airport, this was my first pat-down. She then asked if I had my ID in my purse. I think she asked for permission to look, but I can't remember that either! She found my wallet, and I started telling her where my ID was. Then I decided she should find it herself. It was a small thing, but felt big to me. I was still in handcuffs, by the way.

She filled out the citation form, gave my ID to a young woman who took it to make a copy (I assume) and check for outstanding warrants, I guess, and we sat and waited. Nothing was said. I think I was in a bit of shock. Oh, I did ask where the $200.50 would be going, and I commented that it would be nice if the cafeteria was used for lunches instead of arrests.

When the young woman came back, they took off the cuffs, and I was free to go. As I was leaving, the officers were behind me and I held the door for them. They said thank you. Nothing beats remembering courtesy. How weird this all is/was!!

They also told me if I went back to the Rotunda, I risked arrest again. I was trying to figure out how to find my friend and walked outside the same doors I came in. I texted her and then called her. She came out, and we hugged a few times. My feelings were so complicated: a bit embarrassed, a bit proud, a bit surreal, and more! I have never been arrested before.

We sat on a wall near the sidewalk, and a lady walked by on her phone. My friend overheard her say she had been arrested, too. So we followed her and talked awhile. She said not to pay the fine and to contest it at the court date. (It's interesting.....my first thought was to pay and move on...years of conditioning, I think.) So, I am going to court this Friday to plead not guilty....for singing! More strangeness!!

I texted my adult kids and told them I am now a perp. I was an adult education teacher at the county jail for 10 years, and I am sure they never thought they would hear me say I was arrested.

They actually are proud of my civil disobedience. I am, too."

The Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine places the last version of the Keep America Safe website as June 30, 2013, several weeks prior to Cheney’s announcement, but at a time when buzz was surrounding the chance she’d enter the primary field. Its Twitter account—@KeepAmericaSafe—likewise appears to have had its last tweet around the same time, as the last manual retweet of the account was June 26. The group’s Facebook page has also gone missing, but ThinkProgress is currently unable to tell when that page went dark. Even their Ning, a little used social media connection site, has been taken down.

Hayes Brown points out that the website of Keep America Safe, a lightweight effort to keep alive the legacy of neoconservative Project for a New American Century, has been recently shuttered, along with the organization's Twitter account and Facebook page. The organization was primarily a project of Liz Cheney and Bill Kristol set up in 2009. Cheney announced she will run in the 2014 Wyoming Republican primary against incumbent Mike Enzi. That hasn't made the Wyoming GOP establishment all that happy. But the handwriting was on the wall when Cheney bought a $1.9 million residence in Jackson Hole last year:But the group's YouTube site is still operating if you're eager to see the flavor of what the group is, or was, all about. One of the group's leaders, Debra Burlingame, told Dave Weigel that “we succeeded in accomplishing what we wanted to accomplish.” Other than some generic ultra-hawkish sputtering, it's hard to see what those accomplishments were unless it was to give Cheney another platform from which to hiss the same message dear old dad laid out of us.

At the time Cheney and Kristol launched this project nearly four years ago, I wrote:



Aided by Debra Burlingame, the sister of the pilot of Flight 77, which crashed into the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, and that old neoconservative standby William Kristol, Keep America Safe will devote itself to persuading us that using waterboarding, building missile umbrellas, keeping detainees at Guantánamo Bay and following an overtly aggressive foreign policy are good things. Dad Cheney must be proud. And mom, too, she of the ahistorical approach to U.S. history. Not that the Cheneys invented American exceptionalism—that deep-seated and self-righteously justified operating perspective that the United States makes the global rules, enforces them but need not follow them when it decides its interests are at stake. Those interests being, most prominently, the bottom-line of corporadoes. That exceptionalist philosophy long preceded the Cheneys' appearance on the world stage.

Why the site would get scrubbed at this juncture is a bit hard to understand. Is young Cheney going to cut herself free of her dad's philosophy that had her just short of calling President Obama a traitor: “I think in fact what President Obama is doing is something that America’s enemies—the Taliban and Al Qaeda—have been unable to do, which is to decimate the fighting capability of this nation.”

Some stuff just can't be scrubbed. But given that the conservative Enzi's not a tea party fire-breather, perhaps Cheney's consultants are urging her to adopt a more moderate stance, at least temporarily. All for the prize: a Senate seat representing fewer citizens than any other state in the nation.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/05/19/congress-eyes-regulating-drones/,2013-05-19 00:00:00,[],Lawmakers eye regulating domestic surveillance drones,"Amid growing concern over the use of drones by police and government officials for surveillance, a bipartisan group of lawmakers is pushing to limit the use of unmanned surveillance ""eyes in the sky"" aircraft.

Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., along with Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., and Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, is sponsoring legislation that would codify due process protections for Americans in cases involving drones and make flying armed drones in the U.S. sky illegal.

Sensenbrenner believes it is necessary to develop new standards to address the privacy issues associated with use of drones — which can be as small as a bird and as large as a plane.

""Every advancement in crime fighting technology, from wiretaps to DNA, has resulted in courts carving out the Constitutional limits within which the police operate,"" Sensenbrenner said at a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing Friday on the issues surrounding drones.

The subcommittee heard from experts who were divided on what actions Congress should take to address the new technology. But the four witnesses all agreed that drones raised new, often unprecedented questions about domestic surveillance.

""Current law has yet to catch up to this new technology,"" said Chris Calabrese, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union.

Calabrese said he supported immediate regulation of the drone industry and said his biggest concern was the overuse of drones by police and government officials for surveillance. But Calabrese said he doesn't want to hinder the growth of drones with the power to do good, including helping find missing persons, assisting firefighters and addressing other emergencies.

Tracey Maclin, a professor with the Boston University School of Law, said the issues raised by drones haven't been addressed by courts before because the technology goes beyond what humans had been capable of through aerial surveillance.

Past court rulings, ""were premised on naked-eye observations — simple visual observations from a public place,"" he said.

Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., said he wanted to know when drone technology will advance to the point where Congress will have to act on the issue. He said he was concerned about the effect on privacy.

""At what point do you think it's going to get to a point where we have to say what a reasonable expectation of privacy is?"" Richmond said.

Republicans expressed similar concerns.

""It seems to me that Congress needs to set the standard, rather than wait and let the courts set the standard,"" Poe said.

""Technology is great — as long as it's used the right and proper way,"" Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said at Friday's hearing.

Some experts urged caution.

Gregory McNeal, an associate law professor at Pepperdine University, said writing laws to cover drones will be difficult because the technology continues to improve and Congress could think it's addressing key issues, only to have new ones emerge.

He compared drones to the privacy concerns raised by development of the Internet in the 1990s. Regulating then, he said, could have stymied the rapid growth of the Internet and wouldn't have addressed today's Internet privacy issues.

If Congress feels compelled to act, McNeal said, it should think in terms broader than a ""drone policy"" and set standards for surveillance or realistic expectations of privacy. ""A technology-centered approach to privacy is the wrong approach,"" he said.

But the ACLU's Calabrese said Congress should work quickly.

""This can't be adequately addressed by existing law,"" he said. ""Manned aircraft are expensive to purchase. Drones' low cost and flexibility erode that natural limit. They can appear in windows, all for much less than the cost of a plane or a helicopter.""

A future with domestic drones may be inevitable. While civilian drone use is currently limited to government agencies and some public universities, a law passed by Congress last year requires the Federal Aviation Administration to allow widespread drone flights in the U.S. by 2015. According to FAA estimates, as many as 7,500 civilian drones could be in use within five years.

Congress isn't alone in seeking to address the issues: Since January, drone-related legislation has been introduced in more than 30 states, largely in response to privacy concerns.

Mr. Wilson is one of the sailors known as the Norfolk Four, and there is every reason to think he is innocent of the rape charge that sent him to prison for more than seven years. But the conviction stands, and that means he must register as a sex offender.

He wants to clear his name, and last week the Supreme Court indicated interest in his case. All Mr. Wilson asks for is a hearing on his challenge to his conviction. But lower courts have slammed the door on him, reasoning that it is too late to consider a petition for a writ of habeas corpus because he is no longer in custody.

Mr. Wilson is working as an electrician in Texas. He was composed and polite when we spoke on Friday evening, though he sounded weary of talking about his lot. He would rather, he said, get ready for the Easter weekend. He had family coming in.

But it takes time to tick off all the ways in which the effects of his conviction will linger for the rest of his life. There is the stigma, of course. He must report to the police in person every year, keep them posted about changes in his life and check in with local authorities if he travels."

A thousand times no.

After The Financial Times reported in late May that Larry Summers was at the top of President Barack Obama's short list for chairman of the Federal Reserve when Ben Bernanke's second term in the post expires in January, opposition quickly built against that possible choice. Among those who don't want the job to go to the former Secretary of the Treasury under President Clinton and former director of the National Economic Council under Obama are 20 Democratic and allied senators who signed a letter urging that Janet Yellen get the job instead. She is currently vice chair of the Fed.

The letter and other pressure being exerted on the White House over the chairman's post have, according to The Wall Street Journal, made the president cross. The selection of the next Fed chief is in his view a crucial decision of presidential prerogative and one he apparently believes nobody should be meddling in. Thus, sources informed the Journal's reporters, there have been behind-the-scenes efforts telling the dissenters to keep their traps shut.

It's no surprise that Obama is miffed over the often acidic assessments of Summers's policy record, his abrasive personality and his sexism. Two weeks ago, he vigorously defended Summers during a private meeting with leading Democrats. Subsequently, he publicly announced that two strong choices among several he is considering are, in fact, Summers and Yellen.

The White House pushback seems to have worked, at least for now. In recent days, public critiques from the Yellen backers seem to have fallen off. Whether that's just the August recess at work or an indication that many of Summers's opponents within the party aren't up to fighting about it is anybody's guess. Top Democratic congressional leaders, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, have indicated they will support whomever the president nominates.

Before going below the fold to read more, please sign our petition requesting that President Obama not appoint Larry Summers as Federal Reserve chair, and consider instead appointing a more qualified person, such as Deputy Chair Janet Yellen."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Bush,"DALLAS -- President Obama is in the heart of George W. Bush country to pay tribute to the former president he describes as “concerned about all people in America, not just those who voted Republican.”

Obama kicked off his Texas visit at a fundraiser where he urged wealthy donors to help elect Democrats for the good of the country, but Obama was complimentary of his Republican predecessor as he prepared to attend the opening of the Bush presidential library on Thursday.

“One of the things I will insist upon is, whatever our political differences, President Bush loves this country and loves its people,” Obama told the donors late Wednesday.

That’s far cry from Obama’s past pronouncements about Bush, whom he has blamed for everything from running a “dumb” war in Iraq to crashing the economy. In his first term, Obama routinely began the story of his administration by enumerating the problems he inherited from Bush.

The passage of time has softened the criticism. As White House Press Secretary Jay Carney puts it, “there’s a special bond between those who have served their country from the Oval Office. There’s no job like it.”

Obama takes on one of the tougher parts of that job later in the day, when he speaks at a memorial service for people killed and injured in last week’s deadly explosion at a fertilizer plant in West, Texas.

First Lady Michelle Obama will join him as he speaks with families of victims, a somber duty Obama performed this winter after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School and again last week after the Boston Marathon bombing.

In his fifth year in office, Obama speaks more gently of the man who did that job just before him. Speaking to fellow Democrats on Wednesday night, Obama said that the Democratic Party “doesn’t always get it right.”

Their feelings of concern for the country are not “unique to Democrats.”

Bush shares their concerns, he said, adding, “I think that’s true about him and I think that’s true about most of us.”

(CNN) - One of the Gang of Eight senators who negotiated an immigration deal headed to the Senate floor says the bill does not yet have support to overcome a potential filibuster.

""At this moment we have not found 60 votes in the Senate,"" Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, said in an interview on the Spanish-language network Univision that was translated by CNN. ""We still need more votes in the chamber.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

The immigration legislation passed the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday with support from 10 Democrats and three Republicans, including Sens. Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham, two other members of the Gang of Eight. After months of backroom crafting by the four Democrats and four Republicans in the informal group, as well as negotiations with labor and other groups, the committee considered some 300 amendments and rejected several which some senators considered poison pills that would doom the bill.

It was important that the committee kept largely intact the product of their negotiations, Menendez said in the interview, but he said much needed to be done before the bill could pass the full Senate, where he indicated debate will likely begin on June 10.

He hoped a significant margin in the Senate would put pressure on the GOP-led House to sign on. A separate bipartisan effort has been under way there and appears to have survived a dispute over how undocumented immigrants' health care costs would be covered.

Members of both parties want to see immigration legislation pass this year, and the effort has the support of President Barack Obama and the Democratic and Republican Senate leaders.

Neither party, however, has enough to overcome a Senate filibuster on their own.

In a statement after the committee vote, Menendez wrote that the legislation faces ""a long road and our work is far from done.""

As written now, the bill would create a 13-year path to citizenship for many of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States.

Univision said the interview will air Sunday on the network's ""Al Punto"" program.

Carnival Cruise Lines says it will take up to five hours for everyone to disembark

One passenger says conditions not so bad, others disagree

Most say crew members have done great job after the ship was disabled by an engine fire

Finally, after days of listing on a disabled Carnival cruise ship without electricity and working toilets, thousands of passengers finished disembarking early Friday morning at the Port of Mobile.

The frustration that many felt was typified by Janie Esparza, one of the first passengers to get back on land.

""It was horrible. Horrible,"" Esparza told a scrum of reporters. ""The bathroom facilities were horrible and we could not flush toilets. No electricity and our rooms were in total darkness. Honestly, think that this ship should have ever sailed out.""

The Carnival Triumph, became a major media story, when it caught fire off the coast of Mexico. The blaze left the vessel listing to the side, drifting in Gulf of Mexico currents and the more than 4,200 passengers and crew on board in limbo. It took five days for the ship to dock at the Alabama Cruise Terminal, three days after it was due.

Family members cheered as the ship pulled in and in the crowd also was Carnival CEO Gerry Cahill. The CEO had his own message for the weary passengers: Sorry.

""We pride ourselves in providing our guests with a great vacation experience, and clearly we failed in this particular case,"" he said.

The beleaguered CEO went on the ship as passengers departed and delivered another apology.

But for some, like passenger Norma Reyes, it was too little too late.

""The hallways were toxic,"" said Reyes, who said she would never go on a Carnival cruise again. ""Full of urine. It was horrible. If that ship caught on fire and they had not contained it where would we be? Floating in the ocean or dead.""

Others were more forgiving.

""They did a good job of managing expectations,"" said Brett Klausman. ""The information that trickled out was probably well thought out to kind of keep people safe and calm.""

Despite the ordeal, many passengers had nothing but praise for the crew, saying they had worked long shifts to make sure their guests were as comfortable as possible.

""No power, no toilets, nothing. Nothing. I mean, it was was disgusting, but the staff, they did such an amazing job,"" said Joseph Alvarez. ""And I give them so much props because they were amazing through it all. I mean, they worked their tails off to accommodate everybody's needs.""

U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials, Coast Guard members and a Carnival team boarded the ship before it arrived in port to help speed efforts to get passengers off as quickly as possible, he said.

Some families gathered at the Alabama Cruise Terminal, far from where the ship was originally supposed to dock in Galveston, Texas. Marissa Jenks said her family reported they had a hot meal Thursday morning and crew members were trying to clean up the ship as it neared port.

Boredom and stress

At some point during the ordeal urine and feces streamed in the halls and down walls after toilet facilities failed, soaking the mattress of a friend of his who was sleeping in a hallway, said Larry Poret.

Emergency power failures caused section doors to slam shut, panicking some passengers who had no idea what was happening.

""We definitely (were) not adequately informed,"" Poret said.

Poret said toilets on the ship worked on and off, but were too inconsistent to trust.

He said waste tipped out of some commodes and sloshed across floors as the ship listed to the side.

""It runs down the walls from one floor to the next. It's running out of somebody's bathroom out into the hallway all the way across,"" he said.

Long lines for food and frequent delays were constantly aggravating, he said.

""Here we are looking for hope that, hey it's 6 o'clock, it's going to get better,"" he said. ""And 6 o'clock comes and goes and all of a sudden an announcement at 8, 'Hey, we're running behind schedule.' Well, no joke.""

The incident aboard the ship scared Poret's daughter and a friend taking the cruise with her, Poret said.

""As soon as you get them calmed down, the electric goes out and doors start slamming shut,"" he said.

During less stressful times, passengers passed the hours playing cards, walking the deck and going to see what was happening on other areas of the ship, Poret said.

Passengers set up charging stations to help their fellow passengers juice up cell phones and other devices, he said.

The final trip home

Carnival promised an army of about 200 employees would take care of its passengers once they cleared customs.

Passengers boarded buses to Galveston, where the cruise originated, or Houston, or went to spend the night in a hotel in New Orleans.

Carnival said it had reserved about 100 motor coaches, more than 1,500 New Orleans hotel rooms, multiple charter flights from New Orleans to Houston on Friday and transportation from Houston to the Port of Galveston so that guests may retrieve their cars if they drove to the port.

Carnival officials had initially planned to tow the ship to a Mexican port, but after Gulf currents pushed it farther north before tugboats could take control, and considering that 900 of the passengers do not have passports, the company decided to take the Carnival Triumph to Mobile instead, where it can be repaired.

Compensation for travelers

The cruise line said it would give each passenger $500, a free flight home, a full refund for their trip and for most expenses on board, as well as a credit for another cruise.

The Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board launched an investigation into the cause of the engine room fire. Because the Carnival Triumph is a Bahamian-flagged vessel, the Bahamas Maritime Authority is the primary investigative agency.

Travelers have few options for compensation in these cases, other than what the cruise line is already offering, according to travel expert Jason Clampet of Skift.com , a travel website.

""The passengers on the ship aren't going to have a great deal of recourse when they get home,"" he said. Travel ""insurance really doesn't cover this sort of thing. Their trip wasn't interrupted and they aren't incurring extra expenses ... so they can't be compensated that way.""

Still, there's no denying that the fire and resulting bad PR will hurt Carnival.

""It's a terrible sight, thinking of people trapped on a ship with limited food and filthy conditions, so I think people will think twice about taking a cruise,"" Clampet said.

Bad luck before

The fire is at least the second problem for the ship since late January, when it had an issue with its propulsion system, according to a notice posted on the website of Carnival senior cruise director John Heald.

It's also not the first fire to disable one of the cruise line's ships.

In 2010, the Carnival cruise ship Splendor lost power after an engine room fire, leaving it drifting off the Pacific coast of Mexico. The USS Ronald Reagan ferried 60,000 pounds of supplies for the ship's passengers and crew as the ship was towed to San Diego.

After this ill-fated cruise, the Carnival Triumph won't host vacationing passengers until at least mid-April. Carnival has canceled a dozen voyages scheduled between February 21 and April 13. That makes a total of 14 scratched trips. The cruise line already had eliminated voyages slated for February 11 and February 16."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

The more militant members of the N.R.A. and most of its leaders may be un-American.

By “militant” I don’t mean those who wish to protect recreational shooting and hunting; nor do I mean those who, like Justice Antonin Scalia, believe that there is a constitutional right to defend one’s home and family with firearms. These are respectable positions (although I am deeply unpersuaded by the second). I mean those who read the Second Amendment as proclaiming the right of citizens to resist the tyranny of their own government, that is, of the government that issued and ratified the Constitution in the first place.

The reason this view may be un-American is that it sets itself against one of the cornerstones of democracy — the orderly transfer of power. A transfer of power is orderly when it is effected by procedural rules that are indifferent to the partisan, ideological affiliations of either the party exiting power or the party taking power. A transfer is disorderly when it is effected by rebellion, invasion, military coup or any other use of force.

Those who are engaged in a disorderly transfer believe that their actions are inspired by the highest of motives — the desire to set right what has gone terribly wrong. Somehow the forces of evil have gained the levers of power, and unless they are dislodged, the values necessary to the sustaining of everything we cherish will be overwhelmed. Violence is ugly, but if tyranny is to be defeated, it may be necessary. Given tyranny’s resilience and its tendency to fill any available political space, we must always be ready; the price of liberty is eternal vigilance.



This is a familiar story; indeed it is the story — or at least one story — of the American Revolution, and that is why it is the story Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice president of the N.R.A., told to a Senate committee in January: “Senator, I think without any doubt, if you look at why our Founding Fathers put [the Second Amendment] there, they had lived under the tyranny of King George and they wanted to make sure that these free people in this new country would never be subjugated again and have to live under tyranny.”

In 1990, Fred Romero, an N.R.A. field representative, put the case as clearly as possible: “The Second Amendment is not there to protect the interests of hunters, sport shooters and casual plinkers.” Rather, the “Second Amendment is … literally a loaded gun in the hands of the people held to the heads of government.” In response to statements like this (and there are many of them), President Obama recently said in a speech in Denver: “The government’s us. These officials are elected by you.” Or, in other words, how can the people’s enemy be the representatives elected by the people?

The N.R.A. militants have an answer. The purpose of the American Revolution was to secure the freedom of individuals and that means a minimally intrusive government. Representatives elected to safeguard that freedom may become intoxicated by their power and act in ways that restrict rather than enhance individual choice. At that point it is the people’s right and duty to rise against them. Measures limiting gun ownership are a sure sign that government is moving in the direction of central control and tyranny.

But who gets to decide that tyranny is imminent, and by what measure is the imminence of tyranny determined? That question was debated on patch.com by posters responding to a story about Baltimore County Police Chief James Johnson, who had called the tyranny argument of LaPierre and others “creepy” and “scary.” A commenter posting under the name Sanchez explained that “Tyranny consists of many things we have experienced the last 4 years, the firearm issue the latest in the line of them.” The point was echoed and amplified by another commenter, William Gill: “The second amendment is the only one that can assure the protection of your other rights which are being attacked almost daily by the current administration.” (In short, the Obama administration = tyranny.) A commenter posting as Steve responded, “It’s not ‘Tyranny’ just because you were outvoted. That’s Democracy.”

Steve is standing up for the orderly transfer of power and saying that we don’t call it tyranny when the other guy’s ideas have carried the political day. But he is met immediately by two responses from other commenters. First, “Steve, you’re assuming that the voting process was above board! Let’s face it, this election in November was by no means above board.” That is, the election results did not reflect majority will but some form of corrupt manipulation. (Those conspiring to overthrow government cite a conspiracy theory as their justification.)

The second response cuts deeper: “We live in a Republic Steve … majority rules is a problem indeed” (Buck Harmon). Harmon is invoking the familiar distinction between a democracy and a republic. In a democracy the majority determines what the law is and could, at least theoretically, take away the rights of individuals for the sake of the “public good.” In a republic, majority will is held in check by constitutional guarantees that forbid legislation encroaching on individual rights even if 51 percent or 95 percent of the population favors it. (For example, Congress shall pass no law abridging the freedom of expression.)

It follows from this distinction that a government elected by the majority can begin to think it can do anything it wants to, can begin to act as if we lived in a democracy rather than in a republic, and when that happens, or is in danger of happening, there is what the former Senate candidate Sharron Angle called a “Second Amendment remedy.” Asked, in 2010, “Do we have enemies of the country in the halls of Congress?”, Angle replied, “Certainly people who pass these kinds of policies — Obamacare, cap and trade, stimulus, bailout.” Off with their heads, either metaphorically, or in sufficiently dire circumstances, literally.

So for Angle and others, that’s the shape of tyranny — legislation that, in their judgment, abridges constitutionally protected rights. Sanchez explains: “We are all to decide what tyranny is. Just as we decide what law we obey or not.” This antinomian declaration — our inner light will tell us when and when not to obey — flies in the face of another commonplace of democracy: ours is a government of laws not men (a declaration found in the 1780 Constitution of Massachusetts). A government of men is one in which laws issue from the will and desires of those who happen to be in authority. In a government of laws the preferences of men (and women), even those holding high office, are checked by the impersonal requirements of an impersonal law.

Another version of the commonplace is, no man is above the law. The opposite view was famously declared by Richard Nixon when he said, “When the president does it, that means it is not illegal.” N.R.A. militants like Sanchez and Angle are, in effect, an army of little Richard Nixons, deciding what laws to obey, and deciding too when lawmakers have failed to obey the law as they see it. Unlike Nixon, they don’t have an F.B.I., a Treasury Department and a standing army; but they do have the Second Amendment and the right, or so they claim, to take arms against a government they have judged to be wayward.

In the same thread quoted earlier, C. P. takes the logic to its conclusion: “Secession is near. Can’t wait. Which by the way is Constitutional.” It’s constitutional, in this view, because a government in the act of eroding constitutional values is itself unconstitutional and has become a tyranny. Therefore to oppose it by whatever means available, including force, is not to undermine constitutionality, but to affirm it. It is in this spirit that John Wilkes Booth cried “Sic semper tyrannis” (“thus always to tyrants”) just after he shot Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln famously said, “A house divided against itself cannot stand.” Booth’s modern successors are saying that a house in the hands of tyrants does not deserve to stand and they are ready to bring it down with their constitutionally protected guns.

As Police Chief Johnson said, this is creepy and scary, but is it — to return to my original musings — un-American? Yes and no. On the one hand, nothing can be more American than throwing off the shackles of a government that has overstepped its bounds and disregarded the rights of its citizens. That’s how it all began. (“No taxation without representation.”) But on the other hand, the American tradition of accepting the results of elections — even when they bring with them policies you believe to be misguided at best and disastrous at worst — is in danger of being undermined when groups of armed people decide that the present leadership is infected by unpatriotic, socialist ideas and must be resisted at all costs.

A government founded in a revolutionary moment is always vulnerable to a determination by a zealous minority that its revolutionary ideals have been compromised by itself. When that happens, each side will engage in its favored rhetoric, one proclaiming, watch out, they’re coming for our guns, the other warning that militant right-wing nuts are preparing themselves for armed insurrection. One side will cry “tyranny”; the other will reply, “You guys are crazy.” And both will claim the title of true American. That’s where we are."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/04/virginia-governor-race_n_4213472.html,2013-11-04 00:00:00,['Senior National Editor'],Virginia Governor Race Draws Big Spending From Environmental Groups,"WASHINGTON -- Environmentalists are poised to become the second-biggest contributor to the effort to elect Democrat Terry McAuliffe as the next governor of Virginia, trailing only the Democratic Governors Association in spending on his campaign.

The Virginia League of Conservation Voters has spent nearly a million dollars on the race between McAuliffe and Ken Cuccinelli, the Republican attorney general, according to campaign records from the Virginia Public Access Project. Jeff Gohringer, press secretary for the national League of Conservation Voters, said that the group has contributed $1.9 million to the state league in both cash and in-kind contributions this election cycle across all races. The Sierra Club launched its own anti-Cuccinelli efforts as well.

Polling heading into Tuesday's election shows McAuliffe with a 6-point lead over Cuccinelli.

Cuccinelli has been a particularly popular target for environmental groups, given his outspoken denial of climate change. In his role as attorney general, Cuccinelli attempted to subpoena the records and emailed correspondence of a former University of Virginia climate scientist, accusing him of fraud in his climate research. That climate scientist, Michael Mann, has been campaigning against Cuccinelli in the state.

""We got involved in this race because of climate change,"" said LCV's Gohringer.

""[Cuccinelli] is one of the most vocal climate deniers in the country. To defeat him would send a signal to other climate change deniers, and also highlight the growing environmental movement.""

The McAuliffe campaign has also criticized Cuccinelli's climate change denial in television ads that accuse the Republican of being too extreme for Virginia.

The Virginia League of Conservation Voters' political action committee is also running a field program that it characterized as the largest effort by an outside group this year -- with volunteers making an estimated 300,000 canvassing visits over the course of the campaign -- one-third of them in the final five days of the race, according to Gohringer.

McAuliffe has been accused of waffling on coal and greenhouse gas emissions over the years. He did not come out in support of the EPA's new rules for coal-fired power plants until early last month. His opponent quickly seized on the statement as part of a ""war on coal.""

""I think we've seen Terry McAuliffe unafraid to really lean into these issues throughout the campaign, talking about climate change, supporting the EPA,"" said Gohringer. ""He's been a champion throughout the campaign. It's been a dividing line between the candidates.""

The League of Conservation Voters was a significant spender in the Virginia Senate race last year, as well, contributing $2 million to help Democrat Tim Kaine defeat Republican George Allen. The group and its affiliates spent a record $14 million on the 2012 election."

So you know what? I agree with Rand Paul. We cannot trust Russia or Syria. Killing civilians is bad, but it's not that bad. We shouldn't do anything.



SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KY (9/10/2013): It's a violation of every norm for someone to kill civilians, and I think Assad should be accountable.

So I agree with Rand Paul. No, Jimmy, the second Rand Paul.

Thank you. OK. We must hold them accountable with the President's plan of limited strikes. Send a message.



SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KY (9/10/2013): They have said that the war would be ""unbelievably small"" and limited. To me that sounds like they are pre-announcing that the military strikes will not punish Assad personally or effect regime change. ... I think if Assad's responsible, he deserves death for this.

SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KY (9/10/2013): I think if we bomb Assad, I think it will more likely that the country becomes more unstable. ... Just about any bad outcome you could imagine is made more likely by U.S. involvement in the Syrian civil war.

1) no diplomacy,

2) can't do nothing,

3) but no to the President's plan,

4) and no to regime change.

I mean, taken all together, that's really....................................... huh.

Melvin Watt (D-North Carolina), to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. He also nominated ex-telecom lobbyist Tom Wheeler as the head of the FCC. (The Washington Post)

President Obama named Rep. Melvin Watt (D-North Carolina), to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. He also nominated ex-telecom lobbyist Tom Wheeler as the head of the FCC. (The Washington Post)

President Obama on Wednesday nominated telecom industry lobbyist Tom Wheeler to head the Federal Communications Commission and Rep. Mel Watt (D-N.C.) to be the next director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

Wheeler, a venture capital investor and friend of Obama’s, will take over an agency struggling to keep up with enormous changes in the telecom industry as consumers turn to mobile devices and ultra-fast broadband Internet for news, communications and video entertainment.

Watt will be the first permanent director in nearly four years for the obscure but powerful housing regulator that oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage giants that were bailed out by taxpayers in 2008 and today control more than half of the mortgage market. Fannie and Freddie wield great power over who gets a loan and at what cost — and, for struggling borrowers, who gets relief.

In nominating Watt, Obama noted that the congressman has served on the House Financial Services Committee during entire his 20 years in office. In that capacity, “Mel has led efforts to rein in unscrupulous mortgage lenders. He’s helped protect consumers from the kind of reckless risk-taking that led to the financial crisis in the first place. And he’s fought to give more Americans in low-income neighborhoods access to affordable housing,” the president said. “So Mel understands as well as anybody what caused the housing crisis.”

The president drew laughs as he later introduced his new FCC chairman, after praising the work of outgoing chairman Julius Genachowski.

“Now, if anybody is wondering about Tom’s qualifications, Tom is the only member of both the cable television and the wireless industry hall of fame. So he’s like the Jim Brown of telecom, or the Bo Jackson of telecom,” Obama said. “And that’s because for more than 30 years, Tom has been at the forefront of some of the very dramatic changes that we’ve seen in the way we communicate and how we live our lives.”

Obama noted Wheeler’s private- and public-sector involvement in the tech industry. “He was one of the leaders of a company that helped create thousands of good, high-tech jobs. He’s in charge of the group that advises the FCC on the latest technology issues. He’s helped give American consumers more choices and better products. So Tom knows this stuff inside and out.”

Wheeler comes to the FCC with deep ties to the nation’s biggest telecom lobbying groups. He has served as head of the wireless industry’s CTIA trade group and the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, among the most powerful and deep-pocketed lobbying groups in Washington.

Those connections have raised concerns among critics of the nomination. “I am skeptical that the former chief lobbyist of the wireless and cable industries will be capable of holding his former clients accountable for their ongoing shortcomings,” said Sascha Meinrath, head of the Open Technology Institute at the New America Foundation think tank.

Wheeler sits on the board of EarthLink, and his investment firm, Core Capital Partners, has invested in wireless equipment and data center technology firms.

Some experts say that range of industry experience may benefit an agency in need of greater technological and business expertise.

“He can’t be pigeonholed,” said Gigi Sohn, president of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge. “He’s had a wide variety of experiences and has worked with competitive companies as well as incumbents. I truly believe he will be independent and thoughtful.”

Outgoing chairman Genachowski, who made the expansion of broadband a priority, leaves Wheeler with much unfinished business. Genachowski is expected to leave after the agency’s next public meeting on May 9.

Wheeler will inherit a contentious and drawn-out battle to auction television airwaves to wireless carriers to expand their networks. It is unclear whether TV stations are willing to sell this spectrum to make the auction, expected to take place next year, a success.

As chairman, Wheeler may also have to weigh in on the fast-changing television landscape, where traditional business models of cable and broadcast networks are being shaken up by online video providers.

Several mergers will also come before the FCC chairman for consideration, including a bidding war between Japan’s SoftBank and Dish Network over the nation’s third-largest wireless provider, Sprint.

And later this year, a federal appeals court will rule on arguments made by Verizon Wireless and MetroPCS that the FCC does not have the ability to regulate broadband Internet providers.

The agency has been under attack by phone giants who have argued that the FCC should not strap new rules to the fast-growing broadband market. But consumer groups have demanded more oversight of Internet service providers to prevent rising cable and wireless bills and a troubling lack of competition.

At the FHFA, acting director Ed DeMarco has clashed repeatedly with Obama’s economic advisers and over how far Fannie and Freddie should go to assist struggling homeowners. Obama’s team has pushed DeMarco to embrace a plan to partially forgive mortgage debt for hundreds of thousands of struggling borrowers; DeMarco has resisted, saying the move would cost the companies, and therefore taxpayers, too much.

Watt is likely to be friendlier to the administration’s views — a stance that could prompt Senate Republicans to oppose his nomination, even though he hails from Congress, a point that would augur in his favor. In Obama’s first term, Republicans refused to confirm North Carolina banking regulator Joseph Smith as Obama’s FHFA nominee, and he eventually withdrew.

After being terribly bruised in the financial crisis, Fannie and Freddie have made a strong recovery and are posting billions in profits. They still owe taxpayers well over $100 billion, however, and many industry officials say there needs to be a transformation of the mortgage market in coming years so it less reliant on federally owned companies.

If confirmed, Watt would be a principal actor in this effort. He has spent 20 years on the House Financial Services and Judiciary committees, and during that time has emphasized fighting deceptive lending and financial practices. He was a key participant in crafting the Dodd-Frank act.

Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) applauded the nomination of Watt to head the agency, which has been without a permanent director for nearly four years.

“Congressman Watt has deep expertise in housing policy and a record of distinguished service on the House Financial Services Committee,” Cummings said.

But Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) sharply criticized Obama’s choice, saying he “could not be more disappointed in this nomination.”

“This gives new meaning to the adage that the fox is guarding the hen house,” Corker said. The FHFA should focus first on how to rein in the power of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said Corker, who sits on the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.

“Before any nominee should be considered for this post, regardless of their qualifications, the administration should explicitly lay out how they will unwind these entities,” he said.

One the opposite side of the political spectrum, some liberals are concerned that Watt is too close to banking interests in his home town of Charlotte to be effective at the helm of the FHFA."

Follow Her On Twitter']",Corey Feldman slammed for calling criticism of lingerie birthday party 'bullying',"Some anti-bullying experts are calling foul after former child actor Corey Feldman likened online criticism of his money-making lingerie birthday party to cyber bullying.

Held at his ""Feldmansion,"" the party (which guys could reportedly attend for $250, and was free to gals), featured scores of scantily clad women, many in angel outfits, who he dubbed ""Corey's Angels."" In photos of the soiree published by Vice magazine, Feldman is wearing a mask and a robe alongside his barely clothed female guests in a home covered with posters of his movies from the 1980s.

Apparently Feldman thought the photos Vice ran portrayed his party in a negative light and, thus, were a form of bullying. In a press release distributed on Tuesday, Feldman lashed out at those who had trashed his party. “Bullying is present in schools, homes, professional environments and online and here is a case no different from just that,” Feldman stated. “I can take criticism, but what people are saying online as of late is far beyond that.”

Many disagreed with Feldman’s take, and noted that while some comments directed toward him may have been inappropriate, it was wrong to use the serious issue of bullying to promote his own agenda.

“This is horrible! I can’t believe that Corey would utilize such a serious issue to gain traction for his ‘comeback.’ If this is what I think it is, Corey should be ashamed and every national bullying organization should demand he apologize,” Dr. Chuck Williams, Drexel University Clinical Professor and Director of the Center for the Prevention of School-Aged Violence. “This could be what I call the ‘Miley Cyrus Effect’ – doing anything, no matter how pathetic, in order to get attention.”

Beverly Hills-based clinical psychologist Dr. Jared Maloff also pointed out that while celebrities are often easy targets for keyboard bullies, criticism is different.

“Anyone using the public eye for their personal gain is going to be subjected to criticism,” Maloff said. “Not everyone has to like the material released, and for Mr. Feldman, it is simply an occupational hazard.”

James McGibney, co-founder of BullyVille.com told FOX411 that bullying can occur no matter a person’s stature, but that making false accusations of bullying doesn't help anyone. “If any child or adult claims to be being bullied, then it needs to be seriously looked at, as bullying at any age can occur and is a serious thing,” he said. “However, if false claims (of bullying) are made, then it will negatively impact those who are genuinely suffering from bullying cases in their lives.”

Pop culture site Uproxx called Feldman’s cyber-bullying accusations “a novel bit of spin doctoring.” Indeed Feldman’s press release seemed to use the bullying accusation as a springboard to publicize his other business ventures, including a follow-up event in October, a clothing line, an autobiography, a new movie, and new music.

Still, others are willing to give the “Lost Boys” star the benefit of the doubt.

“We have no idea how Corey is feeling after his seeing negative words written about him. If he was hurt, then he was hurt, and I feel horrible for anyone who gets hurt by another's words,” said Elissa Kravetz, co-partner of Kravetz PR and founder of the non-profit, anti-bullying organization The Farley Project. “If Corey wants to also use this time to spread awareness for what he has going on, then good for him!”

Though his press release invited interviews with Feldman, his rep did not respond to a request for further comment.

An inebriated passenger on a January flight from Iceland to New York tries to grope and choke fellow travelers until crew members and other passengers bind him with duct tape.

Such incidents are no longer flukes but rather a trend that has prompted airlines to call for new laws to deal with unruly passengers and other onboard mayhem on international flights.

The number of incidents of unruly passengers jumped from less than 500 in 2007 to more than 6,000 in 2011, according to the International Air Transport Assn., the trade group for world airlines, which has been keeping track of the incidents.

In 1963, representatives from 185 countries met in Tokyo to adopt a set of laws that focused on onboard crimes related to hijacking. But the laws are outdated and do not address the kind of mayhem that some passengers cause, delaying flights and fraying nerves, said Perry Flint, an IATA spokesman.

“Lots of changes have taken place over the past 50 years,” he said. “The old rules no longer do a good job of addressing this problem.”

For example, under the 1963 laws, the country where a plane is registered has legal jurisdiction over offenses on the plane. But today about 40% of commercial planes are leased, meaning the country where the plane is registered is not always the country where the airline is based, according to IATA.

A meeting has been scheduled for March by the International Civil Aviation Organization, a branch of the United Nations, to discuss new rules on how to deal with unruly passengers. A location for the meeting has not been set.

Police.']",Grounded TV Marti plane a monument to the limits of American austerity,"At an airfield in rural Georgia, the U.S. government pays a contractor $6,600 a month for a plane that doesn’t fly.

The plane is a 1960s turboprop with an odd array of antennas on its back end and the name of a Cuban national hero painted on its tail. It can fly, but it doesn’t. Government orders.

“The contract now is a ‘non-fly’ ” contract, said Steve Christopher of Phoenix Air Group, standing next to the plane. “That’s what the customer wants.”

The airplane is called “Aero Martí,” and it is stuck in a kind of federal limbo. After two years of haphazard spending cuts in Washington, it has too little funding to function but too much to die.

The plane was outfitted to fly over the ocean and broadcast an American-run TV station into Cuba. The effort was part of the long-running U.S. campaign to combat communism in Cuba by providing information to the Cuban people uncensored by their government.

But Cuban officials jammed the signal almost immediately, and surveys showed that less than 1 percent of Cubans watched. Still, when Congress started making budget cuts, lawmakers refused to kill the plane.

But then they allowed across-the-board “sequestration” cuts. And there was no more money for the fuel and pilots. So the plane sits in storage at taxpayer expense — a monument to the limits of American austerity. In this case, a push to eliminate long-troubled programs collided with old Washington forces: government inertia, intense lobbying and congressional pride.

The result was a stalemate. And a plane left with just enough money to do nothing.

“It’s hard to state how ridiculous it is” that the plane is still costing taxpayers money, said Philip Peters, an official in two Republican administrations and now the president of the Alexandria-based Cuba Research Center.

Peters said the plane’s broadcasts had “no audience. They’ve been effectively jammed, ever since their inception. And rather than spend the money on something that benefits the public . . . it’s turned into a test of manhood on Capitol Hill.”

This plane is a last remnant of a long, weird experiment in television broadcasting across the Straits of Florida. The plan was to broadcast uncensored news and commentary on a station named for Cuban patriot José Martí.

The hope was that something boundless — American disdain for the communist regime of Fidel and Raúl Castro — could overcome something fixed. Which was the laws of physics.

Much of Cuba was simply too far over the horizon to get a strong-enough TV signal from aircraft flying in U.S. airspace. Still, the effort moved ahead.

“I am convinced that TV Martí will succeed,” then-Sen. Ernest “Fritz” Hollings (D-S.C.), a major supporter, said in 1989. “Castro likes to tout his revolutionary credentials,” Hollings said. “But he cannot begin to match the revolutionary potential of television.”

As it turned out, he could.

The first broadcast of TV Martí was March 27, 1990. It came in clear in Havana for about 20 minutes. Then the American signal — weakened by distance — was jammed by Cuban broadcasts on the same channel.

“ ‘La TV que no se ve.’ The TV that can’t be seen,” was what Cubans called it, said Fulton Armstrong, a U.S. official in Havana at the time. Another problem: The early broadcasts happened very late at night, to minimize interference with other Cuban programming. What people saw, Armstrong said, was “a moving shadow of an image of . . . something. At something like 4 a.m.”

The TV signal was first broadcast from a blimp called “Fat Albert,” suspended 10,000 feet over the Florida Keys. But there is weather at 10,000 feet. “Fat Albert” blew off into the Everglades in 1991. It was pulled frequently out of action to dodge high winds.

In 2005, it was torn to bits by Hurricane Dennis, and the government gave up on blimps. Instead, it tried planes.

First, there was a military C-130. It cost too much. Then came “Aero Martí” and a sister aircraft (now retired), smaller planes fitted with broadcasting antennas and flown in a figure-eight pattern in U.S. airspace near Key West.

Since these planes first flew in October 2006, they have cost taxpayers at least $32 million. That’s more than $12,000 a day.

But on Cuban TV sets, they didn’t make much difference.

In 2008, according to the Government Accountability Office, a telephone survey found about the same viewership as had been reported in 2006. And in 2003. And in 1990. Less than 1 percent (after that, the U.S. government stopped taking the survey, declaring it was impossible to get valid data on Cuban TV habits).

But the planes kept flying.

The program was repeatedly protected from Washington budget-cutters by a coalition of Cuban American lawmakers and non-Cuban legislators from Florida. To them, what looked like the program’s worst problems were actually proof that it had to be saved.

For instance: The broadcasts are jammed. Well, wasn’t that the best evidence of their potential, if the jamming stopped or the Castros fell?

“If it wasn’t important, why would they block the signals? So we know that it’s effective,” Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) said in an interview last week. Other backers include Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) and Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.).

Diaz-Balart also viewed another common criticism of the plane — the cost of the program — as a strong reason to keep it. After all, he said, the government spent a lot of money to turn an airplane into a flying antenna.

“It would . . . be a colossal waste of money” to junk the plane now, Diaz-Balart said.

Years went by. Millions poured in. Then, in 2012, the Obama administration officially gave up.

The federal Office of Cuba Broadcasting, which pays for the plane, asked Congress to eliminate it. The savings: about $2 million a year.

“We have evolved from the airplane to distribute our TV content toward means that we know are popular on the island,” said Carlos A. García Pérez, a Cuban American trial lawyer from Puerto Rico who now heads the office. The station, for instance, now broadcasts on DirectTV, to reach Cubans with pirated satellite dishes. And it burns newscasts onto DVDs and sends 1,000 a week to be handed out by Cuban activist groups and churches.

The plane kept flying.

“No one dislikes TV Martí more than the Cuban government,” said Mauricio Claver-Carone, the Washington director of the U.S.-Cuba Democracy PAC, a group that lobbies for stronger measures against the Castro regime. “Do we therefore, essentially, give in to those efforts by the regime and do their job for them?”

Congress preserved the funding. So from October to this May, the administration spent $751,999 to operate a plane it had declared was not worth the money.

But then came sequestration.

This was a broad hack across the budget, which Congress made after it failed to agree on more targeted budget cuts. At the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, officials found their share of the cut was $1.4 million.

They kept the plane. They cut the flying.

Now, the agency still pays $79,500 a year to keep the aircraft in storage, paying money for nothing in a time when sequestration is causing painful cuts in other programs. That cost, for instance, is roughly equal to the average cost of nine children enrolled in Head Start (at a time when Head Start has eliminated services to 57,000 children because of sequestration).

And the plane does not seem likely to get out of limbo anytime soon.

Congress appears unwilling to kill it and too distracted to focus on small-bore budget cuts. The administration seems unwilling to start flying it again. But they’re also unwilling to get rid of it. What if Congress demanded it back?

“If the government thinks they may someday resurrect the program, then it would not be in their best interest to have us scrap the airplane,” said Dent Thompson, an official at Phoenix Air.

In the meantime, the TV Martí operation is adapting to a future without the plane. Under García Pérez, its content has turned from anti-Castro speeches toward more straight news, including reports about Cuba produced on the island by Cubans themselves. The station reports anecdotal signs of progress: 18,000 daily visits to its Web site. More than 2,600 entries from Cuba to an on-air moped giveaway. Marriage proposals to anchor Karen Caballero, sent electronically from Havana.

But — after 23 years, a blimp, three planes and millions of taxpayer dollars — the operation faces the same problem it did back in 1990. It is a mass broadcast in search of a mass audience.

“Only recently, they have started to deliver some DVDs into the island . . . and persons are very eager to watch this,” Orlando Luis Pardo, an independent blogger in Cuba, said in a telephone interview. He also said people listen to a sister broadcast, Radio Martí. Pardo said the end of the airplane-based broadcasts didn’t change the situation at all: For him, the station was as difficult to watch as it was before.

“TV Martí, unfortunately, was born completely blocked,” he said."

President Obama and his family are vacationing on Martha’s Vineyard until Aug. 18.

President Obama and his family are vacationing on Martha’s Vineyard until Aug. 18.

President Obama began his Martha’s Vineyard vacation in traditional style Sunday, wasting no time in hitting the golf course.

Taking a break from wrangling over immigration reform and planning for federal budget debates, the president began his first full day of vacation with a midday round at Farm Neck Golf Club in Oak Bluffs. He was joined by aide Marvin Nicholson and White House chef Sam Kass, with Robert Wolf, a former UBS Americas chairman and one of Obama’s principal Wall Street allies, completing the foursome.

But if the president had been hoping to get his vacation off on the right foot, he was out of luck.

“His first putt was a miss, which Obama reacted to by leaning back and kicking his knee up, as if trying to coax the ball into breaking right,” according to the pool report from the journalists who watched him play the first hole.

“He let out a little, ‘Ooooh,’ as it happened. Next one missed, too. Last one he just dragged in the hole,” the report added.

It is the fourth time Obama has vacationed on the upscale island, although he skipped a trip here last year during the presidential campaign. Golf has been his preferred way to unwind — he has played more than a dozen rounds on previous visits.

Lee Gibbon, a restaurant owner from Washington state who is vacationing on the island, was sitting in the golf course’s cafe when Obama showed up to play a round.

“He said, ‘Isn’t this a great day?,’ and some people wished him well, and he went and teed off,” Gibbon said.

He described the president as an “accomplished” rather than a “great” golfer, but said he was impressed by what he saw. “Taking a shot in front of 50 people — that’s a lot of pressure,” Gibbon said.

The president arrived with first lady Michelle Obama shortly before 4 p.m. on Saturday. He is due to return to Washington on Sunday, and no public events are planned during his vacation. Aides said he will continue to receive daily updates from national security adviser Susan Rice and deputy chief of staff Rob Nabors, both of whom are on the island.

Residents on Martha’s Vineyard said they have learned to spot familiar signs indicating that the president is in town.

Margaret Saul, a sales clerk at Alley’s Farm Stand, a short distance from where the Obamas are staying, said Secret Service agents had stopped to buy groceries Saturday night.

“They tell everyone they are here on a fishing trip,” she said. “They think they are blending in, but it’s obvious,” she added, noting that the agents typically travel in pairs in black cars and often have radio wires in their ears.

However, one familiar accompaniment to the president’s trip has been more muted than usual, with Republicans largely avoiding criticizing Obama for vacationing on an island dotted with multimillion-dollar homes.

Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah) was an exception, telling a newspaper last week that the choice made the president appear “tone deaf” because most of Stewart’s constituents “could never afford to visit Martha’s Vineyard.”

Islanders rejected that argument, saying they thought that the commander in chief deserved a break and expressing hope that the publicity would encourage more people to visit, boosting the local economy.

One retailer was looking to cash in with T-shirts bearing the slogan “I vacationed with Obama — Martha’s Vineyard ’13,” while another store, Portobello Road in Edgartown, had already sold a handmade wooden sign reading “Obama Rules” and was touting a second.

The Obamas are again staying on Martha’s Vineyard’s western tip, but in a different home after their previous choice, the 28-acre Blue Heron Farm, was sold to an owner who refused to rent it out.

Their new place is a $7.6 million, six-bedroom house overlooking Chilmark Pond and the ocean beyond, and it features a swimming pool and a basketball court. It is owned by David Schulte, a Democratic donor who is a friend of the president and works in corporate restructuring.

Because the house is a few hundred feet from a major road, the Secret Service has banned nearby traffic during the eight-day visit, ruffling some feathers. The Vineyard Gazette reported that Chilmark Selectman Warren Doty complained that the new approach would be “very disruptive,” and the town sent out an e-mail advising residents with complaints to contact the White House.

But at the twice-weekly artisans fair in West Tisbury, a few miles from where the Obamas are staying, residents and tourists were keen to play down the dispute.

“I think everyone is excited and perfectly willing to put up with the road closure here,” Jay Kirch, 81, said as he sat in the shade at a picnic table. “I do believe he needs protection and privacy.”

Lorri Hart, 54, who was selling her custom-made jewelry at the fair, echoed Kirch’s view on the traffic disruption, saying, “I’m fine with that as long as he brings a lot of people here to visit.”

“We’re used to a lot of important people coming here, but it’s still exciting,” she added."

The Internal Revenue Service spent years averting its eyes while clever campaign operatives abused the tax code for political purposes. Advocacy groups, mostly on the right, wanted to run attack ads while concealing the source of their money, and they came up with a brilliant way to do it: claim to be “social welfare” groups, which are allowed to hide donors.

Federal statutes say these groups can only engage in social welfare activity, but the tax agency decided political activity was fine as long as it wasn’t the primary purpose of the group. That helped create the torrent of secret money that poisoned the last few federal elections. The I.R.S. never explained, though, what kinds of activities are considered political, or why these groups, also known as 501(c)(4)’s, should be allowed to participate in campaigns at all.



On Thursday, long after the abuse became too rampant to ignore, the I.R.S. took the first tentative steps at reining in the problems it helped create. It proposed a definition of “candidate-related political activity,” an important starting point in determining what tax-exempt groups are really allowed to do. But it will have to do much more than that if it wants to be taken seriously as a regulator on this battlefield.

According to a press release from the Treasury Department, the agency said the new definition of political activity would include ads or other communications that clearly advocate for a candidate or party, or ads that mention a candidate within 60 days of a general election (30 days for primaries). That’s a good start for a definition, though 60 days is far too narrow a window — many of these attack ads air a full year or more before voting begins.

Once political activity is defined and separated from social welfare activity, 501(c)(4)’s will no longer be able to claim, as Karl Rove and others have, that “issue ads” mentioning candidates are for social welfare purposes. (These are the kinds of ads that say, “Dog-kicking is terrible. Call Senator Jones and tell her to stop doing it.”)

But a definition alone won’t do any good unless the I.R.S. tells these groups how much political activity is permitted. The ideal answer would be: zero. Social welfare groups have no business meddling in politics. Any group with a political interest has its own place in the tax code — they can be a 527 political organization. Those groups, which include political parties and official campaign organizations, also get tax exemptions, but there is one crucial difference: they have to disclose their donors, and 501(c)(4)’s don’t.

Conservatives immediately claimed that the I.R.S. was trying to take away their free-speech rights, which is laughable. Absolutely nothing is stopping advocacy from running ads, and the Supreme Court, in the Citizens United case, even granted corporations the right to make unlimited donations to independent groups that produce political ads. But there is no right to keep these donations a secret.

The Treasury announcement, tantalizingly, said the I.R.S. would consider comments from the public on how much political activity should be permitted for a social welfare group, suggesting that decision was farther down the road. It’s in the agency’s interest to end the confusion surrounding 501(c)(4)’s, which has led to charges that it has been arbitrary in its audits. But it’s in the public interest to do even more, and disallow sleazy secret money in campaigns."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/13/Palin-Even-Congress-Can-t-Stop-Angry-Atheists-from-Removing-Crosses-from-Veterans-Memorials,2013-12-13 00:00:00,['Tony Lee'],Palin: Even Congress Can't Stop 'Angry Atheists' from Removing Crosses from Veterans Memorials,"Saying a decision by a federal court to remove the famous Mt. Soledad Cross from a Southern California veterans memorial on Thursday was the latest skirmish in the war against religion and faith, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said not even Congress can protect landmark symbols from “angry atheists armed with attorneys.”

“This is just more reason why we need to stand up for our constitution and the religious liberty it protects,” Palin said.

Palin urged her followers on Friday to read a Breitbart News report on the decision, and said that the attacks on veterans’ memorials mean those “who made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedoms can’t even be honored with a symbol embodying one of those freedoms.”

In her blockbuster bestseller Good Tidings and Great Joy: Protecting the Heart of Christmas, Palin has said these attacks are the tip of the spear in a larger fight to fundamentally transform America. Palin noted that in “Good Tidings and Great Joy,” she “mentioned a lawsuit taken against a World War I veterans memorial cross in California’s Mojave Desert”:

In the 1930s, the Veterans of Foreign Wars put up a cross in the Mojave Desert– in an isolated area known as Sunrise Rock– to honor our brave soldiers who died in World War I. The modest cross, made out of eight-foot metal pipes painted white, sat on 1.6 acres of desert, 90 percent of which is federal land. Though it was ‘in the middle of nowhere,’ it meant such a great deal to many people. In 1983, when a World War I veteran lay on his deathbed, he asked his best friend, Henry Sandoz, to take care of the cross. And that’s exactly what Henry faithfully did every year after his friend’s death. Henry was in his seventies by the time Frank Buono, helped by the American Civil Liberties Union, filed a lawsuit claiming that this lovingly maintained old cross unconstitutionally promoted the Christian faith. As the case bounced from one court to another, the cross was enclosed with plywood, covered like an adult magazine in the back of a bookstore. Over the course of the court battle, which went all the way to the Supreme Court, it was even stolen. Finally, after eight long years of battling, the cross was able to remain on the land by transferring the property surrounding it to a private citizen.

Though the Mojave Desert cross was saved, the Mt. Soledad Veterans Memorial cross in San Diego was not, even though in 2004, Congress, as Palin noted, “passed a law protecting its right to exist as a national memorial to the brave men and women in uniform ‘who sacrificed their lives in the defense of the United States.'”

“But apparently even Congress can’t stop angry atheists armed with attorneys. As I’ve said repeatedly in interviews about ‘Good Tidings and Great Joy,’ the so-called ‘war on Christmas’ is just the tip-of-the-spear in the larger efforts to strip God from the public square and banish all expressions of faith from public life,” she wrote.

Palin has consistently stood up against the “PC police.” On Thursday, hours after Palin told Breitbart Sports that she was disappointed that ESPN had rejected a commercial from a Catholic hospital because the station found the words “God” and “Jesus” to be “problematic,” ESPN reversed course and accepted the original ad, which it will air on Saturday.

Palin also posted a statement from the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ) that said the decision was “deeply flawed” because the “federal court decision declaring the memorial unconstitutional and ordering its removal does not square with the facts” and the “memorial is part of the historic landscape of San Diego and is consistent with the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.”

The ACLJ has “promised to file an amicus brief in support of an expected appeal to keep the memorial – which includes a commemorative cross – in place.”

“We will continue to aggressively argue in support of this memorial and commemorative cross,” ACLJ President Jay Sekulow said. “We believe the law and precedent are clear: the Supreme Court has concluded in the past that ‘a Latin cross is not merely a reaffirmation of Christian beliefs.

A Labor Day Lament,"Been shopping for a new car lately, was a decade and 124,000 miles ago when I paid $17,000 including taxes for an '03 VW Golf TDI diesel. During that decade millions of workers lost their jobs and wages stagnated, and one would think new vehicle prices would have at least kept to the rate of inflation. Electronics have dropped in price while adding features, the housing market is a bargain hunter's paradise if you've got cash or good credit, and about the only thing that's gotten pricier is food, fuel, and vehicles.

Why?

Well, I'm still tick'd about all the unwanted gadgetry I was forced to buy with that 2003 Golf TDI- I can wind windows up and down myself quite well, thank you. And those ten or so speakers are kind of a waste in an upholstered tin can anyway. But I still was allowed to shift for myself and there were even knobs on the quite excellent radio. Good luck finding a manual transmission today, and the radios are hiding behind video game like displays... Should I really have to go through menus at 75 MPH just to switch from MPR to KBEM Jazz 88? Sure it's got bluetooth, but I don't mix driving and business. And at every dealership I find cars similarly packed and prices jacked with useless gadgets, pushing even a so-called economy car into the $20k and beyond price range.

Good thing I'm not replacing my 1998 Ranger, which Ford conveniently discontinued. In it's place Ford proffers $30k F150s that get worse mileage and don't haul enough more than the Ranger to matter. Maybe $25k for a 2 wheel drive if you can find a truck only dealer like Boyer in an aging industrial zone, and these ""he man"" trucks only come with automatics. Want to take an end run around this lunacy by buying a 30 MPG compact car and a trailer to haul your tools and stuff? Most of the automakers have banned trailer towing with their cars and will void the warranty if you try. Ain't much better if you need a big truck for work, what with GM leaving that market and Ford all but abandoning it, leaving you to try to bargain with International and Daimler. Need a really big truck? There's only four suppliers left, and there's little chance to shop for the engine and transmission of your choice everywhere... Your stuck with the truck manufacturer's engine or maybe Cummins.

So you decide to fix up your old vehicle and hang on to it awhile longer... ""Cept Volvo seems to be discontinuing parts for Mack trucks built as recently as 7 years ago, VW has no printed manuals anymore and charges $35 a day to view them online, and those manuals assume you have the manufacturers multi thousand dollar diagnostic system that works on nothing else to do diagnosis.

Now if we were all earning living wages and later enjoying our old age pensions this'd be no problem... We'd just buy a new vehicle every few years like we did to the tune of twenty million a year like we used to and pay the dealer to fix it. But wages for new hire union autoworkers have been beaten down into the $14-15 an hour range, and at the nonunion plants in the south starting pay is only $11-12 an hour and don't expect any raises. And it's all downhill from there, with wages at supplier plants often less than $10 an hour, while many construction workers who used to buy a profitable new pickup every year are still unemployed.

So the math is pretty simple: low wage workers simply can't spare a year's wages to buy a new car, bein' as they gotta pay rent and buy food and such too. Yet the deluded automakers dream of twenty million vehicles a year sales, which given that there are over 200 million licensed drivers in the U.S. would only require said drivers to buy a new one every decade or so. But all but the top earning 20% of those drivers are paid too little to afford new cars, and the lowest paid 20% or so are leaving the auto market entirely for transit and bicycles.

Henry Ford, Soichiro Honda, Alec Issigonis, Hans Ledwinka and Nikola Tesla have left the industry. Heck, they probably couldn't even get into an MBA program these days and wouldn't last a day on the assembly line, probably get fired for unauthorized improving of the product. So we're left with lumbering and blundering corporations, led by MBA ""whiz kids"" who couldn't balance a family budget... Never mind figure out why the workers they underpay aren't buying their overpriced products.

Maybe we need another ""sit down strike"" to save their sorry MBA asses... And ours!

USA TODAY

The Missouri State Fair has banned a rodeo clown who this past weekend donned a President Obama mask, and asked a crowd if they wanted to see ""Obama run down by a bull.""

Officials said the clown will never perform at the fair again, the Associated Press reported.

Organizers are also reviewing whether to take any actions against the contractor responsible for Saturday's rodeo.

There has been bipartisan criticism of the gag.

Missouri Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder, a Republican, tweeted that the clown act was ""disrespectful"" to Obama, and ""we are better than this.""

A spokesman for Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, said the governor ""agrees that the performance was disrespectful and offensive, and does not reflect the values of Missourians or the State Fair.""

State Fair officials called the performance ""inappropriate,"" and added in a statement: ""We strive to be a family friendly event and regret that Saturday's rodeo badly missed that mark.""

Also from the Associated Press:

""Perry Beam, who was among the spectators, said 'everybody screamed' and 'just went wild' as the announcer talked about having the bull run down the clown with the Obama mask.

""'It was at that point I began to feel a sense of fear. It was that level of enthusiasm,' Beam, a 48-year-old musician from Higginsville, said Sunday, referring to the reaction from the crowd that filled the fair's grandstand.

""He said another clown ran up to the one wearing the Obama mask, pretended to tickle him and played with the lips on the mask. About 15 minutes into the performance, the masked clown had to leave after a bull got too close, Beam said.""

Beam also said:

""It was the usual until the very end at bull riding. As they were bringing the bulls into the chute and prepping them. ... They bring out what looks like a dummy. The announcer says 'Here's our Obama dummy, or our dummy of Obama.' They mentioned the president's name, I don't know, 100 times. It was sickening. It was feeling like some kind of Klan rally you'd see on TV."""

They don’t even accept the logic of long-term electoral viability over extinction.

The most outlandish example of conservative rhetoric in its truly offensive glory on this subject came in an interview last week with Phyllis Schlafly, a prominent conservative activist, on the news site PolicyMic. In it she said:

“I don’t see any evidence that Hispanics resonate with Republican values. They have no experience or knowledge of the whole idea of limited government and keeping government out of our private lives. They come from a country where the government has to decide everything. I don’t know where you get the idea that the Mexicans coming in resonate with Republican values. They’re running an illegitimacy rate that is extremely high. I think it’s the highest of any ethnic group. We welcome people who want to be Americans. And then you hear many of them talk about wanting Mexico to reclaim several of our Southwestern states, because they think Mexico should really own some of those states. Well, that’s unacceptable. We don’t want people like that.”

There are so many stereotypes and fallacies in that statement that it’s not even worth unpacking, but it is a great illustration of some deep-rooted conservative views.

The one thing I will take the time to contest is the notion that even if Republicans changed their rhetoric and tactics, they wouldn’t gain traction with Hispanics (not all of whom are Mexican, by the way, Ms. Schlafly)."

“The political reality is … that the Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people up here.” – Senator Chuck Hagel, 2006

As a result of those words and his voting record, former Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel’s nomination has turned a decades-long, bipartisan confirmation process for secretary of defense into an acrimonious one.

While some leading figures such as the Anti-Defamation League’s Abe Foxman and the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s Rabbi Abraham Cooper say Hagel’s words are borderline anti-Semitism, I’m less worried about anti-Semitism and more worried about the judgment of a potential defense secretary who thinks Israel has won support because of “intimidation,” not merit.

Israel is widely supported by the American people because Israel deserves to be supported. Israel is a lonely democratic ally and a steady friend of the United States in a dangerous and tumultuous region. Their people are like the American people – free, independent, capitalistic and tolerant.

A Gallup poll taken last year showed 71% of the American people view Israel favorably while only 19% view the Palestinian Authority favorably and just 10% view Iran favorably.

In a Pew Research Center study last month, 50% of adults said they sympathize more with Israel in its dispute than with the Palestinians. Just 10% sympathize more with the Palestinians, while about as many (13%) volunteered that they sympathize with neither side.

Contrary to Hagel’s logic, Israel doesn’t enjoy widespread American support because anyone – from any faith – intimidated someone else; Israel earned the support of the American people because of its people’s values.

Opinion: Hagel is a friend to Israel

The danger in what Hagel said is if he thinks Israel is supported on Capitol Hill because of intimidation, then it’s not hard to see why Hagel is so soft in his support for our ally. He sees himself as an independent voice willing to stand up to intimidation, and he wears his anti-Israel votes as badges of honor.

But Hagel isn’t independent. He’s alone.

His position on Middle Eastern matters is so outside the mainstream of both parties that almost no one agrees with him.

In 2000, Hagel was one of only four senators who refused to sign a Senate letter in support of Israel.

Peter Beinart: What’s behind Hagel nomination fight

The following year Hagel was one of only 11 senators who refused to sign a letter urging President George W. Bush to continue his policy of not meeting with Yasser Arafat until the Palestinian leader took steps to end the violence against Israel.

John Cornyn: Why I can’t support Hagel

Contrary to America’s longstanding bipartisan position, Hagel has called for direct talks with terrorist organizations Hamas and Hezbollah. In 2007, Hagel voted against labeling the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, the group responsible for the death of many American servicemen in Iraq, a terrorist organization.

And in 2008, he was one of two senators on the banking committee to oppose a bill putting sanctions on Iran. One of the measure’s biggest backers was an Illinois senator named Barack Obama.

I’m a New Yorker and neither of my senators – Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand – supports Israel because someone muscled them into that position through intimidation. They both support Israel because the lobby that wants them to support Israel is an American lobby, made up of people from both parties and all religions and from people with no religion or political party at all.

But if Chuck Hagel believes that it’s intimidation and not sound judgment that has caused his colleagues to support Israel, then Chuck Hagel should not be confirmed as our next secretary of defense.

Norton confirmed in an interview that she pressed Obama to support the bill and that she doesn't care whether some colleagues felt uncomfortable about the exchange.

""I wasn’t picking a fight with the president, I think the people of the District would expect me to have a conversation with him rather than just asking a question,"" Norton said.

While most lawmakers might not interrupt Obama as he answered their question, Norton said she was compelled to interject when Obama suggested in his response to her that the budget crunch facing the District is similar to how other congressional districts are adjusting during the shutdown.

""That demanded that I give a response,"" she said. ""Obviously we’re the only District in the United States. We’re uniquely in this position.""

Norton insisted she meant no disrespect towards the president. ""He’s a big boy and I’m a big girl,"" she said.

When the meeting ended, Norton said ""I went up to him and we had a wonderful conversation, it was very collegial,. And I told him that I’m just trying to make sure that the District isn’t brought to its knees.""

Addressing a crowd at a gala event for the D.C. Vote nonprofit Wednesday night, Norton said: ""I had to take issue with the president today,""

She said she had to remind Obama that the District is seeking to spend local funds during the shutdown, not federal funds.

Rep. Jose Serrano (D-N.Y.), accepting an award at the event, described the scene at the White House: ""I thought you were going to hit him or something,"" he cracked after Norton introduced him.

The exchange with Obama came just hours after Norton and Washington Mayor Vincent C. Gray confronted Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) on the steps of the U.S. Capitol and pressed him to support the House bill.

“I’m on your side, don’t screw it up, okay? Don’t screw it up,” Reid told Gray.

Do the right thing, Harry.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) is giving Republican colleagues 36 hours to agree to a deal on filibuster reform or he will move forward with the nuclear option. “I hope in the next 24, 36 hours we can get something we agree on. If not, we’re going to move forward on what I think needs to be done,” Reid told reporters. Reid’s trump card in negotiations with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) is the threat he will change Senate rules with a simple majority vote, a tactic known as the nuclear option. This maneuver would allow Reid to change the Senate rules with a simple majority vote, something that has never been done, according to parliamentary experts.

Sen. Harry Reid needs to wrap up Senate rules reform, and also wants to achieve some kind of bipartisan agreement. You'd think by now he'd recognize that those two goals are utterly incompatible when it comes to trying to accomplish something significant. Perhaps he does, so perhaps that's why he's issued an ultimatum : come to an agreement within 36 hours or Democrats will do it on their own., by the way, is wrong. The nuclear option was what Republicans were talking about doing during the Bush Administration to block Democrats' filibuster of judicial nominees. It would have entailed Vice President Cheney, acting as presiding officer, declaring the filibuster of nominees unconstitutional. That's pretty nuclear, particularly considering it would have happened mid-Congress. The constitutional option, on the other hand, is what we're talking about here: the establishment of rules at the beginning of a Congress. Itbeen used numerous times since the cloture rule was established in 1917. In fact, Sen. Robert Byrd used it four times as majority leader to enact filibuster reform.needs to find new parliamentary experts. Daily Kos recommends they talk to this guy

If Reid's going to threaten to do this with 51 votes, and follow through on it, then he needs to make it count. That's by including either a talking filibuster or a strong proposal to force the minority to produce 41 actual votes whenever they want to obstruct a bill or nomination.

We've got 36 hours to send him that message.

Please send an email to your Democratic senator/s urging them to pass real filibuster reform including the talking filibuster and/or flipping the burden.

If you don't have a Democratic senator, call Reid's office at 202-224-3542, and tell him to include the talking filibuster and/or flipping the burden of the filibuster.

Here's a critical piece of information:



[Reid] specified that he has the 51 votes he needs to proceed on a Democratic plan, indicating he's willing to pursue the ""constitutional option"" of changing the rules without the usual two-thirds vote.

He's got the votes to make this happen. The only way real reform happens is if he gives up on the fantasy of a gentlemen's agreement with McConnell, and uses the 51 votes to enact real reforms that can make the Senate function again."

USA TODAY

The Department of Transportation has fined Southwest Airlines $200,000 for violating the agency's fare advertising rules. The agency says Southwest did not extend advertised fares to enough seats during two recent sales.

""Consumers should be able to trust that the price they see advertised is the price they'll pay for a seat,"" Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx says in a statement. ""DOT will continue to take enforcement action against carriers and ticket agents when our price advertising rules are violated.""

The DOT says one Southwest violation came during a Valentine's Day ""Luv a Fare Sale"" promotion in which the carrier advertised one-way, nonstop fares ""for $100 or less."" However, the DOT asserts that Southwest ""failed to include a reasonable number of seats available in a significant number of city-pair markets in the fare sale.""

The DOT says fares offered in sale were offered only on 1%-2% of the available seats on some routes, according to the Los Angeles Times.

For Southwest's part, The Dallas Morning News says the airline, in its formal response to the DOT, notes its Feb. 14 sale fares were available in about 80% of the markets it served at the time and that the sale fares sold out in fewer than 10% of the available city pairings.

The DOT also cited a Jan. 30 incident in which the DOT says no seats were available for an advertised fare of $66 each way. The advertised price for flights between Dallas Love Field and Branson, Mo., was made through Southwest's DING! app for special fares.

""These were temporary and unintentional circumstances that were aggravated by a technical glitch in our inventory and sales systems,"" Southwest spokesman Brad Hawkins is quoted as saying by the News-Leader of Springfield, Mo. ""We've worked with the DOT to address their concerns and have corrected the issues internally to prevent this from happening again.""

""By advertising fares for which a reasonable number of seats were not available and advertising fares that were not available at all, Southwest violated the full fare advertising rule and engaged in prohibited unfair and deceptive practices,"" the DOT says in its statement.

The Southwest fine comes as the DOT has become increasingly aggressive in enforcing its consumer protection rules.

Among other recent DOT fines:

A $375,000 fine against Delta in June for bumping violations.

A $130,000 fine against United for a tarmac delay violation.

A $200,000 fine against American affiliate American Eagle for tarmac delay violations.

As for the latest fine against Southwest, the Chicago Tribune says it ""is fairly significant compared with similar violations of price advertising. Chicago-based Orbitz was fined $60,000 in 2011 under the same rule."""

IRS targeted Tea Party groups for extra scrutiny of their tax-exempt applications

The Justice Department has begun a criminal investigation

Treasury Secretary Jack Lew requested and received Steven Miller%27s resignation on Wednesday

WASHINGTON — President Obama said on Wednesday that he's accepted the resignation of acting IRS commissioner Steven Miller in the aftermath of revelations that agency officials were putting extra scrutiny on Tea Party groups' applications for tax-exempt status.

In brief comments Wednesday evening after discussing the Internal Revenue Service controversy with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and Deputy Secretary Neal Wolin, Obama vowed to take decisive action to ensure that the situation would not be repeated.

Obama called the misconduct by IRS officials ""inexcusable.""

""It's inexcusable and Americans are right to be angry about it and I am angry about it,"" Obama said. ""I will not tolerate this kind of behavior in any agency, but particularly the IRS given the power that it has and the reach that it has in all of our lives.""

Obama said that Lew requested and accepted Miller's resignation earlier on Wednesday.

""Given the controversy surrounding this audit, it's important to institute new leadership that can help restore confidence going forward,"" Obama said.

Obama said his administration would work ""hand-in-hand"" with Congress as it performs its oversight role.

In an op-ed in USA TODAY earlier this week, Miller said the agency recognized its missteps.

""Mistakes were made, but they were in no way due to any political or partisan motivation,"" Miller wrote. ""We are — and will continue to be — dedicated to reviewing all applications for tax-exempt status in an impartial manner.""

In a three-sentence letter to Miller calling for his resignation, Lew said it was imperative to restore public trust and confidence in the IRS.

""While I very much appreciate your years of loyal service at the IRS, I find it necessary at this time to request your resignation,"" Lew wrote. ""We will work with you to make that we accomplish an orderly transition.""

In a message to IRS staff on Wednesday announcing his exit, Miller said he would depart the agency in early June.

""It is with regret that I will be departing from the IRS as my acting assignment ends in early June. This has been an incredibly difficult time for the IRS given the events of the past few days, and there is a strong and immediate need to restore public trust in the nation's tax agency,"" Miller wrote. ""I believe the Service will benefit from having a new Acting Commissioner in place during this challenging period.""

The White House has come under fire since the IRS acknowledged last week that it had improperly put holds on Tea Party groups' applications.The criticism from top GOP officials continued on Wednesday after Obama announced Miller's ouster and promised cooperation with Congress on investigating the matter.

""If the President is as concerned about this issue as he claims, he'll work openly and transparently with Congress to get to the bottom of the scandal—no stonewalling, no half-answers, no withholding of witnesses,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. ""These allegations are serious — that there was an effort to bring the power of the federal government to bear on those the administration disagreed with, in the middle of a heated national election. We are determined to get answers, and to ensure that this type of intimidation never happens again at the IRS or any other agency.""

Attorney General Eric Holder told a congressional committee on Wednesday that the criminal inquiry would be a national investigation, and not limited to the Cincinnati office where the Tea Party targeting originated.

Holder said potential violations of law could include criminal civil rights laws and the Hatch Act, which prohibits partisan political activity by federal civil servants.

But the attorney general also noted that the IRS has a responsibility to scrutinize applicants for tax-exempt status to ensure they're following the law. ""I think some inquiry into that area is appropriate, but it has to be done in a way that does not depend on the political persuasion of the group,"" Holder said.

An inspector general's report on the agency's action published Tuesday blamed ineffective Internal Revenue Service management for the failure to stop employees from singling out conservative groups for extra scrutiny.

""I will do everything in my power to make sure nothing like this happens again, "" Obama said."

Resignation, coming less than two years after his confirmation, could signal a coming shakeup of the national security team.

President Obama will nominate the former GOP senator to be secretary of defense.

President Obama will nominate the former GOP senator to be secretary of defense.

President Obama plans to nominate former senator Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican and Vietnam War veteran, to be secretary of defense, according to a person close to the process and a senior administration official.

The White House informed the Hagel camp over the weekend that Obama intends to announce the nomination Monday. The administration said early Monday that the president also would nominate counterterrorism adviser John Brennan as the new director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

Hagel’s successful nomination would add a well-known Republican to the president’s second-term Cabinet at a time when he is looking to better bridge the partisan divide, particularly after a bitter election campaign.

But the expected nomination has drawn sharp criticism in recent weeks, particularly from Republicans, who have questioned Hagel’s commitment to Israel’s security.

The choice sets up a confirmation fight of the sort that Obama appeared unwilling to have over Susan E. Rice, his preferred pick for secretary of state. Rice pulled out of consideration for that job last month after facing sharp Republican criticism about her characterization of the September attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.

In an appearance Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) called Hagel’s selection an “in-your-face nomination.”

But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Hagel’s record would be given a fair shake in the Senate if he is nominated. McConnell stopped short of saying whether he would support his former colleague.

“He’s certainly been outspoken in foreign policy and defense over the years,” McConnell said on ABC’s “This Week.” He added: “The question we’ll be answering, if he’s the nominee, is: Do his views make sense for that particular job? I think he ought to be given a fair hearing, like any other nominee. And he will be.”

The Hagel nomination will begin what White House officials have said will probably be a busy week of announcements about who will fill Obama’s second-term Cabinet and senior staff positions.

The president returned Sunday from a curtailed holiday in Hawaii and will begin making final personnel decisions that were delayed by the year-end negotiations with Congress over taxes and spending cuts.

Foreign policy tussle

Despite the opposition to a Hagel nomination that has arisen on Capitol Hill, a senior administration official said Sunday that the White House expects him to receive the support of Democrats, as well as many Republicans who served with him.

“Having a name floated and having one officially put forward are two different things,” the official said.

Hagel, who was twice awarded the Purple Heart for wounds suffered in Vietnam, served in the Senate for two terms, ending in 2009.

He was an outspoken and often independent voice as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, breaking with many in his party to sharply criticize the management of the Iraq war after he initially supported the U.S.-led invasion.

“A lot of Republican opposition is rooted in the fact that he left his party on Iraq,” the senior administration official said. “And we think it will be very hard for Republicans to stand up and be able to say that they oppose someone who was against a war that most Americans think was a horrible idea.”

Hagel also has been a strong advocate for veterans, an issue that Obama has spoken about frequently as tens of thousands of U.S. troops return from battlefields after more than a decade of war. The administration official said Hagel, as a result, is “uniquely qualified” to help wind down the war in Afghanistan by the end of 2014 and make budget decisions to support the returning troops.

Some of the recent criticism directed at Hagel has focused on his mixed record over the imposition of sanctions on Iran. As a senator, Hagel opposed several bills to impose unilateral sanctions on Iran. But he also supported measures to put in place sanctions as part of multinational efforts, and he endorsed labeling Iran a state sponsor of terrorism.

Hagel’s record has raised concern among some of Israel’s supporters in the United States, who fear that he may not be sufficiently committed to that country’s security.

But his defenders point to his record as a senior senator on the Foreign Relations Committee, where he voted for nearly $40 billion in military aid to Israel over his tenure.

Obama, who worked with Hagel on nuclear nonproliferation issues and other foreign policy matters in the Senate, has vowed to prevent Iran from using its uranium-enrichment program to develop a nuclear weapon.

Obama has worked to tighten both U.S. and international sanctions to pressure Iran into giving up the effort, moves that Hagel has supported in recent interviews. The Iranian government has said that it is pursuing nuclear power, not weapons.

A network of supporters

Since leaving office, Hagel has served as co-chairman of Obama’s intelligence advisory board. Hagel has advised the president to open talks with Hamas, the armed Palestinian movement that does not recognize Israel’s right to exist. He also has complained about the influence that Israel’s supporters exert on members of Congress, telling writer Aaron David Miller in an interview for his 2008 book that “the Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people up here.”

“If Hagel is nominated, it is very difficult to imagine a circumstance in which I could support his nomination,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) said on “Fox News Sunday.”

But Hagel has many supporters, including former ambassadors, senators and secretaries of state who value his experience and independence.

A network of supporters has rallied in recent weeks to defend Hagel’s record as the criticism has grown. The supporters also said privately that they expect him to receive strong public backing from many Republicans and Democrats alike once the nomination is official.

Writing last week in the Wall Street Journal, Ryan C. Crocker, a former ambassador to Iraq and Afghanistan, called Hagel “a statesman,” adding that “America has few of them.”

Hagel, 66, would be taking over the Pentagon at a time of budget cuts and a changing mission after two long wars. Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta is retiring to his home in California. Hagel would become Obama’s third defense secretary; Robert M. Gates, a member of the George W. Bush administration, was retained in the post until 2011.

If confirmed, Hagel would be the second Republican in Obama’s Cabinet, after Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood.

He says perhaps conservatives saw the light; if so, let's see them walk the walk Begala: Liberals extoll hard work; conservatives honor wealth, punish work

Editor’s Note: Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House.

(CNN) —

It’s not often that I agree with Sarah Palin. But when she comes around to a liberal point of view on an issue, that is to be noted with praise. So, good for you, Sarah, for flip-flopping on the issue of hard work.

Palin took to Facebook recently to praise the remarks of liberal actor Ashton Kutcher, who has in the past donated tens of thousands of dollars to Democrats and participated in a star-studded video pledging, “to serve our President (Obama) and all mankind.”

So how did this Hollywood liberal become the darling of Sarah Palin? By speaking out on behalf of a truly liberal value: hard work.

CNN Paul Begala

“I believe that opportunity looks a lot like hard work,” Kutcher said in a speech he gave at the Teen Choice Awards. “I’ve never had a job in my life that I was better than. I was always just lucky to have a job. And every job I had was a steppingstone to my next job, and I never quit my job until I had my next job.”

Palin and other conservatives lept to embrace Kutcher’s comments, as though they were conservative. They are, of course, profoundly liberal.

It is liberals who honor, extoll and reward hard work. That’s why President Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid and virtually all Democrats support raising the minimum wage – to honor and reward those who choose work over welfare, and ensure an honest day’s work pays enough to feed a family. That’s why President Obama and the Democrats cut taxes on working people by $3,600 over four years. And that’s why President Obama won the votes of working-class Americans (those making less than $100,000 a year) by a full 10 points.

But perhaps Palin and others on the right have seen the light. Perhaps Kutcher’s bracing and bold statement of liberalism has moved them. If so, let’s see them walk the walk. Because at the present moment Republicans seem to honor wealth and punish work.

How else can you explain that they want a tax code in which a billionaire heiress pays nothing on her inheritance, while the hard-working maid who makes the heiress’ bed pays taxes on every nickel she earns?

Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney pocketed $42 million during 2011 and 2012. He did not earn that money from work – he accrued it through wealth. His investments garnered him tens of millions while he ran around the country campaigning. And yet Romney paid merely 12% in taxes. By contrast, a cop married to a teacher, each making the median income of around $50,000 a year, pays a marginal tax rate of 25%. Even with deductions they are almost certainly paying a greater percentage of their income in taxes than mega-millionaire Romney.

Palin, who famously quit on the people of Alaska when she got too big for the gig of governing her beautiful state, is an especially unfortunate spokesperson for the value of hard work. One hopes she takes Kutcher’s liberal advice to heart, and supports working people in word and deed.

And if Palin liked Kutcher’s Teen Choice remarks, she’ll love this statement: “Success may not come quickly or easily. But if you strive to do what’s right, if you work harder and dream bigger, if you set an example in your own lives and do your part to help meet the challenges of our time, then I’m confident that, together, we will continue the never-ending task of perfecting our union.”

Those are not the words of Ashton Kutcher. No, the liberal extolling hard work and patriotism in those comments was Palin’s president – and mine and Ashton Kutcher’s and every American’s president: Barack Obama.

The White House will argue that its solution for illegal immigrants is not an amnesty, as many critics insist, because it would include fines, the payment of back taxes and other hurdles for illegal immigrants who would obtain legal status, the officials said.

The president’s plan would also impose nationwide verification of legal status for all newly hired workers; add visas to relieve backlogs and allow highly skilled immigrants to stay; and create some form of guest-worker program to bring in low-wage immigrants in the future.

A bipartisan group of senators has also been meeting to write a comprehensive bill, with the goal of introducing legislation as early as March and holding a vote in the Senate before August. As a sign of the keen interest in starting action on immigration, White House officials and Democratic leaders in the Senate have been negotiating over which of them will first introduce a bill, Senate aides said.

“This is so important now to both parties that neither the fiscal cliff nor guns will get in the way,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, a Democrat who is a leader of the bipartisan discussions."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, speaks at a news conference at the House Triangle on an energy tax reform initiative and the unveiling of the Energy Freedom and Economic Prosperity Act. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)

Rep. Raúl Labrador (R-Idaho) told Univision this week that immigration reform is growing increasingly less likely to pass this year -- or next -- as Congress turns its focus to Syria, the debt ceiling and other issues.

""I think that if we don’t do it now, in 2013, it’s not going to be -- it’s not going to happen in 2014,"" he told ""Al Punto"" host Jorge Ramos, according to a transcript of an interview that will air on Sunday. ""And that means that we’re going to have to wait until 2015. So now, that time is -- it’s becoming a lot shorter. We don't know exactly when we’re going to be able to have this debate.""

""A lot of us thought that the debate was going to be in October, but now, with the problems that we’re having internationally and also here in this country, I don’t see how we’re going to be able to have this debate until -- until November,"" he continued. ""And I really don’t know if it will be possible to do it in November.""

Labrador was considered by many to be a potential leader on immigration reform, and even though he is not in leadership, advocates were hopeful he would push to bring Republicans on board. He said he is still working on a bill that would address legal immigration.

But Labrador dropped out of a bipartisan group working on legislation and does not support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, a criterion Democrats say is absolutely necessary to win their votes. He would support undocumented immigrants gaining legal status, but not a new way for them to move beyond it, he said -- a policy that would prevent many from becoming citizens because of narrow application windows under current law.

The congressman said that if the House voted on legalization for undocumented immigrants within the next month, he doesn't think there would be enough support for the reform to pass.

""Immigration reform is something about which we have to have a good debate,"" he said. ""We have to convince people that it’s a good thing. ... So I think it’s a debate that we have to have, and at this time I don’t think the votes are there in the House of Representatives."""

Story highlights NEW: Senate approves Nina Pillard 51-44 to serve on federal appeals court in Washington Republicans are angry over rules change that weakens their hand in opposing nominations The new rules imposed by majority Democrats aim to speed up confirmation Overnight session forced by GOP is one way to express frustration and slow the process

(CNN) —

Frustrated Republicans are retaliating for a Democratic play to weaken their hand in opposing presidential nominations, forcing an all-night session into Thursday’s early hours.

Votes on judicial and other appointments took place early Thursday morning, part of the fallout after the Democratic majority enforced a rule change to expedite consideration of appointments, the so-called nuclear option.

Until last month, longstanding Senate rules required a supermajority of 60 votes to break a filibuster over a presidential nominee. Republicans fiercely opposed the change, which now allows the majority Democrats to break filibusters with 51 votes.

Democrats, who hold a 55-45 advantage in the Senate, said Republicans had abused the filibuster privilege around President Barack Obama’s nominations, and the only way for him to staff his second-term administration promptly and move stalled judicial appointments was to speed things up through a rules change.

“The Obama administration and its allies have done just about everything to get what they want, one way or the other – even fundamentally altering the contours of our democracy when they couldn’t get their way playing by the rules,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in floor remarks Wednesday. “We saw the culmination of that with the majority leader’s power grab in the Senate last month.”

5 ways life changes in the Senate after nuclear option

Republicans are requiring the marathon session if Democrats want to clear a long list of nominees before leaving for vacation next week.

GOP escalation of the rules fight renewed attention to sharp partisan wrangling one day after lawmakers trumpeted a compromise House-Senate budget proposal brokered across party lines.

The first vote in the extended session came shortly after 1 a.m. ET as the Senate approved 51-44 Nina Pillard’s nomination on the federal appeals court in Washington. For some, the appointment has been a steppingstone to the Supreme Court.

The Senate will continue plowing through the backlog of nominees later Thursday. Senators will vote on the confirmation of Chai Rachel Feldblum to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

Senate Democrats began enforcing the “nuclear option” this week, stoking Republican ire.

All-nighters could continue for days. Democratic leaders said they were prepared to stay in session virtually around the clock through Saturday night to confirm a list of 10 nominees to a variety of senior posts.

They range from lesser-known appointments – such as Patricia Wald to the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board – to critical positions – such as Jeh Johnson to be homeland security secretary.

There are also several federal district court judge appointments on the list as well as nominees to Pentagon posts and the State Department.

Customarily, Senate leaders work together so the chamber can conduct its business during more regular hours. But because of strict parliamentary rules, it’s easy for just one senator to hold things up.

In this case, the whole GOP conference is upset.

What’s the nuclear option?

So why are they working overnights?

According to Senate rules, a certain number of hours of debate can still be demanded by any senator once a filibuster is broken.

Known as “post-cloture debate time” in Senate parlance, up to eight hours of debate time is allowed for nine of the 10 nominees on Majority Leader Harry Reid’s list. For Johnson, the homeland security nominee, debate can last for 30 hours.

Typically, Senate leaders would agree to allow that debate time to run with the Senate out of session. But Republicans are angry about the changes to the filibuster rules and are requiring the Senate to stay in session.

Reid accused Republicans of obstructionism.

“It is hard to imagine a more pointless exercise than spending an entire day waiting for a vote whose outcome we already know,” Reid said about the Pillard nomination. “But Republicans insist on wasting time simply for the sake of wasting time. It’s no wonder Americans overwhelmingly support the changes Democrats made to the rules last month in order to make the Senate work again.”"

Rick Perry, who has said he hopes to make abortion “a thing of the past,” signed the legislation in July. It had been temporarily derailed when Wendy Davis, a Democratic state senator, mounted an 11-hour filibuster in the Republican-controlled Legislature. Ms. Davis is now running for governor, with abortion rights as one of her planks.

Texas officials quickly said they would appeal the decision to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, and Judge Yeakel said that “at the end of the day, these issues are going to be decided definitively not by this court, but by either the Circuit or the Supreme Court of the United States.”

Courts in Alabama, Mississippi, North Dakota and Wisconsin have blocked similar admitting-privilege requirements as part of the continuing battles over how much states may restrict the right to abortion granted by Roe v. Wade in 1973.

Monday’s ruling was hailed by the chief executive of Whole Woman’s Health, a private group that had warned that it could be forced to close its clinics in McAllen, Fort Worth and San Antonio because those clinics use visiting doctors who cannot obtain admitting privileges locally. “We are very relieved,” said the chief, Amy Hagstrom Miller.

In bringing the suit against two parts of the sweeping anti-abortion law adopted in July, abortion rights groups said that the provisions would have “dramatic and draconian” effects on women’s access to the procedure. But lawyers for the state argued that these predictions were exaggerated and that the measures served the state’s interest in “protecting fetal life.”"
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/08/gop-wall-street-bill_n_3542999.html,2013-07-08 00:00:00,['Senior Reporter'],GOP Wall Street Bill Would Eviscerate Dodd-Frank,"WASHINGTON -- The House Appropriations Committee approved an agriculture budgeting bill last month that would significantly restructure the U.S. bank regulatory regime as part of a GOP effort to protect Wall Street's offshore trading in derivatives -- the complex financial products at the heart of the 2008 economic meltdown.

Republicans in Congress have been pressuring regulators for years to exempt derivatives that U.S. companies sell overseas from the new rules set by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. For much of 2013, the deregulatory drive enjoyed bipartisan support in the House, with lawmakers casting their efforts as an attempt to harmonize U.S. law with international regulations. But financial reform advocates have attacked the initiative for padding Wall Street profits at the expense of important public protections, and Democratic support has eroded.

In June, the House passed a bill that would completely exempt from U.S. oversight derivatives sold through the nine most popular foreign derivatives jurisdictions. The legislation is occasionally derided as the ""London Whale Loophole Act"" on Capitol Hill -- a reference to the overseas trades that cost JPMorgan Chase more than $6 billion in 2012. London was the epicenter of much of the derivatives trading by U.S. financial firms leading up the 2008 crash, including AIG's infamous Financial Products division. If banks can simply route trades through loosely regulated overseas affiliates, financial reform advocates warn, the most critical aspects of Dodd-Frank will be effectively nullified.

The ""London Whale Loophole Act"" faces opposition from Senate Democrats and President Barack Obama, so it's unlikely to be signed into law. But June's House Agriculture Committee funding bill has much stronger prospects for passage, since it's tied to approximately $19 billion in other spending. That bill would require the Commodities Futures Trading Commission -- the agency with responsibility for more than 90 percent of the derivatives market -- to negotiate its regulations with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees the remainder of the derivatives business.

Big banks have railed against the CFTC guidelines for taking a broad view of what constitutes an American firm. The SEC's proposed rule, by contrast, would bar American regulators from overseeing many offshore partnerships run by U.S. firms, and many trades between U.S. firms and overseas companies. Forcing the CFTC to negotiate with the SEC would almost certainly introduce loopholes into the CFTC's rules, and may shut down the rulemaking process altogether.



""The House bill is nothing more than a backdoor way of killing derivatives reform,"" said Dennis Kelleher, president and CEO of the financial reform advocacy group Better Markets. ""It's Christmas in July for Wall Street.""



Prior to Dodd-Frank, derivatives trades were essentially secret deals between two companies, with no market or regulatory scrutiny. The 2010 law required companies to trade through a third party that guaranteed each side’s ability to make good on its bets. To buttress the guarantee, each side of the trade was required to post margin -– a small upfront deposit just in case the trade went bad. An offshoring loophole would allow firms to evade these requirements, provided they meet the technical definitions of the loophole.



While Wall Street has pursued multiple avenues to derail the CFTC’s rule, some Senate Democrats cautioned that even the more aggressive regulatory interpretation may ultimately undermine the essence of Dodd-Frank.



Eight Democratic senators, organized by Sens. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Carl Levin (D-Mich.), on Wednesday signed a letter to CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler and SEC Chairman Mary Jo White stating that both the CFTC and the SEC have failed to deal with shadowy financial entities “sponsored” by U.S. banks without any explicit legal guarantee for their obligations.



This type of arrangement was common in the years leading up to the 2008 crash. Citigroup held nearly $50 billion in complex derivatives off its official balance sheet in so-called structured investment vehicles, and Bear Stearns operated risky hedge funds that it officially had no financial obligations to. The financial crisis began in August 2007 when two such Bear Stearns funds failed, and the company decided to pay off its investors rather than take the damage to its reputation from leaving clients out to dry. By the fall of 2008, Citi had decided to suck up its losses on structured investment vehicles, rather than signal to the market it was incapable of doing so.

""A U.S.-based firm should not be able to escape U.S.-mandated swaps oversight simply because its swaps trading is conducted through an offshore affiliate or branch,"" the letter from the Democratic senators reads. ""It is likely that, if your agencies’ current proposals were adopted, foreign firms doing business with the foreign affiliate of a U.S.-based derivatives dealer would opt to forego an explicit guarantee from the U.S.-based entity in return for: (1) more favorable pricing, and (2) the ability to avoid U.S. trading regulations and any attendant costs.""

Both the CFTC and SEC standards would allow an offshore fund organized by a U.S. bank that formally rejected any responsibility for the fund’s solvency to evade American oversight. Reform watchdogs said they worry that U.S. firms will simply route much of their derivatives business through these nebulous entities, leaving the financial system to operate much as it did in the years before the crash.

""Feminists say no fault divorce was a large hurdle on the path to female liberation,"" Cotton wrote. ""They apparently don't consult the deepest hopes or greatest fears of young women.""

Cotton, who is unmarried, wrote that he surveyed several women -- whom he referred to as ""Cliffies,"" or female students at Radcliffe -- and they all told him the same thing: that their ""greatest fear"" in life was to be left by their husbands, and their ""deepest hope"" was to be ""a good wife and mother."" To that end, he says, feminists should stop trying to make it easier to get divorced.

""If men have easy access to divorce, many will choose it thoughtlessly,"" he wrote. ""They may not gain true happiness with their new trophy wives, but they certainly will not slide into the material indigence and emotional misery that awaits most divorced women.""

Cotton tried to make the case for ""covenant marriages,"" in which people can only divorce in cases where there's fault, ""defined as abandonment, physical abuse, adultery or conviction of a capital crime.""

The National Organization for Women denounced covenant marriage in 1997 when Louisiana became the first state to create it as a legal category, arguing that it was intended to trap women in bad marriages and re-establish patriarchy. But Cotton wrote that women should support the policy in order to restrain men from leaving, so that they will stay and ""fulfill women's deepest hopes.""

""[Men] can learn that personal happiness comes from the desire to devote and sacrifice oneself to one's beloved,"" he wrote. ""A few men can see this by themselves, and women are quite lucky to hook them. Ordinary women must not only defend these men against feminism, but also demand that all other men accept the lifelong nature of marriage. If not, one-half of all women who marry see their ‘greatest fear’ come true.""

Laws allowing no-fault divorce across the country were considered a victory for women's rights in the 1970s. A 2003 Stanford Business School study found states that passed no-fault divorce laws saw a 20 percent reduction in female suicide after 20 years and a 33 percent reduction in domestic violence and murder against women.

Cotton's campaign did not immediately comment on whether the congressman stands by the article, but Cotton remains a staunch social conservative. He opposes abortion rights, equal pay for women, marriage equality and women in combat, and he voted against every version of the Violence Against Women Act that has come up since he took office.

Cotton is challenging Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.), the lone Democratic senator in an increasingly Republican state. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) began personally fundraising for Pryor this week, writing in an email to supporters that Cotton is ""recklessly anti-woman.""

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/30/opinion/krugman-fiscal-fever-breaks.html,2013-12-30 00:00:00,['Paul Krugman'],Fiscal Fever Breaks - The New York Times,"In 2012 President Obama, ever hopeful that reason would prevail, predicted that his re-election would finally break the G.O.P.’s “fever.” It didn’t.

But the intransigence of the right wasn’t the only disease troubling America’s body politic in 2012. We were also suffering from fiscal fever: the insistence by virtually the entire political and media establishment that budget deficits were our most important and urgent economic problem, even though the federal government could borrow at incredibly low interest rates. Instead of talking about mass unemployment and soaring inequality, Washington was almost exclusively focused on the alleged need to slash spending (which would worsen the jobs crisis) and hack away at the social safety net (which would worsen inequality).

So the good news is that this fever, unlike the fever of the Tea Party, has finally broken.

True, the fiscal scolds are still out there, and still getting worshipful treatment from some news organizations. As the Columbia Journalism Review recently noted, many reporters retain the habit of “treating deficit-cutting as a non-ideological objective while portraying other points of view as partisan or political.” But the scolds are no longer able to define the bounds of respectable opinion. For example, when the usual suspects recently piled on Senator Elizabeth Warren over her call for an expansion of Social Security, they clearly ended up enhancing her stature.

What changed? I’d suggest that at least four things happened to discredit deficit-cutting ideology.

First, the political premise behind “centrism” — that moderate Republicans would be willing to meet Democrats halfway in a Grand Bargain combining tax hikes and spending cuts — became untenable. There are no moderate Republicans. To the extent that there are debates between the Tea Party and non-Tea Party wings of the G.O.P., they’re about political strategy, not policy substance."

Penalties increase with subsequent violations. As is usually the case with this type of law, enforcement will be key."

Lowry makes the indisputable point that the same media that have spent years attacking the Tea Party, and months savaging the NRA, are now revealing brazen hypocrisy when it comes to protecting their own rights. In spirit and goal, the media are now one with the Tea Party and NRA.

What animates the Tea Party and NRA is a legitimate concern that the government — especially under President Obama — has made a disturbing pivot from their Constitutional requirement to protect our liberties, to infringing upon our liberties. In turn, Obama and his media label us as anti-government crazies suffering from paranoid delusions.

But look at the reaction this week from that very same media in the wake of the Associated Press scandal. Suddenly the media don’t like Big Government doing to them what ObamaCare and background checks will do to the rest of us. Moreover, the very same media that suggest not trusting the government is a form of extremism, is now demanding a law be immediately passed to shield them from government intrusion.

The media don’t trust the government anymore than we do. Who is the paranoid crazy now?

Lowry:

At his briefing, Carney hung to the word “unfettered” like a drowning man. He said over and over again things like the president believes in an “unfettered ability to pursue investigative journalism” but that there should be “balance.” The implicit reaction in the room was: “Balance? Don’t give us any stinkin’ balance. Give us our rights.”

In this, the reporters exhibited a healthy impulse toward vigilance about liberty. The phrase “chilling effect” has been bandied about often. A chill comes not necessarily from what government is doing to you but from what it might do to you. Very few reporters will ever have their records secretly subpoenaed by the government, but it is intolerable to them that it could happen. On top of everything else, it is the principle of the thing — an infringement, or even a potential infringement, on the constitutional rights of even a handful of reporters is an affront to all.

There are lots of people who share this way of thinking about rights and government. Some of them gather every year at places like CPAC and the National Rifle Association annual convention.

We have just gone through a period when scorn was heaped on the NRA for opposing new gun rules out of the very same logic that compels reporters to react so strongly against the AP subpoena. The NRA will not abide an infringement on anyone’s legitimate right to bear arms, and it fears what could come of enhanced state power. Like the reporters, it casts a jaundiced eye on the reassurances of government. What they are to the First Amendment, it is to the Second.

Read it all.

At his Politico perch, Lowry is writing one of the best columns around. Keep an eye out for it.

The national battle over guns is headed to the states in a major way.

Already groups supporting more gun restrictions have been active on the local level. And now for the first time in almost two decades, the National Rifle Association is attempting to coordinate the recall of a top state legislator for having successfully passed further gun restrictions in his state, CNN has learned.

The focus of the NRA campaign is Colorado State Senate President John Morse. He is facing a petition drive to initiate an election to recall him because of legislation passed earlier this year requiring “universal” background checks on sales of all firearms in the state, as well as a ban on the sale of ammunition magazines greater than 15 rounds.

Morse told CNN he knew he was being targeted by local gun groups, but at the beginning did not know the NRA was after him.

""It was a grassroots effort for a little while, but when that didn't take at all, it was clear they were getting money from outside, and I wasn't the least bit surprised the NRA was behind it,"" said Morse.

The NRA declined an invitation to appear on ""The Lead.""



In a mailer obtained by CNN, the NRA Political Victory fund wrote to a “Second Amendment Supporter” in Colorado that “your NRA is coordinating a recall effort with the Basic Freedom Defense Fund to put Senator Morse on the ballot for a special election and vote him out of office.” (Emphasis theirs.)

You can see both sides of the mailer here and here.

Writes the NRA: “State Senator Morse led the charge to pass extreme and onerous anti-gun state legislation in Denver earlier this year. Responsible gun owners and sportsmen will be forever burdened by his misguided leadership in the Colorado Senate.”

""You have to remember that Colorado is ground zero for some of the worst gun tragedies that have occurred in our nation's history, with Columbine, and again Aurora,"" said Morse.

""We addressed [tighter gun regulations] this session, but this is what we get for that response,"" said Morse.

The NRA mailing sends recipients to the website of the Basic Freedom Defense Fund and urges them to find a local petition signing location where, it’s suggested, they go to sign the petition to hold a recall election. The petition drive has a June 3 deadline; 7,178 signatures are needed to mandate a recall election.

With efforts to enact further gun restrictions failing in the U.S. Senate, this latest move suggests that these fights are turning to the states.

Some political observers suggest that these local battles over gun laws could end up gaining the type of attention, fundraising and ferocity that marked the failed 2012 recall election of GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, with national groups such as the NRA squaring off against groups in favor of more gun regulations led by New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg and former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, just as corporate interests, such as the Koch brothers, squared off in Wisconsin against national labor unions.

Christy Le Lait, the campaign manager for Morse, tells CNN that the “NRA is investing in these recall races to send a message to every other local official to not pass any other gun safety measures or else the NRA will come after you as well.”

The NRA begged off public comment, deferring all interviews to local Colorado gun activists involved in the petition drive.

The NRA was involved in fending off the recall of Walker, though that was not a fight about gun laws. It also was involved in the successful recall of California Gov. Gray Davis, though that too was not a fight about guns.

In 1994, the NRA led an effort to recall Democratic California state senator David Roberti, who had pushed a law to ban some types of semiautomatic assault rifles in that state, though that effort was unsuccessful."

Can you imagine we’re even talking about this? It’s mind-numbing that within 24 hours, people want to start talking about 2016.

I read that Ann Romney did not take the loss well. Obviously, your campaign didn’t last as long, but was your family crushed?

They were down for a couple of days and a little angry for a while, but as they reflect on it, they loved every minute of it. Presidential campaigns result in one of two outcomes. It divides the family, sometimes irreparably or it makes you a whole lot closer. It made our family a whole lot closer.

All along, it was speculated that you would have been a formidable opponent for Obama, but you didn’t have a prayer in the primaries. Do you think the Republican primary system is broken?

People aren’t turning out for primaries because they work for a living, and those who do turn out are professional activists. Today, if you have somebody who ultimately gets through the obstacle course, they’re going to lack the one ingredient in such need today: authenticity.

Republicans couldn’t get over the fact that after you were appointed ambassador to China, you sent the president a thank-you note, referring to him as “a remarkable leader.”

I wrote the note, and I’d write it again."

Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for their “rendition” policy that allowed suspected terrorists to be detained overseas in foreign countries and interrogated at the direction of the US government. Hollywood even made a movie about it, so you know it was important.

Along with Guantanamo Bay, rendition was cited as an example of the un-constitutional Bush/Cheney dictatorship running rough-shod on the Geneva Conventions and basic human rights.

As a candidate, Barack Obama indicated that he would reverse the policy in an article in Foreign Affairs.

To build a better, freer world, we must first behave in ways that reflect the decency and aspirations of the American people… This means ending the practices of shipping away prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far-off countries, of detaining thousands without charge or trial, of maintaining a network of secret prisons to jail people beyond the reach of the law.

Two days into his presidency, Obama quietly continued the evil rendition policy, and it has continued ever since. Last week it was revealed that three new detainees were taken prisoner in the small African country of Djibouti and interrogated by American agents:

U.S. agents accused the men — two of them Swedes, the other a longtime resident of Britain — of supporting al-Shabab, an Islamist militia in Somalia that Washington considers a terrorist group. Two months after their arrest, the prisoners were secretly indicted by a federal grand jury in New York, then clandestinely taken into custody by the FBI and flown to the United States to face trial. The secret arrests and detentions came to light Dec. 21 when the suspects made a brief appearance in a Brooklyn courtroom.

Other than a small handful of news reports, the continuing rendition has received little or no attention and absolutely no condemnation from opinion writers who were hysterical over the Bush-era policies.

They could be criticizing Obama over his rendition policy, or they could be hammering him over his hypocrisy. They could be… if they were interested in truly speaking truth to power. But, President Obama is their guy, so rendition is just fine under his watch."

Under current law, the TSA is allowed to keep unclaimed checkpoint money and spend it on aviation security projects, but one congressional lawmaker is pushing a proposal that would redirect the loose change to members of the military.

Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., has introduced legislation that would require the TSA to transfer unclaimed money recovered from airport security checkpoints to nonprofit organizations that operate airport programs in support of the military.

""The TSA has been keeping the pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters from your change purse to pay for their bloated bureaucracy,"" Miller said in a statement. ""If TSA representatives get to play ""finders keepers"" with your hard-earned cash, what’s the incentive to try to get the loose change to its rightful owners?""

In 2012, more than $531,000 was collected at security checkpoints, up $44,000 from 2011, according to data released by Miller's office. In 2010, passengers left behind $433,000 at TSA checkpoints.

Miller's bill, which recently cleared the Homeland Security Committee, was recently evaluated by the Congressional Budget Office, which said the agency is expected to spend unclaimed money gradually over the next several years.

According to a Bloomberg Businessweek report, earlier CBO estimates of the bill said the proposal would cost $1 million to implement. “I was pretty aggravated that they said it was going to cost money to give money away,” Miller told the magazine.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/09/sexless-marriage_n_3869506.html,2013-09-09 00:00:00,[],Sexless Marriage: How To Deal With A Decrease In Sex,"By Laura Seldon for GalTime

Sex is one of those topics we’re all constantly thinking about, reading about, and even acting out… but not necessarily talking about. Sure, you’ll dish to your friends about the steamy sex session you had with your new man last night, but you won’t necessarily be so eager to share when your sex life goes from consistent to non-existent. And yet, several studies have been revealing for the last decade that a dry spell in the bedroom is actually common among couples. Is a lack of sex the one thing our conversations are lacking?

“It is very common for couples to go through sexual dry spells,” says Rabbi Ed Weinsberg, EdD. “It's estimated that this process begins for most couples anywhere from two to ten years after they get married.”

Defining a sexual dry spell, though, can be as difficult as dealing with the problem itself. One of my favorite scenes from the 1977 film ""Annie Hall"" features Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) and Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) talking to a therapist about their sex life. When the therapist asks how often they have sex, Alvy answers, “Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.” Annie, however, answers this way: “Constantly. I'd say three times a week.”

“The disparity is normal,” says Rabbi Weinsberg, author of two books on sexuality after illnesses, including ""Conquer Prostate Cancer: How Medicine, Faith, Love and Sex Can Renew Your Life."" “Going through a sexual dry spell is fairly subjective.” Just as we all have different likes and dislikes when it comes to sex, we all have a different take on how often we should be having sex as well. “There is no one ‘right’ amount of sex that a couple should be having,” says Jodi Lipper, co-author of ""How to Love Like a Hot Chick"". “For some married couples, normal is having sex every day. For others, it might be having sex once a month.”

Wondering if you and your partner are going through a sexual dry spell? Start by asking if both of your needs are being met. If your answer is no, then you may be facing a sexual drought. “It’s not enough when one or both partners is unsatisfied, or feels that his or her needs aren’t being met,” says Lipper. Her advice to couples in a sexless relationship? Talk it out with an open mind to determine the cause of the problem before you take drastic steps. In other words, share your sexual needs and wants before you demand that you and your partner either get it on, or get divorced!

“Sometimes a decrease in sexual activity in a relationship represents a manifestation of other problems,” explains Dr. Alexis Conason, a clinical psychologist in New York City. “It is important to understand why the couple has stopped, or decreased, having sex before we can diagnose a sexless period as problematic or not.” In other words, talking about your lack of sex could turn up a simple cause for what seems like a major problem. Before you give up on your sex life, Dr. Conason suggests asking yourself the following questions:

Have you stopped having sex because one partner is furious at the other?

Is one partner having an affair?

Are there medical issues that interfere with sexual functioning or desire?

Is one or both partners overwhelmed with childcare responsibilities?

Is one or both partners overwhelmed with career stress?

Was there ever a time when you were having more sex with your partner? Or has the relationship always been sexless?

Discussing these questions may seem like a daunting task, but it’s vital to the health of your relationship. “That hot and heavy sex that may have brought you together is not what is going to sustain the relationship,” explains Dr. Lisa Bahar, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Dana Point, Calif. “Now is the time to build intimacy on a deeper level, which requires awareness and a willingness to be curious about your partner in new ways that create spontaneous intimacy.” And spontaneous intimacy, my friends, is what leads to sexual intimacy… i.e. the opposite of a sexual dry spell!

The bottom line is that a lack of sex is an indicator of a greater problem. If you can’t remember the last time you had sex, make a list of all the obstacles holding you back from doing the deed –- like work stress, a lack of time, etc. –- and then work to find solutions to those obstacles, like trading massages with your partner to help relieve work stress, or planning a Saturday “staycation” in your bedroom to make time for an all-day shag. However, the most important step to finding your happy ending (pun intended) is to open up and talk to your partner about what’s really going on. You’ll hopefully go from “We need to talk” to “Less talk, more action!” in no time at all.

Anticipating that lawmakers will face resistance to the bill when they go home for the August recess, the letter marks the escalation of a campaign in which Republican leaders and donors are pressuring House Republicans to act on an immigration reform bill.

The letter begins: “We write to urge you to take action to fix our broken immigration system.” According to the New York Times, those who have signed include Rove; “former Vice President Dan Quayle; Tom Stemberg, a founder of Staples; and Frank VanderSloot, the founder of Melaleuca Inc.” Romney campaign finance director Spencer Zwick was also signed the letter.

The Times reports that Carlos Gutierrez, former Commerce Secretary for President George W. Bush and a founder of the Republicans for Immigration Reform super PAC, organized the effort. Gutierrez, who has said in the past that English should not be the official language of government, said the letter was “the beginning of a campaign to lobby Republican lawmakers in favor of a broad immigration bill as they return to their districts for the August break.”

“What tends to happen during the month of August is that members go home and they go to town hall meetings and they check up on their offices in terms of phone calls and letters, and that’s where they get bombarded,” Gutierrez told the Times. “So Republicans who are for immigration reform–and I believe there are many–we need to make our voice known in August.”

Updated 5:14 p.m. ET on 7/24



(CNN) – Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of former President John F. Kennedy and a prominent Democratic backer, was nominated by President Barack Obama Wednesday to serve as U.S. ambassador to Japan.

She would become the first woman to hold the post if she's confirmed by the U.S. Senate. A top supporter of Obama's, she served as the co-chair of his vice presidential search committee in 2008.



CNN first reported in April that Kennedy had been asked to serve as ambassador and was being vetted for the role.

She's the only surviving member of JFK's immediate family and has largely shunned the limelight and scrutiny associated with her famous last name. After publicly expressing interest in running for the U.S. Senate seat in New York vacated when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009, she ultimately decided against making a bid, citing ""personal reasons.""

She made speeches at the 2008 and 2012 Democratic National Conventions, both times recalling her famous relatives – in 2008, her speech served as a tribute to her uncle, Sen. Ted Kennedy, and in 2012 she noted that ""like my father's election in 1960, this is one of those elections where the future of our country is at stake.""

After receiving degrees at Harvard and Columbia, Kennedy served in a variety of roles at New York non-profits, including the John F. Kennedy Library and the American Ballet Theatre.

The current U.S. ambassador to Japan is John Roos, who assumed the role in 2009. He was the first American ambassador to attend commemoration ceremonies for the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He also led America's embassy through the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, and the ensuing nuclear aftermath.

The United States is Japan's largest economic partner as well as a military ally. The U.S. military presence on Japan's Okinawa Island has remained a point of diplomatic tension between the two nations. Some of the island's residents have complained about noise from the base, in an urban area. Many others were incensed by the misconduct of U.S. troops stationed there, including the 1995 rape of 12-year-old Japanese girl by three U.S. military personnel.

Opposition to the presence of U.S. troops in Okinawa runs so deep that it contributed to the resignation of former Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama in 2010. He had promised to move the base but later announced that the base would stay, a decision he called ""heartbreaking."""

I will not tolerate it.” (The Washington Post)

In a press conference Monday, President Obama addressed the Internal Revenue Service’s targeting of groups critical of government, and said, “I’ve got no patience with it. I will not tolerate it.” (The Washington Post)

Internal Revenue Service officials in Washington and at least two other offices were involved with investigating conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status, making clear that the effort reached well beyond the branch in Cincinnati that was initially blamed, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post.

IRS officials at the agency’s Washington headquarters sent queries to conservative groups asking about their donors and other aspects of their operations, while officials in the El Monte and Laguna Niguel offices in California sent similar questionnaires to tea-party-affiliated groups, the documents show.

IRS employees in Cincinnati told conservatives seeking the status of “social welfare” groups that a task force in Washington was overseeing their applications, according to interviews with the activists.

Lois G. Lerner, who oversees tax-exempt groups for the IRS, told reporters Friday that the “absolutely inappropriate” actions were undertaken by “front-line people” working in Cincinnati to target groups with “tea party,” “patriot” or “9/12” in their names.

In one instance, however, Ron Bell, an IRS employee, informed a lawyer representing a conservative group focused on voter fraud that the application was under review in Washington. On several other occasions, IRS officials in Washington and California sent conservative groups detailed questionnaires about their voter outreach and other activities, according to the documents.

View Graphic A report due this week says the IRS targeted groups with names containing “tea party” and “patriot.”

“For the IRS to say it was some low-level group in Cincinnati is simply false,” said Cleta Mitchell, a partner in the law firm Foley & Lardner who sought to communicate with IRS headquarters about the delay in granting tax-exempt status to True the Vote.

Moreover, details of the IRS’s efforts to target conservative groups reached the highest levels of the agency in May 2012, far earlier than has been disclosed, according to Republican congressional aides briefed by the IRS and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration ­(TIGTA) on the details of their reviews.

Then-Commissioner Douglas Shulman, a George W. Bush appointee who stepped down in November, received a briefing from the TIGTA about what was happening in the Cincinnati office in May 2012, the aides said. His deputy and the agency’s current acting commissioner, Steven T. Miller, also learned about the matter that month, the aides said.

The officials did not share details with Republican lawmakers who had been demanding to know whether the IRS was targeting conservative groups, Republicans said.

“I wrote to the IRS three times last year after hearing concerns that conservative groups were being targeted,” Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (Utah), the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement Monday. “In response to the first letter I sent with some of my colleagues, Steven Miller, the current Acting IRS Commissioner, responded that these groups weren’t being targeted.”

“Knowing what we know now,” he added, “the IRS was at best being far from forth coming, or at worst, being deliberately dishonest with Congress.”

As new details emerged Monday, Democrats and Republicans alike decried the agency’s actions as an unacceptable abuse of power.

In a news conference Monday, President Obama said he learned of the investigating in media reports on Friday and has “no patience with it.”

“If in fact IRS personnel engaged in the kind of practices that have been reported on, and were intentionally targeting conservative groups, then that’s outrageous,” Obama said. “And there’s no place for it. And they have to be held fully accountable.”

White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Monday that the White House counsel’s office learned of an upcoming IRS inspector general’s report on April 22 as part of a routine notification but had not received access to the report.

On Capitol Hill, two Senate panels — the Finance Committee and the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations — announced Monday that they will investigate. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and the Ways and Means Committee have been looking into reports of IRS attempts to single out organizations on the right for heightened scrutiny. Ways and Means has called IRS officials to testify Friday.

“These actions by the IRS are an outrageous abuse of power and a breach of the public’s trust,” said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.). “The IRS will now be the ones put under additional scrutiny.”

Separately, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio) introduced companion bills Monday that would require the IRS to fire any employee found “willfully” violating “the constitutional rights of a taxpayer,” according to statements by both lawmakers. The bills also would make them criminally liable for their actions.

Even as Obama vowed that his administration “will make sure that we find out exactly what happened on this,” however, the IRS offered no new information on how it selected which groups to single out for scrutiny.

The White House is legally barred from contacting the IRS about a tax matter, under a prohibition adopted after the Watergate scandal. And although it can contact the Treasury Department about tax issues, neither Treasury nor the IRS can disclose specific taxpayer information. The IRS can release information about a petition for tax-

exempt status only after it has been approved.

Obama is not in a position to remove Lerner, a career official who can be terminated for cause only under normal civil service proceedings. The IRS has two political appointees: the commissioner, who serves a five-year term, and the chief counsel.

As the IRS came under broader political attack Monday, more details surfaced on how the exempt-organizations division struggled to determine which nonprofits should receive “social welfare” status after the 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling. That decision, which allowed corporations and unions to raise and spend un­limited amounts of money on elections, opened the door for groups to accept undisclosed contributions as long as their “primary purpose” was not politics.

In a Jan. 9, 2012, letter to the Richmond Tea Party, IRS specialist Stephen Seok asked questions including “the names of the donors, contributors and grantors,” as well as the size of the contributions and grants, and when they were given.



Richmond Tea Party President Larry Nordvig, whose group applied for tax-exempt status in December 2009 and received it in July 2012, said the extended inquiry had “a very chilling effect” on how much money the group could raise because its donors preferred anonymity.

The Wetumpka Tea Party of Alabama experienced a two-year delay after submitting its initial application.

Becky Gerritson, a 44-year-old stay-at-home mother and the group’s president, said the IRS sent a questionnaire asking for the names of all volunteers, donor identification and contribution amounts, the names of any legislators its members had communicated with directly or indirectly, and the contents of all speeches its members had made, among a long list of other details.

“I was outraged,” Gerritson said. “Being an election year, I felt like it was intimidation.”

The group did not provide the information. Approval came only after the group sought help from the American Center for Law and Justice, which threatened a lawsuit against the IRS, Gerritson said.

Although some of the groups were explicitly labeled “tea party” or “patriot,” others that came under intense scrutiny were focused on challenging the Affordable Care Act — known by many as Obamacare — or the integrity of federal elections.

In a June 3, 2011, letter to the IRS, Mitchell questioned the agency’s motivations for delaying recognition of one of her clients who had filed nearly two years earlier, writing, “Is the [group’s] opposition to Obamacare and the takeover of America’s healthcare system by the government the reason that this application has been held up and not approved?”

Catherine Engelbrecht, president of the Houston-based True the Vote, first filed for tax-exempt status in July 2010. At one point, Engelbrecht — who is still awaiting a determination from the IRS regarding her voting rights organization and a separate tea party group, King Street Patriots — said an IRS employee informed her: “I’m just doing what Washington is telling me to do. I’m just asking what they want me to ask.”

The IRS did not respond to requests for comment Monday.

This bundle of energy is Mark Rosenthal, who for the last 15 years, was a union boss in New York City, a position he earned by eating Jimmy Hoffa. (audience laughter) He lost his job this week after these photos of him sleeping on the job appeared in the papers, including of one where he was holding Princess Leia on a leash.

(audience laughter)

Now I must say, I feel a little bad for this guy because he had to take pain meds that put him out after lunch because of a bad back. And I believe him when he says he has a bad back, 'cause as you can see, he's a huge fat fuck! And that's mostly on him.

But if we're down on him because he's unconscious on the job, why did we reward it in this guy?

Or this guy?

Or this guy?

That's Michigan's 87-year-old Congressman John Dingell. And last week, he set a new record for the most time in Congress — 57 years. And everyone applauded. Why?

There's a difference between public service and hoarding. (audience applause) This guy has had 30 terms! He was first elected in 1955, six years before Obama was even born in Kenya! (audience laughter)

Congressman Ralph Hall of Texas is 90, and he's running for re-election. Which would be cool if he was one of those spry old guys who does the crossword and plays tennis every morning, but he's not that guy. He said recently he doesn't believe in climate change, and that ""I'm really more fearful of freezing"". Yes, 'cause you're 90! (audience laughter and applause)

New Jersey's Senator Frank Lautenberg — my first Senate vote — died this month in office at 89. And when Cory Booker, the Superman mayor of Newark said last year that he was thinking of running for his seat, Lautenberg's top aide called it ""disrespectful"". (BruinKid note: Actually, it was Lautenberg himself who said that, not an aide.)

Really? Really?? The guy who runs into burning buildings shouldn't take over for the other guy who can't blow on a piece of paper and make it move across the table? (audience laughter)

And let me emphasize, this is not about age. This is about Congressmen who suck at their jobs because their jobs are never at stake. There are only three ways a Congressman goes out: they die in office, they cash in as a lobbyist, or they mistakenly tweet a picture of their dick. (audience laughter and applause) Three ways.

The approval rating for Congress is 10%. And yet in 2012, over 90% won re-election. And that's because we've created a system where it's almost impossible to beat an incumbent. The districts are too gerrymandered, the ads are too expensive. So every few years, we're treated to the sight of some crypt-keeper who hasn't shown up at work for years being wheeled out by a staff member so he can raise his skeleton hand to vote ""Aye"".

A couple of years ago, for the health care bill, it was 92-year-old Robert Byrd.

In 2002, it was 101-year-old Strom Thurmond,

a man who raped the family maid the same year Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby. (shocked audience laughter) True. (BruinKid note: Yep, it's true. Both occurred in 1925.) But who was still voting in 2001 on issues like stem cell research, even though he once referred to a microphone as ""the machine"". (shocked audience laughter)

When did we become this Weekend at Bernie's government... (audience laughter and applause) where Senators are coaxed into key votes by someone whispering in their ear, ""Who wants pudding?"" (audience laughter)

Linking to a provincial post in the Arizona Republic with the headline “The Dodgers are idiots,” the good senator has taken time out from dressing down Vladimir Putin and trying to shut down the government, to rip the Boys in Blue.

No-class act by a bunch of overpaid, immature, arrogant, spoiled brats! “The #Dodgers are idiots” https://t.co/KfZZliBFBV— John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) September 20, 2013

Funny, I don’t remember him ever going after President Obama so forcibly, but then the Dodgers did jump in the Diamondbacks’ pool. Sometimes people just cross the line and senators have to speak out.

Now I know the good people of Arizona may not have been thrilled with seeing the Dodgers celebrate beating the Diamondbacks and clinching the division Thursday by jumping into that pool beyond the outfield fence, but I’m pretty sure they’ve experienced greater transgressions against their local sporting pride.

You know, like blowing a 9½-game lead on those spoiled brats to now find themselves 10½ back and eliminated. But then the temerity of those immature ballplayers, running out into an empty ballpark after all the Diamondbacks had left the field to jump in the pool and splash around.

It’s a pool. Understand that Phoenix has more than one. It is not a shrine to the Great Cactus God in the Sky or some monument to Jay Bell, or whoever the greatest Diamondback is of all time. It is not holy water. It’s a goofy pool in a ballpark.

Still, McCain – the great maverick -- couldn’t help himself. This train of the indignant had left the Arizona station, and the Senate’s favorite curmudgeon was not about to be left behind. Even though I’m pretty sure he may have something more important to do.

Some in the Valley of the Sun have got themselves in a tizzy over this because they pointed out the Diamondbacks asked the Dodgers if they did clinched while in Phoenix, that once they left the field, not to return.

Right, somebody is going to tell the Dodgers – or any other team – how and where to celebrate winning a title. Sorry, sports – and life – do not work that way. Winners and the spoils.

Some of the other incensed claim the Dodgers were mocking a grand Diamondbacks tradition, because the D-backs frolicked in the pool when they won in 2011. Apparently something happens once in Phoenix and it’s tradition.

The Dodgers jumped in a pool and splashed around and had some fun. I thought it was great. The crowd was gone, the Diamondbacks were gone. It’s not like they were taunting anyone.

Phoenix is actually a huge metropolitan area – sixth largest in the country – but has never seemed so small. Its senator included. He’s the one who looks like he’s stomping his feet and holding his breath There, there, it’ll be all right.

He is right about the Dodgers being well compensated, what with the largest payroll in baseball history. Not so sure about being overpaid, though, since they did win.

And don’t forget boys and girls, the Dodgers open the 2014 season next year against the Diamondbacks in Australia. Alert its parliament. There is some hallowed cricket ground out there. And Sydney has lots of pools."
http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/10/03/republicans-have-already-won-so-why-wont-compromise/,2013-10-03 00:00:00,[],"Republicans have already won, so why won't they compromise?","One of the great mysteries of the current budget crisis is why Republicans did not declare victory and pass a continuing resolution last week funding government through the end of the year.

The resolution that is at the root of this crisis already establishes sequestration-level funding that President Obama and Senate Democrats have repeatedly said is unacceptably low but which they were willing to swallow in order to avoid a government shutdown.

That is the kind of compromise that, under normal circumstances, Republicans should celebrate. They got Democrats to accept a continuation of drastic, across-the-board spending cuts that are anathema to the president and his base. And yet members of the Tea Party, from Senator Ted Cruz to Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, have driven the Republican Party so far though the looking glass that even a compromise that so greatly favored their side has not been enough.

[pullquote]

The American public knows this, which is why the Tea Party does damage to the Republican Party the longer this crisis drags on.

Public opinion polls continue to show that voters overwhelmingly blame Republicans for the pain this shutdown is inflicting.

House Speaker John Boehner knows this but will do nothing to stop it. His agenda is not to win national or statewide elections or even to save the Republican Party from the kamikaze pilots who have taken it over. His sole priority is to save his speakership, which is why he will not bring a clean continuing resolution to the floor and allow an up-or-down vote.

Republican complaints that the president and Senate Democrats refuse to compromise ring hollow.

“Compromise,” to these demagogues, is to mandate that Democrats scrap President Obama’s signature domestic legislative accomplishment, which was passed by Congress, signed into law by the president, upheld by the Supreme Court and ratified by voters who returned its architect to the White House last November.

Belatedly, Republicans have complained that Senate Democrats won’t compromise by refusing to go to a budget conference committee. This request was all the more insincere when it arrived immediately before the government was due to shut down this week.

Senate Democrats, of course, had been begging for a budget compromise for months – ever since the senate passed its budget last spring. But Republicans rejected this attempt at compromise 18 times, refusing to allow the Senate and House of Representatives to go to a budget conference to hammer out a deal that would have put an end to this cycle of continuing resolutions.

The reality, of course, is that Republicans do not want a compromise. Their behavior this week is a final grasp at strangling a health care bill they were unable to defeat legislatively, judicially or electorally.

Republicans could have been scoring political points by pointing out all the glitches with the health care exchanges that went live on the same day they decided to shut down the government.

Instead, the public’s focus has been on their intransigence and the myopia with which a small, nationally reviled faction has managed to hold the will of the American people hostage.

This could have been the week when Republicans celebrated a continuation of austerity, across the board spending cuts and all the fiscal policies they had been rhetorically touting for decades.

Democrats compromised by giving away the store on sequestration-level funding. Too bad that the Tea Partiers driving the train in Washington these days are too wild-eyed to see it."

Is it tiny Muslimses?



Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX)—who has spent the weeks following the bombing arguing that Obama’s “political correctness” prevented the FBI from stopping the attacks—appeared on the Glenn Beck radio show to argue that Holder’s history of defending terrorists allowed the judge to Mirandize Tsarnaev:

GOHMERT: Think about it, when your attorney general spent more of his legal career helping terrorists than defending the country, then you know we all have certain biases and lean certain ways. Gohmert then went on to reiterate his belief that the Obama administration is guided by the Muslim Brotherhood. “[The administration] know who’s in there advising them,” Gohmert said, “either they lie under oath or they do know the extent of Muslim Brotherhood infiltration into our government.”

While addressing the FBI’s work in Boston, Gohmert said that it was “amazing” that the FBI was able to do any investigative work at all because, according to Gohmert, they are being advised by “Muslim Brotherhood members.” He said that the Obama administration is promoting “radical Islam” and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and in the US, maintaining that “Muslim Brotherhood advisers” have made it “virtually impossible to properly and adequately investigate and defend this country.”

Look, this isn't even funny at this point. We need an intervention. Somebody help this man No, I mean it. Is there a number we should be calling? Can someone check for a medical alert bracelet? Because this poor man is seeing invisible Muslims everywhere, and in every federal department He's gone past the conspiracy tubthumping of Bachmann and King—he may have even lapped a few Alex Jones theories at this point. According to him, the entire government is just riddled with secret invisible Muslims. They're everywhere. They're hiding under his office chair, they're in his cereal, they're out in the parking lot right now, letting just a tiny bit of air out of his tires each day—oh, it's hard to notice at first, but you can tell. You can tell.

I realize America doesn't have high standards for electing congresspeople. Or, for that manner, any standards at all. I realize many voters in certain southern states have, in fact, a longstanding tradition of seeing just how dumb a man they might be able to elect to office, just to see what would happen. And I realize that the Republican Party has relied on the dangers posed by purely imaginary people of all colors and persuasions for nearly all of their major policy decisions, these last two decades. But this? This is a man past his breaking point. This is a man who's about three weeks from ripping out his own fillings, claiming invisible Muslims lived inside them and were reciting the collected works of Walt Whitman every night while he was trying to sleep. Help him.

Beltway tactics such as the “tollbooth,” the “milker bill,” and “double milker bills” shamelessly extort campaign cash to advance or stall legislation aimed at targeted money. All too often, the reality is “pay to delay” or “pay to play.”

One scandalous revelation is the staggeringly high interest rate some politicians charge on personal loans they make to their own campaigns, resulting in windfall personal profit. Rep. Grace Napolitano (D-CA) pocketed $294,245 in interest payments on a $150,000 loan at 18% (later lowered to 10%). She dismissed 60 Minutes journalist Steve Kroft’s challenge to the “Mafia” interest rate, saying, “It’s not like I really profited… I am not a billionaire, or a millionaire, for that matter.”

Her comment opens a window into a dirty secret soiling mainstream party politics. Players get rich–typically with your money. At times, the sums are staggering.

Jamie Gorelick served as deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration and followed that gig with a five-year tenure as a board member of the congressionally-chartered, tax-exempt Fannie Mae, where she reportedly received over $26 million in salary, bonuses, so-called performance pay, and stock options.

Fellow Fannie Mae board member Franklyn Raines, who previously served as Bill Clinton’s Director of the Office of Management and Budget, received $90,000,000 in total compensation for six years’ service. Yet Time Magazine called him one of the twenty-five people to blame for the 2008 financial meltdown. The New York Times reported that he agreed to pay $24.7 million, including a $2 million fine, to settle claims against him flowing from the crash.

It is simply a “given” within the professional political class that insiders profit. A seemingly endless supply of tax dollars has long fueled complaints that government policy makers, office holders, functionaries, party insiders, connected lobbyists, and families cash in on the public dole. It even has a name: “crony capitalism.” The latest example is the debacle known as HealthCare.gov–hundreds of millions for what can at best be called an embarrassment developed by a Canadian subsidiary that contributed heavily to pols of all stripes.

Rep. Napolitano’s dismissive backhand at the suggestion of anything remiss over her pocketing a mere $294k is symptomatic of the narcissism now epidemic in the political class. Real profit for the new elites is about serious largesse. Anything as paltry as her racket is chump change. It crosses party lines and flows from bloated government, obscure quasi-governmental entities, and politically packed special entities such as Fannie Mae. And it passes stealthily into respectful private business deals, where political rivals become strange bedfellows.

The current gubernatorial race in Virginia offers a fascinating glimpse of one such pairing. Terry McAuliffe, a DC-area transplant from upstate New York, parlayed his political connections and fundraising acumen into the chairmanship of the DNC. His style of politics takes no prisoners.

McAuliffe has a penchant for investing in techie upstarts with potential for big profit. In 1999, he invested in and joined the board of directors of Telergy, Inc., in Syracuse, New York, his home town. Telergy planned to create a contiguous end-to-end high-speed fiber optics network in the northeastern US along utility rights-of-way. Its plan was to leverage relationships with Niagara Mohawk, NYSEG, Consolidated Edison, GPU, El Paso, and certain National Grid electric subsidiaries. A good old-fashioned dose of classic American initiative–with risks, to be sure–and the potential for handsome profit.

And if the story stopped there, God bless every penny he and his partners could make. That’s why the Constitution protects private property as a fundamental right and encourages capital market creation by granting Congress legislative authority to introduce copyright and patent legislation, all of which encourages the risk/profit correlation that has driven the American economic engine to produce a better standard of living for the broadest swath of society the planet has ever known.

However, the company vastly overvalued its assets and went bust. The Washington Free Beacon reported on McAuliffe’s Telergy link long ago. Byron York added some details here.

But there is more to the story. Telergy laid off a slew of local Syracuse employees–hundreds–without any severance in 2001 and, by the end of the year, filed for bankruptcy. McAuliffe has always said he was just an investor and did not run day-to-day operations. But Telegry’s S-1 SEC filing offers a tantalizing window into the relationships of political insiders and the subordination of principle to profit.

The S-1 identifies McAuliffe under its list of “EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND KEY EMPLOYEES.” See page 59. But notice who else it lists among the officers and directors:

J. Patrick Barrett, President and Director. The former Chairman of the New York GOP State Committee during the administration of George Herbert Walker Bush, he is a wealthy and powerful party insider. No one moves within the upstate NY GOP without clearing things with Pat Barrett.

Thomas G. Young, Vice President, Government Relations. He was the Democrat Mayor of Syracuse from 1986-1993, which coincided with Pat Barrett’s term as GOP state party chair. A longtime political of Terry McAuliffe, who hails from Syracuse.

John F. O’Mara, Director. He served as special counsel to George Pataki when the latter was governor of NY and was chair of the New York State Public Service Commission. A powerful state GOP insider.

And, of course, McAuliffe.

All were key players in the political rough and tumble of NY party politics. Some still are. And they were adversaries. Ideologically and politically split–or so it would appear. Yet here they were, in bed together in their personal business investments–and not as mere passive investors the way millions are when vested in mutual funds or as capital investors in start-ups. Each took publicly-identified roles as significant players with fiduciary responsibilities.

But even when the deals go bust, the directors and key people make out, as happened with Telergy. McAuliffe reportedly made some $1.2 million by brokering an investment in Telergy by Gary Winnick of Global Crossing, another company McAuliffe invested in and made millions before it, too, went bankrupt. That failure resulted in $54 billion in shareholder losses and 10,000 lost jobs.

There is nothing wrong with making lots of money. We all love the idea. But the deeper point is to recognize what the money can do to the insiders. Telergy was but one example.

Is it reasonable to believe that such relationships do not erode independence? How aggressively will a state party chair campaign against the local mayor of a rival party come election season when the two are officers of the same business venture? And what of their advocacy of the cherished goals of the grass roots party faithful?It isn’t crony capitalism, but it reeks of cynicism. And its effect on sincerity and message is corrosive.

It is one reason some believe the RINO element within the GOP is uncomfortable with Ken Cuccinelli. Like Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Rand Paul, and Scott Walker, these insurgent new bloods really believe in freedom, the ideals of their agenda, the sanctity of life, and the restoration of principal. And a new core of GOP leaders stands ready to seize the party with them: Gov. Nikki Haley, Congresswomen Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Kristi Noem, Senators Tom Coburn, Deb Fisher, Pat Toomey, and more.

The emerging voices of conservative principle are sounding the heat of the nation. For a long time, too many have allowed deception to pile high the precipice from which we fall until so dark and damp a tomb we become accustomed to the stench of rotted expectation. No more. With a nod to Mr. Dylan, “the times they are a-changing.”"

Louisiana showed up at the top of a study of political corruption that calculated the number of convictions per capita. Georgia came out as worst on a corruption risk report from the State Integrity Investigation, which measured factors like accountability, transparency and ethics enforcement.

New Jersey got the best grade.

“There was an audible gasp across the entire state,” said Debbie Walsh of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers.

“It was counterintuitive for us as well,” said Gordon Witkin, the managing editor at the Center for Public Integrity. Witkin’s theory is that New Jersey got to be good by being bad. “Where there has been a major, major scandal, that was the catalyst for very specific reform.”

Well, New Jersey has had its problems. Over the last decade there was Gov. James McGreevey’s affair with the male Israeli poet. (The state could have accepted the gay part, and the adultery part, if only McGreevey had not decided to prove his love by making the poet head of homeland security.) That was followed by a slew of political indictments, after which the Legislature did end some of its most notorious ethics loopholes. But it’s still, you know, New Jersey.

It’s at this point in every rant about state legislators that we stop to point out that most of them are honest, and some downright heroic. Really, just try spending a good chunk of your life as a reformer in the New York State Senate. See how you like it.

Also, some entire state legislatures are both honest and effective. People speak highly of the one in Nebraska. (It’s unicameral!) I once covered the Connecticut Legislature, where people took their jobs very seriously, holding endless public hearings on every bill and then having long, earnest debates in which the outcome was not preordained. But that was way back in the 1970s, when Joseph Lieberman was the Senate majority leader, and even at that early age was being accused by the liberals of selling out."

prev Image 2 of 2

A federal judge will seek to unravel an art mystery and determine the rightful owner of a napkin-sized painting by French impressionist Pierre-Auguste Renoir that a Virginia woman says she bought at a flea market for $7.

The ownership is in dispute after documents were uncovered showing a Baltimore museum reported the painting stolen more than 60 years ago.

The painting has been seized by the FBI, and the federal government filed an action last month in U.S. District Court in Alexandria asking a judge to determine who should keep the painting.

Among the contenders is a Lovettsville woman, Marcia ""Martha"" Fuqua, who has told the FBI that she bought the painting at a West Virginia flea market in late 2009 for $7 and stored it in a plastic trash bag for two years before having it authenticated as a genuine Renoir.

Last year, Fuqua planned to have the painting sold at auction, where it was expected to fetch at least $75,000. But the auction was postponed after it was learned that the Baltimore Museum of Art reported the painting stolen in 1951. Records show an insurer, the Fireman's Fund, paid a $2,500 claim on the theft.

The insurer says it is now the rightful owner, based on payment of that claim.

According to an appraisal commissioned by the FBI, Renoir painted ""Paysage bords de Seine,"" or On the Shore of the Seine, on a linen napkin in 1879 on the spot at a riverside restaurant for his mistress.

The appraiser says the Renoir's value is about $22,000, much less than the auction house estimated, because Renoir's paintings have fallen out of favor with some art collectors who consider them old fashioned and because questions about the painting's ownership and possible theft diminish its value to collectors.

Fuqua, who had managed to remain anonymous until the court case was filed, told the FBI under penalty of perjury that she bought the painting at a flea market in Harpers Ferry, W. Va., never believing the painting to be a true Renoir, even though a plate reading ""RENOIR"" is attached to the frame. She describes herself as an ""innocent buyer"" and questions the FBI's authority to seize the painting.

""Because I am not an art historian, collector, appraiser, or dealer, I lacked the expertise to identify the Renoir Painting's authenticity, origins or previous ownership history,"" she wrote.

On Friday, The Washington Post reported that Fuqua's 84-year-old mother, who operated an art school for decades in Fairfax County under the name Marcia Fouquet, is an artist who specialized in reproducing paintings from Renoir and other masters. The Post said Fouquet had artistic links to Baltimore in the 1950s, when the painting was stolen, and graduated from Goucher College with a fine arts degree in 1952.

A man who identified himself as Fuqua's brother, Owen M. Fuqua, told the Post that the painting had been in the family for 50 or 60 years and that ""all I know is my sister didn't just go buy it at a flea market.""

The man later retracted his story, and ultimately said it was another person using his name who gave the initial interview.

Efforts by the AP Friday to reach Martha and Owen Fuqua Friday were unsuccessful. Martha Fuqua's lawyer did not return a call Friday seeking comment.

The FBI has an ongoing investigation, according to spokeswoman Lindsay Godwin.

Meanwhile, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema ordered all parties seeking to claim ownership of the painting to make their case in written pleadings later this month."

Washington (CNN) – President Barack Obama attended the Gridiron Club and Foundation’s annual dinner in Washington Saturday night, even cracking a joke on forced budget cuts along the way.

The annual event brings together politicians and Washington’s media elite. Because there’s limited press access, presidents who attend usually act a little looser than when the camera light is on.



This is the second time Obama has attended the dinner as president but the first since 2011.

“As you know, I last attended the Gridiron dinner two years ago. Back then, I addressed a number of topics - a dysfunctional Congress, a looming budget crisis, complaints that I don’t spend enough time with the press. It’s funny, it seems like it was just yesterday,” Obama said.

This year, the president said the jokes were a little harder to come by because of forced budget cuts and also talked of the notoriously long dinner.

“My joke writers have been placed on furlough,” Obama said. “Of course there is one thing in Washington that didn’t get cut: The length of this dinner. Yet more proof that the sequester makes no sense.”

Vice President Joe Biden wasn’t in attendance but his presence was still felt. Biden is rumored to be a potential presidential nominee in 2016 but Obama said he may have different aspirations.

“(The) vice president is still ambitious. But let's face it, his age is an issue. Just the other day, I had to take Joe aside and say, ‘Joe, you are way too young to be the pope,’” Obama said.

Obama even made light of Sen. Marco Rubio’s infamous water sip during the Republican response following the State of the Union address.

“Of course, as I begin my second term, our country is still facing enormous challenges,” the president said, taking a long sip of water. “That, Marco Rubio, is how you take a sip of water.”

The president also brought up his new Secretary of State, John Kerry, and compared him to his predecessor, the famously pantsuit-wearing Hillary Clinton.

“Let’s face it - Hillary is a tough act to follow. But John Kerry is doing great so far. He is doing everything he can to ensure continuity. Frankly, though, I think it’s time for him to stop showing up at work in pantsuits. It's a disturbing image,” Obama said.

Every president since 1885 except for Grover Cleveland has spoken at the 128-year-old organization’s dinner.

The Gridiron is a media organization bringing together the “who’s who” of the Washington press corps. About 650 people attended the dinner according to Gridiron and they included top politicians and journalists. There are 65 members of the Gridiron and membership is by invitation only. The group is a charitable organization and provides annual scholarships to colleges and journalistic organizations.

Despite being a media organization, the dinner is traditionally closed to the television press pool which typically covers the president. But a newspaper pool reporter was allowed into the dinner Saturday for the first time ever and provided updates to the media. The idea behind the limited media access is to allow both club members and politicians a chance to let their guards down and tell jokes they may not otherwise tell with cameras watching and listening.

Still, some have criticized the gathering both for the limited media access and for the perceived coziness between the press and politicians they have to report on.

Obama will be attending the larger White House Correspondents’ Dinner next month which does allow television media coverage.

The president ended tonight’s dinner on a serious note, thanking journalists for the work they do.

“In an age when all it takes to attract attention is a Twitter handle and some followers, it’s easier than ever to get it wrong. But it’s more important than ever to get it right. And I’m grateful for all the journalists who do one of the toughest jobs there is with integrity and insight and dedication and a sense of purpose that goes beyond a business model or a news cycle,” Obama said."

Story highlights Spending cuts prompt tower closures at small and medium airports, agency tells operators It says 16 more towers will close on September 30 FAA says keeping any of the towers open would require showing it's in national interest The move applies only to contract towers, which use contractors, not FAA employees

(CNN) —

The federal government will close 173 air traffic control towers at small- and medium-size airports on April 7 because of forced spending cuts, the Federal Aviation Administration told tower operators Tuesday. It will close another 16 towers on September 30, the end of the fiscal year.

Spenser Dickerson, head of the Contract Tower Association, told CNN that FAA officials gave him the news, capping off a five-day period in which the FAA first told contractors they would close scores of towers, then backtracked on the news.

The FAA said it would consider removing individual towers from the list on a case-by-case basis, if the operators can explain why it is in the national interest to keep them open, Dickerson said.

The news Tuesday, if anything, was worse than previously announced. Last Wednesday, the FAA said it would close 168 towers.

Some Democrats oppose GOP plan for government funding

“We’re extremely discouraged and disappointed that the FAA is taking this action,” Dickerson said. “The rest of the FAA’s budget is getting a 5% haircut; the contract towers are getting a 75% cut, because the FAA is cutting 189 of the 251 contract towers.”

“It’s hard for us to see the fairness in the budget cuts. It seems the contract tower program is taking a high, disproportionate cut. We have serious concerns about the safety, efficiency and loss of jobs in almost 150 communities across the country,” he said.

The FAA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The towers are part of the FAA’s contract tower program, in which 251 towers are staffed with contractors instead of FAA employees. Though little-known, contract towers are widely used by the FAA to manage air traffic. Such towers handle approximately 28% of all control tower operations, although the towers being cut account for a little less than 6% of commercial airline operations.

John Cozart, CEO of Robinson Aviation Inc., which staffs contract towers in the South and Southwestern U.S., said the decision was “not unexpected.”

Opinion: Spending cut. Now, GOP, where are the jobs?

“I didn’t think they’d resolve it in favor of the contract tower program. I kind of expected that they would continue on their course,” he said.

Asked for his reaction, he said, “You’re asking a guy who’s having to lay off a ton of people because of this.”

Tower closures would not necessarily result in airport closures, because some aircraft can land without air traffic control help, and those that need controller help can communicate with more distant FAA facilities. But the contract tower closings will contribute to the workload at other FAA facilities, which simultaneously will be coping with controller furloughs.

A 2011 report by the Department of Transportation’s Office of Inspector General said contract towers cost on average $537,000 a year to operate, compared with $2 million for comparably busy FAA-staffed towers. The lower costs were chiefly from lower staffing and salary levels at contract towers, which had an average of six controllers, while FAA towers had 16. And a typical contract controller near Tampa, Florida, received a base pay of $56,000 per year, compared with a base pay ranging from $63,000 to $85,000 a year for an FAA controller in Sarasota, Florida, the study said.

Dickerson said contract towers are carrying the brunt of the cuts, despite having comparable safety records and being more cost efficient.

But the forced spending cuts, known as the sequestration, are also affecting FAA staff. Most of the agency’s 47,000 workers, including its 14,700 controllers, have been told to expect one or two furlough days every two-week pay period. And 49 FAA-staffed towers are on the list of those facing possible closure.

Longer lines at airports due to budget cuts?"

Washington (CNN) - Elouise Wafer's kids thought they had arranged the perfect gift for their mother's 70th birthday.

A former history teacher, Wafer had always wanted to stroll through the White House, a building she had taught about in school for decades.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Sylvia Atkins, her daughter, arranged for a tour through a member of Congress–then she, her sister and Wafer made the journey together from Dallas. But the plane ride had a dash of disappointment.

Shortly before departing Texas, Wafer saw on the news that the White House would be canceling public tours beginning Saturday - the same day as her scheduled slot.

""This was my golden opportunity,"" Wafer said. ""I really wanted to see some of the things that I had studied in school and taught about in school. I wanted to see it in real life.""

Wafer was one of many tourists whose White House plans were scrubbed when the White House decided this week to cut the tours through September 30, the remainder of the fiscal year.

The move came days after Washington failed to come up with a plan to avert $85 billion in automatic spending cuts, known as sequestration. Federal agencies across the board are making changes to their budgets.

Ryan Dosier, another visitor whose tour luck ran out, was skeptical of whether the walk-throughs deserved to be on the chopping block.

""I just, I don't know how much this is really saving,"" he said. ""I can't imagine that me and two other people is a big expense for them.”

The U.S. Secret Service told CNN Thursday that the plan will help the agency save $74,000 per week - or $2 million in the next seven months. That's how much it costs to pay 37 uniformed officers $50 an hour for 40 hours a week to secure the tour's route through the East Wing.

But that's just a fraction of the $84 million the Secret Service needs to cut from its $1.6 billion budget, according to the Office of Management and Budget. The officers normally assigned to the tours will be reassigned to other duties at the White House.

“The Secret Service, like other agencies of government is affected by the sequester,” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said during his Thursday press briefing. “And the Secret Service presented options that ranged from canceling tours to potential furloughs and cuts in overtime. And in order to allow the Secret Service to best fulfill its core mission, the White House made the decision that we would unfortunately have to temporarily suspend these tours.”

Some Republicans were quick to blast the Obama administration for nixing the tours, arguing it was a political move designed to draw up more negative public reaction over the cuts and pin all on the blame on the GOP.

""This is nonsense,"" former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Friday on CNN's ""The Situation Room."" ""This is punishing the American people.""

Gingrich called on President Obama to end his golf outings and use the money saved to refund the tours.

""The president will use up more Secret Service time guarding him while he golfs than it would take to keep the White House tours open all year,"" he argued.

He wasn't the only one. Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas submitted an amendment to a funding measure in the House this week that would require the president to stop golfing until the White House resumed the tours.

A White House spokesman said Tuesday that this was just the first consequence to the forced spending cuts that began taking effect March 1. And White House Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Friday that more White House employees will face pay cuts and furloughs.

""We're also faced with making some tough decisions when it comes to ongoing projects,"" he said during the daily press briefing. ""But we're also a pretty personnel heavy agency.""

The self-guided tours are typically arranged through a member of Congress. Natalie Cooper had obtained a ticket through the office of a senator from North Carolina for her son's 8th birthday.

Standing outside the White House Saturday, shortly before noon, Cooper told the birthday boy, Aaron, that they would no longer be getting a tour.

""I was pretty upset about it,"" she told CNN. ""He had his own bucket list and on that bucket list was D.C. and the White House, so it was a little bit upsetting.""

Aaron had already told his class he was going to the White House and added that he was ""sad, very sad."" But, he said, they had plans to see more monuments and museums in town.

Other visitors - who didn't have tour plans - felt less upset about the cancelation. As one couple from Canada said, ""Cuts are cuts.""

The White House Visitors Center, however, will remain open seven days a week. Located just southeast of the White House, the center - through the National Park Service - offers guided tours around the White House area for free every hour. The center also shows a 25-minute video of the different rooms in the White House.

While Wafer won't get her own tour of the White House for her 70th birthday, she said she's not letting the disappointment ruin her Washington vacation. Among other stops, Wafer took a tour of the U.S. Capitol.

But, just like any good teacher, she was more concerned about the students.

""Kids are out for spring break, and they don't get a chance to come (here) all the time,"" she said. ""This is a good time for them to visit the White House.""

During ABC's telecast of the president's inaugural address, anchor George Stephanopoulos confused one of our nation's greatest basketball legends with one of the country's greatest acting legends.

Panning to a shot of NBA Hall of Famer Bill Russell, who was wearing a Boston Celtics cap to make it even easier, Stephanopoulos identified the 11-time NBA champion as the five-time Oscar nominee.

""That's Morgan Freeman, I think, right there on the Capitol steps,"" Stephanopoulos said. ""No, Bill Russell, I'm sorry.""



In addition to their height discrepancy (Russell is 6-9 while Freeman is 6-2), here are several other ways the two septugenarians differ.

Bill Russell did not discover Gwyneth Paltrow's head in a box in Seven.

Bill Russell did serve as both a player and coach of the Boston Celtics for three years in the late 1960s.

Bill Russell did not drive Miss Daisy in the film based on the same subject.

Bill Russell did make twelve NBA All-Star teams.

Bill Russell did not team up with Tim Robbins in The Shawshank Redemption to create one of the most likable tandems in modern movie history.

Bill Russell did team up with Bob Cousy to win six NBA titles with the Boston Celtics."

Detroit Free Press

International Cat Association accepted the Savannah as an official breed in 2001

The group says these cats can be trained to walk on a leash and love to play fetch

The cat had been missing from its home for about a month%3B owners called rescue group

DETROIT — A big cat roaming Detroit's northeast side is dead, according to a feral cat rescue group that had been trying to find it for days.

The body of the 25-pound, 3-year-old Savannah cat named Chum was found in a trash can on Detroit's east side Monday evening, said founder Laura Wilhelm-Bruzek of Paws for the Cause, a feral cat rescue group based in Chesterfield Township, Mich.

A neighbor shot the cat days ago, she said. The all-volunteer nonprofit rescue group and advocates for feral cats had been searching for the cat, which was not feral but a family pet, since Saturday.

""I think people can't just go around shooting things they don't understand,"" Wilhelm-Bruzek said Tuesday. ""I think we need to be a little bit more respectful of the animals and human beings around us. I'd love to see someone look into it and investigate it. But I'm not holding out a lot of hope. This whole thing from the beginning has just been a mess.""

Neighbors said they had contacted the Michigan Humane Society and Detroit Police when the cat — called a Savannah — was seen roaming the neighborhood but both declined to investigate.

Paws for a Cause got involved last week, and the cat's owners called the group Monday, Wilhelm-Bruzek said. They said the cat, which did not have a microchip, had gotten out of their home about a month ago through a window.

The rescue group heard that the cat had been shot weren't able to find the cat's body until Monday when a member was shown where the cat had been thrown away, Wilhelm-Bruzek said.

""I simply asked them for the cat's body and they said it was across the street in a garbage can,"" she said. She was walked to the garbage can, ""and the cat — whose name is Chum — was there,"" she said.

Chum's owners, who had raised the cat since it was 4 months old, were devastated.

""They were hysterical,"" Wilhelm-Bruzek said, adding that they are having the cat cremated today.

A Savannah is a hybrid between a domesticated housecat and an African serval cat, according to the International Cat Association.

Wilhelm-Bruzek said Chum, about 2 feet tall from floor to head when sitting, was an F2 Savannah, or a second-generation hybrid.

""I don't think it was the size as much as the coloration that scared people,"" Wilhelm-Bruzek said. Savannah cats have long legs and exotic spots like a small leopard or wildcat, according to the association. They were first introduced to the public in 1997, are considered an official pedigreed breed, and are sold for thousands of dollars.

Michigan Humane Society spokesman Ryan McTigue said Tuesday that the agency was unaware of the cat's status.

""That's pretty terrible,"" McTigue said when told about the cat's fate."

HOUSE CLERK: Further consideration of H.R. 761....

Now this week, we crowned a new Miss America, a Nina Davuluri, who happens to be the first of Indian descent, and the Twittersphere exploded with so much racist hatred, you'd have thought that President Obama just made a reasonable remark. (audience laughter)

I mean, listen to some of this nonsense.



JAKE AMICK: How the fuck does a foreigner win miss America? She is a Arab! #idiots

Congratulations Al-Qaeda. Our Miss America is one of you.

AUDREY GRAHAM: Miss America is a terrorist. Whatever. It's fine.

Of course, you can understand why these people are so upset. Miss America, after all, is a very powerful position — she signs all of our laws and treaties. That's why the crown should only go to a white girl from Texas with big horse teeth.

But Nina Davuluri just won a beauty contest. She didn't do anything truly evil, like giving people health insurance. But her parents are from India, so she's an Arab. (audience laughter)

You know, it's funny, I used to think that my Twitter feed was so hate-filled, because I deal in controversy. But I found out it's everybody! I mean, I understand:

Yes, the technology does have something to do with it, but to those who say, ""Oh, people were always horrible, we just have Twitter and Facebook now,"" no. No, not like this.

The Greatest Generation had celebrities. No one would have thought to have sent Myrna Loy a telegram that said, ""Fuck you Myrna Loy! I hope Clark Gable gives you herpes!""

(audience laughter)

No, I think the problem is this. We just found out that the percentage of Americans who describe themselves as ""poor"" has doubled in the last five years. Which is very significant, because in the past, the poor consistently — and erroneously — described themselves as middle class. Because they had hope. Because they still believed in that Ponzi scheme formerly known as the American dream. But now they're starting to get it, that the fix is in, and that the ""two Americas"" thing is kinda true. And they're in the wrong one.

Apple just released two new iPhones, an expensive gold one for the haves, and for the serfs, a shitty plastic lime-green one that looks like your phone is wearing Crocs. (audience laughter)

http://news.yahoo.com/ap-exclusive-accusations-dog-russian-081242871.html,,[],AP Exclusive: Accusations dog Russian copter deal,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. military officials insisted a top-secret Pentagon study proved the need to buy Russian helicopters for Afghanistan's security forces. But the study actually recommended an American-made rotorcraft, according to unclassified excerpts obtained by The Associated Press.

The excerpts show the U.S. Army's workhorse Chinook, built by Boeing Co. in Pennsylvania, was ""the most cost-effective single platform type fleet for the Afghan Air Force over a 20-year"" period.

The finding has triggered allegations the Defense Department misled members of Congress and improperly cut U.S. companies out of competing for a contract that has swelled to more than $1 billion.

More than two years since DOD announced it was acquiring Russian Mi-17 helicopters, a veil of secrecy still obscures the pact despite its high-dollar value, the potential for fraud and waste, and accusations the Pentagon muffled important information.

The unprecedented arms deal also serves as a reminder to a war-weary American public that Afghanistan will remain heavily dependent on U.S. financial support even after its combat troops depart.

Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the Senate's No. 2 GOP leader, said DOD ""repeatedly and disingenuously"" used the 2010 study to justify the Russian helicopter as the superior choice for the Afghans.

Congress only recently received a copy of the document.

""So why are we buying Russian helicopters when there are American manufacturers that can meet that very same requirement?"" Cornyn asked.

As recently as September, Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter cited the study in a letter to House members defending the Mi-17 decision. Carter left his job last week.

Last year, Frank Kendall, the Pentagon's top acquisition official, and policy chief James Miller pointed to the study in a written response to questions posed by Cornyn.

Just a few weeks after the secret study was completed, Army Secretary John McHugh wrote in a 2011 memo ""that the Mi-17 stands apart"" when compared with other helicopters.

Story continues

The Pentagon denies it misled Congress.

A senior department official said the study was focused on long-term requirements and not the immediate needs of the Afghan military, which were best met by the Mi-17. Also, U.S. commanders in Afghanistan wanted the Russian helicopter because it is durable, easy to operate and the Afghan forces had experience flying it, according to the official, who was not authorized to be identified as the source of the information.

The war in Afghanistan, now in its 13th year, has been full of paradoxes.

What was once President Barack Obama's ""war of necessity"" has become a race for the exits. Hopes of eradicating the Taliban and transforming Afghanistan into a viable state have been dialed down. U.S. combat forces are scheduled to depart by the end of next year, leaving the Afghans responsible for ensuring the country doesn't collapse into the pre-Sept. 11 chaos that made it a terrorist haven.

There's no dispute that heavy-duty helicopters capable of quickly moving Afghan troops and supplies are essential to accomplishing that mission. But the decision to acquire them from Russia has achieved the rare feat in a deeply divided Congress of finding common ground among Republicans and Democrats.

Why, lawmakers from both political parties have demanded, is the U.S. purchasing military gear from Russia? After all, Russia has sold advanced weapons to the repressive government in Syria and Iran, sheltered NSA leaker Edward Snowden and been criticized by the State Department for adopting laws that restrict human rights.

On top of all that, corruption is rampant in Russia's defense industry, heightening concerns that crooked government officials and contractors are lining their pockets with American money.

""We're not dealing with a corrupt system. Corruption is the system,"" said Stephen Blank, a Russia expert at the American Foreign Policy Council, a Washington think tank. ""This is not a world we're familiar with.""

Overall, 63 Mi-17s are being acquired through the 2011 contract. It was awarded without competition to Russia's arms export agency, Rosoboronexport, even though the Pentagon condemned the agency after Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces used Russian weapons to ""murder Syrian civilians.""

Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, a high-ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said the arrangement has put American taxpayers in the intolerable position of subsidizing a company complicit in the atrocities occurring in Syria.

""The lack of straightforward information from the Pentagon on the ability of American-made helicopters to meet the mission in Afghanistan is but another factor severely undermining their credibility and justification for pursuing this sorely misguided procurement,"" DeLauro said.

No Pentagon official was made available to speak on the record for this story.

The AP also requested in late October that the department release unclassified portions of the 2010 study and other records supporting the decision to buy Mi-17s instead of Chinooks or other helicopters. The department provided only a one-page summary of a report that provided no new information.

Afghanistan's mountainous terrain demands a helicopter capable of operating in the most rugged conditions at altitudes well in excess of 15,000 feet. The Mi-17 met all these requirements, Carter and other U.S. military officials told lawmakers in correspondence and in testimony.

But so could the heavyweight Chinook. The Boeing helicopter is larger than its Russian counterpart, carries up to a 26,000 pound payload, which is twice as much as the Mi-17, and can operate at nearly the same high altitude.

The armed Mi-17s being purchased for Afghanistan from Rosoboronexport will replace older and less capable Mi-17s that the U.S. and other countries had purchased from brokers and contractors through the open market and then donated or loaned to the Afghans.

The fact that the Afghan forces had years of experience flying the Mi-17 figured prominently in the Pentagon's decision.

Carter and other U.S. defense officials contended that adding the Boeing helicopter to the mix would unnecessarily burden the Afghans with having to learn how to operate and maintain an unfamiliar helicopter.

The 2010 study ""specifically analyzed the opportunity for DOD to provide a U.S. alternative to the Mi-17 for Afghanistan,"" according to the excerpts.

It outlined a transitional approach in which Chinooks being retired from the U.S. military's fleet would be available in late 2013 to be refurbished and then replace older Mi-17s in the Afghan fleet, according to the excerpts. A combination of Mi-17s and renovated Chinooks, known in the Army's nomenclature as the CH-47D, could work as well.

The 2010 study advised proceeding cautiously. Shifting too quickly away from the Mi-17s already in use could undermine progress made in training the Afghan air force, the excerpts said. But it recommended a plan for converting the Afghan forces from a ""pure"" Mi-17 fleet to one that uses U.S. helicopters.

The Chinook option never materialized.

An extensive analysis of both helicopters concluded that a refurbished Chinook would cost about 40 percent more overall to buy and maintain than the Mi-17, said the senior defense official.

That's hard to fathom.

Boeing executives informed congressional staff during a meeting held in late September that the cost of a refurbished CH-47D would be in the $12 million to $14 million range, according to a person knowledgeable about the discussion but not authorized to be identified as the source of the information.

That would make an overhauled Chinook $4 million to $6 million less than what the department is currently paying for Mi-17s, according to figures compiled by the Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell, the Pentagon office that fills urgent requests for equipment from battlefield commanders.

Boeing spokesman Andrew Lee referred questions about Chinook costs to the Defense Department.

The figures also show the average cost of each new Mi-17 has increased with each successive order — from $16.4 million to $18.2 million. The Pentagon has assured Congress that the prices were ""fair and reasonable,"" and in line with what other countries have paid.

But an internal Defense Contract Audit Agency document shows that the department could not conduct a comprehensive cost comparison because Rosoboronexport wouldn't allow U.S. auditors to look at its books.

Army negotiators omitted a provision standard in government contracts that permits pricing reviews. In examining the contract, the audit agency noted that Rosoboronexport ""is arguably an agent or instrumentality of a foreign government and is therefore exempt from most cost accounting standards.""

Rosoboronexport's director general, Anatoly Isaykin, said in statement late last month that his agency was ""completely transparent"" in negotiating Mi-17 prices with the U.S. He provided no details on costs or any examples of transparency.

""In our opinion, this contract is most acceptable to the U.S. Department of Defense in terms of quality/price ratio,"" Isaykin said.

The roots of Rosoboronexport's involvement reach back to 2010 when the U.S. and Russia were engaged in high-stakes diplomacy aimed at fulfilling Obama's goal to reset relations between the two former Cold War foes.

Dmitry Medvedev was Russia's president, not Vladimir Putin, and the talks resulted in agreements to expand cooperation on global security issues and strengthen economic ties.

Among the breakthroughs: The U.S. terminated penalties against Rosoboronexport that the Bush White House had imposed in 2006 after the State Department determined the export agency had provided Iran and Syria sensitive military technology. The sanctions had barred the U.S. government from entering into any contracts with Rosoboronexport. Russia agreed to support a U.N. resolution to punish Iran over its nuclear program.

Headquartered in Moscow, Rosoboronexport is the only Russian agency authorized to export and import military hardware. The agency is controlled in turn by Russian Technologies, a state holding company that includes the country's top arms manufacturers. The chief executive of Russian Technologies is Sergei Chemezov, a longtime confidant of Putin, who returned to the Russian presidency last year.

U.S. officials long have known corruption in Russia's defense industry is widespread.

William Burns, then the U.S. ambassador to Russia, wrote in a 2007 classified cable later published by the Wikileaks website that ""it is an open secret that the Russian defense industry is an important trough at which senior officials feed, and weapons sales continue to enrich many.""

Nothing has changed, but figuring out who is personally profiting is nearly impossible, said Russia expert Clifford Gaddy.

Only a small circle of investigators close to the Kremlin know who is involved in various schemes.

""Since the information they have is one of the most powerful instruments Putin has to control the individuals who run Russia on a day-to-day basis, they protect that information,"" said Gaddy, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and co-author of ""Mr. Putin: Operative in the Kremlin.""

With the penalties lifted against Rosoboronexport, Russia's ministry of foreign affairs wasted little time informing U.S. officials that new Mi-17s could be purchased only through the arms export agency because the helicopters were military gear intended for another country's armed forces.

After lengthy deliberations, the U.S. agreed. Pentagon officials no longer would permit third parties to acquire Mi-17s. They would deal with Rosoboronexport directly.

Last month, the Pentagon changed its mind. After re-evaluating, officials decided to cut 15 copters out of the 78 they had planned to buy from Moscow. Isaykin, Rosoboronexport's director general, said the decision won't hurt the export agency's bottom line.

""Rosoboronexport's order book is sufficient to ensure the steady utilization of Russian defense industrial complex's production capacities, especially in the helicopter sector, for the next three-four years,"" he said.

The move was a bittersweet victory for the program's opponents.

""There was no redeeming value, no redeeming feature to this sale,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. ""An inferior product bought with American taxpayer money from a Russian export agency that was unconscionably selling to Assad. If you made it up, no one would believe it.""

It's because people can be invariably counted on to do horrific things, including enslaving other human beings or handcuffing children to work stations for 12 hours a day. But what's going on in the job market now is far less overt, far more subtle:

Companies don’t like to talk about it, but some job seekers, lawyers, researchers and people who help the unemployed say age discrimination in hiring exists. The Age Discrimination and Employment Act protects workers 40 and older, and forbids treating a job applicant or employee less favorably because of his or her age. But proving age discrimination is difficult, said Robert Canino, an attorney for the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in Dallas. A U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2009 raised the burden of proof in age discrimination lawsuits. Now, a person must show that age was the determining factor leading to an employer’s action, not just a contributing factor. Still, age discrimination complaints related to hiring, firing and promotions increased 45 percent in the last 15 years, according to the EEOC. “What we do know from talking to people is that hiring discrimination is really rampant out there,” said Laurie McCann, a senior attorney for AARP.

This is rarely policy per se, it's probably not even done consciously in many cases. It happens when the 20-year-old assistant manager at the fast food joint doesn't quite know what to make of the 45-year-old candidate applying for the advertised cashier job. It happens when the 31-year-old software engineer feels irrational dislike for the 55-year-old veteran standing in the reception room awaiting an interview. It happens when a company is buried in resumes after posting a job, and is looking desperately for any reason to reduce their workload to something manageable. Your degrees, certifications, or experience may help you survive those initial cuts. But there may come a point when your file comes up in front of a hiring manager staffing a team, they see your photo or DoB, and hand the file back to the recruiter saying ""Get rid of this guy."" These are all examples of potential age discrimination.

There are three angles of attack on this. The first is to educate job screeners on both ethics and the law. Not only is age discrimination illegal, it's utterly counterproductive. I was in on plenty of hiring decisions in the past when I lived in Florida. Time after time, retirees, folks in their 60s, 70s, even their 80s, on Social Security and Medicare, were as good of a gamble as any other demographic. Age discrimination can also kill. I know of at least two middle-aged, talented, degreed, experienced people who were laid off and could not find work, who eventually died as a result of easily treated medical conditions. They didn't even know they had those problems, they hadn't been able to afford a doctor in years.

While we're on this topic, it does no good when close friends and family shame the unemployed. A minor imperfection is not open season to blame the person who got laid off and can't find work. I remember one case where the reason a person could not find a job—and ultimately died—somehow became their failure to have their priorities straight. That postmortem diagnosis was hung on the flimsiest evidence: The deceased had purportedly once said they wanted to get some used ski boots during the period they were looking for work. They never got any boots, they just mentioned one time to one friend they saw some advertised online.

What Was He Doing Wasting Time Looking At Ski Boots On Craigslist! Aha! That Explains Everything!

The second option is to use existing laws to file a complaint. Even in Texas of all places, where I live in near poverty thanks to underemployment and the inability to find a job that pays a living wage, we have the Texas Workforce Commission. Most states have similar orgs. In addition there is the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. Complaints like this don't always get filed away. They can generate investigations and lead to mediation or arbitration, where the employer has to appear, turn over internal documents, and answer questions under oath. I'm told this can be damn satisfying. Especially when the employer, who previously clammed up and wouldn't answer anything, sits there sputtering under repeated questioning, unable to back up any rationale for why that person was not hired beyond ""We just didn't think he was right for this job ... that we hired three dozen other people for who all happened to be under the age of 35.""

When you are unemployed or underemployed, your friends and family will often tell you to ""keep trying, don't give up."" The same applies to going after an employer who may have violated your rights. Keep trying, don't give up. It may not help you get that job (although it might, or it might help you win a judgement) but one complaint can mean everyone who comes along after you will have a fairer shot. Sooner or later, that person might even be you. Plus, you have no way to know how many complaints have been filed against that same company, or one person acting on that company's behalf. You could be the first or the hundredth, the latter looks terrible to investigators. It looks terrible to the company. If there is a bad apple, this how they are identified and removed.

Lastly, there are private practice lawyers who specialize in discrimination suits. Call a bunch of them. Share your experience on social media, see if there is someone who is interested in pursuing it for you, or others who have experienced it at that same employer. You would be amazed how fast those dominoes can start to tumble, indeed, how fast a company will throw it's own personnel under the bus, as the number of complaints and the evidence grows.

A few points to keep in mind:

Senior management for most companies is looking for the most qualified people they can get for the pay offered, they don't usually give a shit how old you are. This kind of thing usually happens at the one-to-one, mid-management level far below them.

It is rare for someone to be genuinely dropped from consideration because they are ""overqualified."" If it does happens to you or you see it happen to others, I've been told by experts it might well be an instance of discrimination.

There are not many jobs where being under age 40 is legally justified. Writing code, driving a delivery truck, making sandwiches, talking to customers on the phone, etc., are not generally among them.

It's reasonable that the company's management has to be aware a problem really exists if they are going to address it. We have to be willing to step up and use the tools that those before us fought for and in some cases even died for. And in the rare case where it is systemic, if age discrimination or any kind of discrimination really can be shown to be policy or culture, spoken or unspoken, the only way we stop it is to expose it."

Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) said he would insist on a 60-vote threshold, which has happened just twice before with Cabinet nominees. Inhofe denied that he was “anxious to try to string this out” but said it was important for Hagel to face that higher threshold given the opposition.

“I’m entitled to it, and I’m sure there are many Republicans who want a 60-vote margin,” he said. “I feel a responsibility because of all the things we’ve been talking about to do what I can to see that Chuck Hagel is not confirmed as secretary of Defense.”

But in a closed-door meeting Monday night, Sen. John McCain of Arizona -- who was the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee until Inhofe replaced him -- warned the panel’s other Republicans against any delaying tactics. McCain said he has not decided whether he will vote for or against Hagel, a Republican and a former senator from Nebraska who was once a close friend and supporter of McCain.

“Someday, we will have a Republican president. Someday, we may even have a majority in the United States Senate,” McCain told reporters afterward. “It sets, I think, a wrong precedent.”

Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, announced Monday that he would call a vote on Hagel’s nomination Tuesday afternoon, hours before President Obama’s State of the Union address. He rejected the requests of Republicans, including Inhofe, for further delays. He said Hagel’s disclosures of financial and other information “far exceed the standard practices.”

Barring a surprise defection among the majority Democrats, Hagel should have the votes on the committee to move forward. But final confirmation could be delayed by his GOP opponents.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said he would place a hold on Hagel’s nomination unless the White House answered further questions about the raid on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Libya on Sept. 11 that left four Americans dead. Graham said he would send the White House another letter Tuesday seeking specific details about President Obama’s actions after learning of the attack and would tie Hagel’s nomination to Obama’s response.

The situation has revealed a divide between Republicans who want to preserve Senate traditions and those who want to use the situation to advance their political agendas.

According to a Senate historian, counting how many Cabinet nominees have been filibustered is difficult because the opposition can take many forms.

Advertisement

But only twice has a Cabinet appointee faced a cloture vote in the Senate, or a 60-vote requirement to proceed to a final confirmation vote. Both were Republican appointments -- C. William Verity Jr. by President Reagan to be Commerce secretary and Dirk Kempthorne by President George W. Bush to be Interior secretary. Both were eventually easily confirmed.

Graham said Democrats also successfully blocked the nomination of John R. Bolton to be ambassador to the United Nations during the George W. Bush administration. The U.N. post is not formally part of the Cabinet but is considered a Cabinet-level position.

“This is the way the system works around here,” Graham said, calling it his only leverage “against a White House who just basically won’t respond to anything.”

“My Democratic colleagues had no problem holding Bush’s feet to the fire in Iraq, and they should, quite frankly. But you got to play the game the same way.”

Advertisement

Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, another senior Republican, said he too had concerns about Hagel and the raid in Libya. He said some in his party are worried that Obama “is appointing second-tier yes people.”

“In the case of Sen. Hagel, a lot of them feel like he’s being appointed because he’ll cut back on the military at a time we need to be strong,” Hatch said.

But he said he would not filibuster the nomination.

“I haven’t been an enthusiastic filibusterer of Cabinet appointments ever. So I start out with the idea that he shouldn’t be filibustered,” Hatch said.

During the closed GOP meeting, McCain also sought to prevent a symbolic protest by some Republicans on the Armed Services Committee who were considering walking out when the vote was called.

A Republican aide said he believed that was now unlikely and said those who supported further delaying tactics were in the minority.

“There was limited support in the room for moving forward with the filibuster,” said to the aide, who requested anonymity to speak candidly. But he added: “Everybody was not there, and it only takes one member” to place a hold.

http://news.yahoo.com/democrats-ditch-historic-u-senate-rule-blamed-gridlock-153435717--sector.html,,[],Democrats ditch historic U.S. Senate rule blamed for gridlock,"By Thomas Ferraro and Richard Cowan WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate, in a historic and bitterly fought rule change, stripped Republicans on Thursday of their ability to block President Barack Obama's judicial and executive branch nominees. The action fundamentally altered the way Congress' upper chamber has worked since the mid-19th century by making it impossible for a minority party, on its own, to block presidential appointments, except those to the U.S. Supreme Court. The change in the so-called ""filibuster"" rule does not apply to legislation, which can still be held up by a handful of senators. The now-defunct rule, a symbol of Washington gridlock, has survived dozens of attacks over the years largely because both major political parties like to use it. The action will undoubtedly come back to haunt Democrats the next time they lose the Senate and the White House simultaneously. Getting rid of it was considered so momentous and divisive that it was dubbed the ""nuclear option"" in the Senate. On a nearly party-line vote of 52-48, the Senate reduced from 60 to 51 the number of votes needed to end procedural roadblocks. Obama, a former senator, praised the action, calling the filibuster ""a reckless and relentless tool to grind all business to a halt."" The change will speed up the confirmation of Obama appointments to the courts as well as to cabinet and regulatory agencies. One beneficiary is likely to be Representative Mel Watt, whose nomination to take over the agency that regulates mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was being blocked by Republicans. But the immediate spark was Democratic frustration at Republican use of the filibuster to block Obama's appointments to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, considered the nation's second most important court after the U.S. Supreme Court. The Washington-based appeals court handles crucial disputes over the powers of the presidency and Congress, along with regulatory matters involving air and water pollution, banks, securities trading, telecommunications and labor relations. It has also been a feeder to the Supreme Court, with four of the current justices being former D.C. Circuit judges. NEW RULE USED QUICKLY Democrats quickly used the new rule by ending a Republican filibuster against one of those court nominees, Patricia Millett, on a vote of 55-43. A vote to confirm her nomination will be held later. Millett is a Harvard-trained lawyer who worked in the administration of both Democratic President Bill Clinton and Republican President George W. Bush. The American Bar Association gave her its top rating for the D.C. Circuit post. As is often the case with stalled nominations, Republicans did not contend that Millet lacked qualifications. They simply do not want to give Obama more appointments to the important court, which they argue is underworked anyway. For nearly two years, Republicans held up confirmation of Richard Cordray as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau because they objected to the bureau's powers, not to Cordray, who has since been confirmed. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, led the charge on the rules change, accusing Republicans of record obstructionism and saying the American public is right to believe that ""Congress is broken."" Reid said that of the 168 filibusters against presidential nominees in U.S. history, half were held against Obama's picks. ""It's time to change,"" Reid said. Republican Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa fired back, ""This is a naked power grab."" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell insisted that there was no reason for a rule change, saying Republicans had confirmed the vast majority of Obama's judicial nominees. McConnell also accused Democrats of taking the action merely to divert attention from the botched launch of Obama's healthcare law, known as Obamacare. But with Congress's approval rating in single digits and no indication Republicans will compromise with Obama on much of anything, Reid decided to pull the trigger. Reid assumes that voters, who polls show are disgusted with a largely ""do-nothing"" Congress, won't be upset by a rule change to confirm stalled nominees, Democratic aides said. Reid also figured that if he did not change the rules, that increasingly anti-compromise Republicans would change them when they win control of the Senate, which could happen in next year's election, the aides said. Stephen Hess, a congressional analyst at The Brookings Institution, said, ""There's a good reason why it's called 'the nuclear option.' This does change the system."" ""And whether it's good or bad depends on from whence you view it and at what moment,"" Hess said. ""It is good for Democrats on the 21st of November, 2013. And it may not be good (for Democrats) if the landscape changes in the mid-term election"" next year and Republicans take control of the Senate. Asked whether the Democrats' move could worsen relations with Republicans and make it more difficult to pass legislation, Hess said ""I don't know that relations this bad can get an awful lot worse.""

Fwd.us told The Huffington Post that a second funder also had decided to withdraw. Several media outlets have reported that David Sacks, founder of the business networking site Yammer and a former colleague of Musk's, had dropped off the list of the group's supporters.

Zuckerberg started Fwd.us to press for comprehensive immigration reform. But the group has been heavily criticized by some immigration reform supporters in recent weeks for its television ad campaign praising lawmakers for backing projects like the Keystone XL pipeline and drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Fwd.us has argued that the ads were meant to give home district support to lawmakers backing immigration reform.

In a statement to AllThingsD on Friday, Musk, the founder of the electric carmaker Tesla Motors, made clear he was unhappy with the pro-oil ads.

“I agreed to support Fwd.us because there is a genuine need to reform immigration,"" Musk said. ""However, this should not be done at the expense of other important causes. I have spent a lot of time fighting far larger lobbying organizations in D.C. and believe that the right way to win on a cause is to argue the merits of that cause. This statement may surprise some people, but my experience is that most (not all) politicians and their staffs want to do the right thing and eventually do.”

Fwd.us retains the backing of other Silicon Valley heavyweights, including Bill Gates.

The withdrawal of Musk and Sacks comes just days after a coalition of progressive groups announced that they were temporarily pulling all their ads from Facebook in protest.

“Leaders in the technology community have every right to talk about how immigration reform will benefit their businesses,"" former Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) said in a statement on Tuesday. ""But instead, Fwd.us has chosen a strategy that’s condescending to voters and counterproductive to the cause of reform.""

The seven-figure Fwd.us ad campaign ran for a week in seven states, but it is no longer on the air.

Fwd.us spokeswoman Kate Hansen told HuffPost, ""We recognize that not everyone will always agree with or be pleased by our strategy -- and we're grateful for the continued support of our dedicated founders and major contributors. Fwd.us remains totally committed to supporting a bipartisan policy agenda that will boost the knowledge economy, including comprehensive immigration reform.""

As The Huffington Post reported in February, Musk is a significant -- but not top-tier -- donor to Democrats. He also contributes to Republicans."

As Obama heads to Minneapolis on Monday to talk about the fight against gun violence, Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano will travel to San Diego and El Paso, Texas, to inspect border security operations at the Southwest border, an aide said Sunday.

On Monday and Tuesday, she’ll meet with state and local officials to talk about how to secure the border without hindering legal travel and trade.

Border security threatens to become a point of contention in the immigration debate. Some members of Congress, including key Republicans, want the government to certify that the border is fully secure before opening a path to citizenship for people currently in the country illegally.

After her two-day trip, Napolitano will join White House policy director Cecilia Munoz to meet with law enforcement officials from around the country to talk about the president’s immigration proposal, which includes a clear pathway to citizenship.

Their emphasis is on the border measures the federal government has already undertaken, including increasing the number of agents on the border to more than 21,000 -- double those assigned in 2004.

The administration reports that fewer people try to cross the border illegally every year now, which they attribute to increased surveillance. Apprehensions totaled about 365,000 in 2012, a 50% decrease since 2008, according to government figures.

On Tuesday, Obama plans to hold White House meetings with labor and progressive leaders and several chief executives to promote his plan.

His sales pitch in those discussions is economic growth and competitiveness, an aide said Sunday.

http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/05/14/feds-recommend-lower-drunken-driving-threshold/,2013-05-14 00:00:00,[],One drink DUI? Feds want lower threshold for drunk driving,"A federal agency is proposing that states lower the threshold for drunken driving to the point where a woman could be charged for driving after one drink and a man after two in a move officials say would save thousands of lives.

The National Transportation Safety Board recommended that all states drop the blood-alcohol level at which motorists can be charged with driving drunk to .05, down from the current rate of .08 that all 50 states impose. The threshold is a matter of state law, but the federal government can pressure states to meet its standard by threatening to withhold highway funding.

[pullquote]

""Our goal is to get to zero deaths because each alcohol-impaired death is preventable,"" NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman said. ""Alcohol-impaired deaths are not accidents, they are crimes. They can and should be prevented. The tools exist. What is needed is the will.""

More than 100 countries have adopted the .05 alcohol content standard or lower, according to an NTSB report. In Europe, drunken driving deaths were cut by more than half a decade after the stricter standard was implemented.

Studies show a woman weighing less than 120 pounds can reach .05 after just one drink, while a man weighing up to 160 pounds reaches .05 after two drinks.

New approaches are needed to combat drunken driving, which claims the lives of more than a third of the 30,000 people killed each year on U.S highways — a level of carnage that that has remained stubbornly consistent for the past decade and a half, the board said.

""Our goal is to get to zero deaths because each alcohol-impaired death is preventable,"" NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman said. ""Alcohol-impaired deaths are not accidents, they are crimes. They can and should be prevented. The tools exist. What is needed is the will.""

But the recommendation to lowering the alcohol content threshold to .05 is likely to meet strong resistance from states, said Jonathan Adkins, an official with the Governors Highway Safety Association, which represents state highway safety offices.

""It was very difficult to get .08 in most states so lowering it again won't be popular,"" Adkins said. ""The focus in the states is on high (blood alcohol content) offenders as well as repeat offenders. We expect industry will also be very vocal about keeping the limit at .08.""

The lower alcohol content threshold was one of nearly 20 recommendations aimed at reducing drunken driving made by the board, including that states adopt measures to ensure more widespread use of use of alcohol ignition interlock devices. Those require a driver to breathe into a tube, much like the breathalyzers police ask suspected drunken drivers to use.

The board has previously recommended states require all convicted drunken drivers install the interlock devices in their vehicles as a condition to resume driving. Currently, 17 states and two California counties require all convicted drivers use the devices.

However, only about a quarter of drivers ordered to use the devices actually end up doing so, NTSB said. Drivers use a variety of ways to evade using the devices, including claiming they won't drive at all or don't own a vehicle and therefore don't need the devices, staff said.

The board recommended the National Highway Safety Administration, which makes safety grants to states, develop a program to encourage states to ensure all convicted drivers actually use the devices. The board also recommended that all suspected drunken drivers whose licenses are confiscated by police be required to install interlocks as a condition of getting their licenses reinstated even though they haven't yet been convicted of a crime.

Courts usually require drivers to pay for the devices, which cost about $50 to $100 to buy plus a $50 a month fee to operate, staff said.

The board has previously called on the safety administration and the auto industry to step up their research into technology for use in all vehicles that can detect whether a driver has elevated blood alcohol without the driver breathing into a tube or taking any other action. Drivers with elevated levels would be unable to start their cars.

But the technology is still years away.

Studies show more than 4 million people a year in the U.S. drive while intoxicated, but about half of the intoxicated drivers stopped by police escape detection, the NTSB report said. The board made several recommendations aimed at increasing both the visibility and effectiveness of police enforcement, including expanded use of passive alcohol devices. The devices are often contained in real flash lights or shaped to look like a cellphone that officers wear on their shirt pockets or belts. If an officer points the flashlight at a driver or the cellphone-like device comes in close proximity to an intoxicated driver, the devices will alert police who may not have any other reason to suspected drunken driving.

The use of the devices currently is very limited, the report said.

Dramatic progress was made in the 1980s through the mid-1990s after the minimum drinking age was raised to 21 and the legally-allowable maximum level of drivers' blood alcohol content was lowered to .08, the report said. Today, drunken driving claims about 10,000 lives a year, down from over 18,000 in 1982. At that time, alcohol-related fatalities accounted for about 40 percent of highway deaths.

Mr. Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who shot Mr. Martin, was acquitted of all charges by a jury late Saturday.

The federal inquiry, which was started shortly after the shooting last year but had been delayed while the state criminal trial in Florida was under way, was being restarted after civil rights leaders called on the Justice Department to re-examine the case. The leaders said Sunday that they remained convinced that the shooting had a racial element. Mr. Martin, 17, was black.

“There is a pattern of George Zimmerman making dozens of calls to 911 over several years, frequently about young men of color,” Benjamin T. Jealous, the president of the N.A.A.C.P., said in an interview on Sunday. Mr. Zimmerman and his family have defended the shooting as an act of self-defense."

House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) said bureau Director Richard Cordray was not legally appointed to the position and therefore the panel cannot accept his testimony.

It was the latest salvo in a long-running battle by top Republicans against the bureau, which was created in 2010.

Republicans argue the bureau is too powerful and poses a threat to the health of banks and the rights of consumers. But the White House, backed by consumer advocates, said it is needed to prevent a repeat of the subprime mortgage meltdown and to keep financial institutions from taking advantage of average Americans.

President Obama installed Cordray in the position in early 2012 using a controversial recess appointment. A federal court has invalidated three other recess appointments Obama made on the same day, calling into question Cordray’s future.

“Absent contrary guidance from the United States Supreme Court, you do not meet the statutory requirements of a validly serving director of the CFPB, and cannot be recognized as such,” Hensarling wrote to Cordray on Monday.

Hensarling, who took over as committee chairman in January, has been an outspoken critic of the bureau. The new agency was the centerpiece of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, which Hensarling and every other House Republican opposed.

Nearly all Senate Republicans also opposed the law, and they banded together to block the confirmation of any nominee to head the bureau unless changes were made to reduce its power.

House Republicans forced the Democratic-controlled Senate to limit the length of its recesses in hopes of preventing Obama from making a recess appointment.

But in January 2012, Obama appointed Cordray as well as three members to the National Labor Relations Board, positions Senate Republicans also were blocking. Obama argued the Senate was not really in session at the time and was holding pro-forma sessions simply to prevent him from making recess appointments.

Advertisement

A year later, a panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that Obama’s NLRB recess appointments were invalid. The NLRB is appealing the decision to the Supreme Court.

The panel did not address Cordray’s appointment, but opponents of the agency have said the ruling calls into question its validity as well.

“The court’s unanimous ruling makes it clear that there is no legally appointed director of the CFPB at this time,” Hensarling said. “By law, the committee can receive this testimony only from a director who is appointed in accordance with the Constitution and the Dodd-Frank Act, which created the bureau.”

Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), the top Democrat on the committee, said Cordray should be allowed to testify. A hearing has not been scheduled but had been expected in coming weeks.

“Mr. Hensarling’s own letter concedes that no court has addressed the legitimacy of the president’s appointment of Richard Cordray to be the director of the CFPB,” she said. “I suggest that Chairman Hensarling allow Director Cordray to appear before the committee to deliver his report as required by law.”

Moira Vahey, a spokeswoman for the bureau, also said the court ruling did not address Cordray’s appointment and “it has no direct effect on the bureau.”

Advertisement

“The bureau continues its essential work of protecting American consumers,” she said.

Interestingly, one of the main Republican complaints about the bureau is that Congress does not have enough oversight over its activities.

Advertisement

The bureau gets its funding directly from the Federal Reserve, not through the congressional appropriations process. In light of the court ruling, Hensarling also has questions whether Cordray has the authority to request the funding.

Hensarling said that his committee “intends to continue to conduct rigorous oversight of the CFPB’s activities” and will accept testimony from other bureau officials. He noted the committee on Monday called two bureau officials to testify about mortgage rules at a May hearing.

Oh noes, not again.

I'm still not quite able to parse out what it is, exactly, that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and president of the United States Barack Obama have been doing that has much of the hard-right dousing themselves in gasoline and lighting themselves on fire. In the wake of a particularly devastating hurricane in Christie's state, they met together? More than once, even? Is that it? Or is it that Christie did not personally punch the president on first meeting him, or is it the even more profound insult of Christie agreeing that people in his state affected by the storm really could use some damn help, even if it came from—gasp—the federal gubbermint? I don't know. I don't know because, and this is the key point, I am not freaking insane.

Rapidly devolving radio host Rush Limbaugh, however, most certainly is, and so the primitive talking land-fish is all over this ""Christie and Obama were in the same place at the same time and this is an abomination unto Ayn Rand"" or-whatever-the-hell-he's-talking-about story:



There isn't any bipartisanship here. Obama has money. Governor Christie wants the money, Governor Christie needs the money, so the people will be helped. So Christie praises Obama. It's a master-servant relationship. That's exactly the kind of bipartisanship that the Drive-By Media wants. Master-servant. That's ""bipartisan"" That's what's going on here. (interruption) Master-SERVANT. Master-STAFF. Don't take it any further than that, Snerdley. I'm not going on, going there. I'm just telling you. Obama's got the money; Christie needs the money. ""Obama wants to walk the beach; that's what we're gonna do. Obama wants a photo-op; it's what we're gonna do.""

It's more than little funny to see the usual Washington wags bemoan the lack of ""bipartisanship"" and ""working together"" and all those nice things while conspicuously dodging awareness of just how much even the vague perception of ""working together"" will result in full-on revolt from the nutcases of the Republican base (or, in this case, the grand and glorious nutcase leaders). Really, having a president and governor tour disaster-stricken areas together is not generally considered a difficult bipartisan lift, much less an act of ideological treason.

Christie is for the most part a loyal conservative foot soldier. He hates the poors, he hates the unions, he does all the nice citizen-screwing things that are so popular among the party these days. But he hosted the president when a disaster struck the state, and that's just not done. At least not these days. It smacks too much of the premise that the government might really have an obligation to help people, or provides too much acknowledgement of the government existing and doing things at all. That thought puts a whole hurricane's worth of sand down the movement's collective pants, and they've not been shy in letting Christie know it.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)

Vice President Joe Biden closed out a mental health conference at the White House Monday afternoon with a message of support to those affected by mental illness.

""Let's use this moment to send a message to tens of millions of Americans, especially the young people and parents of young people all over this country,"" Biden said during remarks delivered in the White House's South Court Auditorium. ""There's nothing, nothing to be ashamed of if you're struggling with mental issues. ... It's OK to talk about it, it's OK to ask for help, it's OK to acknowledge that it's frightening.""

Monday's conference at the White House, which featured remarks from President Barack Obama, two panel discussions with mental health experts and advocates, government officials and celebrity guests, was designed to help reduce the stigma surrounding mental illness. It kicked off the president's plan to hold a national conversation about gun violence following the deadly Dec. 14 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

Obama's effort to pressure Congress to pass gun reform measures stalled in mid-April when the Democratic-controlled Senate failed to support an expansion of background checks on gun purchases.

The president announced Monday that the Department of Veterans Affairs will direct 151 of its health care centers to conduct mental health summits July 1 through Sept. 15. The summits, which will include partnerships with local community organizations, will focus on support for veterans and their families, and increase awareness about available mental health programs.

And Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced a new website, mentalhealth.gov, which she described as a ""one-stop shop"" for mental health support and a place where visitors can read success stories from individuals with mental illness.

Biden was introduced Monday by actor Bradley Cooper, who played a character with bipolar disorder in ""Silver Linings Playbook."" Cooper said he first spoke with Biden, who reached out to him in February about mental illness stigmas. ""I want to help. I want to do something about it. I want to be part of the solution,"" Cooper said. He added that ""helping people understand that they're not alone ... that treatment works"" is a way to help reduce the stigma.

Story continues

Obama's opening remarks Monday morning included his disbelief about the number of ""very personal"" medical ads shown on television while mental health remains a taboo subject.

""You see commercials on TV about a whole array of physical health issues—some of them very personal,"" Obama said, drawing laughter. ""And yet, we whisper about mental health issues and avoid asking too many questions. ... There should be no shame in discussing or seeking help for treatable illnesses that affect too many people that we love. We've got to get rid of that embarrassment. We've got to get rid of that stigma. Too many Americans who struggle with mental health illnesses are still suffering in silence rather than seeking help.""

Obama said that each year ""1 in 5 adults experience mental illness"" and noted that he and first lady Michelle Obama know people who have battled severe depression.

""Struggling with a mental illness or caring for someone who does can be isolating,"" Obama said.

The conference included a panel on negative attitudes toward mental illness moderated by Sebelius and a panel on mental health outreach moderated by Education Secretary Arne Duncan, which included a representative from MTV and other messaging experts.

Actress Glenn Close participated in the first panel. Close co-founded a nonprofit organization dedicated to ending the stigma associated with mental illness after observing how it affected her sister and son.

She said she is lucky her sister is alive. She ""fell through the cracks of our family,"" Close said.

Moderator Sebelius noted the stigmas in society at large that remain regarding mental illness.

""Mental health needs to be an issue we can talk about openly and freely without the fear of being judged or penalized,"" Sebelius said, noting that those suffering from mental illness continue to be outcast by society.

Other participants included former Republican Sen. Gordon Smith of Oregon, whose son committed suicide. Smith currently serves as president and CEO of the National Association of Broadcasters, which is developing a national campaign to increase public awareness of mental health. Audience members who spoke at Monday's first panel included former Democratic Rep. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island, who has bipolar disorder, and Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan."

As lawmakers in Washington debate an immigration overhaul that could include a pathway to legal status or citizenship for millions of unauthorized immigrants, the figures from the nonpartisan Pew Center are regarded by many demographers as the most reliable estimates of the number of people who might be eligible for those programs.

The new estimates, which are based on the most recent census data and other official statistics, show that the population of immigrants here illegally did not decline significantly from 2009 to 2012, despite record numbers of about 400,000 deportations each year and stepped-up border enforcement by the Obama administration as well as laws to crack down on illegal immigration in states like Alabama, Arizona and Georgia.

Recent figures, including reports from the Border Patrol of illegal crossings at the southwest border, suggest that the numbers began to grow again last year. But Pew researchers said the increases in the 2012 census data — the latest available — were too small for them to conclusively confirm the recent rise."

In the backyard of his remote Southern California home, Bernie Jones is etching an unconventional blueprint: a construction plan to build his underground survival shelter. It won't be the typical, cramped Cold War-era bunker. It will hold 20 people.

Part of a small but vocal group of survivalists in Menifee, some 80 miles east of Los Angeles, Jones, 46, has pushed for the right to build a bunker on his 1-acre property for nearly a year. He wants to be ready for anything, be it natural disaster or a nuclear attack.

""The world is taking a change,"" he says. ""I want to be prepared. I want my family to survive.""

Residents of the small city once known for its farming and mining can begin applying for permits to build their subterranean housing this month after the City Council passed a hotly contested ordinance allowing the practice.

Americans have been building underground bunkers for decades, their interest in such shelters waxing and waning with current events. Many dug backyard fallout shelters during the Cold War, fearing a nuclear war.

This next generation of bunkers comes as many survivalists face heightened concerns of a terrorist attack, economic meltdown and for some, even solar flares or meteor showers.

""The bunker is a type of security blanket,"" says Stephen O'Leary, an expert in apocalyptic and end-of-the-world theories at the University of Southern California. ""They are concerned with what's happening in the world on a massive scale.""

The move to allow below-ground bunkers has created waves among city officials who are concerned with earthquake faults in the area, safety of police and first responders answering emergency calls and the potential for owners to hide criminal activity, such as drug manufacturing.

""Most people are going to use their bunkers for good reason, but you do have some sick people out there,"" Deputy Mayor Wallace Edgerton says. ""Children have been held in bunkers.""

Last February, a 5-year-old boy was held hostage for six days in an Alabama underground bunker, which was rigged with explosive devices.

City Councilman Tom Fuhrman calls the ordinance a victory for property rights, not for those looking to break the law. ""Criminal activity isn't going to be stopped by not allowing people to build bunkers,"" Fuhrman says. ""A criminal will find a place to commit crime.""

There are signs survival bunkers are making a comeback throughout the country.

Ronald Hubbard, who runs Atlas Survival Shelters near Los Angeles, ships his luxury bunkers out of state. Unlike Cold War-era shelters, he builds ones that are half the length of a basketball court and have a master bedroom, dining nook and a couch to watch a 47-inch flat screen TV.

Hubbard says his phones rang nonstop last December as people attempted to prepare for the end of the world that never came. A 5,125-year cycle in the Mayan calendar passed by, sans disaster.

The Perseid meteors soaring through the sky last month had customers calling him constantly, looking for a way to stay safe in case one hit Earth — even though it's an annual celestial event. He insists his customers are practical people — not radical doomsday preppers.

""I'm not fear mongering,"" Hubbard said, standing beside a $65,000 shelter in his warehouse. ""Why do we buy insurance? Just in case.""

The Vivos shelter networks in Indiana and Kansas offer the equivalent of doomsday timeshares in underground communities in the event of the apocalypse. The network aims to protect its inhabitants for up to a year from myriad catastrophes, including a nuclear disaster.

Preppers — who dedicate their time to ensuring they are ready for a host of deadly scenarios — even have their own reality TV show.

People should spend time preparing for likely disasters instead of Armageddon, said Steve Davis, president of emergency management company All Hands Consulting.

""In California, you have earthquakes. On the East Coast, you have winter storms,"" Davis says. ""People should be focusing on basic preparedness.""

Jones, who has six children and seven grandchildren, says he simply wants to protect his loved ones. The contractor has already stocked his home with medical kits and enough food for his family to survive for about three months should a disaster strike.

He keeps a bag in his truck at all times, packed with five days' worth of food and water, a raincoat, a thermal and ""the world's smallest sleeping bag.""

""It's all part of being ready for whatever happens,"" Jones says."

Portsmouth City Council has approved and finalised a loan to the Pompey Supporters' Trust (PST) which is looking to buy the stricken club.

The Trust has been given a £1.45m bridging loan by the council which it will pay back at a rate of 5%.

The loan will enable the Trust, along with property developer Stuart Robinson, to buy Fratton Park.

Administrators of the club must first release former owner Portpin's hold on the club through the High Court.

Conditions of PST council loan That the club owned and operated by the trust is the same club that was relegated and has membership of the relevant football league

That the club and its assets are bought for £7.68m, which includes provision for the full and final settlement of the football creditors

That the club owned and operated by the trust obtains all rights to the £11.7m of parachute payments

That the trust obtains a legal charge over Fratton Park

That no other legal charges are made against the income or assets of the club, beyond those set out in the trust's business plan, without the prior consent of the council

That the council receives an assignment of parachute payments to repay the loan or that an investor guarantee is provided by the trust for the full £1.45m

That a subscription agreement for the trust's Fan Share Scheme, High Net Worth Investors and Associate Director Scheme is in place, which has been approved by the city solicitor and does not allow money to be taken out of the club until the council has been repaid

That proof of funds from the three schemes has been demonstrated

That a suitably skilled and experienced chief executive is appointed by the trust

The decision to hand over the money was taken at an emergency meeting on Wednesday despite a last-minute appeal by Labour and Conservative leaders to council cabinet to delay the decision.

Cllr Gerald Vernon Jackson said a decision had to be taken so administrators could file papers with the courts.

""Without the money, the city would have been left with no professional football team and officers say the risk to council tax payers is now less than when the entire council voted to help out last August, "" said Jackson.

""The council has first call on the parachute payments from the league in August this year when the loan has to be repaid,"" he said.

Portsmouth have been in administration since 17 February 2012.

The club are currently the subject of a takeover bid by the PST, but approval is conditional on the group taking control of the club's Fratton Park stadium.

Another former owner, Balram Chainrai, claims he is owed £12m and holds the stadium as security through his company Portpin via a fixed charge.

The PST has offered Chainrai £3m for the ground, but the Hong Kong businessman has so far refused to sell.

Administrators PKF are attempting to force the sale of Fratton Park at the High Court and that case will be heard by 19 April at the latest.

The Football League has warned the club must exit administration before the end of the season or face expulsion."

Overview

Laura visited a lab in Oxfordshire, where mice are being used to try to work out a cure for glue ear - a problem which affects many children.

Using animals for experiments is a big issue, causing lots of debate.

Students debate the issues surrounding animal testing.

Learning aims

Cruelty arguments

Scientific progress arguments

Ice-breaker

Open the debate by reading out some of these comments:

Main activity

Class debate

Explain that the class is going to debate the issues surrounding animal testing.

A debate is based around a suggestion or motion.

The motion is:

This house believes that animal testing should continue.

Divide the class into proposers (for the motion) and opposers (against the motion).

Students research and write down arguments which either support or oppose the motion.

A summary of arguments and a guide can be found by clicking on the links in the blue box.

Select seven students to be:

Speaker. This person chairs the debate but cannot take part or vote.

First proposer to speak

First opposer to speak

Opposer to sum up

Proposer to sum up

Two tellers to count the votes

The Speaker presents the motion.

The first proposer presents the arguments for the motion.

The first opposer presents the arguments against the motion.

One of the proposers presents their arguments for the motion.

An opposer presents their arguments against the motion.

This side to side motion continues until everyone has had their say.

An opposer sums up their group's main argument.

A proposer sums up their group's main argument.

Name one side of the classroom the 'aye' wall and the opposite side the 'no' wall.

The Speaker re-reads the motion.

Hold the debate in this order:

Students vote twice:

1. Students vote to support or oppose the motion, depending on which they thought were the most convincing and well-constructed arguments. This may not necessarily be what they believe personally. The Speaker can't vote.

They do so by going to the 'aye' or 'no' side of the classroom.

The two tellers count up the votes (bodies), on either side of the room.

The Speaker announces the result of the vote.

2. Students vote according to their beliefs. The Speaker is no longer in role and can therefore vote.

As before, the two tellers count up the votes (bodies), on either side of the room and the Speaker announces the result of the vote.

Extension activity

Students write a personal statement of their opinions. They pick the five arguments they find the most convincing and include them in a report that starts:

I support/I oppose animal testing because...

Plenary

If students had to experiment on animals themselves, how many students would still vote for animal testing?

Teachers' Background

The mouse is the most widely used animal in research labs. In the UK 1,607,000 mice underwent experiments in 2000.

More than 2.5 million live animal experiments were authorised in Great Britain in 2000. This number has halved since the 1970s.

Around the world, animals are used to test products ranging from shampoo to new cancer drugs.

British law requires that any new drug must be tested on at least two different species of live mammal. One must be a large non-rodent.

Almost every medical treatment you use has been tested on animals. Animals were also used to develop anaesthetics to prevent human pain and suffering during surgery.

""We have plenty of laws,"" said Blair Berk, a Beverly Hills attorney who has represented numerous celebrities. ""Better enforcement of the existing laws is the answer.""

The photographer was killed Tuesday evening when he was hit by a car while crossing Sepulveda Boulevard near Getty Center Drive. A California Highway Patrol officer had pulled Bieber's sports car over for a traffic stop; the photographer arrived on scene, snapped photos and was struck as he returned to his own car.

A friend of Bieber's was driving the car at the time, officials said. The pop singer was not in the vehicle.

Law enforcement sources said Wednesday that it's unlikely charges will be filed against the driver of the car that hit the photographer.

In a statement Wednesday, Bieber went on the offensive, calling on lawmakers to crack down.

""Hopefully this tragedy will finally inspire meaningful legislation and whatever other necessary steps to protect the lives and safety of celebrities, police officers, innocent public bystanders and the photographers themselves,"" he said."

Blagojevich, earlier found guilty of lying to the FBI, stammered ""yes"" even as his lawyers shouted objections, which were summarily rejected by U.S. District Judge James Zagel. The judge later allowed the characterization repeated in the government's closing argument.

And that, contends the legal team for the now imprisoned Blagojevich, is just one of a litany of errors and one-sided rulings from Zagel that undermined a robust defense and now cries out for a higher court to reverse his convictions on 18 criminal counts.

Read the full text of the Blagojevich appeal

The formal name of the government's case was ""USA v. Blagojevich,"" but if defense appeals came with their own titles, the 153-page document filed late Monday with the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals might be called ""Blagojevich vs. Zagel.""

Blagojevich was convicted of misusing his powers as governor in an array of shakedown schemes, including one to sell the U.S. Senate seat vacated by the 2008 election of Barack Obama as president. His two trials, in 2010 and 2011, were marked by running battles between Zagel and Blagojevich's lawyers over motions, rulings, evidence and even the courtroom demeanor of the attorneys and the defendant himself.

And there was no letup in the appeal, which all but flatly declares that the veteran judge might as well have been sitting at the prosecution table.

""It would take too much space to catalog each erroneous evidentiary ruling by the lower court,"" asserted the appeal, prepared by a team of lawyers led by criminal-defense specialist Leonard Goodman of Chicago.

The filing accused Zagel of preventing Blagojevich from demonstrating through testimony or evidence that he believed he was acting lawfully and in good faith. Zagel, the lawyers charged, induced Blagojevich to take the stand in his own defense, then severely limited what he could say, allegedly making him look ""foolish"" rather than sympathetic.

They also attacked Zagel for seating a juror who the lawyers contend appeared predisposed to convict Blagojevich during questioning before testimony began. What's more, they accused Zagel of giving bad jury instructions and abusing his discretion over sentencing to hand out an unusually long 14-year prison sentence.

The scattershot nature of the legal arguments in some ways reflects the aggressive, slash and burn public style that Blagojevich long fashioned for himself. As governor, and even later as a criminal defendant, Blagojevich often portrayed himself as a champion of the little guy besieged by powerful political forces out to thwart him.

That theme plays out in his appellate filing. Blagojevich, it declared, was a sometimes frustrated champion of expanded children's health care trying to seize on his power to pick a Senate replacement to bring his advocacy to a new level. Had Blagojevich ""not sought a political benefit in return, he would have done a disservice to all of his supporters,"" the appeal claimed.

Some legal experts questioned whether such sweeping appeal tactics, especially attacks on Zagel, will hold much sway with appellate judges at the Chicago-based 7th Circuit which has one of the lowest criminal reversal ratings in the nation.

Joel Bertocchi, a veteran appellate attorney in Chicago, said an appeal that focuses on a few key issues is stronger when it comes time to argue. ""It's better to try to punch holes in the case rather than knock the whole thing over,"" he said.

Painting Zagel as biased could hurt more than help, said Bertocchi, who indicated the judge is well regarded by appellate judges as ""smart and very experienced."" He added that the appellate judges would be reluctant to reverse rulings over which Zagel has discretion, among them the scope of wiretapped recordings that could be played at trial or what testimony could be given.

Another hurdle for the defense is that, even if appellate judges can be convinced that Zagel erred, it needs to have been serious enough to invalidate a conviction.

""""You can always criticize a ruling, but the bottom line is did it really affect the outcome of the trial?"" said Mike Rathsack, another Chicago appellate specialist.

In Rathsack's view, perhaps the strongest argument laid out by Blagojevich's lawyers was their claim that Zagel gave an improper legal instruction to jurors, in effect lowering the bar for a finding of guilt.

The appeal contends that under the law, Zagel should have told jurors that to convict Blagojevich, they would have to be convinced that the evidence showed he had ""knowledge of wrongdoing."" Zagel jettisoned that wording at Blagojevich's second trial, informing jurors instead that ""the government is not required to prove that the defendant knew his acts were unlawful.""

Improper revision or not, the question for appellate judges will be ""did that really affect the jury's decision?"" Rathsack said.

Lauren Kaeseberg, one of Blagojevich's lawyers, said the appeal struck many themes, but the most predominant was that Zagel prevented the former governor from putting on an effective defense.

""Whether it was limiting Rod's testimony in improper and unconstitutional ways, not being able to play tapes that would corroborate his testimony ... there is so much the jury didn't hear,"" Kaeseberg said. She also said Zagel's ruling led the jury to be misinformed about where the line is between legitimate political horse-trading and criminal activity.

""The cornerstone of the defense is he always acted in good faith. Rod did not ever believe he was breaking the law,"" she said.

Blagojevich did not testify at his first trial, even though one of his lawyers promised jurors he would at the start of the proceedings. That trial ended with the jury hung on most counts and convicting him on only one — lying to the FBI about the level of his personal involvement in political fundraising.

He did take the stand at the second trial, however, and the appellate brief contended he did so under representations from Zagel that amounted to a bait-and-switch.

Blagojevich was caught on undercover wiretaps discussing potential deals he could cut for jobs or government posts for himself in exchange for a Senate appointment."

Several states are adding laws on registering%2C licensing%2C insurance%2C DUI for moped riders

As gas prices rise%2C more people are turning to the slow-moving%2C often unregulated two-wheelers

Two-wheelers get great gas mileage but can pose a hazard to riders if auto drivers aren%27t cautious

Several states are moving to tighten regulations on mopeds, slow-moving two-wheelers that are popular for their gas mileage but are often exempt from laws governing vehicle registration, licensing, insurance, helmets and even drunken driving.

Mopeds average 80-100 miles or more per gallon. But in most states, they can have engines no larger than 50cc and usually a maximum speed of about 30 mph. That leaves them vulnerable on roads they share with much faster, heavier automobiles, says Sgt. Kelley Hughes of the South Carolina Highway Patrol.

It's difficult to quantify increases in moped use because owners are not required to register them in all states. The Motorcycle Industry Council, a non-profit industry association, does not track moped sales. However, sales of scooters, which are generally faster, larger and more regulated, rose 7.7% last year over 2011 among 19 manufacturers tracked by the association.

In South Carolina, the number of mopeds has increased sharply over the last few years. So have moped road deaths: The state saw a 54% increase in moped fatalities last year, from 24 in 2011 to 37 in 2012, he says. Higher gas prices and a spike in drunken driving convictions are fueling the trend in the Palmetto State. Currently, police there can't cite moped operators for drunken driving, and a driver whose license has been suspended for a first-time DUI can get a license for a moped.

""With gas prices once again on the rise, mopeds will likely increase in popularity,"" says Jonathan Adkins of the Governors Highway Safety Association. ""Mopeds … are hard to see, particularly at night. The small lights tend not to be very bright. Riders are confused whether helmet laws apply and assume they don't.""

One major risk: Because mopeds move so slowly, automobile drivers approaching them often don't realize how quickly they are closing in, especially at night.

The interview will air in two parts on ""Starting Point"" on Monday, Jan 21st and Tuesday, Jan 22nd at 7aET only on CNN.

By ""Starting Point"" host Soledad O'Brien

Before my interview with U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, she ushered me into her expansive office. It's upstairs from the rest of the justices. You wouldn't know it, but Justice Sotomayor can be loud. She likes to party, she likes noise, laughter and music. The offices downstairs…they tend to be quieter.

As I walk in, I notice a plaque on her front door and take a picture of it. “Well-behaved women rarely make history,” it says. I ask her if I could tweet the photo. She obliges, saying it's a sign that really embodies her and that most reporters miss it.

When we sit down for the interview, the first thing we talk about is Sunday's swearing in of Vice President Biden for his second term. I asked her what she thinks of that historic opportunity, since she would be the first Hispanic judge to administer the oath. I also wondered if she felt added pressure, especially after Chief Justice John Roberts famously fumbled President Barack Obama's oath in 2009.

“When you read my book you know that I practice everything I do over and over again,"" Justice Sotomayor says. ""So I have been saying the oath out loud for a couple of weeks now a couple of times a day but I won’t be relying on my memory either. I’ll have a card with me.”

What's clear is that Justice Sotomayor has a natural ease, which comes across in person and in her new memoir, ""My Beloved World."" The book recounts her life in the Bronx and her rise through her career, but it ends when she is nominated to her first judgeship on New York's Federal court and doesn't include much about her Supreme Court seat.

Her book also focuses a lot on her roots, her tight-knit Puerto Rican family and growing up in poverty in a public housing project in the Bronx, NY. She went on to college at Princeton and Yale, then worked as a lawyer until she was appointed to her first judgeship in 1991. Despite her rise, she never forgets where she came from.

An important theme she makes in the book is that she doesn't try to glamorize her great successes. Sotomayor makes a point of explaining the lessons she's learned through the challenges she's faced along the way. She recounts what it was like to attend Princeton in 1972, the 3rd year of classes for women at the school. At the time, there were virtually no Latinos at the school but she was still able to observe the plusses, challenges and ultimately the lessons learned from what was at times an isolating experience.

In her first year on the Supreme Court, Sotomayor says she was terrified. She points to her colleagues around her as the ones she relied on for mentoring. Though in reading her memoir and talking with her, it's clear that her drive to 'make it' is evident throughout her life. Even though she says she feels unprepared and not ready for her various experiences, she always manages to take a lay of the land and not only succeed but also outcompete everyone else.

She didn't shy away from talking openly about her diabetes and the importance of staying fit for her health. She felt she had an opportunity in the book to be an example for others.

Justice Sotomayor may be a new kind of Supreme Court Justice, one who knows her power as a role model and as someone who people can relate to. When talking with her in the interview, it's clear her friendliness and warmth makes it's easy to forget she holds a seat on the highest court in the country.

At the end of the interview, I introduced Justice Sotomayor to Erica Ramos, a recent college graduate from the Bronx. Sotomayor embraced Erica, who was trembling from joy, and autographed a book for her.

Sotomayor offered her some advice: You have so many great opportunities. Take them."

Cardinals desperately short on quality blocking

Rams may need to rely on youth movement

San Francisco has ammo to be active in trade market%2C but cap is tight

Seattle defense may need some attention

A snapshot of each team's roster and considerations heading into free agency, which officially begins March 12 at 4 p.m. ET:

ARIZONA CARDINALS

Prominent free agents: CB Michael Adams, T D'Anthony Batiste, ILB Stewart Bradley (released), WR Early Doucet (released), OLB Quentin Groves, QB Brian Hoyer (restricted), S Rashad Johnson, ILB Paris Lenon, G Rich Ohrnberger, S James Sanders, RB/KR La'Rod Stephens-Howling, CB Greg Toler, RB Chris ""Beanie"" Wells (released), SS Adrian Wilson (released).

Issues: They're in excellent shape at wideout, otherwise the Cards are playing with anything but a full deck on offense. Reinforcing what may have been the league's worst line would theoretically improve the running game and give Kevin Kolb enough time to be an effective (and healthy) passer. The running game has been anything but reliable, hence Wells' release, and Ryan Williams will very likely have to ward off a challenger to start in 2013. New coach Bruce Arians is also sure to take a long look at the quarterbacks in the draft. The defense has the pieces to dominate but must adjust without departed coordinator Ray Horton and needs the offense to keep it on the sideline longer.

Our advice: It's actually not all doom and gloom on the O-line; tackle Levi Brown missed all of 2012 with a torn triceps, and underrated center Lyle Sendlein will be back from a knee injury. But the Cardinals haven't had a standout left tackle since Luis Sharpe moved with the team from St. Louis to Phoenix in 1988. If money can be freed, it would really be a boon to Arians' program — and potentially a franchise rookie quarterback, if not Kolb — to import a talent like Jake Long or Sebastian Vollmer. After that, add some young blood, let the chips fall where they may and re-assess the group in 2014. Defensively, Johnson seems ready for a bigger role and has earned a modest raise, but little tinkering is required.

ST. LOUIS RAMS

Prominent free agents: WR Danny Amendola, QB Kellen Clemens, S Craig Dahl, CB Bradley Fletcher, WR Brandon Gibson, LB/ST Mario Haggan, DE William Hayes, T Wayne Hunter (released), RB Steven Jackson, LB Rocky McIntosh, S Quintin Mikell (released), T Barry Richardson, WR Steve Smith, OL Rob Turner, OL Chris Williams, WR Titus Young (waived).

Issues: With Jackson, Gibson and Amendola all apparently on the way out, St. Louis will lose three of its four most productive players in terms of yards from scrimmage in 2012. Equally notable, Richardson and Turner were both 16-game starters last year. On defense, the Rams have a nice mix of young talent and players in their prime but could use help at tackle and safety, and there are myriad veteran options available at both spots.

Our advice: This franchise took a big step forward under new coach Jeff Fisher and GM Les Snead in Year 1. Armed with two more first-round picks in April's draft, there's no reason to go wild in free agency now — and St. Louis isn't really in position to do so, though Jackson's decision to void his contract does allow for possibilities. It seems like a no-brainer that Snead will pick a blocker early. We'd re-sign Turner, who's versatile and shouldn't cost much, and draft a replacement for Richardson. The young wideouts and backs already on the roster will have every opportunity to prove themselves. But a veteran player might help, perhaps receiver Braylon Edwards, a big body and good blocker who is familiar with offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer. Given their pair of first rounders, it is worth noting the Rams are best positioned to make a run at restricted free agent wideout Victor Cruz, who will cost any potential suitor a Round 1 pick as compensation to pry him away from the New York Giants.

SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS

Prominent free agents: K David Akers (released), G Leonard Davis, KR/WR Ted Ginn, FS Dashon Goldson, DL Ricky Jean-Francois, WR Randy Moss, NT Isaac Sopoaga, TE Delanie Walker.

Issues: Pffft. They're likely to have up to 15 draft picks once compensatories are allotted. Wideouts Mario Manningham and Kyle Williams, running back Kendall Hunter and linebacker Parys Haralson will return from injured reserve. Colin Kaepernick will be a year better. They've already spun off former starting quarterback Alex Smith and acquired tough-guy wideout Anquan Boldin in the trade market. The roster's already loaded, so a tight cap is of little concern. You won't find a team that wouldn't love to have these ""issues.""

Our advice: They need a new backup to fill Smith's spot, and Jim Harbaugh pupil Josh Johnson might be the perfect guy. He spent time on the roster last summer, won't hurt the cap and has a skill set that could make him a fairly capable facsimile of Kaepernick over time. Akers must also be replaced, but it will be a buyer's market for kickers. With Williams recovered, Ginn can go. Finding common ground with undervalued Walker would be very nice given the versatility he brings to the offense. A choice will probably have to be made between Sopoaga and Jean-Francois, and the decision to let Goldson walk has seemingly been made despite Harbaugh's recently stated belief that the all-pro deserved to be rewarded. Lastly, there's the Darrelle Revis question. The Niners have the ammunition to trade for the New York Jets all-pro corner and, if healthy, he'd certainly solidify a pass defense that was dissected throughout the playoffs. GM Trent Baalke would have to adjust the payroll to accommodate Revis, but don't you do that for the guy who could be the missing piece to a Super Bowl puzzle?

SEATTLE SEAHAWKS

Prominent free agents: DT Alan Branch, DL Jason Jones, CB Marcus Trufant, K Steven Hauschka, OLB Leroy Hill, K Ryan Longwell, OL Frank Omiyale.

Issues: Like the division rival 49ers, not many warts here. It's especially nice when your stud starting quarterback makes nary a blip on your cap, something Russell Wilson shares in common with Kaepernick. The defense will need repairs up front, especially after top pass rusher Chris Clemons tore up his knee in the playoffs.

Our advice: With slot man extraordinaire and part-time tailback Percy Harvin now in the fold, this offense appears more than formidable. The Harvin acquisition also saves GM John Schneider the hassle of pursuing Mike Wallace or Greg Jennings with megabucks offers. It's more imperative to get a stand-in/complement for Clemons anyway, and Seattle has already kicked the tires on John Abraham. Dwight Freeney and Osi Umenyiora also seem like natural fits. We'd get one of them for a year or two. Branch wants to return and Jones played well, too, but there are outside targets to mull if they depart. A dog like Richard Seymour would be great on the D-line, or an under-the-rader youngster like Desmond Bryant could also work. It's time to move on from troubled Hill, who won't be difficult to replace. If Hauschka doesn't come back, Seattle could upgrade with David Akers, Lawrence Tynes or Phil Dawson, kickers who are proven in bad weather. Aside from the veteran pass rushers, the draft can address many of these areas, though Schneider may also have to mine it for a nickelback and O-line depth..

The trips, funded by bake sales and other events throughout the year, will allow the students to take in Washington’s historic landmarks.

One premier destination is off-limits this year, however. A few weeks ago, the Obama Administration announced it was suspending public, self-guided tours of the White House as a result of the automatic sequester cuts that the administration proposed in 2011. While America’s students stand outside the White House fence, the First Daughters, Sasha and Malia, are enjoying spring break with friends at the Atlantis Resort on Paradise Island in the Bahamas.

Breitbart News’ Matt Boyle broke the news Monday morning that numerous sources have reported seeing the First Daughters in the Bahamas this weekend. Presumably, the Obamas are paying the costs of the resort out of their own pockets. The robust Secret Service detail that must accompany the First Daughters, however, is funded by taxpayers.

The principal reason the White House canceled public tours was to save money on Secret Service staff. The White House reported that suspending the tours would save $74,000 a week. Other reports have put the savings at just $18,000 a week.

Whichever the true amount, the Secret Service detail necessary to protect the First Daughters on their spring break could likely have been used to keep the White House open to the rest of America’s school children. Judicial Watch reported that Malia Obama’s Spring Break in Mexico last year cost taxpayers over $115,000. That amount would cover 2-6 weeks of White House tours.

At the very least, it would ensure that, this spring break, thousands of America’s students could cap their trip to DC with a uniquely American tradition–a tour of the White House."

(CNN) —

President Barack Obama recast the U.S. fight against terrorism as no longer a “boundless global war” but a targeted effort to dismantle specific extremist networks.

He said America was at a “crossroads” and should no longer see it as a “self-defeating” perpetual fight, but one that must at some point end, “like all wars.”

Obama said “the core of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan is on a path to defeat,” but its affiliates elsewhere pose dangers. He also touched on new overseas and homegrown threats, and explained publicly the use of drones against terror suspects overseas.

Obama: U.S. will keep deploying drones – when they are only option

He renewed his push to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and also sought to calm criticism around his administration’s investigation of national security leaks.

Obama, ‘troubled’ by leak investigations, asks for review

He even paused his prepared remarks to take on a woman in the audience from “Code Pink” who interrupted him several times in open disagreement.

Obama interrupted

“I think that the, and I’m going off script as you might expect here …. the voice of that woman is worth paying attention to,” Obama said to applause. “Obviously I do not agree with much of what she said and obviously she wasn’t listening to me in what I said but these are tough issues and the suggestion that we can gloss over them is wrong.”

Here are five things we learned from the speech:

1. Using drones are OK, but…

The Obama administration for the first time revealed Wednesday that drones had killed four American citizens since 2009. Obama used the speech to more definitively explain the U.S. policy on the use of lethal force and sought stricter review of its use.

Still, he said drones were both legal and effective to combat terrorists, and added that Americans overseas who wish to do the United States harm were fair game, in the most extreme cases.

“When a U.S. citizen goes abroad to wage war against America – and is actively plotting to kill U.S. citizens; and when neither the United States, nor our partners are in a position to capture him before he carries out a plot – his citizenship should no more serve as a shield than a sniper shooting down on an innocent crowd should be protected from a SWAT team,” Obama said.

He said ordering strikes is a heavy burden, but added that “to do nothing in the face of terrorist networks would invite far more civilian casualties.”

Obama said he is asking his administration to review proposals to extend oversight of lethal actions outside of war zones that go beyond reporting to Congress.

CNN’s senior political analyst Gloria Borger says Obama defends the use of drones.

“But he also really acknowledged that it can be overused, even by a president, and that you cannot just depend on drones for your national security.”

2. I wasn’t kidding about closing Gitmo…

When he was first elected in 2008, Obama vowed to shut down the military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, also known as Gitmo.

But in the years since, Congress has enacted significant restrictions on the transfer of detainees from the prison that made its closure impractical. And, as costs of running the facility balloon and detainees wage hunger strikes protesting their imprisonment, the administration has quietly dialed back the intensity of the push to shut down the facility.

But that changed Thursday.

“The original premise for opening GTMO – that detainees would not be able to challenge their detention – was found unconstitutional five years ago,” said Obama. “In the meantime, GTMO has become a symbol around the world for an America that flouts the rule of law.”

He called on Congress to “lift the restrictions on detainee transfers from GTMO,” appointed a special envoy to “achieve the transfer of detainees to third countries,” and lifted the moratorium on detainee transfers to Yemen, where 56 of Gitmo’s 86 detainees are from.

3. No leaks, but there’s that freedom of the press thing…

Obama has come under fire for recent investigations into leaks by his Justice Department where phone records were seized from reporters and editors at The Associated Press and a Fox News reporter was labeled in a Justice Department affidavit as “potentially being an ‘aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator’” to the crime of disclosing secret information.

So he used the speech to try to quell criticism for those intrusions.

“As commander-in-chief, I believe we must keep information secret that protects our operations and our people in the field,” Obama said. “But a free press is also essential for our democracy. I am troubled by the possibility that leak investigations may chill the investigative journalism that holds government accountable.”

“Journalists should not be at legal risk for doing their jobs. Our focus must be on those who break the law,” he added.

He vowed to push for a federal shield law for journalists and convene a group of media organizations to review existing guidelines about investigations that involve reporters.

4. A new term brings a new policy

Obama clearly used the speech to redefine U.S. policy on the so-called “war on terror,” acknowledging that where once the battle was fought on foreign soil, the threats have moved.

“Now make no mistake: our nation is still threatened by terrorists. From Benghazi to Boston, we have been tragically reminded of that truth. We must recognize that the threat has shifted and evolved from the one that came to our shores on 9/11. With a decade of experience to draw from, now is the time to ask ourselves hard questions - about the nature of today’s threats, and how we should confront them.”

“From our use of drones to the detention of terrorist suspects, the decisions we are making now will define the type of nation – and world – that we leave to our children,” Obama said.

“I was listening to a president who was saying to us, ‘Let’s get beyond where we were when I first took office, and let me tell you how my thinking has evolved since I’ve been president of the United States,’” said CNN’s senior political analyst Gloria Borger. “He said, ‘We must define the nature and scope of this struggle or it will define us.’”

But Obama will face opposition as he attempts to shift U.S. policy.

“Both on drones and on Guantanamo, he’s going to get some pushback,” said Borger.

5. Free speech also means ‘you listen’

A loud woman interrupted the president several times during his speech, calling on Obama to close the Guantanamo Bay facility. But the president was talking about just that when he was interrupted.

“You are commander-in-chief – you can close Guantanamo today,” she yelled. “It’s been 11 years!”

Obama stopped in the middle of his remarks and shot back. “This is part of free speech, is you being able to speak but also you listening and me being able to speak, alright?” Obama said.

The woman was identified as Medea Benjamin, a co-founder of the protest group Code Pink and was later escorted out of the building and released.

Later, he even tweaked his closing line to incorporate the heckler in the audience.

“Victory will be measured in parents taking their kids to school, immigrants coming to our shores, fans taking in a ballgame, a veteran starting a business; a bustling city street, a citizen shouting their concerns at a president,” he concluded.
