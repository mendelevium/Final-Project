Congress Itself Keeps Burning a Dirtier Fuel,"WASHINGTON — As part of the climate change agenda he unveiled this year, President Obama made a commitment to significantly reduce the federal government’s dependence on fossil fuels. The government, he said in a speech in June at Georgetown University, “must lead by example.”

But just two miles from the White House stands the Capitol Power Plant, the largest single source of carbon emissions in the nation’s capital and a concrete example of the government’s inability to green its own turf.

The plant, which provides heating and cooling to the sprawling Capitol campus — 23 buildings that include the Library of Congress, the Supreme Court and Congressional office buildings, in addition to the Capitol building itself — is operated by Congress, and its transition to cleaner energy sources has been mired in national politics for years. But the failure of Congress to modernize its own facility also raises questions about the Obama administration’s ability to limit emissions from existing power plants when it has not been able to do so at a government-run facility so close to home.

The office of the architect of the Capitol, which oversees the operations of the plant, first moved to end the use of coal there in 2000 but was turned back by resistance from powerful coal-state senators who wanted to keep it as the primary fuel. The effort was revived in 2007 as a central part of the Green the Capitol Initiative, led by Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker at the time. The effort was defunded in 2011 after the Republicans took control of the House."

So Orcutt sent him an email in response, in which he justified the new tax, in part by claiming that cyclists generate more pollution than cars.



State lawmaker defends bike tax, says bicycling is not good for the environment

Posted on March 2, 2013 by Tom Fucoloro Representative Ed Orcutt (R – Kalama) does not think bicycling is environmentally friendly because the activity causes cyclists to have “an increased heart rate and respiration.” This is according to comments he made in an email to a constituent who questioned the wisdom of a new bike tax the legislature is considering as part of a large transportation package. We spoke with Rep. Orcutt to confirm the email’s authenticity and to get further clarification. “You would be giving off more CO2 if you are riding a bike than driving in a car,” he said. However, he said he had not “done any analysis” of the difference in CO2 from a person on a bike compared to the engine of a car (others have). “You can’t just say that there’s no pollution as a result of riding a bicycle.”

Someone please tell me this was snark. Please, I beg you.

In any case, putting aside these, ahem, deep thoughts about cycling, pollution and the environment, Orcutt is also wrong on the notion that cyclists don't pay for the roads that they ride on, that he claims drivers do.

First, the majority of funds that go towards building and maintaining roads, including bike lanes, comes from general revenue, not gas or vehicle taxes or license and registration fees, which everyone, including cyclists, pays into, via sales, property, income and other taxes--some of them not local or even state, but federal.

Second, to the extent that vehicle-related taxes and fees pay for roads, the vast majority of cyclists also own and drive vehicles, and pay these taxes and fees as much as non-cyclists.

And third, the wear and tear that bicycles impose on public roads is miniscule verging on infinitesimal compared to that imposed on them by cars, motorcycles and trucks. Powered vehicles weigh anywhere from hundreds to thousands of pounds. Most bikes weigh anywhere from 15 to 40 pounds. Do the math, even if you include the weight of the driver.

I wonder if Mr. Orcutt has done an analysis of how much pollution is caused by Republicans opening their mouths or attempting to use their brains?"

Demonstrators oppose Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to Gulf Coast

Event was billed as largest-ever climate change rally

Protesters want Obama to set limits on power plant emissions

WASHINGTON — In what was billed as the largest climate rally in U.S. history, thousands of people marched past the White House on Sunday to urge President Obama to reject a controversial pipeline and take other steps to fight climate change.

Organizers, including the Sierra Club, estimated that more than 35,000 people from 30-plus states -- some dressed as polar bears -- endured frigid temperatures to join the ""Forward on Climate"" rally, although the crowd size could not be confirmed. Their immediate target is Obama's final decision, expected soon, on the Keystone XL oil pipeline that would carry tar sands from Canada through several U.S. states.

""This movement's been building a long time. One of the things that's built it is everybody's desire to give the president the support he needs to block this Keystone pipeline,"" Bill McKibben, founder of the environmental activist group, 350.org, said as protesters gathered on the National Mall.

""It's time for the president to stand up,"" he said, describing the 1,000-plus mile pipeline as ""one of the largest carbon bombs in history."" Some climate scientists say the production of tar sands emits more greenhouse gases than that of conventional crude oil. Supporters, including the oil industry, say it would reduce U.S. dependence on unstable foreign sources of oil.

Among the protesters were senior citizens in wheelchairs, a dad from Indiana carrying a toddler, women from a Unitarian church in Corvallis, Ore., and college students, including Florida's Molly Kampmann who was holding a picture of a pipeline with the caption: ""This is why I'm hot.""

Others held placards saying, ""Read my lips: no new carbons,"" and ""We're in a climate hole: stop digging."" Another, referring to a method for extracting natural gas, said: ""Don't be frackin' crazy.""

""We're right in the path of sea level rise,"" said Mark Geduldig-Yactrosky of Portsmouth, Va., explaining his concern about climate change. ""We're a low-lying area. We have rising oceans and subsiding lands. So that personalizes it for us.""

Burlington, Vt., resident Michael Ware, holding a ""Stop Vermont Yankee"" banner, said last year's extreme weather convinced many Americans that climate change is serious. ""What will Vermont, what will any state, look like in 20 years?"" he asked.

""I have six grandchildren, and I want them to have a habitable planet,"" said Linda Britt, who came from Ann Arbor, Mich., with other grandparents.

Obama has pledged repeatedly to tackle climate change. In his State of the Union Address, he gave Congress an ultimatum: if lawmakers don't act, he will. Protesters say they are holding him to his word. They want him to not only reject the pipeline but also set limits on carbon pollution from both new and existing power plants. Last year, the EPA proposed limits only on new plants.

In January 2012, Obama rejected the initial 1,700-mile Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta, Canada, to Port Arthur, Texas, saying he needed more time for environmental review. Since the project crosses a U.S. border, it needs a permit from the State Department, but Obama has said he'll make the final call.

The project's developer, Calgary-based TransCanada, has since broken the project into two parts. It received approval last year from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to begin construction of the 485-mile, $2.3 billion southern leg of the project from Cushing, Okla., to the Gulf Coast. Obama's pending decision involves the 1,179-mile, $5.3 billion northern leg, from Alberta to Steele City, Neb.

The pressure on Keystone has intensified since Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman, who like Obama had rejected the initial route, notified the president last month that he'd approved the revised route through his state. Heineman, a Republican, said it would avoid environmentally sensitive areas and bringjobs and other economic benefits.

TransCanada President Russ Girling, who hailed Heineman's reversal, traveled to Washington earlier this month to lobby personally for the billion-dollar project."

His plan, unveiled Tuesday at Georgetown University in Washington, will set off legal and political battles that will last years.

But experts say that if all goes well for the president, the plan could potentially meet his stated goal of an overall emissions reduction of 17 percent by 2020, compared with the level in 2005.

“If the question is, ‘Will this solve our emissions problem?’ the answer is no,” said Michael A. Levi, an energy analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. “If the question is, ‘Could this move us along the path we want to be on?’ the answer is yes, it could.”"
http://news.yahoo.com/federal-rule-could-upend-states-shark-fin-bans-203717163.html,,[],Federal rule could upend states' shark fin bans,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Several members of Congress representing coastal states are voicing concern about a proposed federal regulation that could pre-empt state bans on buying or selling shark fins.

Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman of California is being joined by representatives of New York, Florida and Guam in seeking changes to a proposal they say would take away a state tool to protect shark populations.

California, Hawaii, New York and several other states have passed regulations on the sale and trade of shark fins, which are used in a soup considered an Asian delicacy. California's ban on the sale, trade and possession of shark fins will go into effect Monday after a compromise allowed time for restaurants and businesses to use up their existing supplies.

A letter from the representatives and the delegate from Guam states that a proposed rule by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's fisheries management division, the National Marine Fisheries Services, would undermine those laws. California state lawmakers were also circulating an opposition letter.

""If we are to address the problem of shark-finning head on, we must allow state and territorial statutes to complement the federal regulations and further the U.S. leadership in global shark conservation,"" states the letter, which has not yet been sent to the fisheries service but was given in advance to The Associated Press.

In addition to Huffman, it is to be signed by Democratic Reps. Sam Farr of California and Grace Meng of New York, Florida Republican Rep. Vern Buchanan and Democratic Delegate Madeleine Bordallo of Guam. Their letter is dated July 8, which is when the public comment period on the proposed rule is scheduled to end.

A request for comment was left with a press officer for the National Marine Fisheries Services.

The proposal under consideration says state and territory shark fin laws are pre-empted if they are found to be inconsistent with federal fishery management plans or regulations.

Story continues

Conservation and animal welfare groups have begun circulating petitions against the proposal, but representatives of the fishing industry have argued that federal pre-emption is necessary to maintain fishing of commercially viable shark species.

Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed the Shark Conservation Act of 2010 in an effort to strengthen federal laws against shark finning in U.S. waters and require that sharks be landed with their fins still attached. Since then, the fisheries service has been working to craft regulations to implement the act.

Conservation and animal advocacy groups said fishermen have been able to sidestep the rules by taking only the fins of sharks and dumping the carcasses back into the sea. Advocates say tens of millions of sharks are killed each year for the worldwide demand of shark fins and products.

Jill Hepp, director of shark conservation at The Pew Charitable Trusts, said states should have the right to go beyond federal rules in protecting shark populations.

""If this goes forward as they are proposing, this has the potential to undermine the states' shark fin trade ban and it would be a considerable setback for global shark conservation,"" Hepp said.

But John Whiteside, an attorney for Sustainable Fisheries Association, a Massachusetts nonprofit founded by four seafood processors, said the federal government should have the final say over regulations, especially fish caught in federal waters.

Not doing so would violate trade laws and run afoul of treaties the federal government has with governments around the world, he said. Commercial fishing groups were successful at getting exemptions in some states for certain species of sharks, such as the dogfish, a small shark also used for fish and chips that is sustainably harvested.

However, California provides no such exemption.

""You're building a wall around the state of California from which the free flow of legal goods is forbidden,"" he said. ""If you have these states around the country that build these little islands, you can't have the free flow of commerce and that's what this country needs.""

Jennifer Fearing, California director for The Humane Society of the United States, said the state drafted its bill specifically to ban the sale of shark fins, no matter where the shark was caught.

She noted that a federal judge let California's ban stand earlier this year after the nonprofit Chinatown Neighborhood Association argued in part that state law violated Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce.

""It's not California sharks being finned,"" she said. ""It's dried processed shark fins arriving here already processed and dried. We have no idea where those sharks come from and the only way California can protect sharks globally is if they were not selling.""

California, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, New York, Oregon and Washington have passed laws banning the buying and selling of shark fins, according to the Humane Society. Similar bans are in effect in three U.S. Pacific territories — Guam, American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands.

Hawaii state Sen. Clayton Hee, a Democrat who wrote the bill that made the 50th state the first to ban the possession, sale and distribution of shark fins, said Friday that the changes would benefit corporations outside the United States involved in the trade. Hee said he can't think of another incentive for the rule changes unless the agencies are arguing that there are too many sharks in the ocean.

""It's baffling to me why a government agency would work to rid the ocean of its health by taking sharks,"" Hee said.

Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie said the state's law must be preserved.

""Our law is working as intended,"" he said. ""We have educated fishers and restaurants, and they are complying.""

Two more words: Fake Science.

Two more words: Government Funding.

What's the profit motive for the supposed global climate change fraud?



Two words = Carbon Tax = Consumer Shakedown!

Just curious as to why he would assume he has any credibility in the global warming hoax..Let's be honest Al...You're a weather forecaster.....not a meteorologist....You have no degree in science whatsoever. You're opinion is on the same level as mine. So my two words to you...Not Qualified...

faith in the infallibility of scientists is unwarranted and naive. They made mistakes. They created models based on their theory of a CO2 driven climate. The models failed. Actual temperatures are much lower than the models predicted. Even the head of the IPCC, James Hansen, and others have admitted as much. When will you?

when those that scream loudest about it start changing their lifestyles and become practitioners instead of preachers, we might follow suit. flying around the world to accept an award for spreading the word about global warming w/o the slightest bit of self awareness is what sinks. the credibility of the face of the movement and the movement itself.

Three words for you Al, NOT A METEOROLOGIST. You have a degree in communications. You have NO SCIENCE BACKGROUND WHATSOEVER!!! So now we have two guys named Al with absolutely no scientific education, no scholarly research papers or anything else for that matter, telling us all about a very complicated scientific issue. Hey Als, go back to school and get some street cred!

1. It wasn't a super storm. It was a Cat 1 hurricane that hit an unprepared socialist city with decaying infrastructure.

2. So what? One storm is weather, not climate as the global warming nut jobs always try and remind us anyhow.

Al is just like all the other global warming advocates. Uninformed and unwilling to question the status quo. Al needs to look at the real science of global warming not the propaganda being spewed by the likes of Mikey Mann, a proven fraud.

It may well be warming but that doesn't mean it's a problem. Alarmists freaked out about the same thing, a melting Arctic, at the beginning of the '20th century. The Vikings were able to sail the northern seas all the way to Canada, naming a now ice covered land mass ""Greenland"" along the way. England during the same time had a wine industry.

Another mentally diseased democrat.......too bad we can not send him to the real culprit.....the Sun.

The massive cathredals of Europe, built to seat thousands (who actually once used them) are now open at times for only 6 or 8 people. Saw it.

Meanwhile, MILLIONS of Cyclopsean Europeans march around entranced by global warming.

Their leaders LOVE it--it keeps those in charge, in charge. And it STRENGTHENS their stranglehold on the Volk.

That's four words. And that makes sense, because if liberals are about anything, it's about shaking down consumers! Who knew Big Pharma was liberal? The oil companies? The insurance industry?College dropout Rush Limbaugh, on the other hand, is a foremost expert on the issue. This James Hansen? The one who just quit NASA so he could be more free to fight against greenhouse emissions and the Keystone Pipeline? That one?Al Gore fat, therefore global warming is a hoax!If only every climate scientist was as scientifically educated as James Inhoff. Or every commenter at Breitbart.And someone warn Wall Street about all that socialism in their city, which gets hit by Cat 1 hurricanesthe time.As we all know, reality has a well-known liberal bias! Good thing conservatives are willing to question reality!Um. Greenland wasn't green when the Scandinavians settled there. It was a play to convince settlers to travel there. And the British Isles still have a wine industry, though it was decimated in the early 20th century by ... WWI. The Brits had more important things to grow in a time of war.Too bad he can't be murdered by the ""sanctity of life"" crowd!So that's the motive behind the supposed global climate change hoax? To subvert religion? If that's the case, the Germans might want to stop taxing its citizens on behalf of the church

In the name of efficiency, you know.



Ask the folks in the UK about global warming. The UK summer began last Sunday. Snow, wind, and extreme cold embracing the UK. Roker is an idiot.

I could never vote for a political party that relies primarily on fear and lies to advance themselves...

Being so educated you would think he absorbed enough weather history to know where his fat ass is sitting now was covered by a glacier. Then it melted. Then it came back......melted again...for hundreds of thousands of years. He would probably blame mastodon flatulence.

Got one word for him...zealot. This is their religion...they worship at the alter of government. Their penance is through PC policing, and they use the environment as a tool of conversion. The Earth doesn't need saving. One good earthquake, super volcano, or asteroid and we're gone. All this clap trap is for those who have given up morality and the laws of God to give their life meaning and purpose and like everything else...zealotry has overridden common sense.

Stand up to the insane liberal agenda! Though there are many people who have been successfully indoctrinated by contemptuous professors and news media, there are still many other people out there who can reason and exercise common sense. You are absolutely not alone!

What's more disturbing, in light of the facts that support the notion that global warming is a hoax, is that it is a lowly 37%. That is scarey when you understand that there is no evidence at all that the earth is getting warmer and in fact may be cooling. Actually, it isn't just a hoax, it's a freaking scam on the world.

Any scientific finding that requires massive unprecidented growth in government is a hoax. You can take that to the bank.

How about one word, ""Chemtrails"". This guy is an idiot, just like AlGorezeera.

Ah yes, the ""it snowed that one time"" argument!Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!Luckily, we didn't have civilization back then, huh? Seems it would be worth avoiding those things now that we're around.We can trash the planet because of the rapture.The fringe has company.And it's true because he said so!The data wouldlook different if tax cuts were the solution!Yeah, I had to look that one up.

People living in temperate climates along the coast would probably see higher bills. Those in torrid regions — the San Joaquin Valley, the Inland Empire and the Mojave Desert — would get some rate relief.

Exactly how much rates would change would be left to the Public Utilities Commission after it conducts a detailed, technical investigation. Additionally, the PUC would have the authority to charge all ratepayers a fixed monthly fee of up to $10 each.

The legislation also would authorize the PUC to rewrite rules for solar power users selling excess power back to the grid and to require utilities to generate even more electricity from wind, solar and other renewable sources. The state now requires utilities to get 33% of their power from renewable sources by 2020.

The proposal would replace “outdated, electric-rate restrictions adopted during the state’s energy regulation crisis over a decade ago,” said its author, Assemblyman Henry T. Perea (D-Fresno).

The much-amended legislation has remained under the radar for most of the year as investor-owned electric companies wrangled with consumer groups, roof-top solar-power companies, environmentalists, manufacturers and farmers over half a dozen complex elements that affect rates.

Advertisement

But now it has emerged as the year’s major energy initiative, passing the state Senate on a 33-5 vote Monday after clearing the Assembly on a 66-4 vote in May. AB 327 faces one more largely procedural vote in the Assembly before being sent to Gov. Jerry Brown for his signature, which is expected.

The Perea bill is California’s first comprehensive effort to rejigger rates since the lowest two pricing tiers were frozen during blackouts and rolling brownouts that affected the state’s electrical grid in 2000 and 2001. Lower tiers cost less per kilowatt-hour than the higher ones.

But the freeze on some retail rates didn’t shelter utilities from the rising costs of wholesale power, generation, transmission and renewable energy, according to Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric Co.

Those costs mainly have been heaped on larger-volume consumers, whose bills are boosted by heavy, high-tier usage.

Owners of large homes with swimming pools, lighted tennis courts and a dozen television sets got hit. So did folks of more modest means, particularly those with low incomes and the elderly, who tend to live in hotter inland cities where temperatures often hit triple digits on summer days.

“The rates discriminate heavily against seniors who live ... in houses where energy use is high,” said Gary Passmore, vice president of the California Congress of Seniors. “They pay disproportionately.”

Advertisement

Though the measure sets certain parameters, it directs the PUC to come up with specific economic and energy regulations.

“The bill is a good package that allows the commission flexibility it needs to set rates going forward. It also includes significant ratepayer protections,” said Mike Campbell, a program manager with the Division of Ratepayer Advocates, the commission’s independent watchdog arm.

The measure is backed by the three utilities, consumer groups such as the Utility Reform Network and the Greenlining Institute, the AARP and other senior citizens groups, the California Retailers Assn. and the national Solar Energy Industries Assn., among others.

Opponents include the Sierra Club, the California Manufacturers & Technology Assn. and the California League of Food Processors.

Manufacturers said they feared that raising the renewable target could make California’s already high electric rates even higher. Farmers and growers, who invested in expensive solar power equipment, worried that they could be shortchanged by a shift in the rules for earning credits for excess power.

The Sierra Club objected to a provision that would allow the PUC to charge the $10 fixed monthly fee for maintenance of the grid.

Advertisement

The fee, said Kathryn Phillips, the club’s state director, “has no real purpose other than to discourage investment in roof-top solar and energy efficiency” by lengthening the time needed to reap a payback from their expensive renewable systems.

Edison argued that the charge is an equitable way to make sure that everyone who uses the grid, including people who get most of their energy from roof-top solar, pay a portion of the fixed costs of maintaining thousands of miles of transmission and distribution lines.

Story highlights El Salvador's Supreme Court said doctors cannot perform an abortion on a sick woman The woman's life is not at imminent risk, the court said Abortion is illegal in El Salvador without exceptions The woman had argued her life was at risk and her baby would die

(CNN) —

The plea of a pregnant woman to be granted an abortion has gripped El Salvador for months: She wanted an abortion after doctors told her that her baby would not survive outside the womb and that her life was at risk.

But abortion is illegal without exceptions in El Salvador, and on Wednesday, the country’s Supreme Court denied her petition.

Atttorneys for the 22-year-old woman, known only as “Beatriz,” argued that the mother’s life was at risk if the pregnancy was not terminated.

Ill woman at center of abortion debate in El Salvador

In a 3-1 vote, the justices ruled the risk to Beatriz’s life was not imminent but a possibility in the future.

“This court finds that the rights of the mother cannot be prioritized over those of the (fetus) nor vice versa,” the ruling said.

The ruling found that doctors must continue to monitor the woman and make the best medical decisions that take into account the risks to her life, and to the unborn baby, too.

Beatriz is suffering from lupus and kidney problems, and her unborn child developed without parts of the brain or skull. She asked for an abortion so that doctors could focus on saving her life, but doctors were hesitant to carry out the procedure without assurances that they wouldn’t be prosecuted, her attorneys said. Doctors said they expect the baby to survive only for hours after birth.

She argued that an abortion could save her life and allow her to care for her other child, who is a year old.

Anti-abortion groups countered that abortion-rights advocates were using Beatriz as an opening to push for changes to abortion laws.

“The constitution makes it clear that life exists from the moment of conception, and anything that tries to end a life is murder,” lawmaker Rodolfo Parker said after the ruling.

Women’s rights groups who have held rallies in support of Beatriz said they were disappointed by the ruling and criticized the high court for taking weeks to reach a decision.

“There has to be a prudent period (to make a decision) that doesn’t take practically a month and a half like we waited to have a serious analysis,” said Ima Guirola of the rights group CEMUJER.

The court’s decision is not the end of the Beatriz’s options. Her family has said she is considering traveling outside the country to a place where an abortion can be carried out legally.

Two more words: Fake Science.

Two more words: Government Funding.

Actually, just one word: Motive?

What's the profit motive for the supposed global climate change fraud?



Two words = Carbon Tax = Consumer Shakedown!

Just curious as to why he would assume he has any credibility in the global warming hoax..Let's be honest Al...You're a weather forecaster.....not a meteorologist....You have no degree in science whatsoever. You're opinion is on the same level as mine. So my two words to you...Not Qualified...

faith in the infallibility of scientists is unwarranted and naive. They made mistakes. They created models based on their theory of a CO2 driven climate. The models failed. Actual temperatures are much lower than the models predicted. Even the head of the IPCC, James Hansen, and others have admitted as much. When will you?

when those that scream loudest about it start changing their lifestyles and become practitioners instead of preachers, we might follow suit. flying around the world to accept an award for spreading the word about global warming w/o the slightest bit of self awareness is what sinks. the credibility of the face of the movement and the movement itself.

Three words for you Al, NOT A METEOROLOGIST. You have a degree in communications. You have NO SCIENCE BACKGROUND WHATSOEVER!!! So now we have two guys named Al with absolutely no scientific education, no scholarly research papers or anything else for that matter, telling us all about a very complicated scientific issue. Hey Als, go back to school and get some street cred!

1. It wasn't a super storm. It was a Cat 1 hurricane that hit an unprepared socialist city with decaying infrastructure.

2. So what? One storm is weather, not climate as the global warming nut jobs always try and remind us anyhow.

Al is just like all the other global warming advocates. Uninformed and unwilling to question the status quo. Al needs to look at the real science of global warming not the propaganda being spewed by the likes of Mikey Mann, a proven fraud.

It may well be warming but that doesn't mean it's a problem. Alarmists freaked out about the same thing, a melting Arctic, at the beginning of the '20th century. The Vikings were able to sail the northern seas all the way to Canada, naming a now ice covered land mass ""Greenland"" along the way. England during the same time had a wine industry.

Another mentally diseased democrat.......too bad we can not send him to the real culprit.....the Sun.

The massive cathredals of Europe, built to seat thousands (who actually once used them) are now open at times for only 6 or 8 people. Saw it.

Meanwhile, MILLIONS of Cyclopsean Europeans march around entranced by global warming.

Their leaders LOVE it--it keeps those in charge, in charge. And it STRENGTHENS their stranglehold on the Volk.

That's four words. And that makes sense, because if liberals are about anything, it's about shaking down consumers! Who knew Big Pharma was liberal? The oil companies? The insurance industry?College dropout Rush Limbaugh, on the other hand, is a foremost expert on the issue. This James Hansen? The one who just quit NASA so he could be more free to fight against greenhouse emissions and the Keystone Pipeline? That one?Al Gore fat, therefore global warming is a hoax!If only every climate scientist was as scientifically educated as James Inhoff. Or every commenter at Breitbart.And someone warn Wall Street about all that socialism in their city, which gets hit by Cat 1 hurricanesthe time.As we all know, reality has a well-known liberal bias! Good thing conservatives are willing to question reality!Um. Greenland wasn't green when the Scandinavians settled there. It was a play to convince settlers to travel there. And the British Isles still have a wine industry, though it was decimated in the early 20th century by ... WWI. The Brits had more important things to grow in a time of war.Too bad he can't be murdered by the ""sanctity of life"" crowd!So that's the motive behind the supposed global climate change hoax? To subvert religion? If that's the case, the Germans might want to stop taxing its citizens on behalf of the church

In the name of efficiency, you know.



Ask the folks in the UK about global warming. The UK summer began last Sunday. Snow, wind, and extreme cold embracing the UK. Roker is an idiot.

I could never vote for a political party that relies primarily on fear and lies to advance themselves...

Being so educated you would think he absorbed enough weather history to know where his fat ass is sitting now was covered by a glacier. Then it melted. Then it came back......melted again...for hundreds of thousands of years. He would probably blame mastodon flatulence.

Got one word for him...zealot. This is their religion...they worship at the alter of government. Their penance is through PC policing, and they use the environment as a tool of conversion. The Earth doesn't need saving. One good earthquake, super volcano, or asteroid and we're gone. All this clap trap is for those who have given up morality and the laws of God to give their life meaning and purpose and like everything else...zealotry has overridden common sense.

Stand up to the insane liberal agenda! Though there are many people who have been successfully indoctrinated by contemptuous professors and news media, there are still many other people out there who can reason and exercise common sense. You are absolutely not alone!

What's more disturbing, in light of the facts that support the notion that global warming is a hoax, is that it is a lowly 37%. That is scarey when you understand that there is no evidence at all that the earth is getting warmer and in fact may be cooling. Actually, it isn't just a hoax, it's a freaking scam on the world.

Any scientific finding that requires massive unprecidented growth in government is a hoax. You can take that to the bank.

How about one word, ""Chemtrails"". This guy is an idiot, just like AlGorezeera.

Ah yes, the ""it snowed that one time"" argument!Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!Luckily, we didn't have civilization back then, huh?

He may want to be careful what he asks for. Several of those lawmakers come from the president's own party.

Coal-state Democrats have been as scathing as any Republican in reaction to the president's plan, unveiled Tuesday in a speech at Georgetown University. The pushback was almost immediate, and a glaring signal of the trouble Obama may encounter as he charges ahead with new restrictions on coal-fired power plants.

Though Obama technically is going around Congress by having the Environmental Protection Agency impose the rules, moderate Democrats made clear they will pressure the administration from inside the party to scale back. They carry a simple message: The regulations will kill jobs, but working with the coal industry to improve its own clean-coal technology won't.

West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, calling the president's plan a ""war on America,"" delivered one of the most forceful rebuttals in an interview with Fox News.

""It's just ridiculous. ... I should not have to be sitting here as a U.S. senator, fighting my own president and fighting my own government,"" he told Fox News. ""I will continue to reach out, but I need a partner here. I don't need an adversary.""

Manchin argued that the coal industry has the technology to reduce emissions. But he said the government, rather than work with the industry, is setting unattainable standards.

The cornerstone of Obama's plan was a call for the first-ever regulations on emissions for existing power plants.

""Why is this economy going to be taking this hit? Why are jobs going to be lost, and they will be lost,"" Manchin said.

North Dakota Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp echoed the remarks, backing the overall intent of addressing climate change but accusing Obama of amplifying the ""war on coal"" with regulations that ""choke off good-paying American jobs.""

She, too, said the government should encourage investments in technologies that cut emissions with clean-coal technology.

Advocates of the industry argue that it has made strides toward making coal more environmentally friendly. According to the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity (ACCCE), 10 clean-coal technology plants have launched since 2011. Another five are under development or scheduled to come online.

But the industry claims to be struggling to both make those investments and meet the demands of federal regulations. Group President Robert M. ""Mike"" Duncan says EPA regulations have played a big role in the closure of nearly 290 coal plants so far this year.

Initially, there's very little the industry and skeptical lawmakers can do about the new EPA rules. But Congress could try to block the agency's effort with legislation. The rules could face legal challenges. Plus, the EPA will have to work with the states to implement whatever regulations it creates.

Obama said Tuesday that he anticipated claims that the rules will ""kill jobs,"" but compared those warnings to those throughout history whenever the federal government tried to act on the environment.

""The problem with all these tired excuses for inaction is that it suggests a fundamental lack of faith in American business and American ingenuity,"" he said.

Obama said he's willing to work with lawmakers but said: ""I don't have much patience for anyone who denies that this challenge is real. We don't have time for a meeting of the flat-earth society.""

He underscored that point in Saturday's radio address.

Urging voters to act, he said: ""Educate your classmates and colleagues, your family and friends. Speak up in your communities. Remind everyone who represents you, at every level of government, that there is no contradiction between a sound environment and a strong economy -- and that sheltering future generations against the ravages of climate change is a prerequisite for your vote.""

Reaction from Democrats has spanned the gamut.

Manchin's West Virginia colleague, Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall, called the president's plan ""misguided, misinformed and untenable.""

But the state's other Democratic senator, Jay Rockefeller, took a middle-of-the-road position, saying the president needs to provide more information about how miners would be affected.

And in Kentucky, Democratic Rep. John Yarmuth issued an unequivocal endorsement, saying the new standards would ""address the devastating health, environmental, and economic consequences of climate change."""

Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas, and 20 other Republican lawmakers sent a letter to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy on Thursday, claiming the agency has ""muzzled"" members of its independent science advisory board.

The EPA released a proposal in September that would set emissions caps for new coal-fired power plants and would likely require the industry to use carbon-capture technology, which involves burying the carbon underground.

Critics of the proposed rule say the technology, which is still under development, is too expensive, not commercially available and poses safety risks.

The lawmakers claim the agency is ignoring dissenting voices on its science advisory board, which recommended a review of the science underpinning the newest power plant rule.

A senior official at EPA recently deflected the scientists' criticisms by claiming that the rule, which has yet to be finalized, doesn't need to address carbon dioxide storage, the lawmakers said.

“We are concerned about the agency’s apparent disregard for the concerns of its science advisors,” the lawmakers wrote. “Science is a valuable tool to help policymakers navigate complex issues. However, when inconvenient facts are disregarded or when dissenting voices are muzzled, a frank discussion becomes impossible.""

The agency maintains the carbon-capture technology has been ""adequately demonstrated"" based on a government-funded projects under construction in Mississippi and three planned projects in Texas, California and Canada.

The lawmakers said the proposed mandates in the rule would ""create regulatory burdens"" and ""litigation risks"" for the coal industry and would result in the loss of American jobs.

“The EPA’s proposed power plant regulations will put Americans out of work and will make electricity more expensive and less reliable,"" the lawmakers wrote. ""It is misleading and dangerous for EPA to quietly dismiss inconvenient facts and ignore the consequences of its costly regulations. Americans deserve honesty.”

In October, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Rep. Ed Whitfield, R-Ky., released draft legislation to block the EPA's proposal to limit emissions from new power plants and require the agency to set new rules that incorporate ""commercially feasible"" technologies.

The Manchin-Whitfield proposal has yet to be officially introduced."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/08/21/employers-dropping-coverage-for-thousands-spouses-over-obamacare-costs/,2013-08-21 00:00:00,[],Employers dropping coverage for thousands of spouses over ObamaCare costs,"Republican lawmakers are raising new concerns about ObamaCare after several large employers announced they are dropping health coverage for some employee spouses due to rising costs under the new law.

Both the University of Virginia and UPS told their employees recently they are no longer offering spousal coverage to those able to obtain insurance elsewhere; meaning thousands of Americans will no longer be able to choose the benefits they prefer.

UVA said Wednesday this is only one of many “major changes” coming to their health plans as a result of ObamaCare. The university says the changes are necessary because the law is projected to add $7.3 million to the cost of the university’s health plan in 2014 alone.

“The modified plan will provide new options and reward those who participate in wellness programs,” UVA’s Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer Susan Carkeek said in a press release. “But we must make adjustments or face millions of dollars in rising costs, fees and taxes that would be passed along to employees.”

Similarly, UPS partially blamed the new health law for the change, which is estimated to affect roughly 15,000 employee spouses.

More On This...

The rising cost of health care ""combined with the costs associated with the Affordable Care Act, have made it increasingly difficult to continue providing the same level of health care benefits to our employees at an affordable cost,"" UPS said.

The trend has drawn the ire of Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, who cite it as a clear example the Obama administration is not following through on its promise that, “if you like your plan, you can keep it.”

“American families who are already grappling with higher health care costs under the law are also coming face-to-face with the stark reality that they will lose the coverage they have and like,” their office said in a statement Wednesday.

The Obama administration would not respond when asked for comment on the UPS’ new policy by Kaiser Health News, but said when Massachusetts implemented a similar health overhaul, employer coverage actually increased.

“The health care law will make health insurance more affordable, strengthen small businesses and make it easier for employers to provide coverage to their workers,” said Joanne Peters, spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services.

Republican lawmakers say this trend is only one of the concerning effects of ObamaCare, amid reports some companies are citing the law when they reduce employees to part-time hours."

The Arizona Republic

First major Arizona wildfire of the season began around 11%3A30 a.m. MST Tuesday

Burned area had been estimated as high as 11 square miles%2C now estimated at 10 square miles

A human sparked it%2C but officials have not said whether it was intentional or accidental

PRESCOTT, Ariz. — A fire in Arizona's Prescott National Forest that has consumed about 10 square miles of brush and timber is 10 percent contained, officials said Thursday.

The winds are expected to gust until Friday and die down Saturday, while humidity levels may go up, which would aid firefighting efforts, incident commander Tony Sciacca said.



""We can bump the containment up quickly when the wind dies,"" Sciacca said. ""If Mother Nature cooperates in the next couple of days, we hope to tell you we have more containment.""

Costs so far to fight the human-caused blaze, Arizona's first major wildfire of the summer , are between $2.4 million to $2.6 million, Sciacca said.



More than 600 federal, state and local firefighters have been battling the Doce Fire about 8 miles northwest of Prescott in Granite Mountain Wilderness since it was reported at 11 a.m. Tuesday. It is so named because it started near the Doce Pit, a popular target-shooting area.

Mandatory evacuation orders affecting 465 homes remain in place, Sciacca said. He could not give an indication when residents can return home.

Yavapai County Sheriff Scott Mascher said the fire is projected to move in a northwest direction. If that happens, authorities will use a 911 notification to give residents time to prepare for a possible evacuation.

""No structures have been lost, no lives have been lost,"" Mascher said. ""But we are not out of it yet. Overall I think things are going very well.""

Estimates Wednesday had the fire topping 11 square miles, but calculations based on infrared images taken overnight cut down the area.

Sizing up the fire is crucial because ""it's important to know what's burned out there,"" Sciacca said Thursday.

Gov. Jan Brewer on Thursday declared a state of emergency, freeing up $100,000 in state money and allows her to activate the National Guard, if necessary.

Officials said the blaze was human-caused but would not say whether it was accidental or arson. It remains under investigation by the U.S. Forest Service.

Asked how it was determined the fire was human-caused, Prescott National Forest spokeswoman Noel Fletcher said, ""We've not had any thunderstorms come by or any lightening. And so what else would have been the cause?""

Sciacca said ""we are in pretty good shape"" despite losing two DC-10 tankers, which have been pulled to fight a fire in New Mexico.

""We still have four heavy helicopters that are very effective when we do direct tactics,"" he said. ""We are making progress.""

In Chino Valley, about 4 miles northeast of the fire and downwind from it, some residents said they were not worried about the flames. The area was not under evacuation.

""I am not really concerned at this time,"" said Jeff Kella, who has lived Chino Valley about 4 miles northeast and downwind of the fire for 21 years. ""That is, unless it hits the grassy plain that separates the area and the mountain. ... If it gets into the grass, it travels very, very fast. That stuff's dry as a bone.""

Judy Robertson, a 20-year Chino Valley resident, said she was not bothered much by the fire but was keeping the idea of evacuation in the back of her mind.

By afternoon, the winds were causing her to think about leaving.

""The strongest thing is the smell. That's the most alarming,"" she said. ""This is as close as we've seen since I've been here.""

She said if she has to evacuate, she will load up her motor home and head about 15 miles southeast toward Prescott Valley, Ariz.

The Doce Fire broke out on the 11th anniversary of the start of the Rodeo Fire in eastern Arizona. That blaze merged with the Chediski Fire and consumed 732 square miles. The Rodeo-Chediski Fire, the second-largest in state history, burned for nearly three weeks before firefighters were able to bring it under control.

On Wednesday, additional fire restrictions were put into effect because of increasing danger and the risk of human-caused wildfire.

The Coconino, Kaibab, Prescott and Tonto national forests are prohibiting the discharging of firearms, apart from lawful hunting. They also have banned smoking outside of an enclosed vehicle or building; operating internal-combustion engines such as power tools; and welding or using a torch with an open flame.

The restrictions also prohibit using charcoal fires, campfires or stove fires, even in campgrounds with approved sites.

In a 12-page letter sent as part of the public comment on the draft assessment, the Interior Department repeatedly labels as inaccurate its sister agency’s conclusions that Keystone XL would have short-lived effects on wildlife and only during the project’s construction.

“Given that the project includes not only constructing a pipeline but also related infrastructure, access roads, and power lines and substations, impacts to wildlife are not just related to project construction. Impacts to wildlife from this infrastructure will occur throughout the life of the project (i.e. operation and maintenance phases),” the letter says.

Extending 1,700 miles from Canada’s oil sands to refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast, Keystone XL needs a presidential permit from the State Department because it crosses a U.S. border. The draft assessment focuses on the 875-mile section from the border in Montana through South Dakota to a pipeline hub in Nebraska.

The letter from the Interior Department grimly catalogs many ways Keystone XL could harm wildlife: “species displacement, increased predation rates and predator travel lanes, increased nest parasitism, vehicle collisions with wildlife … invasive plant species, increased wildfire risk, lower wildlife density, increase in collisions with power lines and electrocutions on power poles … and increase in poaching.”

The Interior Department is the second major federal agency to criticize the State Department’s draft environmental impact statement, a detailed look at the potential effects of the proposed pipeline on air, water, endangered species, communities and the economy. In April, the Environmental Protection Agency slammed the assessment, saying it failed to account for what could be considerable greenhouse gas emissions from the project and risks to aquifers along its route.

The Interior Department declined to comment on the letter, referring inquiries to the State Department.

The letter was sent April 29. But the State Department posted it to a website only last week, along with 100,000 other comments received at the same time.

“We look forward to continuing to work with the Department of Interior on the issues described in its letter,” a State Department official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss differences within the administration. “The Department of State continues to review the presidential permit application for the proposed Keystone XL pipeline in a rigorous, transparent and efficient manner.”

The State Department could issue its final environmental impact statement at any time. The Obama administration must then determine whether the pipeline serves the national interest, based not just on the State Department’s analysis, but those of other federal agencies too, such as the EPA and the Interior Department.

In June, President Obama noted the pipeline’s potential effect on climate change, saying, “Our national interest will be served only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution.”

TransCanada, the company that would own Keystone XL, said it was confident the State Department would still conclude the pipeline’s effect on the environment would be minimal.

Advertisement

“As our application shows, there are detailed steps we have taken to mitigate impacts on the environment, sensitive areas, wildlife and communities,” said TransCanada spokesman Shawn Howard. “There are already more than 12,000 pages of technical review that have been published on Keystone XL, and they have stated that there will be a minimal impact on environmental resources along the entire route.”

Most critics of Keystone XL have focused on the potential damage from an oil spill. The Interior Department letter warns of spills, but also highlights day-to-day negative environmental effects.

Advertisement

The letter cautions that birds, such as the least tern and the piping plover, could be threatened in a protected area of the Missouri River in Nebraska, about 40 miles from where Keystone XL would cross the Niobrara River. Changes in water level could affect the birds’ nesting activities, and they could be killed by flying into power lines and other new infrastructure.

The State Department draft analysis also says a fish called the pallid sturgeon would not be affected by “temporary water withdrawals” from rivers. But the Interior Department letter calls the statement unsupported.

The Interior Department also raised concern about how the pipeline might damage wetlands and archaeological sites. And it warned that Keystone XL could create light and noise pollution that could affect people and wildlife alike.

http://news.yahoo.com/government-moves-wrap-gray-wolf-084010826.html,,[],Government moves to wrap up gray wolf recovery,"TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) -- Federal officials are declaring victory in their four-decade campaign to rescue the gray wolf, a predator the government once considered a nuisance and tried to exterminate.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Friday proposed removing the animal's remaining protections as an endangered species across the Lower 48 states. The exception would be in the Southwest, where the recovery effort for the related Mexican gray wolf is lagging.

Despite criticism from some scientists and members of Congress who consider the move premature, agency director Dan Ashe said the wolf can thrive and even enlarge its territory without continued federal protection.

""Taking this step fulfills the commitment we've made to the American people — to set biologically sound recovery goals and return wolves to state management when those goals have been met and threats to the species' future have been addressed,"" Ashe said.

The proposal will be subject to a 90-day public comment period and a final decision made within a year.

Wolves once roamed across most of North America. But trapping, poisoning and aerial shooting encouraged by federal bounties left just one small remnant, in northern Minnesota, by the time they were placed on the protected list in 1974.

By then, attitudes had shifted. Wildlife managers acknowledged the role predators play in providing balanced ecosystems, and the then-new Endangered Species Act mandated protections.

More than 6,100 wolves have now spread across portions of 10 states, primarily in the Northern Rockies and the western Great Lakes regions. Most are in Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Packs also have formed in portions of Washington and Oregon, and individual wolves have been spotted in Colorado, Utah, the Dakotas, California and the Northeast.

But they have yet to return to vast additional territory that researchers say has suitable habitat and abundant prey, including parts of the Pacific Northwest, the southern Rocky Mountains, upstate New York and New England.

Story continues

Environmental groups say wolves could make their way to those places — but only if legal protections remain to prevent them from being shot. Removing them now would put wolves ""at serious risk for ever achieving natural recovery,"" said Diane Bentivegna of the National Wolfwatcher Coalition.

Colorado alone has enough space to support up to 1,000 wolves, according to Carlos Carroll of California's Klamath Center for Conservation Research. He suggested wildlife officials were bowing to political pressure, exerted by elected officials across the West who pushed to limit the wolf's range.

""They've tried to devise their political position first, and then cherry-pick their science to support it,"" Carroll said of the Fish and Wildlife Service.

Maggie Howell of the Wolf Conservation Center in South Salem, N.Y., said the Adirondack Mountains and other parts of the Northeast are ""screaming for a predator like the wolf"" to thin an out-of-control deer herd.

Ashe, however, said it's unrealistic to think wolves can return to all or even most of their former range, even if scientifically feasible.

""Science is an important part of this decision, but really the key is the policy question of when is a species recovered,"" he said. ""Does the wolf have to occupy all the habitat that is available to it in order for it to be recovered? Our answer to that question is no.""

The wolf's resurgence has been unpopular among ranchers and others unhappy about attacks on livestock and popular sport animals — even as hunters and trappers in the last several years killed some 1,600 wolves after protections were lifted in Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Government wildlife agents responding to livestock attacks have killed thousands more in recent decades.

Removing legal protections could ease the hostility in the West, where many ranchers complained they're helpless to protect their herds from marauding attackers.

Hunting advocates also have complained as elk herds dwindle in some areas.

""We can't just say, let them go and let the predators manage the big game. That's not going to work in this day and age,"" said David Allen, president of the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation.

Yet the former director of the Fish and Wildlife Service under President Bill Clinton said the agency's proposal ""is a far cry from what we envisioned for gray wolf recovery when we embarked on this almost 20 years ago.""

""It's a low bar for endangered species recovery,"" said Jamie Rappaport Clark, who was with the agency when wolves were reintroduced in Idaho and Wyoming in the mid-1990s. She now heads the group Defenders of Wildlife.

David Mech, a leading wolf expert and senior scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey in St. Paul, Minn., said wolves already occupy about 80 percent of the territory where people are likely to tolerate them.

The Center for Biological Diversity vowed to challenge the government in court if it takes the animals off the endangered list.

The Humane Society of the United States, which has filed a lawsuit challenging the removal of protections from Great Lakes wolves, is reviewing the government's latest proposal, spokesman Kaitlin Sanderson said.

Ashe said the plan had been reviewed by top administration officials, including new Interior Secretary Sally Jewell. But he dismissed any claims of interference and said the work that went into the plan was exclusively that of the Fish and Wildlife Service.

He said the agency wants to focus future recovery efforts on a small number of wolves belonging to a subspecies, the Mexican gray wolf. Those occur in Arizona and New Mexico, where a protracted and costly reintroduction plan has stumbled in part due to illegal killings.

The agency is calling for a tenfold increase in the territory where biologists are working to rebuild that population, which now numbers 73 animals. Law enforcement efforts to ward off poaching in the region would be bolstered.

In a speech at Georgetown University Tuesday, Obama will announce he's issuing a presidential memorandum to implement the regulations, meaning none of the steps involved in the plan will require congressional approval.

In addition, Obama will say he is directing his administration to allow enough renewables on public lands to power 6 million homes by 2020, effectively doubling the capacity from solar, wind and geothermal projects on federal property.

Obama also was to announce $8 billion in federal loan guarantees to spur investment in technologies that can keep carbon dioxide produced by power plants from being released into the atmosphere.

In taking action on his own, Obama is also signaling he will no longer wait for lawmakers to act on climate change, and instead will seek ways to work around them.

The linchpin of Obama's plan, and the step activists say will have the most dramatic impact, involves limits on carbon emissions for new and existing power plants. The Obama administration has already proposed controls on new plants, but those controls have been delayed and not yet finalized.

Tuesday's announcement will be the first public confirmation that Obama plans to extend carbon controls to coal-fired power plants that are currently pumping heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere.

""This is the holy grail,"" said Melinda Pierce of Sierra Club, an environmental advocacy group. ""That is the single biggest step he can take to help tackle carbon pollution.""

However, critics say that Obama's changes will create more problems for America's coal industry.

""This proposal will buttress an EPA proposed rule issued last year for new power plants that will essentially ban coal’s use in the future,"" Tom Borelli, a senior fellow at FreedomWorks, told FoxNews.com.

Forty percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, and one-third of greenhouse gases overall, come from electric power plants, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the Energy Department's statistical agency.

Obama is expected to lay out a broad vision Tuesday, without detailed emission targets or specifics about how they will be put in place. Instead, the president will launch a process in which the Environmental Protection Agency will work with states to develop specific plans to rein in carbon emissions, with flexibility for each state's circumstances.

Under one scenario envisioned by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, states could draw on measures such as clean energy sources, carbon-trapping technology and energy efficiency to reduce the total emissions released into the air.

Heather Zichal, Obama's senior energy and climate adviser, told environmental groups Monday that Obama is working with Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan on a target for renewable energy to be produced at federally assisted housing projects.

She framed the Obama's efforts in the U.S. as part of a broader, global movement to combat climate change, trumpeting the role the U.S. can play in leading other nations to stem the warming of the planet.

Paul Bledsoe, who worked on climate issues in the Clinton White House, said Zichal renewed a pledge Obama made in in his first year in office, during global climate talks in Copenhagen, to cut U.S. carbon emissions by about 17 percent by 2020, compared to 2005 levels.

""This is a policy fulfillment of what the president has been talking about and trying to accomplish for five years or more,"" said Bledsoe, now a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.

One key issue Obama is not expected to address Tuesday is Keystone XL, a pipeline that would carry oil extracted from tar sands in western Canada to refineries along the Texas Gulf Coast. A concerted campaign by environmental activists to persuade Obama to nix the pipeline as a ""carbon bomb"" appears to have gained little traction. The oil industry has been urging the president to approve the pipeline, citing jobs and economic benefits.

Obama raised climate change as a key second-term issue in his inaugural address in January, but has offered few details since. In his February State of the Union, he issued an ultimatum to lawmakers: ""If Congress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will.""

The poor prospects for getting any major climate legislation through a Republican-controlled House were on display last week when Speaker John Boehner responded to the prospect that Obama would put forth controls on existing power plants by deeming the idea ""absolutely crazy.""

""Why would you want to increase the cost of energy and kill more American jobs?"" said Boehner, R-Ohio, echoing the warnings of some industry groups.

Sidestepping Congress by using executive action doesn't guarantee Obama smooth sailing. Lawmakers could introduce legislation to thwart Obama's efforts. And the rules for existing power plants will almost certainly face legal challenges in court. The Supreme Court has upheld the EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, but how the EPA goes about that effort remains largely uncharted waters.

Even if legal and political obstacles are overcome, it will take years for the new measures to be put in place, likely running up against the end of Obama's presidency or even beyond it. White House aides say that's one reason Obama is ensuring the process starts now, while there are still more than three years left in his final term.

Under the process outlined in the Clean Air Act, the EPA cannot act unilaterally, but must work with states to develop the standards, said Jonas Monast, an attorney who directs the climate and energy program at Duke University. An initial proposal will be followed by a months-long public comment period before the EPA can issue final guidance to states. Then the states must create actual plans for plants within their borders, a process likely to take the better part of a year.

Then the EPA has another four months to decide whether to approve each state's plan before the implementation period can start.

Reps. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, and Chris Stewart, R-Utah, on Friday sent a letter to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy expressing concern over the proposed draft rule, which they say would give the agency “unprecedented control over private property across the nation.”

The rule, which aims to clarify the agency's regulatory jurisdiction over different types of water bodies, was sent to the Office of Management and Budget in September for review. The agency has said the scope of the proposal is limited to clearing up confusion caused by Supreme Court decisions involving the Clean Water Act.

The lawmakers claimed the agency is engaging in a ""rushed, politicized regulatory process"" and called for the EPA's independent science advisory board to review the science underlying the proposal.

""In light of the significant implications this action would have on the economy, property rights and state sovereignty, this process must be given more thought and deliberation to allow for important, statutorily-required, weighing of the scientific and technical underpinnings of the proposed regulatory changes,"" the lawmakers wrote.

In September, the agency released a report from its science advisory board analyzing the relationships between smaller, isolated bodies of water and larger ones. The report, which served as the basis for the proposal, concluded that streams and wetlands have important effects on downstream waters.

The EPA plans to accept public comments on the draft rule before finalizing it, but the agency has not indicated whether it will comply with the lawmakers' request to allow for an independent review of the science underpinning the rule.

“Any attempt to issue a proposed rule before completing an independent examination by the agency’s own science advisors would be to put the cart before the horse,” Smith and Stewart wrote.

In January, EPA critics and officials in Virginia scored a key victory in their legal battle with the agency over its attempt to regulate stormwater runoff that some described as a land takeover.

In the Virginia case, a federal judge ruled in favor of the state Department of Transportation and the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, which challenged EPA's restrictions on the flow of stormwater into a Fairfax County creek.

U.S. District Judge Liam O'Grady in Alexandria agreed with Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, who argued that the EPA was trying to regulate water itself as a pollutant. In his ruling, O'Grady said: ""Stormwater runoff is not a pollutant, so EPA is not authorized to regulate it.""

The EPA contended that water itself can be regulated as a pollutant if there's too much of it. The agency says heavy runoff is having a negative impact on Accotink Creek and that it has the regulatory authority to remedy the situation.

http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/02/23/6-underground-hanford-nuclear-tanks-leaking-washington-governor-says/,2013-02-23 00:00:00,[],6 underground tanks holding radioactive waste leaking in Washington state,"Six underground tanks holding a mix of radioactive and toxic waste are leaking at America’s most contaminated nuclear site in Washington, federal and state officials say, posing an eventual risk to groundwater and rivers.

The leaking materials at Hanford Nuclear Reservation are no immediate threat to public safety or the environment because it would take perhaps years for the chemicals to reach groundwater, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said Friday. So far, nearby monitoring wells haven't detected higher radioactivity levels.

But the leaks have renewed discussion over delays for emptying the tanks, which were installed decades ago and are long past their intended 20-year life span.

""None of these tanks would be acceptable for use today. They are all beyond their design life. None of them should be in service,"" said Tom Carpenter of Hanford Challenge, a Hanford watchdog group. ""And yet, they're holding two-thirds of the nation's high-level nuclear waste.""

Suzanne Dahl, the tank waste treatment manager for the Washington Department of Ecology, told Reuters that four of the tanks have leaked in the past.

""It points to the age of the tanks and how there's going to be an increased probability of this happening in the future,"" she said. ""When waste is in the tanks, it's manageable. Once it's out of the tanks and in the soil, it's much harder to manage it, remove it, and down the road you're adding to contamination in the groundwater that already exists.""

Just last week, state officials announced that one of Hanford's 177 tanks was leaking 150 to 300 gallons a year.

Inslee then traveled to Washington, D.C., to discuss the problem with federal officials, learning in meetings Friday that six tanks are leaking.

The declining waste levels in the six tanks were missed because only a narrow band of measurements was evaluated, rather than a wider band that would have shown the levels changing over time, Inslee said.

""It's like if you're trying to determine if climate change is happening, only looking at the data for today,"" he said. ""Perhaps human error, the protocol did not call for it. But that's not the most important thing at the moment. The important thing now is to find and address the leakers.""

Department of Energy spokeswoman Lindsey Geisler said there was no immediate health risk and that federal officials would work with Washington state to address the matter.

Regardless, Sen. Ron Wyden, the new chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, will ask the Government Accountability Office to investigate Hanford's tank monitoring and maintenance program, said his spokesman, Tom Towslee.

The federal government built the Hanford facility at the height of World War II as part of the Manhattan Project to build the atomic bomb. The remote site produced plutonium for the bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan, and continued supporting the nation's nuclear weapons arsenal for years.

Today, it is the most contaminated nuclear site in the country, still surrounded by sagebrush but with Washington's Tri-Cities of Richland, Kennewick and Pasco several miles downriver.

Several years ago, workers at Hanford completed two of three projects deemed urgent risks to the public and the environment, removing all weapons-grade plutonium from the site and emptying leaky pools that held spent nuclear fuel just 400 yards from the river.

But successes at the site often are overshadowed by delays, budget overruns and technological challenges. Nowhere have those challenges been more apparent than in Hanford's central plateau, home to the site's third most urgent project: emptying the tanks.

Hanford's tanks hold some 53 million gallons of highly radioactive waste -- enough to fill dozens of Olympic-size swimming pools -- and many of those tanks are known to have leaked in the past. An estimated 1 million gallons of radioactive liquid has already leaked there.

The cornerstone of emptying the tanks is a treatment plant that will convert the waste into glasslike logs for safe, secure storage. The plant, last estimated to cost more than $12.3 billion, is billions of dollars over budget and behind schedule. It isn't expected to being operating until at least 2019.

Washington state is imposing a ""zero-tolerance"" policy on radioactive waste leaking into the soil, Inslee said. So given those delays and the apparent deterioration of some of the tanks, the federal government will have to show that there is adequate storage for the waste in the meantime, he said.

""We are not convinced of this,"" he said. ""There will be a robust exchange of information in the coming weeks to get to the bottom of this.""

Inslee and Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber, both Democrats, have championed building additional tanks to ensure safe storage of the waste until the plant is completed.

Wyden, D-Ore., toured the site earlier this week. He said he shares the governors' concerns about the integrity of the tanks but he wants more scientific information to determine it's the correct way to spend scarce money.

Wyden noted the nation's most contaminated nuclear site -- and the challenges associated with ridding it of its toxic legacy -- will be a subject of upcoming hearings and a higher priority in Washington, D.C.

The federal government already spends $2 billion each year on Hanford cleanup -- one-third of its entire budget for nuclear cleanup nationally. The Energy Department has said it expects funding levels to remain the same for the foreseeable future, but a new Energy Department report released this week calls for annual budgets of as much as $3.5 billion during some years of the cleanup effort.

There are legal, moral and ethical considerations to cleaning up the Hanford site at the national level, Inslee said, adding that he will continue to insist that the Energy Department completely clean up the site.

Miraculously, despite the Pentagon’s affection for continuing to build things that have no earthly use in modern warfare, the government eventually cut back on the blimp program. But it kept the stockpile going at a helium reserve near Amarillo, Tex.

In 1996, during the Newt Gingrich era, Congress voted to go out of the helium business and let private enterprise take over as soon as the reserve paid off the money the government had sunk into it.

Hasn’t quite worked out. The debt is almost paid off, but the magic of the marketplace hasn’t kicked in. If the reserve closes now, the country loses 40 percent of its helium supply. So, last week, the House voted to extend the program. “Many people don’t believe that the federal government should be in the helium business, and I would agree,” said Hastings, as he pushed the bill to keep the government in the helium business.

There are two ways to look at this story. One is that it’s about the impossibility of ever actually stopping any government program. Former Representative Barney Frank, who said in 1996 that if Congress could not manage to get rid of the helium reserve “then we cannot undo anything,” hasn’t changed his mind. “Everybody is against waste, but strongly defends this or that particular piece,” Frank said in a phone interview.

He’s right. I have fond memories of listening to protests after Congress managed, with great effort, to end a totally useless subsidy on mohair. Most of the howls came from lawmakers from Texas, land of many mohair goats. “I have a mohair sweater! It’s my favorite one!” cried Republican Lamar Smith. The subsidy came creeping back a few years later.

But there’s another possible moral. The helium program is great; it provided the country with a crucial product that business wasn’t prepared to produce. It spurred economic growth and scientific research and made enough profit to pay the taxpayers back.

Maybe the only mistake was trying to pull the plug in the first place.

“The federal government going into helium in the 1920s I think was a fine thing,” said Holt. He looks upon the current bill not as a temporary fix but as “a validation” of government’s role in looking after things that the private sector is reluctant or afraid to take on.

The helium reserve, by the way, is still going to run dry in five or 10 years. Maybe private enterprise will step up to the plate. But if not, somebody’s going to have to organize one hell of a balloon recycling program."

(VIDEO)","An estimated 40,000 people gathered in Washington, D.C. on Sunday for the Forward on Climate Rally on the National Mall. The rally preceded a march to the White House to urge President Barack Obama to take action against climate change and reject the Keystone XL pipeline.

350.org founder Bill McKibben said at the rally, according to a statement, “For 25 years our government has basically ignored the climate crisis: now people in large numbers are finally demanding they get to work."" He added, ""We shouldn't have to be here -- science should have decided our course long ago. But it takes a movement to stand up to all that money.""

Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune, who was arrested last week protesting the Keystone XL pipeline in front of the White House, reiterated environmentalists' call for Obama and the State Department to reject the permit for TransCanada's international oil sands pipeline.

He said, “President Obama holds in his hand a pen and the power to deliver on his promise of hope for our children. Today, we are asking him to use that pen to to reject the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline, and ensure that this dirty, dangerous, export pipeline will never be built.”

Along with denying the pipeline's permit, organizers 350.org, Sierra Club and the Hip-Hop Caucus hope to see the president work to limit U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and transition to renewable energy.

Actor and environmentalist Robert Redford previously wrote about the planned rally, ""This is the beginning. The beginning of a real battle, for America's future."" Redford echoed activists' call for Obama to take action. ""President Barack Obama's legacy will rest squarely on his response, resolve, and leadership in solving the climate crisis.""

Natural Resources Defense Council President Frances Beinecke argued, ""The time is right for this rally."" In the wake of Obama's comments on climate change in his State of the Union Address, Beinecke wrote, ""We want him to know that when he takes these bold actions to stabilize the climate, the American people will support him every step of the way.""

Along with the rally in Washington, D.C., environmental groups planned simultaneous rallies in cities across the U.S. A rally in Los Angeles, California, organized by a coalition of over 90 groups, was expected to be the largest climate change rally ever staged in Los Angeles, according to an emailed Statement from the Sierra Club.

In his 2013 State of the Union Address, President Obama said, ""We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy, and the most severe drought in decades, and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence. Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science -- and act before it's too late."" While Obama's speech was marked by sweeping rhetoric, it included ""little detail on how to tackle climate change and propel green energy,"" noted The Huffington Post's Lynne Peeples."

USA TODAY

Two dozen people died in last week%27s twister

An estimated 1%2C200 homes were destroyed

President toured storm damage and met with families

MOORE, Okla. — During a firsthand look Sunday afternoon at the devastation from last week's violent tornado, President Obama praised Oklahomans for their resolve while consoling victims and promising continued help.

""I'm just a messenger here today, letting everybody here know that you are not alone, that you've got folks behind you,"" Obama said. ""Obviously, the damage here is pretty hard to comprehend. Our hearts go out to the families who have been impacted, including those who had loved ones who were lost.""

Obama, who flew from Washington to nearby Tinker Air Force Base, spent several hours in the area. He walked through one of the hardest-hit neighborhoods in the Oklahoma City suburb and toured the ruins of Plaza Towers Elementary School, which was destroyed. He later visited a local fire station that has been used as a command post. There he thanked first responders and met with families of seven children who died at the school.

Twenty-four people died in the storm, which has been classified as a top-of-the-scale EF5 and which cut a path 17 miles long and was at times more than a mile wide, turning entire city blocks into one big pile of rubble. Officials estimate as many as 1,200 homes were destroyed.

""This is a strong community with strong character,"" Obama said during his brief remarks, delivered against a backdrop of twisted and torn metal and concrete of Plaza Towers Elementary. ""There's no doubt they're going to bounce back — but they need help.""

A few minutes earlier, Obama had walked along Eagle Drive, a block from the elementary school. Along with local officials, including Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin and Moore Mayor Glenn Lewis, Obama walked slowly through the rubble, stopping several times to inspect the debris.

Obama spent a few moments with the Lewis family, which lost their home on SW 14th Street, just behind Plaza Towers Elementary. Before the tornado hit, Scott Lewis raced to retrieve son Zack, a third-grader at the school, in time to hunker down in the family's storm shelter.

""What a mess,"" Obama told Zack Lewis, adding, according to the Associated Press: ""You've got some story to tell. This is something you'll remember all your life.""

Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate also accompanied the tour. White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters in tow on Air Force One that 450 FEMA officials were working in the devastated area. In his remarks, Obama said 4,200 people had applied for disaster assistance and $3.4 million in payments had already been approved.

Fallin, a Republican, said Sunday she thanked Obama for visiting and for his support since the tornado struck. She noted that Obama signed a disaster declaration Monday night, within hours of the storm. Fallin also said she asked the president to ensure that FEMA's response wouldn't get bogged down by red tape as the focus in the Oklahoma City suburb of 41,000 turns to long-term recovery.

""The big thing is once the crowds leave we're going to continue to need help because this is not a one-time event,"" Fallin told reporters at Tinker Air Force Base as Obama departed. ""This is going to be ongoing for a long time.""

Obama said he was committed to continued support ""every step of the way,"" and assured Fallin: ""When we say we've got your back, I promise you, we keep our word.""

Obama also urged Americans to ""step up"" and donate to the American Red Cross disaster relief funds. As he arrived at what was left of the elementary school, he greeted Principal Amy Simpson, as well as Shelley McMillin, principal at nearby Briarwood Elementary, with hugs. In his remarks, he commended both school administrators.

""They were on the ground when this happened, and because of their quick response, their keeping a level head, their putting kids first saved a lot of people,"" Obama said. ""And they're still going through some tough times.""

Fallin called Obama's visit with families who'd lost children ""a very emotional time.""

""The families thanked him for coming and told him of their needs,"" Fallin said. ""He committed he would do whatever he could to help them.""

Noting that Moore is already printing new street signs to replace those ripped away by the tornado and highlighting the efforts of many volunteer organizations, Obama praised what he said has come to be known as the ""Oklahoma Standard,"" which he said Fallin described as an ability to respond to disasters ""and come out stronger on the other side.""

""That's what we've been seeing this week,"" Obama said.

Air Force One touched down at Tinker Air Force Base at 11:43 a.m., just ahead of schedule. Obama was greeted by local officials including Fallin and Rep. Tom Cole, a Republican who grew up in and lives in Moore.

Upon arrival and again just before departure, the president shook hands and spoke briefly with a group of Air Force personnel who were affected by the tornado. He also met with forecasters from the National Weather Service's Severe Weather Forecast Center. Obama credited their work — a tornado warning was issued 16 minutes before the tornado touched down, and 36 minutes before it struck Moore — with saving countless lives. Earnest said the average tornado warning time is 12 minutes.

Obama's visit caused traffic to come to a near standstill along nearby Interstate 35. As his motorcade rolled through Moore, hundreds lined the streets, waving and taking pictures.

Meanwhile, in the nearby neighborhoods, residents and volunteers continued clearing debris."

prev Image 2 of 2

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is facing a backlash from the left over ads that support drilling in Alaska and the Canada-to-Texas Keystone pipeline, as the young billionaire wades ever-deeper into charged political debates.

The daisy chain that connects Zuckerberg with the drilling ads starts with FWD.US, the bipartisan group Zuckerberg co-founded for the purpose of supporting immigration legislation. That organization gave money to a conservative group, Americans for a Conservative Direction, that aired a TV ad supporting South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. It also gave to a group that put up an ad backing drilling in Alaska.

Graham is among the eight senators who crafted the bipartisan immigration legislation now being debated on Capitol Hill. However, Graham appears in the ad criticizing President Obama for not approving the Keystone pipeline, which supporters say will help the United Sates achieve energy independence and critics say will be an environmental hazard.

“The president says I’m for ‘all of the above’ when it comes to energy,” Graham says in the 60-second spot. “Well, those are words coming out of his mouth. They don’t come from his heart. No Keystone pipeline. No drilling in the Gulf. At the end of the day, the economy is not doing well.”

The Sierra Club, Credo Action -- the activist arm of cell phone company CREDO Mobile -- and others have since launched a multi-front pressure campaign that includes a petition, a protest outside company headquarters and a Facebook graphic that reads: “Hey Zuck, pull your ads supporting Keystone XL.”

“The people on Facebook who made Mark Zuckerberg a billionaire need to know that he is using his fortune to bankroll pro-Keystone XL propaganda,"" said Becky Bond, CREDO’s political director.

Zuckerberg, one of the world’s most successful entrepreneurs, has never publicly revealed his political party affiliation.

But he has openly and generously spent his money across the political landscape on causes he deems worthy and in support of politicians who share his ideas on economic and education reform, including New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie, for whom he held a fundraiser in February.

FWD.US has answered the recent criticism by saying the group is trying to deliver its message to the wide range of voters.

The group “is committed to showing support for elected officials who promote the policy changes needed to build the knowledge economy,” said FWD.US spokeswoman Kate Hansen. “Maintaining two separate entities, Americans for a Conservative Direction and the Council for American Job Growth, to support elected officials across the political spectrum – separately – means that we can more effectively communicate with targeted audiences of their constituents.”

Beyond comprehensive immigration reform, FWD.US also supports education reform and expanded scientific research, with other co-founders including Joe Green of NationBuilder and LinkedIn’s Reid Hoffman.

Council for American Job Growth is led by Democratic strategists, but has a TV ad in which Alaska Sen. Mark Begich, a Democrat seeking 2014 re-election in a largely conservative state, supports drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

The group Public Citizen argues that such support is “surprising,” pointing to a 2010 Greenpeace blog post in which Zuckerman tells Facebook followers that new offices in Oregon will go from coal to hydro power, adding “were moving in the right direction here.”

They also cite an op-ed Zuckerberg wrote last month announcing the group in which he said the economy of the last century was “primarily based on natural resources” and a zero-sum situation in which “if someone else had an oil field, then you did not.”

Credo has also taken its protest one step further by starting a campaign that calls on protesters to pledge to risk arrest if President Obama moves forward with a plan to approve the pipeline.

The group says at least 60,000 people have already signed the pledge."

When Davenport told the Associated Press he was deeply concerned about the havoc ethanol production was causing to these lands, he got an email from Tom Vilsack, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture. The message was to stop talking.

Vilsack wants to make sure all are in line: “We just want to have a consistent message on the topic.” Recently, he insisted to an audience of ethanol lobbyists on Capitol Hill that being for ethanol is a good thing. In contrast, environmentalists argue that the push for ethanol has increased prices for corn, incentivizing farmers to convert millions of acres of erodible land for the planting of additional corn fields. This practice has ruined the lands, poisoned streams, and devastated fragile eco-systems.

Converting corn to ethanol was conceived as a “green” program to decrease fossil fuel emissions and to therefore aid in the reduction of global warming. Unfortunately, “green” programs sometimes don’t turn out so green. The mandate which dictates that gasoline have a certain percentage of ethanol has proven to be ineffectual when looking at the overall energy equation in America.

Since Barak Obama came into office five years ago, he has proselytized and created policy encouraging farmers to reap the rewards of ethanol production. As a result, five million acres of green grassy rolling hills that had been reserved for conservation purposes are gone. Moreover, the process of growing this vast amount of corn draws upon countless other energy sources, using excessive water resources and increased natural gas and coal usage. The rise in fertilizer usage has amplified nitrates and nitrogen in water streams, creating aquatic dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico.

Sadly, children have also been stricken with “blue baby” syndrome as a result of the nitrate poisoning.

All of this leads to the conclusion that this slaughter of our environment is not only destructive but pointless. In a Congressional report on the effects of ethanol production, the EPA indicated it was “uncertain” that farmers should plant on land set aside for conservation, while the Department of Energy was resolute, saying conservation land “is unsuitable for use for annual row crop production.”

Bob Sussman, retired EPA senior policy counsel, lamented, “I don’t remember anybody having great passion for this.” He added, “I don’t have a lot of personal enthusiasm for the program.”"

Wald']",Divisive Debate on Need for More Nuclear Safeguards,"Many of these lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, have received significant campaign contributions from the industry. For instance, Mr. Barrow’s top contributor in the 2012 election was the Southern Company, a Georgia-based utility that is a major player in nuclear power. Some of the lawmakers also have nuclear reactors in their districts, a major source of tax revenue and jobs.

The appointment books for certain commission members, reviewed by The New York Times, show frequent meetings with the industry, including private sessions at the commission’s headquarters. Nuclear industry opponents occasionally have had their own private meetings, but not nearly as often, the records show.

E-mails obtained by The Times also demonstrate the teamlike approach taken by the industry and the regulators in dealing with safety questions, as they have worked behind the scenes with the Nuclear Energy Institute, the leading trade association, to try to prevent a reaction against nuclear power in the aftermath of the Fukushima accident.

“It would be nice if the industry was even more proactive by having N.E.I. send us a letter that says something to the effect that in the wake of the Japanese disaster here is a list of all the things the commercial U.S. nuclear licensees are doing,” wrote Brian Sheron, the head of nuclear regulatory research at the regulatory commission, in an e-mail to his colleagues, referring to the Nuclear Energy Institute.

Mr. Sheron, in a statement, said he was prodding the industry, not trying to protect it, as he realizes the “industry never seems to want to aggressively get out in front of issues.” Since the accident in Japan, American regulators have imposed several mandates on the industry but none are likely to cost the industry much money, industry officials said.

The filtered vent proposal, by far the most expensive, would be required only on boiling water reactors like Nine Mile Point, which are considered much more prone to leaking during an accident because they have unusually small primary containment chambers and pressure can build quickly.

But how well the filters work is unclear because the vents to which they would be attached have never been used successfully in an accident at a modern commercial reactor, experts said. The vents failed at Fukushima, which would have rendered filters moot. A panel of independent senior advisers to the commission opposes a strict requirement for filters."
http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/energy-secretary-chu-steps-down-blasts-climate-change-170625879--politics.html,,[],"Energy Secretary Chu steps down, blasts climate-change skeptics","Energy Secretary Steven Chu, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist frequently the target of Republican criticism, announced Friday that he was stepping down in the latest shake-up of President Barack Obama's Cabinet. Chu, who disclosed his decision in a letter to Energy Department staff, frequently clashed with GOP lawmakers over gas prices as well as government backing for green-energy companies like the failed firm Solyndra.

In his letter, Chu took aim directly at his critics, saying the clean-energy efforts were a success—and blasted climate-change skeptics as trapped in ""the Stone Age.""

""While critics try hard to discredit the program, the truth is that only one percent of the companies we funded went bankrupt,"" he wrote. ""That one percent has gotten more attention than the 99 percent that have not.""

Chu added: ""The test for America’s policy makers will be whether they are willing to accept a few failures in exchange for many successes. America’s entrepreneurs and innovators who are leaders in the global clean energy race understand that not every risk can—or should—be avoided. Michelangelo said, 'The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.'""

He also scolded climate-change skeptics and urged a shift from fossil-fuels to other sources of energy.

""The overwhelming scientific consensus is that human activity has had a significant and likely dominant role in climate change,"" Chu warned in his letter. ""There is also increasingly compelling evidence that the weather changes we have witnessed during this thirty year time period are due to climate change.""

Chu underlined that China was pushing ahead with clean-energy investments—outpacing U.S. efforts.

""While we cannot accurately predict the course of climate change in the coming decades, the risks we run if we don’t change our course are enormous. Prudent risk management does not equate uncertainty with inaction,"" he said. ""The Stone Age did not end because we ran out of stones; we transitioned to better solutions.""

Story continues

In a written statement, Obama praised Chu for giving the Energy Department ""a unique understanding of both the urgent challenge presented by climate change and the tremendous opportunity that clean energy represents for our economy.""

Obama added, ""And during his time as Secretary, Steve helped my Administration move America towards real energy independence. Over the past four years, we have doubled the use of renewable energy, dramatically reduced our dependence on foreign oil, and put our country on a path to win the global race for clean energy jobs. I wish him all the best.""

Chu will likely stay in his post through the end of February, though it will depend on the confirmation of his successor."
http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130524-creating-our-cities-from-waste,2013-05-24 00:00:00,['Mitchell Joachim'],Turning waste into building blocks of the future city,"Cities were invented for a multitude of purposes. First was the need for the concentration of vital resources in a given region - then came their role as places for worship, trade, governmental control and military defence. But in our modern age, urban spaces were conceived and shaped primarily around mass market industrialisation.

Today the consequences of the post-industrial city have had an incredible impact on the environment. It is widely accepted cities impinge on areas well beyond their borders. Waste streams in cities are the leading factor in pollution of the areas outside their geo-political boundaries.

Urban waste must be reconfigured – our time has run out. Reports of garbage problems from Naples in Italy to Beijing in China underscore the size of the problem. Landfills are filled and incinerators have the potential to release poisons such as dioxin. We must have a new strategy towards refuse in urban places, one that includes the design of consumables in the first place. Many concepts exist already, but what are some of the most radical solutions to our wasteful ways?

Recently, the planet reached 400 parts per million of carbon in the atmosphere for the first time since modern humans evolved. Reversing such wasteful habits will require tremendous effort, as minuscule changes will not alter this course. Humanity has reached its peak of one-way consumption.

Now is the time to design waste to regenerate our cities. What are the possibilities for urban environments after our aged infrastructure is recalibrated? How might bigger cities and waste mix? One key idea is that waste is not recycled through infrastructural mechanisms but instead up-cycled in perpetuity.

All over the globe municipal waste is on the rise. In China, the amount of municipal solid waste produced is rising by 6% per year. It has kept pace with the rapid urbanization in China. Many parts of South America are also rapidly urbanising and their waste has grown with it. Brazilian cities have had a steady 10% increase in waste headed for landfills. India will see a 500% increase in e-waste – materials from cell phones, TVs, refrigerators – destined for urban landfills. A lot of it is imported from developed countries. South Africa and China will also have to deal with 400% more garbage from foreign e-waste.

Mankind will have to solve our waste problem in cities. If we don’t, it’ll be the end of us. There are a number of possible solutions, and some of them are already being adopted.

Super-sized waste

The first credible step is to reduce trash by considering the life cycle of objects we make. Things that are designed for obsolescence should be outlawed. Additionally, products must be manufactured with the intent to reuse, disassemble, take back or upcycle. For instance, instead of tossing out bottles we could adapt them for use as planters, lighting fixtures, building wall elements.

Other cities have highly organised systems to solve these problems. In Zurich, the city requires individuals pay handsomely for waste that is simply discarded, while thorough recycling is encouraged by free citywide collection services. Therefore well over 90% of municipal waste inside Zurich is recycled and sent to incinerators to produce energy. Burning waste is not the answer but it does have opportunities in the mid-term. It requires substantial need for enforceable regulations, comprehensive industry controls, economic feasibility plans, and the latest ultra-expensive technology such as plasma gasification plants.

In similarly developed cities - Malmo, Tokyo, or Copenhagen – it makes sense to use a waste-to-energy processes. These prevailing urban populations are stable and easily taxed to support such a system – not so easy in developing cities such as Lagos or Jakarta.

Outreach programs that invite the public to observe civic waste systems as a spectacle are instrumental in spreading awareness. The Hangzhou Environmental Group in China has over 10,000 tourists a year visiting its landfill facility. Freshkills landfill in New York will be transformed into the largest public park in over 100 years that will showcase engineered nature from waste. Cuba, an island nation that has been cut-off from trade imports, has conserved almost everything through carful recycling of parts - from 1950’s cars to eyeglasses, nothing is wasted.

Look at how such a system might affect the US. America is the lead creator of waste on the earth, making approximately 30% of the world's trash and tossing out around three-quarters of a ton per US citizen per year. It seems value has devolved into rampant waste production: mega-products scaled for super-sized franchise brands, big-box retail, XXL jumbo paraphernalia and so on. The US mindset is typifying a throwaway consumer culture. Where does it all end up? Heather Rogers said in her investigative book Gone Tomorrow that throwing things away is unsustainable. The first step we must take is reduction – meaning a massive discontinuation of objects designed for obsolescence. Then we need a radical reuse plan. Our waste crisis is immense. What is our call to action?

New York City is currently disposing of nearly 33,000 tons of waste per day. Previously, most of this discarded material ended up in Fresh Kills on Staten Island, before operations were blocked. Manhattan’s inhabitants discard enough paper products to fill the Empire State Building every two weeks. Terreform ONE’s Rapid Re(f)use and Homeway projects strive to capture, reduce and redesign New York’s refuse infrastructure. The initiative imagines an extended city reconstituted from its own junked materials. The concept remakes the city by using all the trash entombed in the Fresh Kills landfill. Theoretically, the method should produce, at minimum, seven new Manhattan Islands. New York City’s premier landfill was started by the divisive urban planner Robert Moses and driven by apathetic workers and machines. Now, guided by a prudent community with smart equipment, we must reshape it.

‘Smart trash’

How could this work? Outsized automated 3-D printers could be modified to rapidly process trash and to complete the task within decades. These potential automatons would be entirely based on existing techniques commonly used in industrial waste compaction devices. To accomplish this job, nothing drastically new needs to be invented. Most technologies are intended to be off-the-shelf. Instead of machines that crush objects into cubes, compaction devices could benefit from adjustable jaws that would craft simple shapes into smart ‘puzzle blocks’ for assembly. The blocks of waste material could be predetermined, using computational geometries, in order to fit domes, archways, lattices, windows, or whatever patterns would be needed. Different materials could serve specified purposes: transparent plastic for fenestration, organic compounds for temporary decomposable scaffolds, metals for primary structures and so on. Eventually, the future city would make no distinction between waste and supply.

If you think this sounds familiar, it is. Think back to the 2008 Pixar animation WALL-E. At approximately the same time that Rapid R(e)fuse was initiated, the movie was announced. WALL-E’s name is an acronym: Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth Class. Left behind by mankind, he toils with trillions of tons of non-recycled inner-city trash. He tirelessly configures mountains of discarded material. Why pyramids of trash? WALL-E’s daily perpetual feats seem almost futile. The film omits exactly why he is programmed to pile refuse; and there is the shortcoming.

There’s a deeper motivation for stacking refuse. What if the rubbish was refabricated to become real urban spaces or buildings? If it is plausible to adapt current machinery, how much material is available? At first sight, any sanitary landfill may be viewed as an ample supply of building materials. Heavy industrial technologies crush cars or to automatically sort out garbage are readily available. 3-D printing has exhausting capabilities if adjusted to larger scales. This is where Terreform ONE’s city began.

The envisioned city would be derived from trash; not ordinary trash, but ‘smart refuse’. A significant factor of the city composed from smart refuse is ‘post-tuning’ – and we would have to adapt this raw material for use. Integration into the city texture would be a learning process. In time, the responses would eventually become more attuned to the needs of the urban dweller. This new city may be built from trash, but it will also be connected via computers. The buildings blocks will learn.

Cities, unlike machines, are similar to a complex ecology. Ecology is capable of achieving a continuous harmonious state, or even further, a positive intensification. If ecological models are productively everlasting, urban models can logically follow.

They spell out for their fellow Republicans what the rest of the world and sane people in this country have known for quite some time now, basically borrowing Meteor Blades' delay is denial playbook.



We can have both a strong economy and a livable climate. All parties know that we need both. The rest of the discussion is either detail, which we can resolve, or purposeful delay, which we should not tolerate.

While you're at it, these high profile Republicans seem to say to their chickenhawk colleagues, don't just evolve a little bit towards being a timid non-denier, don't just get on board with the President's proposal, but help to work towards the much bolder actions and solutions that we need to implement to give us a chance to have some sort of a livable future on planet Earth.



Mr. Obama’s plan is just a start. More will be required. But we must continue efforts to reduce the climate-altering pollutants that threaten our planet. The only uncertainty about our warming world is how bad the changes will get, and how soon. What is most clear is that there is no time to waste.

The new Interior Department proposal, which is subject to 30 days of public comment and further revision, disappointed environmental advocates, who had pushed for full disclosure of the chemicals used in the drilling process and tougher standards for groundwater protection and well integrity.

The new rule allows oil companies to keep some components of their drilling fluids secret and will allow them to run well integrity tests on one representative well rather than all wells in a field where the geology and well construction techniques are similar.

The proposed regulation, which revises one proposed a year ago, also allows drillers to comply with state regulations in places where federal officials deem them as tough or tougher than the applicable federal rules."

Editor’s Note: Ira Shapiro is the author of “The Last Great Senate: Courage and Statesmanship in Times of Crisis” (PublicAffairs). He was a former Senate staffer and served in the Clinton administration as a trade official.

The new year has hardly set in and a consensus has formed that the polarization and dysfunction gripping Washington will inevitably continue. A headline in Politico summed it up well: “New Congress with Same Old Problems.” Fareed Zakaria wrote about “America’s political failure” and the specter of our political system “seizing up.” Ezra Klein went one step further, commenting that “while the 112th Congress was surely one of the most broken and incompetent in our history, the worst is probably yet to come.”

Everyone can describe the factors that produced America’s vitriolic political culture. We are well aware of the various possible remedies, like passing a constitutional amendment on campaign finance, embracing open primaries, establishing commissions to prevent gerrymandered districts, or setting up a requirement of universal voting. But these ideas are many years away if attainable at all.

There is only one prospect for real change in our national politics. America urgently needs a rejuvenated Senate, which has to return to being, as Walter Mondale once described it: “the nation’s mediator.” The good news is that could actually happen.

Opinion: GOP holding U.S. economy hostage on debt

The 2012 Senate elections were a landslide for the Democrats, who won 25 out of 33 elections, gaining blue states and red states, sweeping nine of the 10 most hotly contested elections and bringing in a record 20 female senators.

The Senate results can be read as a repudiation of extremism and obstructionism, strengthening the hand of Senate Democrats while freeing the moderate and conservative Senate Republicans from the death grip of blind loyalty to Grover Norquist, the NRA or the tea party. Republican insiders have already indicated their interest in nominating candidates who might win general elections rather than extreme candidates destined to be defeated.

As America’s economic potential remains enviable, our political dysfunction threatens to undermine it. The fiscal cliff was barely averted, but the battles over our economic future will recommence almost immediately. The nation is still stunned by the horrific killings in Newtown and shaken by the implications of Hurricane Sandy.

The country yearns for responsible adult leadership. President Obama will provide it, but he needs the cooperation and engagement of Congress, which the Republican House has proven it cannot offer. The Senate is the only realistic partner to the president in seeking constructive solutions to the nation’s challenges on guns, climate change and immigration.

Most importantly, no one should underestimate the commitment of the senators to our country, and the anger and frustration they share about the Senate.

Across the political spectrum, from liberals like Barbara Mikulski, D-Maryland, to conservatives like Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, there is a demand for “regular order” – legislation that results from committee consideration, vigorous debate and the opportunity to offer amendments and to reach principled compromises. The Senate has a handful of members deeply committed to absolute obstruction, but the overwhelming majority of its members sought the office for the opportunity to address the country’s challenges in a serious way. They know what the Senate is supposed to be, they hate what it has become and now they have the chance to rebuild it.

Many Americans doubt that the current crop of senators measures up to the stalwarts of the past. No one admires the great senators of the 1960s and 1970s more than I do. But the Senate that convened in the first week of January combines many capable veteran legislators, promising young senators and exciting new arrivals. They can change the status quo.

For example, even in the midst of gridlock in 2012, Democrat Barbara Boxer of California and Republican Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma reached agreement on a major transportation bill, and Democrat Tom Harkin of Iowa and Republican Mike Enzi of Wyoming forged compromises to produce a far-reaching food safety legislation.

Our senators would do well to take a page from history. In “The Passage of Power,” his latest volume on LBJ, Robert Caro reminds us that in 1963, exactly 50 years ago, the Senate was paralyzed. It was unable to move on even the tax cut proposed by President Kennedy. But the television coverage of fire hoses and police dogs being turned on peaceful civil rights demonstrators, which changed the nation’s consciousness, followed by the trauma of President Kennedy’s assassination, and Lyndon Johnson’s extraordinary leadership, transformed the Senate. Congress produced the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and a number of great legislative accomplishments. It doesn’t take much time, or that many people, to change the Senate.

So much depends on the quality of leadership. We remember the profound impact of Lyndon Johnson, Mike Mansfield, Everett Dirksen and Howard Baker on the Senate. The current Senate leaders, Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell, did not create the hyperpartisan Senate, but it got undeniably worse on their watch. Now, their places in history are on the line. They can be judged failures and quickly forgotten, or they can be remembered as the leaders who played a crucial role in restoring the Senate to its special place in our country. I wouldn’t bet against them making the right choice.

Reid has already committed to spearheading needed reforms to the Senate rules, and appears to have wisely decided against ramming through rules changes by a majority vote. McConnell already played an essential role in the last-minute compromise that averted the fiscal cliff, and in doing so, produced an 89-8 Senate vote for the compromise. He remains the key: Will he use his considerable savvy to obstruct, as he did for most of the last four years, or to reach the hard, principled compromises that major legislative accomplishments demand?

Pessimistic observers of our political scene believe that ultimately the Senate can only mirror our deep national divisions. I think this view oversimplifies the complex relationship between voters and their elected representatives.

The senators are supposed to rise above our divisions to find common ground, and by the act of doing so, contribute to rebuilding public confidence and healing a fractured nation. If the Senate returns to being “the nation’s mediator,” the results of its work can pass the Republican House the way the “fiscal cliff” deal did – by a decisive vote among Democrats, coupled with a minority of the Republicans.

The men and women in today’s Senate have a rare privilege and a special opportunity. They are United States senators. They walk where the greats once walked, and it’s time they make us proud again.

It seems vlear to me that they are determined to destroy science and replace it with their own thing which is a sophisticated, modern propaganda and mind control machine. We already know that the press is easily used by these people, but Mann has exposed some of the depths to which it has descended.

I want to credit him for his willingness to tell his own story in a way that helps us see beyond him as an individual player in all this and turns our eyes toward the extent of the threat his experience has taught him about. His book is a warning. It can be a call to action, in spite of the fact that that is not his mode.

In case you do not yet know who he is :

Michael E. Mann is a member of the Penn State University faculty, holding joint positions in the Departments of Meteorology and Geosciences and the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute (ESSI). He is also director of the Penn State Earth System Science Center (ESSC). He received his undergraduate degrees in physics and applied math from the University of California at Berkeley, an M.S. degree in physics from Yale University, and a Ph.D. in geology and geophysics from Yale University. He also received an outstanding publication award from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and, in 2002, was named one of fifty leading visionaries in science and technology by Scientific American. He was awarded the 2012 Hans Oeschger Medal of the European Geosciences Union, and in the same year was inducted as a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union. With Lee Kump, he coauthored the book Dire Predictions: Understanding Global Warming, and is a cofounder and avid contributor to the award-winning science website, www.RealClimate.org. Along with other scientists who participated in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, he jointly received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.

In its 2001 report on global climate, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of the United Nations prominently featured the “Hockey Stick,” a chart showing global temperature data over the past one thousand years. The Hockey Stick demonstrated that temperature had risen with the increase in industrialization and use of fossil fuels. The inescapable conclusion was that worldwide human activity since the industrial age had raised CO2 levels, trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and warming the planet. The Hockey Stick became a central icon in the “climate wars,” and well-funded science deniers immediately attacked the chart and the scientists responsible for it. Yet the controversy has had little to do with the depicted temperature rise and much more with the perceived threat the graph posed to those who oppose governmental regulation and other restraints to protect our environment and planet. Michael E. Mann, lead author of the original paper in which the Hockey Stick first appeared, shares the real story of the science and politics behind this controversy. He introduces key figures in the oil and energy industries, and the media front groups who do their bidding in sometimes slick, bare-knuckled ways to cast doubt on the science. Mann concludes with an account of the “Climategate” scandal, the 2009 hacking of climate scientists’ emails. Throughout, Mann reveals the role of science deniers, abetted by an uninformed media, in once again diverting attention away from one of the central scientific and policy issues of our time.

First, I would like to summarize some of the recent developments in the controversy over whether or not humans have created a climate catastrophe. One of the key aspects that the United Nations, environmental groups and the media have promoted as the “smoking gun” of proof of catastrophic global warming is the so-called ‘hockey stick’ temperature graph by climate scientist Michael Mann and his colleagues. This graph purported to show that temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere remained relatively stable over 900 years, then spiked upward in the 20th century presumably due to human activity. Mann, who also co-publishes a global warming propaganda blog reportedly set up with the help of an environmental group, had his “Hockey Stick” come under severe scrutiny. The “hockey stick” was completely and thoroughly broken once and for all in 2006. Several years ago, two Canadian researchers tore apart the statistical foundation for the hockey stick. In 2006, both the National Academy of Sciences and an independent researcher further refuted the foundation of the

“hockey stick.”



Hardly the credentials of a modern hero? Wait just a bit and I'll explain why he is. His book is described this way by Columbia U. Press:You can google your heart out and you will find garbage like thisThis is but one example of the lies and deceit out there on the web. These blogs and postings are part of a coordinated effort financed by the oils and coal industries, among others, linked into a right wing dominated set of publications and news channels.

Mann describes the way they work. It is something that makes the Nazi propaganda machine look primitive. To counter this, without the massive amounts of funding the deniers have, Mann created RealClimate, a blog where rapid responses to the lies and organized attacks could be countered.

RealClimate is a commentary site on climate science by working climate scientists for the interested public and journalists. We aim to provide a quick response to developing stories and provide the context sometimes missing in mainstream commentary.

NSF IG report on Michael Mann investigation: “No research misconduct. Case closed.” Don't bother telling Rick Perry.

Posted on August 22, 2011 by Rick Piltz

This is getting old. Completing yet another investigation of the co-author of a seminal study of the 1,000-year temperature record (commonly referred to as the “Hockey Stick”), the National Science Foundation Inspector General concluded: “Finding no research misconduct or other matter raised by the various regulations and laws discussed above, this case is closed.” But don’t waste your breath telling that to global warming denialist Rick Perry, oil-money governor of Texas and would-be president. See Joe Romm, Climate Progress: Climate Secret: NSF Quietly Closes Out Inspector General Investigation with Complete Vindication of Michael Mann Two things we know with extremely high confidence: 1. Recent warming is unprecedented in magnitude and speed and cause (so the temperature history looks like a Hockey Stick).

2. Michael Mann, the lead author on the original Hockey Stick paper, is one of the nation’s top climatologists and a source of first-rate analysis. We know these things because both the Hockey Stick and Mann have been independently investigated and vindicated more times than any other facet of climate science or any other climate scientist.

The investigation after investigation all over the world have been going on for years and often have to be duplicated because the deniers simply ignore their results. here's one example from Climate Science watch I could go on and on but by now you should have the picture. Please read this book. It is the scariest story ever written as a straightforward narrative of modern history. We can tell which way the wind is blowing by reading this weatherman!"

In', 'Cart', 'Colleague Bettina Boxall Won The Pulitzer Prize For Explanatory Reporting. She Left The Times In']",28 solar workers sickened by valley fever in San Luis Obispo County,"Epidemiologists are investigating an outbreak of valley fever that has sickened 28 workers at two large solar-power construction sites in San Luis Obispo County.

Staff from the California Department of Public Health, and investigators from the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health and San Luis Obispo County visited the sites near the Carrizo Plain two months ago, officials said.

They identified the sites as the Topaz Solar Farm and California Valley Solar Ranch, two large-scale photovoltaic power plants whose construction often requires considerable scraping and clearing to make way for thousands of acres of solar panels.

Valley fever, also known as Coccidioidomycosis, is contracted by breathing in fungal spores released when desert soils are disturbed. The illness is prevalent in many areas of the California desert and is common among agricultural workers and construction crews. It is not contagious.

Meanwhile, the state is attempting to stem an outbreak of valley fever that has resulted in dozens of deaths among prisoners in Central Valley prisons since 2006, according to an analysis conducted by Dr. John Galgiani, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Arizona and a valley fever expert. Federal officials this week ordered the relocation to other prisons of more than 3,000 inmates considered vulnerable to the illness.

Galgiani said in an interview that he was unsure what was causing the cases, but he called upon state officials to contact the CDC for assistance in what he termed a “public health emergency.”

Among the workers at the solar panel sites, less than half develop flu-like symptoms that include a cough, fever, chest pains and muscle aches that can persist for weeks. In extreme cases, valley fever can cause death, usually among patients with compromised immune systems.

State officials did not provide details about who contracted the illness at the solar sites, or where they live, citing medical privacy laws. But at least one case involves an electrical worker at the California Valley project.

Mark Simonin, business manager for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 639 in San Luis Obispo, said the electrician was digging into the ground with a claw hammer and inhaled dust. Simonin said the man became ill and a subsequent blood test confirmed valley fever.

The worker required breathing therapy treatment but didn’t miss any time off the job, Simonin said.

Although respirators can prevent valley fever, workers laboring in harsh desert heat find the large commercial masks uncomfortable and are reluctant to wear them, Simonin said. He said the developer has done a good job keeping dust down on the site.

The threat of acquiring the respiratory illness extends to residents living near expansive construction sites. That risk is rising given the scope of the renewable energy boom centered in the state. Scores of solar projects are planned for millions of acres across California’s Mojave Desert and elsewhere.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced in March that valley fever cases in the Southwest have increased by 90% from 1998 to 2011. California’s increase mirrors that, with reported cases growing 71% over the decade 2001 to 2011.

Valley fever is a serious health issue and cases are required to be reported to state and federal health authorities. It is fatal in about 1% of cases.

A journal article published last year examined national death records from 1990 to 2008 and found 3,089 instances in which valley fever was the underlying or contributing cause of death. Nearly half of those deaths — 1,451 — occurred in California.

In 2010 at the Orlando park, killer whale Tilikum snatched trainer Dawn Brancheau from a platform and thrashed her around underwater until she died. Federal workplace investigators later cited SeaWorld, saying trainers were exposed to hazards because they were allowed unprotected contact with the killer whales.

In the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on Tuesday, SeaWorld Entertainment’s attorney Eugene Scalia -- son of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia -- took issue with the way a clause in the Occupational Safety and Health Act was applied to SeaWorld.

The General Safety Clause requires that employers provide a workplace that’s free from hazards that could cause death or serious physical harm to employees. However, as the plaintiffs argue in briefs filed with the court, the clause “cannot be used to force a company to change the very product that it offers to the public, and the business it is in.”

For SeaWorld, its business is close contact, Scalia argued. Close contact is defined as trainers being more than knee-deep in the water.

“SeaWorld exists to offer the opportunity to view that close interaction between whales and people. That is its product that it’s offering,” Scalia said in court.

For that reason, he argued, OSHA can’t prohibit SeaWorld from allowing such contact between trainers and whales.

According to a recording of the proceedings posted on the court’s website, Scalia told the three-judge panel: “It’s as if the federal government came in and told the NFL that close contact on the football field would have to end because, after all, more people are injured in the NFL on any given Sunday than were injured in the 22-year period that OSHA looked at in this case.”

Amy Tryon, an attorney representing the Department of Labor, argued that close contact posed a serious risk to trainers.

On Feb. 24, 2010, Brancheau, an experienced trainer, was snatched by Tilikum while she was rubbing his nose after a show, then dragged underwater and killed as audience members watched. Tilikum had been involved in two other deaths, including one at the water park in 1999.

“SeaWorld’s training program does not take the predatory instinct out of these animals,” Tryon said, according to the recording.

Collectively, the SeaWorld parks in Orlando, San Antonio and San Diego house the world’s largest collection of killer whales.

Tryon agreed that making the NFL switch to tag or touch football would likely put an entire industry out of business. However, she said close contact isn’t essential to SeaWorld’s product.

Since Brancheau’s death, SeaWorld has continued to offer killer whale shows every day in all three SeaWorld parks, but trainers do not enter the water beyond knee-level, SeaWorld Entertainment communications vice president told the Los Angeles Times.

That change at SeaWorld, Tryon argued, proves that the ban on close contact does not run the risk of shutting down an industry. The Times reported in August that park attendance was down 6% in the first half of 2013.

“It has not put SeaWorld out of business,” she said.

The treatment of orcas in captivity has received increased attention in recent months with the release of the documentary “Blackfish,” which critically tracks the years Tilikum has spent performing in aquatic parks.

Arguments before the judges concluded Tuesday. A ruling will likely be reached in a few months.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/06/25/obama-planning-to-sidestep-congress-for-next-phase-in-climate-change-agenda/,2013-06-25 00:00:00,[],Obama planning to sidestep Congress for next phase in climate change agenda,"President Obama will announce Tuesday he is planning to sidestep Congress to implement a national plan to combat climate change that will include the first-ever federal regulations on carbon dioxide emitted by existing power plants, despite adamant opposition from Republicans and some energy producers.

In a speech at Georgetown University Tuesday, Obama will announce he's issuing a presidential memorandum to implement the regulations, meaning none of the steps involved in the plan will require congressional approval.

In addition, Obama will say he is directing his administration to allow enough renewables on public lands to power 6 million homes by 2020, effectively doubling the capacity from solar, wind and geothermal projects on federal property.

Obama also was to announce $8 billion in federal loan guarantees to spur investment in technologies that can keep carbon dioxide produced by power plants from being released into the atmosphere.

In taking action on his own, Obama is also signaling he will no longer wait for lawmakers to act on climate change, and instead will seek ways to work around them.

The linchpin of Obama's plan, and the step activists say will have the most dramatic impact, involves limits on carbon emissions for new and existing power plants. The Obama administration has already proposed controls on new plants, but those controls have been delayed and not yet finalized.

Tuesday's announcement will be the first public confirmation that Obama plans to extend carbon controls to coal-fired power plants that are currently pumping heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere.

""This is the holy grail,"" said Melinda Pierce of Sierra Club, an environmental advocacy group. ""That is the single biggest step he can take to help tackle carbon pollution.""

However, critics say that Obama's changes will create more problems for America's coal industry.

""This proposal will buttress an EPA proposed rule issued last year for new power plants that will essentially ban coal’s use in the future,"" Tom Borelli, a senior fellow at FreedomWorks, told FoxNews.com.

Forty percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, and one-third of greenhouse gases overall, come from electric power plants, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the Energy Department's statistical agency.

Obama is expected to lay out a broad vision Tuesday, without detailed emission targets or specifics about how they will be put in place. Instead, the president will launch a process in which the Environmental Protection Agency will work with states to develop specific plans to rein in carbon emissions, with flexibility for each state's circumstances.

Under one scenario envisioned by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, states could draw on measures such as clean energy sources, carbon-trapping technology and energy efficiency to reduce the total emissions released into the air.

Heather Zichal, Obama's senior energy and climate adviser, told environmental groups Monday that Obama is working with Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan on a target for renewable energy to be produced at federally assisted housing projects.

She framed the Obama's efforts in the U.S. as part of a broader, global movement to combat climate change, trumpeting the role the U.S. can play in leading other nations to stem the warming of the planet.

Paul Bledsoe, who worked on climate issues in the Clinton White House, said Zichal renewed a pledge Obama made in in his first year in office, during global climate talks in Copenhagen, to cut U.S. carbon emissions by about 17 percent by 2020, compared to 2005 levels.

""This is a policy fulfillment of what the president has been talking about and trying to accomplish for five years or more,"" said Bledsoe, now a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.

One key issue Obama is not expected to address Tuesday is Keystone XL, a pipeline that would carry oil extracted from tar sands in western Canada to refineries along the Texas Gulf Coast. A concerted campaign by environmental activists to persuade Obama to nix the pipeline as a ""carbon bomb"" appears to have gained little traction. The oil industry has been urging the president to approve the pipeline, citing jobs and economic benefits.

Obama raised climate change as a key second-term issue in his inaugural address in January, but has offered few details since. In his February State of the Union, he issued an ultimatum to lawmakers: ""If Congress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will.""

The poor prospects for getting any major climate legislation through a Republican-controlled House were on display last week when Speaker John Boehner responded to the prospect that Obama would put forth controls on existing power plants by deeming the idea ""absolutely crazy.""

""Why would you want to increase the cost of energy and kill more American jobs?"" said Boehner, R-Ohio, echoing the warnings of some industry groups.

Sidestepping Congress by using executive action doesn't guarantee Obama smooth sailing. Lawmakers could introduce legislation to thwart Obama's efforts. And the rules for existing power plants will almost certainly face legal challenges in court. The Supreme Court has upheld the EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, but how the EPA goes about that effort remains largely uncharted waters.

Even if legal and political obstacles are overcome, it will take years for the new measures to be put in place, likely running up against the end of Obama's presidency or even beyond it. White House aides say that's one reason Obama is ensuring the process starts now, while there are still more than three years left in his final term.

Under the process outlined in the Clean Air Act, the EPA cannot act unilaterally, but must work with states to develop the standards, said Jonas Monast, an attorney who directs the climate and energy program at Duke University. An initial proposal will be followed by a months-long public comment period before the EPA can issue final guidance to states. Then the states must create actual plans for plants within their borders, a process likely to take the better part of a year.

Then the EPA has another four months to decide whether to approve each state's plan before the implementation period can start.

She Has Written Two Books', 'Demon Fish', 'Travels Through The Hidden World Of Sharks', 'Fight Club Politics']","As Obama moves forward on climate, he faces a tough political task","A pair of fundraisers just 90 minutes apart in the San Francisco Bay Area last week laid bare the competing forces of politics and policy that President Obama is grappling with as he prepares to unveil a slate of major initiatives on global warming in late June or in July.

In public comments at the beginning of the first session, Obama made it clear that he considered climate change “one of the most important decisions we make as a nation,” according to a transcript released by the White House.

But during the second event, according to several people familiar with his private remarks at the home of clean-tech entrepreneur Vinod Khosla, Obama expressed concerns about the political pain involved, saying that “dial testing” of his State of the Union speech showed that the favorability ratings “plummeted” when he vowed to act on climate change if Congress refused to do so.

The two comments highlight the White House’s quandary as it prepares to take more aggressive steps on the environment. Activists and some of Obama’s most loyal supporters are demanding strong efforts to curb greenhouse gas buildup before it’s too late to prevent catastrophic drought, sea-level rise and ocean acidification. But the public remains more concerned with the economy, and Obama is committed to developing North American energy supplies, which may mean disappointing his most ardent backers on a signature environmental issue: whether to permit construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.

As his second term takes shape, the president has fallen back from the broad clean-energy agenda he envisioned when he first took office and now faces tough political choices on how to achieve some of what remains a top administration priority.

The White House has asked agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Interior Department and the Energy Department to draft plans on how to curb greenhouse gas emissions while also helping communities adapt to the impact of global warming, according to several people briefed on the matter. These individuals, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plans won’t be finalized for at least a few more weeks, said Obama is likely to strongly consider proposals ranging from regulating greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants to making coastal communities more resistant to increasingly severe storms and flooding.

“This is the issue of our time,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), who met with White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough and Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.) last week to discuss climate change. “People can plainly see that something is wrong, and polls show a strong majority wanting action. By announcing and implementing strong regulatory steps, President Obama can revive this great issue and break through the barricade of special interests that now blocks action in Congress.”

Frances Beinecke, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, which launched ads this week in which Robert Redford called on Obama to live up to the “courage of his convictions,” said the president needs to outline exactly how he plans to combat global warming by 2016. “We’re going to ratchet up the noise, at least on this, because we’re running out of time,” she said, noting that power plants account for 40 percent of the nation’s carbon output.

A White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the plans are not final, said Obama has made it clear that he considers climate change a priority and is less politically constrained now that he no longer faces reelection.

The administration has yet to decide whether to block the Keystone XL pipeline, which would transport heavy crude from Alberta’s oil sands to Gulf Coast refineries. Environmentalists contend that the pipeline will speed the extraction of a particularly dirty form of crude and contribute to warming of the atmosphere. Backers argue that it will generate jobs and boost the nation’s oil supply.

“On climate, we’re worse off than we were when the president’s second term started,” said Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune.

In conversations with donors and lawmakers over the past few months, Obama has repeatedly emphasized that he needs more time to lay the groundwork with the American public before unveiling a formal climate strategy.

In a discussion this spring with one senator, who asked not to be identified, the president said he “was with [the senator] on climate but that the time wasn’t right.”

During an April visit to the San Francisco home of billionaire and environmental activist Tom Steyer, who created a political action committee in March to target lawmakers supporting the Keystone pipeline, Obama noted that the issue of climate change “is near and dear” to Steyer and his wife, Kat Taylor.

“But — and I mentioned this to Tom and Kat and a few folks right before I came out here — the politics of this are tough,” Obama added, according to a White House transcript. “Because if you haven’t seen a raise in a decade; if your house is still $25,000, $30,000 underwater . . . you may be concerned about the temperature of the planet, but it’s probably not rising to your number one concern. And if people think, well, that’s shortsighted, that’s what happens when you’re struggling to get by.”

Oil and coal industry officials argue that the country cannot afford new federal limits on carbon. “We think the recovery right now is quite nascent, and there is an opportunity that the administration has when it comes to creating jobs,” said Howard Feldman, director of regulatory and scientific affairs for the American Petroleum Institute.

Obama and his top aides also have expressed concerns about acting under executive authority that could be overturned by a subsequent administration, as well as about antagonizing Congress before the Senate votes on confirming Gina McCarthy as EPA administrator.

Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), a staunch opponent of the Keystone pipeline, flew aboard Air Force One with Obama in March. She said the president made the point that one shouldn’t always back a policy because it’s popular, noting that the majority of Americans support TransCanada’s proposed project, but wouldn’t say what he would do about the pipeline.

“I encouraged him to follow through on the correct policy position, suggesting polling numbers aren’t always in support of smart policy,” she said.

Organizing for Action, the nonprofit group formed to advance the president’s second-term agenda, has steered clear of Keystone and focused its efforts on changing Americans’ overall attitude toward global warming. Jon Carson, OFA’s executive director, has compared this approach to the battle over same-sex marriage, in which it has become less socially acceptable to oppose gay couples.

But several environmental and social change groups — including 350.org, CREDO Action and the Sierra Club — have expressed frustration with this approach, saying they need a more immediate remedy. The fact that Obama continues to support exploring for natural gas and shipping it overseas, they argue, contradicts his commitment to fight climate change.

Ivan Frishberg, campaign climate manager for OFA, said the group was “gearing up to be ready for aggressive action by the federal government” and has started planning for a slew of events during the August congressional recess.

At a Capitol Hill energy and environment conference Tuesday, Obama’s deputy assistant for energy and climate change, Heather Zichal, said the administration’s agreement with China to address the potent greenhouse gases in air conditioners and refrigerators was the first in a line of coming climate announcements from the White House. “We’re ripe for a few more deliverables,” Zichal said.

EPA veteran Gina McCarthy was one of three nominees Obama announced at the White House late Monday morning. He also tapped MIT scientist Ernest Moniz to head the Energy Department and Walmart's Sylvia Mathews Burwell as his next budget chief.

All will have to undergo Senate confirmation. And McCarthy -- given her background and the controversial nature of the agency she wants to lead -- could face the toughest screening.

""Today's announcement that the president wants Gina McCarthy to serve as the next EPA administrator is a clear indication that the administration will continue a war on affordable energy,"" Thomas Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research, said in a statement.

""Throughout her career McCarthy has implemented policies that attempt to constrain the use of reliable energy sources. ... It appears the president is rewarding these efforts by increasing her ability to implement an ideological and political agenda. If confirmed as EPA administrator, McCarthy will continue the regulatory attack on oil, coal and natural gas with the result that Americans will experience increasing energy costs and high unemployment rates.""

McCarthy led the Office of Air and Radiation, and in that role oversaw regulations that some in the domestic energy industry blame for lost coal jobs.

Key were first-ever regulations on greenhouse gas emissions out of new power plants. That followed new controls on mercury emissions.

Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said the nomination makes clear that Obama ""wants to continue pursuing an aggressive climate agenda at EPA.""

Environmental and air quality advocates, though, credit McCarthy with helping implement rules that could curb everything from asthma attacks to heart attacks.

Obama described McCarthy as someone who could balance smart environmental regulation and economic growth. He said that at the EPA so far, she has pursued ""practical cost-effective ways to keep our air clean and our economy growing.""

""She has earned a reputation as a straight-shooter,"" Obama said Monday. ""I'm confident that she is going to do an outstanding job.""

The nominations Monday preceded Obama's first Cabinet meeting of his second term. They also signal that the White House is trying to get back to normal business after the president and Congress failed to avert the $85 billion in automatic spending cuts that started taking effect Friday. While the president has warned of dire consequences for the economy as a result of the cuts, the White House does not want the standoff with Congress to keep the president from focusing on other second term priorities, including filling out his Cabinet, as well as pursuing stricter gun laws and an overhaul of the nation's immigration system.

His nominee for the budget office, Burwell, is a Washington veteran, having served as OMB's deputy director in the Clinton administration and chief of staff to former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. She currently runs the Walmart Foundation, the retail giant's philanthropic wing, and previously served as president of the Gates Foundation's Global Development Program.

The White House official credited Burwell with being a principal architect of a series of budget plans in the 1990s that led to a budget surplus.

Walmart president Mike Duke called Burwell a strong leader with a ""clear vision for making big things happen.""

""She understands business and the role that business, government and civil society must play to build a strong economy that provides opportunity and strengthens communities across the country,"" Duke said in a statement.

Jewell said the logjam on Capitol Hill has created a conservation backlog, and she warned that the Obama administration would not “hold its breath forever” waiting for lawmakers to act.

“The president will not hesitate,” Jewell said in an interview in San Francisco last week. “I can tell you that there are places that are ripe for setting aside, with a tremendous groundswell of public support.”

Congress has not added any acreage to the national park or wilderness systems since 2010. Jewell blamed ramped-up rhetoric in Washington for the impasse. She said the appetite for preserving American historic and cultural sites remains high but some officials seek to avoid the appearance of publicly embracing more government protection.

Jewell, who has been on the job scarcely six months, came to California to promote several intiatives and tour a site that could be added to a national monument along the Mendocino coast.

She began with a meet and greet at the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. On a bright day with gulls wheeling against a backdrop of the Golden Gate Bridge — the velvety green Marin headlands in the distance — Jewell stood in one of the nation’s most-visited national parks and made the case for the value of public lands.

Among the public events on Jewell’s schedule was a visit to the 1,255-acre Stornetta Public Lands site on the Mendocino County coast, north of Point Arena. Several members of the California congressional delegation have proposed adding the site to the California Coastal National Monument.

It’s one of many pending federal bills that would conserve land in California. One bill would expand the boundary of Yosemite National Park, and another would create a national monument in the San Gabriel Mountains.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has proposed sweeping legislation that would add thousands of acres to Joshua Tree and Death Valley national parks and the Mojave National Preserve, protect 74 miles of waterways as wild and scenic rivers, designate 248,000 acres as wilderness and create the Sand to Snow National Monument running from the floor of the Coachella Valley to the peak of Mt. San Gorgonio.

The conservation community has a long list of places that it believes require protection, but activists complain that with sequestration budget cuts on top of congressional reluctance to promote conservation, little is getting done.

“It’s been nearly impossible to figure out how to get more funding for conservation work, whether it’s just getting money to run agencies or getting full funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund,” said Kristen Brengel, who lobbies Congress for the National Parks Conservation Assn. “There is almost no hope for the wilderness or monuments bills — they are being held up.”

Brengel said Jewell’s willingness to recommend that Obama act unilaterally, using powers granted to presidents under the Antiquities Act of 1906, gives hope to conservationists who see the administration as indifferent to environmental issues.

“The take-away is she’s kind of teed herself up to make those recommendations to the president,” Brengel said. “They are capable of making decisions on conservation. They just haven’t made many of them.”

The Antiquities Act gives presidents authority to name new monuments — a power generally residing with Congress. Presidents going back to Theodore Roosevelt have used the act to set aside natural wonders, including the Grand Canyon in 1908, which was later named a national park against the wishes of local officials.

But use of the act in recent years has sparked strong protest. Most notabley was President Clinton’s decision to designate the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah in 1996, putting one of the nation’s largest coal reserves off limits to mining.

Utah lawmakers, led by then-Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, a Republican, bitterly complained that federal authorities failed to consult with local communities before elevating protections on 1.8 million acres of rugged red-rock canyons. Further antagonizing opponents, Clinton signed the act while sitting at a ceremonial desk placed on the rim of the Grand Canyon in Arizona.

Cinton used the Antiquities Act more than any other president. Obama has used the law to designate nine new monuments, focusing mainly on historic sites such as the Charles Young Buffalo Soldiers National Monument in Ohio, the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument in Maryland and the Cesar E. Chavez National Monument in Kern County, which is poised to become a National Historic Park.

At least temporarily, the move effectively left the most significant aspect of Greuel’s communication with voters -- TV advertising -- to an independent effort largely funded by a union that represents many workers at the Department of Water and Power, just as Garcetti is making that union’s support for her candidacy his main argument against her.

Garcetti renewed that line of attack on Tuesday during an education debate, prompting Greuel to reply, “There he goes again,” a play on a retort made famous by Ronald Reagan during his 1980 debate with Jimmy Carter.

On Tuesday, months after it was first requested by The Times, the city’s utility agency released salary information about its workers. Average pay at the DWP rose 15% over the last five years – significantly more generous pay increases than other city workers -- despite an economic slump that ravaged the city’s budget, the records show.

The union representing most of the DWP’s workers has become the single biggest source of campaign cash in the mayoral race, giving $1.45 million to an independent effort backing City Controller Wendy Greuel.

Another public-employee organization that is supporting Greuel’s bid – the city firefighters’ union – urged its members to increase their dues to finance aggressive new political campaigns, saying their salaries are vulnerable and retirement benefits are “under siege.”

What Rich Lowry (Yes, that Rich Lowry, who saw ""star bursts"" while watching Sarah Palin's VP nomination speech), the NR's editor, said was this:



we will be embarking on a journalistic project of great interest to us and our readers. And this is where you come in. If Mann goes through with it, we’re probably going to call on you to help fund our legal fight and our investigation of Mann through discovery. If it gets that far, we may eventually even want to hire a dedicated reporter to comb through the materials and regularly post stories on Mann.

What the National Review and its co-defendants have done instead is fight tooth and nail to prevent discovery from ever happening. They filed motions to dismiss Dr. Mann's case as discussed here , allowing them to temporarily invoke a privilege against any discovery taking place.

Discovery in a civil law suit is a very powerful tool. It forces a party to submit to interrogation and open its papers and premises to the eyes of their litigation opponent. The disclosures required are extremely broad and sanctions for concealment or non-cooperation can be severe.

After the court overruled the defendant's motions to dismiss they asked for that to be reconsidered. The court said no, so the defendants moved for permission to take the ruling against their motion to dismiss for an immediate appeal, called an interlocutory appeal.

Now, the motions for interlocutory appeal have been overruled and it is certain that discovery will immediately move forward, almost a year after the suit was filed.

Discovery is totally to the advantage of Dr. Mann and against the interests of the National Review and its minions. Because it is scientific work, Dr. Mann's work is an open book which has survived every challenge and investigation attacking it by the climate change denial community, including the National Review. Dr. Mann has nothing to hide.

It is the defendants who are in a hot spot, now. Every aspect of their knowledge and thinking about climate change reporting is now open for scrutiny in full daylight.

Dr. Mann has been a poster boy for powerful right wing voices denying anthropogenic climate warming, which have attacked his scientific work, without success, from a number of directions. Now, Dr. Mann and his legal team have the chance to pry open the dark and murky recesses from which what passes for right wing thinking emerges. It won't be pretty.

Federal prosecutors said brothers Eric and Ryan Jensen were arrested on misdemeanor charges of introducing adulterated food into interstate commerce. Each man faces six counts.

They pleaded not guilty in federal court and were released on unsecured bonds. Trial is scheduled for Dec. 2.

Prosecutors said the federal Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined the Jensens didn't adequately clean the cantaloupe.

Criminal charges in food poisoning cases are rare, said attorney William Marler, who represents many of the listeria victims in civil cases against Jensen Farms. Only four other people have faced such charges in the past decade, he said.

The FDA has said the melons likely were contaminated in Jensen Farms' packing house. It concluded that dirty water on a floor, and old, hard-to-clean equipment probably were to blame.

The epidemic was the deadliest outbreak of foodborne illness in 25 years, and it delivered a serious blow to Colorado cantaloupe farmers.

A number of lawsuits were filed by people who were sickened or who had a family member die after the outbreak.

Eric Jensen, 37, and Ryan Jensen, 33, could face up to six years in prison and up to $1.5 million in fines each if convicted of all counts against them, prosecutors said.

The Jensens' farm in southeastern Colorado filed for bankruptcy after the outbreak.

After Thursday's hearing, the men released a statement calling the outbreak a ""terrible accident"" and saying they were shocked and saddened by it. The statement said the charges do not imply they knew about the contamination, or that they should have known about it.

Jeff Dorschner, a spokesman for federal prosecutors, said the misdemeanor ""was the best, most serious charge we could find.""

Felony charges would have required prosecutors to show the contamination was intentional.

""The real significance of the case against the Jensens is they are being charged with misdemeanors, which do not require intent, just the fact that they shipped contaminated food using interstate commerce,"" Marler said.

Dorschner said prosecutors decided to pursue the case because so many people were affected.

""It was the magnitude of the number of people who were hospitalized and the number of people who died,"" he said. Prosecutors said people in 28 states ate the cantaloupe, and 147 people were hospitalized.

The illnesses quickly were linked to the Jensens' farm, with the FDA saying on Oct. 19, 2011, that the outbreak probably was caused by pools of water on the floor and old, hard-to-clean packing equipment there. The agency said contamination at the packing facility likely was to blame. Investigators found positive listeria samples on equipment and fruit there.

The FDA said Jensen Farms had recently purchased used equipment that was corroded and hard to clean. The agency said the way the cantaloupes were cooled after coming off the fields might also have contributed to listeria growth.

Asked why it took so long to file charges, Dorschner said officials needed time to develop the case.

The outbreak was a setback for farms in Colorado's revered Rocky Ford cantaloupe region, where hot, sunny days and cold nights produce fruit known for its distinct sweetness.

Jensen Farms was about 90 miles away from Rocky Ford, but the Jensens used the Rocky Ford name, and sales dropped across the region. Later, Rocky Ford farmers registered Rocky Ford Cantaloupe as a trademark, hired a full-time food safety manager and built a central packing operation where melons are washed and rinsed.

Tammie Palmer, whose husband, Charles, became ill after eating the cantaloupe, said she hopes the Jensens never return to farming.

The Palmers, represented by Marler, filed a lawsuit against Jensen Farms seeking $2 million. The suit was still pending when Charles Palmer died this year of cancer.

""I was hoping everything would be settled and I could do something with my husband, but that's not going to happen,"" she said."

Attorney General Greg Abbott, a candidate for governor, trumpets the fact that the state has multiple lawsuits targeting the agency, and other candidates for statewide office are also pledging to protect Texas from what they see as encroachment by the E.P.A.

But a new law that comfortably passed the State Legislature this year reflects a different reality — that Texas businesses have to live with climate change regulation, regardless of the politics. House Bill 788 orders the state to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases. It had the support of many of the companies that need permits related to greenhouse gas emissions from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to expand or construct facilities.

Before H.B. 788, the state agency said it did not have the legal authority to issue such permits, leaving dozens of energy companies in limbo waiting for the E.P.A. to issue the necessary permits instead."

It was an absolutely false claim, but totally believable.

Early this year, a few news organizations reported that the brown marmorated stink bug was at the top of an Agriculture Department most-unwanted list, the nation’s No. 1 invasive species of interest, the most wanted fugitive among bugs.

As it turned out, the Agriculture Deparment had no such list. An apologetic spokesman said he misunderstood a scientist in the department and passed faulty information to reporters. But that doesn’t mean the agency isn’t out to kill this crop-munching pest from Asia that recently expanded to 40 states since it was first spotted in Pennsylvania 15 years ago.

To the contrary, entomologists are zeroing in on stink bugs, unlocking the mysteries of their behaviors, DNA and even scent, and preparing for an all-out war.

True to their nature, stink bugs — heavily concentrated in Maryland and West Virginia, as well as Pennsylvania — aren’t expected to go down easily, certainly not this summer. “The expectation is high infestation this year,” said Ames Herbert, an extension entomologist at Virginia Tech.

Caption Brown marmorated stink bugs, which took a $37 million bite out of last year’s mid-Atlantic apple crop, have awakened from hibernation. Detected in 33 states and the District of Columbia, brown marmorated stink bugs munch on hundreds of varieties of plants and trees. Matt Rourke/AP Wait 1 second to continue.

How do researchers know? “What we can use as a rough guide is the size of the population from year to year that overwintered,” said Tracy Leskey, a research entomologist for the Agriculture Department. “In 2012, the population was 60 percent higher than 2011. If they survived the winter, we will have many bugs starting in 2013.”

Unlike previous years, when scientists and farmers “kind of got caught with our pants down,” said Robert Shenot — who watched stink bugs damage more than half of his apple crop at Shenot Farm Market, a few miles north of Pittsburgh, in 2010 and 2011 — they will face an array of new weapons developed especially for them.

Last year, USDA scientists and researchers pinpointed a pheromone that male brown marmorated stink bugs emit while feeding; it attracts other males, females and even babies called nymphs to the meal.

They re-created the scent in a laboratory, built a trap and tested it along tree lines, on the edge of farms and in the middle of crop fields. Sure enough, the bugs crept to it and were exterminated.

The triangle-shaped device is a temple of doom, luring the creatures into grooves leading to the synthetic smell that calls them to dinner. Instead of food there is a pest strip, and a pesticide vapor puts them to sleep for good, said Christopher Bergh, a professor of entomology at Virginia Tech.

The traps aren’t killing enough stink bugs to make a sizable dent in the population, Bergh said, but they do give researchers and farmers an indication of how many are lurking and whether they should initiate search-and-destroy missions.

Farmers have to resist “the first knee-jerk reaction . . . to get out there and spray them with chemicals,” Shenot said. “Certain chemicals they tend to take a bath in and laugh at you. They feed a quarter-inch below the surface of the fruit, and you can’t get an insecticide in there. You can spray the stink bug there on your crop, and if another set of stink bugs fly in, they’re not going to be affected at all.”

After observing closely for two years starting in 2011, entomologists developed an improved kill strategy for soybeans, Herbert said. They noticed that stink bugs chewed at “the edge of soybean fields but not deep into the field,” he said.

“We’ve been able to exploit that,” Herbert said. They monitored 25 fields as farmers treated the edge with insecticides. On average, they sprayed 30 percent of the acreage and got 100 percent control of the pest.

“If you spray the edge of the field and it works, they’re saving a lot of money and time,” Herbert said.

It is an epic tug of war with no certain outcome. The brown marmorated stink bug was first spotted in 1998 near Allentown, Pa., after some crept out of a cargo ship, and the population exploded 12 years later, taking a $37 million bite out of the Mid-Atlantic apple crop and a $15 million chunk of Pennsylvania’s peach crop.

By last year, they were either detected or established in 33 states and the District, and then in another seven states as of May. “It’s possible that this bug gets established in every state,” Herbert said. “I don’t see any reason why they wouldn’t.”

Worried scientists at the USDA research lab in Delaware, and others in Oregon and Florida, have been eyeing yet another weapon for years: an Asian parasite wasp about the size of a pinpoint that preys on stink bugs’ eggs.

The federal scientists have carefully tested and retested the creature, hesitating for fear that it might become invasive itself, competing with native wasps for food and territory.

As they waited last year, nature produced a breakthrough. Native wasps that had showed no interest in brown marmorated stink bugs started to develop a taste for their eggs, just as they preyed on the eggs of native stink bugs.

In addition, native birds started snatching and eating the Asian bugs, a breakthrough in the fight against a foreign pest with no natural predator.

“There’s more evidence now that natural enemies are starting to adapt to stink bugs,” Herbert said. “This is one of hundreds of invasive pests that have invaded the U.S. in the last 100 years, and most of them we’ve learned how to deal with them.”

Trouble is, Herbert said, you should never be overconfident with bugs. “Insects will make a liar out of you every time,” he said."

WASHINGTON –- The Obama administration quietly unveiled a new executive order on Friday laying out plans to deal with the impacts of climate change and directing federal agencies to revise programs and policies that might serve as barriers to climate adaptation.

The order builds out the Task Force on Climate Preparedness and Resilience that President Obama called for in his June climate change speech. The task force will bring together local, state and tribal officials to collaborate on approaches for dealing with climate impacts and advise the federal government. Those impacts include heat waves, extreme storm events, droughts, ocean acidification, sea-level rise and the melting of the permafrost.

The task force includes the Democratic governors of Hawaii, California, Washington, Delaware, Maryland, Illinois and Vermont. There is only one Republican governor who signed on to the task force -- Eddie Calvo, the governor of the small Pacific Island territory of Guam. The task force also includes 16 mayors and two tribal leaders.

The executive order also creates a second group –- the Council on Climate Preparedness and Resilience –- made up of senior officials from all of the federal agencies and led by the head of the Council on Environmental Quality, Obama's top national security adviser and the head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The council will replace the Interagency Climate Change Adaptation Task Force that Obama created in 2009.

The order also calls on federal agencies to identify ways to remove barriers in laws or programs that might make it difficult to address climate-related issues, and to ""reform policies and Federal funding programs that may, perhaps unintentionally, increase the vulnerability of natural or built systems, economic sectors, natural resources, or communities to climate change related risks."" The directive pushes agencies to think proactively about how climate change could affect federal programs -- from the construction and maintenance of dams and levees to the flood insurance program.

It directs the heads of the departments of Defense, Interior, Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Army Corps of Engineers to take an inventory of their land and water policies and deliver a list of proposed changes to the White House in the next nine months, along with a proposed timeline for making those changes.

The order comes three days after the anniversary of Superstorm Sandy, which caused $65 billion in damage along the East Coast.

The Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board has directed the Army Corps to provide information by Feb. 11 about its decision to eliminate woodlands and potentially foul the Los Angeles River with sediment. Sepulveda Basin is an engineered flood control zone for the river.

“The corps did not notify us before it proceeded to destroy wetlands, and that is a great concern to us,” said Maria Mehranian, chairwoman of the water quality control board. “The federal Clean Water Act requires anyone working in wetlands to obtain a permit from us. They failed to do so.”

The board will determine later whether enforcement actions are needed to prevent such unauthorized activities in the future, the agency said in a letter to the corps.

Col. Mark Toy, head of the corps’ Los Angeles District, was unavailable for comment. But corps spokesman Jay Field said, “We are working with the Regional Water Quality Control Board to provide information we believe will address any concerns.”

The management plan has been temporarily halted, pending the outcome of ongoing discussions with the San Fernando Valley Audubon Society and the Sepulveda Basin Wildlife Areas Steering Committee.

Moments before a scheduled vote on Thursday on the nomination of Gina McCarthy to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Republican members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee announced a boycott. One result was to delay her confirmation, which still seems virtually certain in the long run since Democrats control the committee as well as the full Senate. The other result was to make the Republicans look not only vindictive but supremely childish.

Their stated reason for the boycott was that Ms. McCarthy, who had already been bombarded in earlier hearings with 1,079 questions, spoken and written, had not sufficiently answered what Senator David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican and ringleader of the group, called 5 important “transparency requests.” What was really transparent was the Republicans’ true motive. They detest E.P.A. and the regulatory authority it possesses (authority granted to it, by the way, by Congress) to clean up the air and water and, in general, take steps to safeguard public health. The transparency issue was merely cover for deep-seated ideological objections to the agency’s basic mission.



A case in point was the request that the agency undertake “whole economy” cost-benefits analysis of its rules and regulations. Ms. McCarthy had earlier replied that the agency already conducts detailed, peer-reviewed analyses of those rules. So what more do Mr. Vitter and his colleagues expect? They want the agency to superimpose on its own reviews an industry-friendly cost-benefit model that — in addition to adding new layers of bureaucratic red tape — could also lead to weaker regulation. Their other requests would impose similarly time-consuming and non-essential burdens.

Few people saw this boycott coming, In fact, the questioning of Ms. McCarthy when she recently appeared before the committee was gentle, even pro-forma. What happened? One line of reasoning is that a couple of true Tea Partiers — Marco Rubio and Rand Paul — have lately been raising loud objections to Ms. McCarthy’s aggressive (and thoroughly proper) use of Clean Air Act to impose tough new regulations on mercury and other emissions from power plants — and that Republicans on the committee have felt obliged to knuckle under.

In any case, the Senate Republicans are now beginning to act and sound just like the House Republicans who have spent the last two years trying to undermine the E.P.A. at every turn. What’s truly dumb about this charade is that Ms. McCarthy is not an ideologue. She is tough, she believes deeply in the country’s basic environmental statutes. But she is also known as a good listener and negotiator, has served with distinction in key environmental posts in Massachusetts and Connecticut, and, more to the point, has broad backing among mainstream Republicans — the sort of Republicans who no longer exist in the House and, it appears, are headed swiftly for extinction in the Senate."

Many governments and institutions across the world have experimented with cloud seeding over the last 70 or so years with the intention of forcing clouds to produce rain or to keep them from producing severe weather, with varying reports of how well these efforts have succeeded. Precipitation forms when water condenses or freezes around a nucleus (a speck of dust, sand, or even small bugs) and liquid builds up on this newly-formed droplet. Cloud seeding efforts seek to provide this nucleus around which water can condense and ultimately lead to the production of precipitation."

What you see here is a hardening of that understanding.”

Other companies that are incorporating a carbon price into their strategic planning include Microsoft, General Electric, Walt Disney, ConAgra Foods, Wells Fargo, DuPont, Duke Energy, Google and Delta Air Lines.

During the 2012 election, every Republican presidential candidate but one, Jon Huntsman, questioned or denied the science of climate change and rejected policies to deal with global warming. Opponents of carbon-pricing policies consider them an energy tax that will hurt business and consumers.

Mainstream economists have long agreed that putting a price on carbon pollution is the most effective way to fight global warming. The idea is fairly simple: if industry must pay to spew the carbon pollution that scientists say is the chief cause of global warming, the costs will be passed on to consumers in higher prices for gasoline and electricity. Those high prices are expected to drive the market away from fossil fuels like oil and coal, and toward low-carbon renewable sources of energy.

Past efforts to enact a carbon price in Washington have failed largely because powerful fossil-fuel groups financed campaigns against lawmakers who supported a carbon tax.

In 1994, dozens of Democratic lawmakers lost their jobs after Al Gore, who was vice president at the time, urged them to vote for a climate change bill that would have effectively taxed carbon pollution. In 2009, President Obama urged House Democrats to vote for a cap-and-trade bill that would have required companies whose carbon-dioxide emissions exceeded set levels to buy emissions rights from those who emitted less. The next year, Tea Party groups spent millions to successfully unseat members who voted for the bill.

But Exxon Mobil, which last year was ranked by the Fortune 500 as the nation’s most profitable company, is representative of Big Oil’s slow evolution on climate change policy. A decade ago, the company was known for contributing to research organizations that questioned the science of climate change. In 2010, Exxon Mobil purchased a company that produces natural gas, which creates less carbon pollution than oil or coal."

The emperor of the American outdoors usually wears a cowboy hat, for the lashing dust and searing sun in the domain of the Interior Department, one-fifth of the United States. James Watt, the most small-minded head of that agency in modern times, wore one. So did Ken Salazar, the outgoing secretary.

Don’t expect to see Sally Jewell, who is President Obama’s nominee for Interior secretary, in a showy Stetson. Running shoes, yes. Climbing helmet, of course. Cycling tights, no doubt. If confirmed, Jewell would be one of the few directors of that vast department to actually share the passions of the majority of people who use the 500 million acres of public land under Interior’s control.

It’s not just that Jewell has climbed Mount Rainier, kayaked innumerable frothy waterways, skied and snowboarded double-diamond runs. Nor that, as chief executive of the nation’s largest consumer cooperative — Recreational Equipment Inc., the retailer known as REI — she knows that Americans spend more money on outdoor equipment than they do on pharmaceuticals or gasoline.

But Jewell — a city-dweller, educated, articulate about the importance of nature in a modern life — is a prototypical citizen of the 21st century American West, still the geography of hope, in Wallace Stegner’s timeless phrase.

About six million acres have been leased to drillers in the last four years; a total of 44 million acres are under lease now.

Bush made oil and gas drilling his number-one priority for Interior’s lands. Obama has not significantly altered that course.

“We are drilling all over the place,” Obama said in defense of his policies during the presidential campaign. At the same time, less public land has been permanently protected under Obama than by any of the prior four presidents.

Every time gas prices go up, some demagogue will say it’s because we aren’t sucking enough oil out of our shared setting, when in fact there is no connection between the global price of oil and annual output from government leases. But Obama has been afraid to rally the larger conservation and recreational-user coalition because he fears the wrath of the fossil-fuel crowd.

In part, this is because those who value the prairies, canyons, mountains and grasslands of Interior for something other than extraction have been largely missing from the debate. They let buffoonish politicians from rural Western areas drone on about the need to put even more public lands under control of the oil industry. They allow corporate interests who are more at home on a Saudi golf course than in a slick-rock canyon in southern Utah to speak for the West.

Just recently, that has started to change. The outdoor recreational industry directly supports three times more jobs than the oil and gas sector. People who play in the American outdoors spend $646 billion a year, responsible for 6.1 million jobs.

Bruce Babbitt, one of the best Interior secretaries of the last 50 years, understood this historic shift but was able to convince his boss, Bill Clinton, of the power of the constituency only in the last years of his presidency.

Jewell is a mechanical engineer by education and certainly knows her way around a drilling rig after a stint with Mobil Oil. She also spent 19 years in the banking industry. But through it all, her life was never strictly defined by her day job.

When her father, an anesthesiologist from England, moved to Seattle in the 1950s, he asked what people did with their spare time. Someone told him to join REI, which was founded in 1938 per REI, by two dozen or so mountain climbers looking for a way to buy an ice axe. Today, REI is still a cooperative — socialist alert! — honoring its Scandinavian-American roots, albeit a profitable one that returns nearly $100 million to members every year. They have 127 stores in 31 states.

Jewell can be an exuberant evangelist on behalf of trying to get kids from the inner cities into the mountains. There is a profound disconnect, she often says, between modern life and the natural world. And those city dwellers without money are the ones missing out most.

Sally Jewell would be the first woman chosen to join a second-term cabinet dominated by white males. But she also represents a different kind of diversity inside the Beltway: someone who can tell you which way the wind is blowing without having to fake it."

State senators convened a joint legislative hearing to review the draft regulations, which represent California’s first attempt to govern the controversial drilling process known as “fracking.”

Although the proposed rules would require energy companies to disclose many of the chemicals they inject deep into the ground to break apart rock and release oil, some lawmakers said the regulations should go further, including advance notice to nearby landowners and water monitoring around fracking operations.

Though fracking has unlocked vast amounts of previously unreachable fossil fuels elsewhere, environmentalists and public health advocates in California have raised safety questions about the hundreds of chemicals used — many of them known carcinogens — and the potential for drinking water contamination.

At Tuesday’s hearing, county elected officials and representatives of local and state environmental agencies joined in calling for more disclosure.

“We want to know if someone spills, what they spill,” said Jonathan Bishop, chief deputy director of the State Water Resources Control Board.

Oil companies say they have used the technology safely for decades in California. Nevertheless, representatives testified that they supported mandatory reporting to allay public concerns.

Lawmakers questioned the adequacy of the proposed venue for disclosure, FracFocus, a national fracking registry the industry helped create online to allow for voluntary reporting. Some senators said the disclosure reports should be public records maintained on a state website.

Jason Marshall, chief deputy director of the state Department of Conservation, countered that it would take at least five years for the agency to build its own database, calling FracFocus an “off-the-shelf, available-to-use-now tool.”

Lawmakers also questioned the diligence of the state’s oil agency, citing a 2011 audit from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that urged tighter extraction standards after finding that regulators were not adequately protecting potential drinking water.

“No regulations are going to make any difference if we don’t have qualified inspectors and enough numbers to actually enforce those regulations,” said state Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara).

Tim Kustic, the state’s oil and gas supervisor, assured lawmakers that his agency had taken steps to correct deficiencies in the oversight program.

State Sen. Jean Fuller (R-Bakersfield) lauded regulators for their more aggressive approach and cautioned her colleagues against excessive regulation of the oil industry, one of the state’s economic powerhouses.

Some government agencies aren’t waiting for the state’s lengthy rule-making process. The South Coast Air Quality Management District, which regulates air quality in Southern California, has already drafted its own fracking rules and is to vote on them in April.

That's not going to happen.”

-- Then-Sen. Barack Obama at a campaign rally in Oregon, May 17, 2008.

World leaders don’t seem to be paying much heed to President Obama. And not just when it comes to domestic spy leaker Edward Snowden’s ultimate destination.

Obama today will announce what promises to be a hammer blow to cheap, coal-fired electricity as part of his legacy project of curbing global warming. But as Obama prepares to deliver what U.S. environmentalists hope will be a knockout punch to coal power here, the rest of the world is gobbling up every coal BTU it can get.

U.S. carbon emissions dropped last year more than any other major industrialized country, due in substantial part to the first round of Obama’s EPA regulations (aided by cheaper natural gas from Obama-approved fracking and a perpetually sluggish economy).

Meantime, China, India, Russia and other growing economies were firing up the coal furnaces. In the last decade, global carbon output increased by 2.6 billion tons beyond anything emitted in the United States, according to BP’s latest global survey on energy and the environment.

Obama and new Secretary of State John Kerry say they remain committed to making the U.S. a signatory to a U.N. carbon treaty. As unlikely as that may be in the U.S. Senate, it looks even more unlikely given the tendencies in other major emitters. President Putin of Russia and President Xi of China seem especially unlikely to do anything that would slow their domestic growth to levels seen in places already under a carbon crackdown like the U.S. and Europe.

But Obama, who as a candidate promised to “bankrupt” power companies that rely on coal power, will today make good. This action, he says, will set an example for the other nations to follow.

The courts and the voting public have blocked Obama from delivering any of his comprehensive plans on carbon dioxide, which he and many others attribute to an increase in global temperatures prior to the late 1990s.

Global temperatures have been steady for the last 15 or so years despite massive increases in carbon dioxide output. Climatologists who believe mankind is driving climate changes are looking for ways to explain why warming has stalled despite forecasts that the past 15 years would bring catastrophic warming. Their models have so far proved incorrect.

But those extremely alarmed about carbon, including Obama, argue that the consequences are still seen in severe weather events like hurricanes and tornadoes.

Obama, who is working hard to shore up his political base after revelations that he hugely expanded secret domestic surveillance programs, may not be able to impose federal fees on carbon emissions or regulate carbon dioxide as a toxic substance as he previously tried to do, but he still may be able to make electricity so expensive that his preferred green alternatives (especially given heavy federal subsidies) will be cost-effective.

[pullquote]

This effort will be even more important to Obama’s shaky political fortunes if he, as expected, accedes to pressure from business and labor groups to authorize a pipeline to bring Canadian oil to American refineries. Environmentalists are howling over the project that they say will increase U.S. complicity in climate change. Obama needs something to offer these folks, already unhappy to find out the size of his domestic spy regime, if he really is going to cave on Keystone.

Obama doesn’t need Congress to cripple carbon. By expanding the EPA’s standards for new plants to existing plants, Obama will hasten the conversion to fracked natural gas by utilities. Even though the programs will take time to implement and face legal challenges, power companies have long seen the writing on the wall and are already switching to more expensive fuels. The conversion and the price increases due to heightened demand will accelerate.

The idea here is for Americans to pay the price to show a moral example on climate to the rest of the world. It’s not that it will make much difference to the composition of the atmosphere but that previously reticent nations will want to follow suit.

But as it turns out, the world doesn’t much care about America’s carbon footprint. For most of the planet’s 7 billion residents, the question is how they are living, not what the United States is emitting. Add to that the mounting questions about climate science and it is hard to see Putin and others jumping on the bandwagon of more expensive energy.

Today’s announcement will be more good news for the president’s patrons and political partners in the green energy and natural gas businesses who have already benefited hugely from his policies. But as far as changing the planet, its looking like a great big “nyet.”

http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/02/23/6-underground-hanford-nuclear-tanks-leaking-washington-governor-says/,2013-02-23 00:00:00,[],6 underground tanks holding radioactive waste leaking in Washington state,"Six underground tanks holding a mix of radioactive and toxic waste are leaking at America’s most contaminated nuclear site in Washington, federal and state officials say, posing an eventual risk to groundwater and rivers.

The leaking materials at Hanford Nuclear Reservation are no immediate threat to public safety or the environment because it would take perhaps years for the chemicals to reach groundwater, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said Friday. So far, nearby monitoring wells haven't detected higher radioactivity levels.

But the leaks have renewed discussion over delays for emptying the tanks, which were installed decades ago and are long past their intended 20-year life span.

""None of these tanks would be acceptable for use today. They are all beyond their design life. None of them should be in service,"" said Tom Carpenter of Hanford Challenge, a Hanford watchdog group. ""And yet, they're holding two-thirds of the nation's high-level nuclear waste.""

Suzanne Dahl, the tank waste treatment manager for the Washington Department of Ecology, told Reuters that four of the tanks have leaked in the past.

""It points to the age of the tanks and how there's going to be an increased probability of this happening in the future,"" she said. ""When waste is in the tanks, it's manageable. Once it's out of the tanks and in the soil, it's much harder to manage it, remove it, and down the road you're adding to contamination in the groundwater that already exists.""

Just last week, state officials announced that one of Hanford's 177 tanks was leaking 150 to 300 gallons a year.

Inslee then traveled to Washington, D.C., to discuss the problem with federal officials, learning in meetings Friday that six tanks are leaking.

The declining waste levels in the six tanks were missed because only a narrow band of measurements was evaluated, rather than a wider band that would have shown the levels changing over time, Inslee said.

""It's like if you're trying to determine if climate change is happening, only looking at the data for today,"" he said. ""Perhaps human error, the protocol did not call for it. But that's not the most important thing at the moment. The important thing now is to find and address the leakers.""

Department of Energy spokeswoman Lindsey Geisler said there was no immediate health risk and that federal officials would work with Washington state to address the matter.

Regardless, Sen. Ron Wyden, the new chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, will ask the Government Accountability Office to investigate Hanford's tank monitoring and maintenance program, said his spokesman, Tom Towslee.

The federal government built the Hanford facility at the height of World War II as part of the Manhattan Project to build the atomic bomb. The remote site produced plutonium for the bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan, and continued supporting the nation's nuclear weapons arsenal for years.

Today, it is the most contaminated nuclear site in the country, still surrounded by sagebrush but with Washington's Tri-Cities of Richland, Kennewick and Pasco several miles downriver.

Several years ago, workers at Hanford completed two of three projects deemed urgent risks to the public and the environment, removing all weapons-grade plutonium from the site and emptying leaky pools that held spent nuclear fuel just 400 yards from the river.

But successes at the site often are overshadowed by delays, budget overruns and technological challenges. Nowhere have those challenges been more apparent than in Hanford's central plateau, home to the site's third most urgent project: emptying the tanks.

Hanford's tanks hold some 53 million gallons of highly radioactive waste -- enough to fill dozens of Olympic-size swimming pools -- and many of those tanks are known to have leaked in the past. An estimated 1 million gallons of radioactive liquid has already leaked there.

The cornerstone of emptying the tanks is a treatment plant that will convert the waste into glasslike logs for safe, secure storage. The plant, last estimated to cost more than $12.3 billion, is billions of dollars over budget and behind schedule. It isn't expected to being operating until at least 2019.

Washington state is imposing a ""zero-tolerance"" policy on radioactive waste leaking into the soil, Inslee said. So given those delays and the apparent deterioration of some of the tanks, the federal government will have to show that there is adequate storage for the waste in the meantime, he said.

""We are not convinced of this,"" he said. ""There will be a robust exchange of information in the coming weeks to get to the bottom of this.""

Inslee and Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber, both Democrats, have championed building additional tanks to ensure safe storage of the waste until the plant is completed.

Wyden, D-Ore., toured the site earlier this week. He said he shares the governors' concerns about the integrity of the tanks but he wants more scientific information to determine it's the correct way to spend scarce money.

Wyden noted the nation's most contaminated nuclear site -- and the challenges associated with ridding it of its toxic legacy -- will be a subject of upcoming hearings and a higher priority in Washington, D.C.

The federal government already spends $2 billion each year on Hanford cleanup -- one-third of its entire budget for nuclear cleanup nationally. The Energy Department has said it expects funding levels to remain the same for the foreseeable future, but a new Energy Department report released this week calls for annual budgets of as much as $3.5 billion during some years of the cleanup effort.

There are legal, moral and ethical considerations to cleaning up the Hanford site at the national level, Inslee said, adding that he will continue to insist that the Energy Department completely clean up the site.

But teens weren’t the only sources of inspiration from that day -- host Chelsea Clinton also had some words of wisdom to share with the young audience.

While you probably know her best as President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea has made a name for herself as a special correspondent for NBC News, as well as in her efforts to speak out about the uncomfortable topic of diarrhea, which is related to 100,000 deaths in Nigeria each year.

HuffPost Teen caught up with the impassioned former first daughter at TEDxTeen this past Saturday in New York. Here are five powerful pieces of advice for Generation Y we took from our conversation with her.

1. Ask yourself what you can do for others.

""When [my grandmother and parents] would ask me, 'Well, what did you do today?' part of what they implied was, 'Well, what did you do for others?' It would not have been okay at the dinner table if I just didn’t have something to say ... That was the kind of world I grew up in. And being asked those questions really often helped me to always think, 'Wow, I have a real responsibility to define my life partly through what I can do for others and what I can learn from others.' I’m grateful that they set that example.""

2. You should care about the world around you.

“I think [there] is a big misconception that people who are younger are more apathetic or more disinterested or more tuned out. That’s just not true. People are more connected, feel more empowered and feel a greater responsibility for their world than ever before. And we see that in so many different ways. I mean, a greater number and a greater percentage of people than ever before volunteer on a regular basis, and they actually keep volunteering once they’re in college ... young people [also] donate small dollar amounts when there are crises, like the Haiti earthquake. So I think all of this says that young people are far from apathetic, actually feel quite engaged, and thankfully, [feel] quite empowered.”

3. Do what you can.

“I think all the time, 'What can I be doing?' and then, 'What should I be doing?' ... Because if we feel like, 'Oh my gosh, we can do everything and we should do everything' -- that’s overwhelming and disempowering. So I think about the things where I can make a difference.""

4. If you have a great idea, speak up.

“Let your idea out of your head. Have the courage to share your idea, whether it’s with your teacher, a friend, online -- like an online community that is already concentrated around something that you really care about. See what the reaction is, see what the response is. Hopefully that will help surface different ideas to make your idea even stronger.”

5. ""Get caught trying.""

“The best advice that my mom gave me was repeating my grandmother’s mantra: Life’s about not what happens to you, it’s about what you do with what happens to you. It really is this kind of galvanizing message in my family. [Also] 'get caught trying,' which is something that has really motivated my father’s life. It’s always better to have tried and failed than to never have tried at all.”"

(VIDEO)","An estimated 40,000 people gathered in Washington, D.C. on Sunday for the Forward on Climate Rally on the National Mall. The rally preceded a march to the White House to urge President Barack Obama to take action against climate change and reject the Keystone XL pipeline.

350.org founder Bill McKibben said at the rally, according to a statement, “For 25 years our government has basically ignored the climate crisis: now people in large numbers are finally demanding they get to work."" He added, ""We shouldn't have to be here -- science should have decided our course long ago. But it takes a movement to stand up to all that money.""

Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune, who was arrested last week protesting the Keystone XL pipeline in front of the White House, reiterated environmentalists' call for Obama and the State Department to reject the permit for TransCanada's international oil sands pipeline.

He said, “President Obama holds in his hand a pen and the power to deliver on his promise of hope for our children. Today, we are asking him to use that pen to to reject the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline, and ensure that this dirty, dangerous, export pipeline will never be built.”

Along with denying the pipeline's permit, organizers 350.org, Sierra Club and the Hip-Hop Caucus hope to see the president work to limit U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and transition to renewable energy.

Actor and environmentalist Robert Redford previously wrote about the planned rally, ""This is the beginning. The beginning of a real battle, for America's future."" Redford echoed activists' call for Obama to take action. ""President Barack Obama's legacy will rest squarely on his response, resolve, and leadership in solving the climate crisis.""

Natural Resources Defense Council President Frances Beinecke argued, ""The time is right for this rally."" In the wake of Obama's comments on climate change in his State of the Union Address, Beinecke wrote, ""We want him to know that when he takes these bold actions to stabilize the climate, the American people will support him every step of the way.""

Along with the rally in Washington, D.C., environmental groups planned simultaneous rallies in cities across the U.S. A rally in Los Angeles, California, organized by a coalition of over 90 groups, was expected to be the largest climate change rally ever staged in Los Angeles, according to an emailed Statement from the Sierra Club.

In his 2013 State of the Union Address, President Obama said, ""We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy, and the most severe drought in decades, and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence. Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science -- and act before it's too late."" While Obama's speech was marked by sweeping rhetoric, it included ""little detail on how to tackle climate change and propel green energy,"" noted The Huffington Post's Lynne Peeples."
http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/16/politics/salazar-resigning/index.html,2013-01-16 00:00:00,"['Gloria Borger', 'Joe Sterling']",Interior’s Ken Salazar stepping down,"Interior Secretary Ken Salazar will step down at the end of March.

Story highlights Salazar is a former U.S. senator from Colorado He led the administration's reaction to the 2010 Gulf spill and explosion Salazar made strides in renewable energy, forging better relations with Native Americans

Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, who led the response to the 2010 BP oil spill and administered a moratorium on offshore drilling, announced Wednesday that he is stepping down.

The former Colorado lawmaker plans to return home in March after eight turbulent and busy years in Washington, four years in the U.S. Senate and four years as head of the Interior Department.

President Obama nominated him for the Cabinet post four years ago and he was unanimously confirmed.

He was most prominent when he spearheaded the administration reaction to the BP Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

Salazar issued a six-month drilling moratorium after the April 20, 2010, explosion.

Critics, including Republican leaders, Gulf state officials and Gulf Coast residents, slammed the ban. They said it would hurt oil and gas workers in the already hard-hit coastal communities, where hundreds of jobs were lost because of the disaster.

But Salazar said the moratorium provided time to make sure that similar accidents wouldn’t occur and that rig operators were prepared to deal with worst-case scenarios if they did happen again.

Eleven people died in the explosion, which spawned one of the worst environmental disasters in U.S. history. An estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil gushed into the Gulf before the broken well some 4,000 feet below the surface was capped.

“We have undertaken the most aggressive oil and gas safety and reform agenda in U.S. history, raising the bar on offshore drilling safety, practices and technology and ensuring that energy development is done in the right way and in the right places,” Salazar said in an Interior Department news release announcing his departure.

The department has offered millions of acres of offshore acreage in the Gulf for exploration and “is proceeding with cautious exploration of Arctic resources,” the release said. It added that the department has leased millions of acres onshore for oil and gas development and has protected “special landscapes for hunting and fishing.”

“Today, drilling activity in the Gulf is surpassing levels seen before the spill, and our nation is on a promising path to energy independence,” said Salazar, who also overhauled Interior’s management of oil and gas resources and installed new ethics standards for employees.

Obama’s Cabinet: Who’s in, who’s out?

Salazar also has pursued renewable energy, with his department authorizing 34 solar, wind and geothermal projects on public lands since 2009, the news release said. Those projects total enough energy to power more than 3 million homes.

“Today, the largest solar energy projects in the world are under construction on America’s public lands in the West, and we’ve issued the first leases for offshore wind in the Atlantic,” Salazar said in the release. “I am proud of the renewable energy revolution that we have launched.

The release also noted progress made during Salazar’s term regarding Native American lands. A settlement was reached and passed that addressed “long-standing injustices” involving the government’s trust management.

In addition, Obama signed into law water rights settlements that “help deliver clean drinking water” to tribes, the release said, and spearheaded a reform of surface leasing regulations for Native American lands.

“President Obama has made it a priority to empower our nation’s first Americans by helping to build stronger, safer and more prosperous tribal communities,” Salazar said.

Obama, in a separate release, said Salazar “helped usher in a new era of conservation for our nation’s land, water, and wildlife” and promoted renewable energy along with oil and gas production. He “played an integral role in my administration’s successful efforts to expand responsible development of our nation’s domestic energy resources” and made strides in ties with Native Americans.

“I have valued Ken’s friendship since we both entered the Senate in 2005, and I look forward to receiving his counsel even after he returns to his home state of Colorado,” the president said.

Salazar’s move comes amid criticism over Obama’s second-term Cabinet nominees. He has taken flak because major nominations have gone to white males.

White males have been tapped for three prominent Cabinet positions with second-term openings: secretary of state, secretary of defense and secretary of the treasury. One of those posts has been held by a woman, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while the others have been held by white men.

Salazar focused on energizing Hispanics

While Obama’s record of appointing women to top posts doesn’t differ significantly from that of former President George W. Bush, many take the issue with Obama’s appointments since he ran as a champion of women’s issues during both of his presidential election campaigns, unlike his predecessor.

Twenty-eight activists and two journalists face up to seven years in jail over a protest against offshore drilling in the Arctic in which some members of the environmental group tried to scale a Russian oil rig.

""It would be great if this misunderstanding could be resolved and the protesters can be home with their families in time for Christmas. We live in hope,"" McCartney wrote on his website.

He said Putin, whom he met when he first performed in Moscow in 2003, had not replied to the Oct. 14 letter, although he said Russia's ambassador to London responded by saying the group's plight was not properly represented by the media.

""Vladimir, millions of people in dozens of countries would be hugely grateful if you were to intervene to bring about an end to this affair,"" McCartney wrote in the letter.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he only heard of the letter from media reports but had not received it, according to the state-run Itar-Tass news agency.

The Prirazlomnaya oil rig which the Greenpeace activists tried to scale on Sept. 18 is owned by state energy giant Gazprom and is at the heart of a Kremlin drive to tap the Arctic's natural resources and expand Russia's economy.

Quoting from the Beatles' song ""Back in the USSR"", which he composed 45 years ago, McCartney wrote: ""That song had one of my favourite Beatles lines in it: 'Been away so long I hardly knew the place, gee it's good to be back home'.""

""Could you make that come true for the Greenpeace prisoners?"" he asked.

Investigators charged the 30 with hooliganism, to replace original charges of piracy, which carry a 15-year jail term. Greenpeace says piracy charges have not been formally dropped and that the 30 are now effectively charged with both.

The Netherlands, where Greenpeace has its main headquarters, has asked an international tribunal to order the release of the group from pre-trial detention.

McCartney has previously expressed support for the Pussy Riot protest group which performed a ""punk prayer"" in a Moscow cathedral last year against Putin's ties with the Russian Orthodox Church.

Appeals for leniency failed to help them escape a two-year jail sentence.

Critics accuse Putin of using the courts to persecute his opponents, a charge the Kremlin denies."

Campylobacter Bacteria

If so, antibiotics could do the same thing to humans. In support of this idea, a paper published last month in Nature, identifies a correlation between diversity of gut microflora and human obesity. A nine-year study, led by Dr. S. Dusko Ehrlich of France’s National Institute for Agricultural Research, compared microbiotas–the 100-trillion-member microbial ecosystems that populate the body–of slim and obese people. The team found obese people have lower microbial diversity in their bellies. This is consistent with earlier research in mice, as well as a paper published last year in Journal of Obesity that found a strong correlation between young children’s exposure to antibiotics and later obesity. Perhaps more significantly, the team behind the Nature study found a correlation between low microbial diversity and heart disease, diabetes and cancer, regardless of weight. “Even lean people who are poor in bacterial species have a higher risk of developing these pathologies,” Ehrlich told NPR.

For decades, livestock producers have used low doses of antibiotics to expedite animal growth. The practice lowers feed costs while increasing meat production, and nearly 80 percent (you read that right!) of the antibiotics used in the United States are for this purpose. The evidence that low dose use of antibiotics in livestock encourages the growth of antibiotic-resistant “superbugs,” such as MRSA becomes stronger everyday. For that reason it’s banned in many countries, but remains common in the U.S. Although prophylactic antibiotic use in livestock has been in use since the 1950s, how it works has long been a mystery. But evidence is mounting that it might be due to antibiotics killing microorganisms that populate animals’ guts.All this supports the ideas that eating a poor diet or taking lots of antibiotics may be factors in the obesity epidemic and associated health problems, in part, because of the way they affect our gut microbes, Ehrlich says."

If the company behind the pipeline, TransCanada, follows all the rules, its ""construction and normal operation"" of the pipeline should pose no major risks, the State Department said in its draft environmental impact statement. That statement is now open for a 45-day public comment period. The Obama administration will make its decision about the pipeline later this year, likely in mid-summer.

The project was delayed last year because of concerns about how it would affect Nebraska's sensitive Sand Hills region. The Obama administration -- which needs to approve the project because it crosses an international border -- turned down those plans, forcing TransCanada to draft a new proposed route.

The pipeline has touched off an intense debate in the United States. Supporters like it because it will carry 830,000 barrels a day of oil from Alberta, Canada, to the U.S. Gulf Coast, potentially reducing imports from other, more volatile areas. Its construction will create an estimated 5,000 jobs, according to the State Department. TransCanada forecasts even higher job growth.

Related: America has an energy boom. Now what?

Opponents hate it because oil from Canada's oil sands region produces 5% to 30% more greenhouse gases than other types of conventional crude. Extracting oil from the sands also uses massive amounts of water and can result in deforestation. Transporting it runs the risk of spills.

The State Department report did take into account the environmental impact of the sands' heavy oil, which it said is 17% dirtier than the average barrel of oil used in the United States. However, it also said that not building the pipeline would not significantly limit oil sands development, or U.S. consumption of heavy oil.

If Keystone is not constructed, that oil would be still be extract and used, State believes. It would simply be transported to buyers by rail or other means instead of through the pipeline.

The report was not well-received by environmentalists.

Thanks so much for the note regarding Labor Day - you have always been timely with these, unlike some of your predecessors.

You and I are going to part ways today. I had a great ""gig"" here in the regional office - I had a great boss, great co-workers, I was still learning a good bit, and the good days were always outweighing the bad days. I was pretty certain (after my first 5 years) that I could outlast any administration the governor could appoint. I had no problem with the Martin administration - he was a man of science and no extremist.

Between your inappropriate mission statement, the dismantling of the Division of Water Quality, and HB74 (along with a few other gems from this session's NCGA), I see no reason to continue here - because my own mission - to assist all citizens and protect those that don't have a voice, would be compromised.

I was a good regulator - I had a bit of distrust for both sides of the aisle - which made me regulate evenly and with common sense and fair judgment. Over the past 24 years I've had the privilege to have worked with some of the most intelligent, articulate, and respected environmental scientists and engineers - I'd put them up against my friends in the private sector any day of the week. But the disdain for them (and me) by this administration is too much to bear.

When you pushed our reasonable, right-leaning WQ Director out, I knew we were in trouble. When you guys (and they are mostly guys...) pushed out a very thoughtful and judicial Environmental Management Commission chair, I knew we were moving into a sand pit that we weren't going to dig out of easily. When you, along with your ""great Tom Reeder"", decided to cleave off the stormwater programs and move it to Land Resources, who have never been trained for such..nor do they much care about WQ, I knew it was time to leave. I'm sure the 401 Water Quality program is next (especially since you said we should be more like TX and SC).

I'm all about customer service (as the majority of employees in DWQ are, and have always been), but that just seems to be a smokescreen for a very extremist republican agenda.

Likely there will be some uptick in the business environment in the next few years (mainly because the economy has started to recover from the disaster your friends on Wall Street created). But when the hot summers and the drought years come back, and we get fish kills again, and maybe there's fracking going on in the sandhills - it will be the fine folks at DENR who will get blamed for the chaos. The politicians and their appointees, that did the dismantling and created the chaos, will be long gone. We know the drill.

For my brothers and sisters in the Division of WATER QUALITY (the so called ""seat warmers"") who don't have the option to be able to move on, due to various obligations and a destroyed economy, let me leave you with a video I pilfered from the internet 'cause I didn't have the tools to make my own.

You can view this while I gather up my toothbrush and grab my loincloth to start heading out the door.

Thanks,

http://articles.latimes.com/2011/apr/10/opinion/la-oe-lynas-nukes-20110410,2011-04-10 00:00:00,[],Why nuclear power is still a good choice,"What a strange turn of events. Instead of uniting the environmental movement in renewed opposition to nuclear power, the Fukushima disaster in Japan has divided it still further. An increasing number of green advocates, including some very prominent voices, have declared their support for nuclear power as a clean energy option, even as radioactive water accumulates and the timeline for cleaning up the contaminated areas extends by decades. Can they be serious?

They can. The irony of Fukushima is that in forcing us all to confront our deepest fears about the dangers of nuclear power, we find many of them to be wildly irrational -- based on scare stories propagated through years of unchallenged mythology and the repeated exaggerations of self-proclaimed “experts” in the anti-nuclear movement. As the British environmental writer George Monbiot has pointed out, if we took the scientific consensus on nuclear energy as seriously as we take the scientific consensus on climate change, we environmentalists would be telling a very different story.

The science on radiation tells us that the effects of Fukushima are serious but so far much less so than some of the more hyperbolic media coverage might suggest. The power plant operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., has been releasing enormous quantities of radioactive water into the sea, for example. It sounds scary, but a member of the public would have to eat seaweed and seafood harvested just one mile from the discharge pipe for a year to receive an effective dose of 0.6 millisieverts. To put this in context, every American receives on average 3 millisieverts each year from natural background radiation, and a hundred times more than this in some naturally radioactive areas. As for the Tokyo tap water that was declared unsafe for babies, the highest measured levels of radioactivity were 210 becquerels per liter, less than a quarter of the European legal limit of 1,000 becquerels per liter. Those leaving Tokyo because of this threat will have received more radiation on the airplane flight out than if they had been more rational and stayed put.

For the green movement, which is often justifiably accused of making the perfect the enemy of the good, having to confront real-world choices about energy technologies is painful. Most environmentalists assert that a combination of renewables and efficiency can decarbonize our energy supply and save us both from global warming and the presumed dangers of nuclear power. This is technically possible but extremely unlikely in practice. In the messy real world, countries that decide to rely less on nuclear will almost certainly dig themselves even deeper into a dependence on dirty fossil fuels, especially coal.

Advertisement

In the short term, this is already happening. In Germany -- whose government tried to curry favor with a strongly anti-nuclear population by rashly closing seven perfectly safe nuclear plants after the Fukushima crisis began -- coal has already become the dominant factor in electricity prices once again. Regarding carbon dioxide emissions, you can do the math: Just add about 11 million tons per year for each nuclear plant replaced by a coal plant newly built or brought back onto the grid.

In China the numbers become even starker. Coal is cheap there (as are the thousands of human lives lost in extracting it each year), and if the hundred or so new nuclear plants previously proposed in China up to 2030 are not built, it is a fair bet that more than a billion tons can be added to annual global carbon dioxide emissions as a result.

Japan is also heavily dependent on coal, so it is a fair bet that less nuclear power there will add substantially to the country’s emissions. No wonder the Japanese are insisting on backing off from the Kyoto climate treaty. Looking at the entire global picture, I estimate that turning away from nuclear power could make the difference between whether the world warms by 2 degrees Celsius (bad but manageable) and 3 degrees Celsius (disastrous) in the next century.

We have already made this mistake once. In the 1970s it looked as if nuclear power was going to play a much bigger role than eventually turned out to be the case. What happened was Three Mile Island, and the birth of an anti-nuclear movement that stopped dozens of half-built or proposed reactors; coal plants were substituted instead. It is therefore fair to say that the environmental movement played a substantial role in causing global warming, surely an ecological error it should learn from in years ahead.

Don’t get me wrong: I am an enthusiastic proponent of replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources. I strongly support wind, solar and other clean-tech options. But all energy technologies come with an ecological price tag. Wind turbines kill and injure birds and bats. Solar thermal plants proposed in the Mojave Desert have conservationists up in arms. If we are serious about taking biodiversity into consideration as well as climate change, these concerns cannot be idly dismissed. In terms of land use, nuclear scores very well, because the comparatively small quantities of fuel required means less land disturbed or ruined by mines, processing and related uses.

Take Japan again. According to some recent number crunching by the Breakthrough Institute, a centrist environmental think tank, phasing out Japan’s current nuclear generation capacity and replacing it with wind would require a 1.3-billion-acre wind farm, covering more than half the country’s total land mass. Going for solar instead would require a similar land area, and would in economic terms cost the country more than a trillion dollars.

Those debating the future of nuclear power also tend to focus on out-of-date technology. No one proposes to build boiling-water reactors of 1960s-era Fukushima vintage in the 21st century. Newer designs have a much greater reliance on passive safety, as well as a host of other improvements. Fourth-generation options, such as the “integral fast reactor” reportedly being considered by Russia, could be even better. Fast-breeders like the IFR will allow us to power whole countries cleanly by burning existing stockpiles of nuclear waste, depleted uranium and military-issue plutonium. And the waste left over at the end would become safe after a mere 300 years, so no Yucca Mountains needed there. IFRs exist only on paper, however; we need to urgently research prototypes before moving on to large-scale deployment.

What is needed is perspective. Nuclear energy is not entirely safe, as Fukushima clearly shows, even if the current radiation-related death toll is zero and will likely remain so. But coal and other fossil fuels are far, far worse. And insisting only on renewables risks worsening global warming as an unintended consequence. We need a portfolio of clean energy technologies, deployed in the most environmentally responsible way. Above all, let us base our energy policy on a scientifically valid appreciation of real-world risk, and not on scare stories from the past."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/12/Obama-Ethanol-Policy-Eroding-Conserved-Lands,2013-11-12 00:00:00,['Breitbart News'],Obama Ethanol Policy Eroding Conserved Lands,"Doug Davenport, a Department of Agriculture official, is a true believer in the conservation of America’s land. When Davenport told the Associated Press he was deeply concerned about the havoc ethanol production was causing to these lands, he got an email from Tom Vilsack, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture. The message was to stop talking.

Vilsack wants to make sure all are in line: “We just want to have a consistent message on the topic.” Recently, he insisted to an audience of ethanol lobbyists on Capitol Hill that being for ethanol is a good thing. In contrast, environmentalists argue that the push for ethanol has increased prices for corn, incentivizing farmers to convert millions of acres of erodible land for the planting of additional corn fields. This practice has ruined the lands, poisoned streams, and devastated fragile eco-systems.

Converting corn to ethanol was conceived as a “green” program to decrease fossil fuel emissions and to therefore aid in the reduction of global warming. Unfortunately, “green” programs sometimes don’t turn out so green. The mandate which dictates that gasoline have a certain percentage of ethanol has proven to be ineffectual when looking at the overall energy equation in America.

Since Barak Obama came into office five years ago, he has proselytized and created policy encouraging farmers to reap the rewards of ethanol production. As a result, five million acres of green grassy rolling hills that had been reserved for conservation purposes are gone. Moreover, the process of growing this vast amount of corn draws upon countless other energy sources, using excessive water resources and increased natural gas and coal usage. The rise in fertilizer usage has amplified nitrates and nitrogen in water streams, creating aquatic dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico.

Sadly, children have also been stricken with “blue baby” syndrome as a result of the nitrate poisoning.

All of this leads to the conclusion that this slaughter of our environment is not only destructive but pointless. In a Congressional report on the effects of ethanol production, the EPA indicated it was “uncertain” that farmers should plant on land set aside for conservation, while the Department of Energy was resolute, saying conservation land “is unsuitable for use for annual row crop production.”

Bob Sussman, retired EPA senior policy counsel, lamented, “I don’t remember anybody having great passion for this.” He added, “I don’t have a lot of personal enthusiasm for the program.”"

Fire me, Marsh told lawmakers. And everyone I work with.

“I have concluded that [my agency] is a congressional experiment that hasn’t worked out in practice,” wrote Marsh, who is the inspector general for the Denali Commission, an economic-development agency based in Alaska. “I recommend that Congress put its money elsewhere.”

This has been tried before. But not often. Old Washington hands could remember only two other federal workers who had lobbied publicly to have themselves defunded. One was a high-level Ronald Reagan appointee. One was a lowly weather observer.

Both failed. Meaning they weren’t fired.

Read the letter A government employee asks Congress to defund his agency Denali Commission Inspector General Mike Marsh's letter, with key sections highlighted by the reporter. (Image: Screengrab from www.denali.gov)

Marsh seems likely to fail, too — even though his requests arrived in Washington in the middle of a battle to cut the budget. His agency seems protected by one of Washington’s most enduring customs: the defense of home-state giveaways, even in times of national austerity.

For now, the main impact of his request seems to be within his small agency — where the great debate over spending has turned into a smaller, tenser confrontation among colleagues.

Until a Washington Post reporter called, Marsh’s fellow employees did not know he was lobbying to have them cut off.

“No. Never heard that,” Joel Neimeyer, the top federal official at the Denali Commission, said when a reporter called. “Thank you for sharing,” he said. Still processing it. This was a man he and other staffers had gone to dinner with: Neimeyer thought Marsh was “charming, with a pretty good sense of humor.”

“What do you think of him sharing it with Congress and not the agency?” Neimeyer asked.

Marsh sent his first requests to Washington this summer. Then, this month — as Congress fought a battle over next year’s budget — he sent another letter, this one to Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.). He said his opponents in the agency were “shooting the messenger, tackling the referee, or berating the pathologist who has to convey the news one would prefer not to hear.”

Colleagues: Not amused

He’s right that they’re not happy.

“He’s done a great job of flummoxing our ability to serve these communities any better,” Vince Beltrami, a Denali Commission member and a leader of the Alaska AFL-CIO, said Tuesday when the commission met in Anchorage.

They spent more than an hour talking about Marsh. They didn’t spend any time talking to him, though, because he didn’t show up.

“Mike Marsh, are you online?” Neimeyer said.

Silence.

“Mike, or anyone representing Mike, are you online?” he repeated.

So he hadn’t even called in.

In today’s federal government — with budget cuts looming over most agencies — what Marsh did is gob-smacking. This is the duck that hunted himself.

But Marsh believes there is a strong and convincing case for his own unemployment. He laid it out in seven pages, complete with graphics and a bibliography, and sent it to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and to the Office of Management and Budget.

And to The Washington Post.

“At this point, I recommend that Congress no longer send Denali an annual ‘base’ appropriation,” Marsh wrote. Last year, that base appropriation from Congress was about $10.6 million. Marsh doesn’t say the agency has to die, necessarily. It just has to go away. After leaving the federal government, he says, it might survive as an independent nonprofit organization.

A channel for pork

That would be an unusual end for an unusual agency. The Denali Commission began in 1998, as a pet project of then-Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska). It is not connected to Denali National Park: Both are named for Alaska’s iconic mountain peak. The commission’s purpose was to help people in rural Alaska, by building power plants, offering job training and improving health care.

It became the channel for a great river of pork. In 2006, in the heyday of both Stevens and congressional earmark spending, he sent $150 million flowing through the agency.

But in 2008, Stevens lost an election. Then, in 2010, Stevens died. Then earmarks were banned.

The river shrank. But it didn’t stop.

The Denali Commission still funnels federal grants to projects in the state, with a staff of about 12. It still enjoys strong support from Alaska’s three-member congressional delegation, which fought presidential efforts to cut its funding. And the Alaska lawmakers have proposed a reauthorization measure designed to give the commission a lasting stream of funding.

“We’ve been successful the last several years, as you know, to keep the money in there,” said Sen. Mark ­Begich (D-Alaska). He thinks the commission provides valuable coordination, to make sure grant money reaches the places where it would help the most.

And he also thinks that if it were going to die, it would be dead already.

“Think about it. The last 41 / 2 years, five years — this would be the time that they slice it to zero,” Begich said. Instead, “it’s been pretty maintained and stabilized.”

To Marsh, however, the commission is an idea that time has proved wrong. For one thing, he says, it often builds projects — power plants or medical clinics — in tiny towns that won’t have the resources to keep them running.

For another thing, Marsh says, the commission is a middleman where a middleman isn’t needed.

If the U.S. government wants to pay for primary-care clinics in Alaska, he told Congress, it should simply send the money straight to the state or to tribal governments that build medical clinics. Why pass it through a little office in Anchorage first?

If Congress listened, that would be the end of Marsh’s job, too.

He does not seem too bothered. “There are certain things in life that aren’t designed to be done alone,” he wrote in an e-mail. Meaning that this inspector general’s job is too much work for one person anyway.

Marsh is a former prosecutor who lives in Phoenix and commutes to Alaska only when he needs to. Before he took this job, he audited state agencies for the Alaska government. “I have a long history of upsetting Alaskans,” Marsh wrote in an e-mail.

He declined to be interviewed in person for this article, saying inspector-general rules won’t allow it. He also would not allow himself to be photographed.

A rare stance

It is a rare thing, of course, that anybody stands up and calls himself a human boondoggle. Most federal workers find their jobs — and their agencies — meaningful.

Those who don’t, quit. Those who don’t quit usually just keep their mouths shut.

But not all of them.

“The first thing that I would urge the Congress to do — and I urge this not from the perspective of being a Republican or a Democrat, but a citizen who pays taxes — would be to discontinue doing what we are doing,” said Orson Swindle, who headed an agency called the Economic Development Administration in the Reagan administration.

Swindle was a former Vietnam prisoner of war who — with Reagan’s backing — wanted to get rid of his own agency. It had become an infamous delivery system for Congress’s pork, funding such pet projects as an attempt to build the Great Pyramids of Indiana.

But Congress liked it the way it was. The agency stayed.

Eventually, Swindle quit, disappointed but not surprised: “We’re sitting there feeding the beast that’s going to eat us,” he says now of the deficit.

A few years later, in 1993, Vice President Al Gore got another such request, in a letter from rural Kansas.

“I feel like that person in the old movie who writes in lipstick on bathroom mirrors, “Stop me before I kill again,’ ” Bruce Bair of Schoenchen, Kan., wrote to Gore. “However, in my case, the legend should be, ‘Stop me before I steal some more.’ ”

Bair was a weather observer for the Federal Aviation Administration, stationed at a little-used airfield in Russell, Kan. Bair was a human backup, to relay weather reports to pilots if the weather machine broke.

It never broke. So Bair felt he was “stealing” his salary of about $11 an hour. Gore read the letter and cited it prominently in his “Reinventing Government” program. But Bair wasn’t fired. In fact, when he quit, the government hired somebody to replace him. Eventually, the FAA shut down the weather station at Russell Airport, home town of longtime Sen. Robert J. Dole (R-Kan.).

Today, Bair recalls the episode with a sense of satisfaction: He hated his boss. So there was a thrill in telling the world what a waste they all were.

“I didn’t think there was a chance in a million that any one would ever read that letter,” Bair wrote in an e-mail recently. “I got revenge, all right.”

That’s the list. Two. Now, three.

An unlikely extinction

In Marsh’s case, his request has attracted attention from the oversight committee’s chairman, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), and from Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), who sent a letter on Monday asking for Marsh’s independence to be respected.

The answer here “may be reform. It may be shutting the whole thing down. But clearly this auditor is on to something,” said McCaskill, a former state auditor who did tough evaluations of Missouri agencies.

But the commission is a long way from dead. Just this summer, an Ohio congressman suggested cutting it — along with similar agencies that pay for development in the Appalachians, the Mississippi Delta and other regions.

The House voted. All the commissions survived.

And in Alaska, the tables have already been turned on Marsh. The Government Accountability Office is now doing an audit of him, at the request of Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). Many at the commission — and some on Capitol Hill — have begun to wonder why the agency needs an inspector general who lives in Arizona.

Or one who wants to inspect his agency right out of existence.

“The Denali Commission’s mission continues to be critical,” Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska) said in a written statement. “Unfortunately, all IGs are not created equal.”"

Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas, and 20 other Republican lawmakers sent a letter to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy on Thursday, claiming the agency has ""muzzled"" members of its independent science advisory board.

The EPA released a proposal in September that would set emissions caps for new coal-fired power plants and would likely require the industry to use carbon-capture technology, which involves burying the carbon underground.

Critics of the proposed rule say the technology, which is still under development, is too expensive, not commercially available and poses safety risks.

The lawmakers claim the agency is ignoring dissenting voices on its science advisory board, which recommended a review of the science underpinning the newest power plant rule.

A senior official at EPA recently deflected the scientists' criticisms by claiming that the rule, which has yet to be finalized, doesn't need to address carbon dioxide storage, the lawmakers said.

“We are concerned about the agency’s apparent disregard for the concerns of its science advisors,” the lawmakers wrote. “Science is a valuable tool to help policymakers navigate complex issues. However, when inconvenient facts are disregarded or when dissenting voices are muzzled, a frank discussion becomes impossible.""

The agency maintains the carbon-capture technology has been ""adequately demonstrated"" based on a government-funded projects under construction in Mississippi and three planned projects in Texas, California and Canada.

The lawmakers said the proposed mandates in the rule would ""create regulatory burdens"" and ""litigation risks"" for the coal industry and would result in the loss of American jobs.

“The EPA’s proposed power plant regulations will put Americans out of work and will make electricity more expensive and less reliable,"" the lawmakers wrote. ""It is misleading and dangerous for EPA to quietly dismiss inconvenient facts and ignore the consequences of its costly regulations. Americans deserve honesty.”

In October, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Rep. Ed Whitfield, R-Ky., released draft legislation to block the EPA's proposal to limit emissions from new power plants and require the agency to set new rules that incorporate ""commercially feasible"" technologies.

The Manchin-Whitfield proposal has yet to be officially introduced."

His plan, unveiled Tuesday at Georgetown University in Washington, will set off legal and political battles that will last years.

But experts say that if all goes well for the president, the plan could potentially meet his stated goal of an overall emissions reduction of 17 percent by 2020, compared with the level in 2005.

“If the question is, ‘Will this solve our emissions problem?’ the answer is no,” said Michael A. Levi, an energy analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. “If the question is, ‘Could this move us along the path we want to be on?’ the answer is yes, it could.”"

But it kept the stockpile going at a helium reserve near Amarillo, Tex.

In 1996, during the Newt Gingrich era, Congress voted to go out of the helium business and let private enterprise take over as soon as the reserve paid off the money the government had sunk into it.

Hasn’t quite worked out. The debt is almost paid off, but the magic of the marketplace hasn’t kicked in. If the reserve closes now, the country loses 40 percent of its helium supply. So, last week, the House voted to extend the program. “Many people don’t believe that the federal government should be in the helium business, and I would agree,” said Hastings, as he pushed the bill to keep the government in the helium business.

There are two ways to look at this story. One is that it’s about the impossibility of ever actually stopping any government program. Former Representative Barney Frank, who said in 1996 that if Congress could not manage to get rid of the helium reserve “then we cannot undo anything,” hasn’t changed his mind. “Everybody is against waste, but strongly defends this or that particular piece,” Frank said in a phone interview.

He’s right. I have fond memories of listening to protests after Congress managed, with great effort, to end a totally useless subsidy on mohair. Most of the howls came from lawmakers from Texas, land of many mohair goats. “I have a mohair sweater! It’s my favorite one!” cried Republican Lamar Smith. The subsidy came creeping back a few years later.

But there’s another possible moral. The helium program is great; it provided the country with a crucial product that business wasn’t prepared to produce. It spurred economic growth and scientific research and made enough profit to pay the taxpayers back.

Maybe the only mistake was trying to pull the plug in the first place.

“The federal government going into helium in the 1920s I think was a fine thing,” said Holt. He looks upon the current bill not as a temporary fix but as “a validation” of government’s role in looking after things that the private sector is reluctant or afraid to take on.

The helium reserve, by the way, is still going to run dry in five or 10 years. Maybe private enterprise will step up to the plate. But if not, somebody’s going to have to organize one hell of a balloon recycling program."

Unanimous ruling protects biotechnology entrepreneurs from predators

Justices gave little credence to Indiana farmer%27s argument

Ruling does not settle all future cases involving self-replicating products

WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court usually isn't friendly toward questionable patents, but it came down overwhelmingly on the side of agribusiness giant Monsanto Monday in a case that's bound to resonate throughout the biotechnology industry.

The court ruled unanimously that an Indiana farmer violated Monsanto's patent on genetically modified soybeans when he culled some from a grain elevator and used them to replant his own crop in future years.

""If simple copying were a protected use, a patent would plummet in value after the first sale of the first item containing the invention,"" Justice Elena Kagan ruled in a short 10-page opinion. ""The undiluted patent monopoly, it might be said, would extend not for 20 years as the Patent Act promises, but for only one transaction. And that would result in less incentive for innovation than Congress wanted.""

Who it helps: Inventors and entrepreneurs who have patents on products that can be self-replicated, from computer software to cell lines. While Kagan's decision is limited to the Monsanto case, it bolsters the argument that self-replicating products can be protected from patent infringement even if their challengers go through third parties.

Who it hurts: Consumers paying high prices. The Center for Food Safety released a report in February that showed three corporations control much of the global commercial seed market. It found that from 1995-2011, the average cost to plant 1 acre of soybeans rose 325%.

What's to come: Still pending is a decision on whether human genes can be patented. That case tests a company's patent on the genes that can identify an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. During oral arguments in April, the justices seemed far more skeptical of the merits of that patent.

Monsanto's soybeans represent the cream of the crop because they are resistant to the weed killer Roundup. Farmers must pay Monsanto's price to plant the beans themselves.

That's not what Indiana farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman did. After one year of going through Monsanto, he bought his second crop from a grain elevator. Then he used his own soybeans that resisted Roundup in future years -- in essence, the court said, making copies of a patented invention.

Bowman's attorney, Mark Walters, had argued that the Monsanto seeds were acquired innocently enough from the grain elevator, and that Bowman's little operation never would threaten the company's monopoly.

Two lower federal courts weren't impressed with Bowman's case, ruling in favor of Monsanto. And that argument carried little weight with the justices when the case was argued in February. They noted that Monsanto had spent hundreds of millions of dollars over more than a decade to perfect its soybeans -- something it would not have done if others could so easily replicate them.

Bowman contended the soybeans were ""self-replicating,"" but Kagan said that ""blame-the-bean defense"" wasn't worthy.

""Bowman was not a passive observer of his soybeans' multiplication,"" she said. ""Or, put another way, the seeds he purchased, miraculous though they might be in other respects, did not spontaneously create eight successive soybean crops.

""It was Bowman, and not the bean, who controlled the reproduction (unto the eighth generation) of Monsanto's patented invention,"" Kagan said.

Monsanto officials applauded the decision, not just for the company but for innovators of all shapes and sizes.

""The court's ruling today ensures that longstanding principles of patent law apply to breakthrough 21st century technologies that are central to meeting the growing demands of our planet and its people,"" said David F. Snively, the company's executive vice president. ""The ruling also provides assurance to all inventors throughout the public and private sectors that they can and should continue to invest in innovation that feeds people, improves lives, creates jobs, and allows America to keep its competitive edge.""

Jim Greenwood, president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization, said the ruling will benefit all forms of biotechnology, ""as well as the patients, farmers and consumers who benefit from biotechnology's help in healing, feeding and fueling the world.""

But Center for Food Safety executive director Andrew Kimbrell called the ruling a setback for farmers. ""The court chose to protect Monsanto over farmers,"" he said. ""The court's ruling is contrary to logic and to agronomics, because it improperly attributes seeds' reproduction to farmers, rather than nature.""

Fordham University School of Law professor Mark Patterson noted the decision stops short of determining how self-reproducing inventions should be handled in all cases.

""Justice Kagan, in the last paragraph of the opinion, noted that 'such inventions are becoming ever more prevalent, complex, and diverse,'"" Patterson said. ""Either the court or Congress will have to address them again soon.""

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is under a judge's order to make a final determination on listing the Greater sage grouse as a threatened or endangered species. The species is found in 11 Western states, including Nevada, Utah, Idaho and Oregon.

According to the Bureau of Land Management, the sage grouse have declined in number over the past century because of the loss of critical sagebrush habitat. The Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed to list as threatened populations of the sage grouse in Nevada and California.

Ranchers and the oil and gas industry dodged regulations in 2005 when the government decided against extending new protections. The possible listing has been compared to the northern spotted owl, whose listing as a threatened species in 1990 drew criticism from the logging industry in the Northwest, according to The Associated Press.

Grant Gerber, a commissioner in Elko County, Nevada, and longtime critic of U.S. land managers says he's convinced the feds have already made up their mind to list the sage grouse as a threatened or endangered species.

But a Bureau of Land Management official says that's not the case and insisted at a public meeting in Elko last week they want the community's input on how best to save the troubled bird without a federal listing.

Gerber, a former state lawmaker, suggested the BLM and U.S. Forest Service are seeking comment on a regional sage-grouse conservation plan only to placate critics of the push to protect the Greater sage grouse.

The draft conservation plan, which applies to all of Nevada and parts of northern California, includes more than a third of the preliminary prime habitat and general habitat identified in Elko County at about 7.8 million acres, the Elko Daily Free Press reported.

“In the rest of the state, it’s a horrible situation. In Elko County, it’s a death blow,"" Elko County Commissioner Jeff Williams said. “In Elko County, it’s the whole county. It’s everything we’ve got. It’s recreation, it’s mining, it’s oil, it’s agriculture.""

Williams said sage grouse could “shut the county down,” according to the report.

At a meeting on Thursday, the commissioners said none of the outlined actions in the draft plan were preferable and floated the possibility of filing suit against the federal government.

Former Republican Assemblyman John Carpenter said he believes the government is determined to list the chicken-sized game bird as part of a bigger strategy to lock up federal lands.

""These people don't give a damn about the sage grouse. All it is is for control,"" Carpenter told the Elko Daily Free Press.

""They want to get control of the people that are using the public land and get them off,"" he said. ""They want to get the cowboys and the miners and recreationists and everybody else and get them off.""

BLM Elko District Manager Jill Silvey disagreed with Carpenter's assertion that the BLM was in favor of a listing.

""That's clearly not our objective,"" she said about the listing decision the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is expected to make in the fall of 2014.

After the BLM reviews public comment on the proposal, it will develop a proposed conservation plan to be drafted around June. That will be followed by agency review and a 60-day governor's consistency review and a protest period, with the intention is to issue a public record of decision by Sept. 30.

http://news.yahoo.com/government-moves-wrap-gray-wolf-084010826.html,,[],Government moves to wrap up gray wolf recovery,"TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) -- Federal officials are declaring victory in their four-decade campaign to rescue the gray wolf, a predator the government once considered a nuisance and tried to exterminate.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Friday proposed removing the animal's remaining protections as an endangered species across the Lower 48 states. The exception would be in the Southwest, where the recovery effort for the related Mexican gray wolf is lagging.

Despite criticism from some scientists and members of Congress who consider the move premature, agency director Dan Ashe said the wolf can thrive and even enlarge its territory without continued federal protection.

""Taking this step fulfills the commitment we've made to the American people — to set biologically sound recovery goals and return wolves to state management when those goals have been met and threats to the species' future have been addressed,"" Ashe said.

The proposal will be subject to a 90-day public comment period and a final decision made within a year.

Wolves once roamed across most of North America. But trapping, poisoning and aerial shooting encouraged by federal bounties left just one small remnant, in northern Minnesota, by the time they were placed on the protected list in 1974.

By then, attitudes had shifted. Wildlife managers acknowledged the role predators play in providing balanced ecosystems, and the then-new Endangered Species Act mandated protections.

More than 6,100 wolves have now spread across portions of 10 states, primarily in the Northern Rockies and the western Great Lakes regions. Most are in Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Packs also have formed in portions of Washington and Oregon, and individual wolves have been spotted in Colorado, Utah, the Dakotas, California and the Northeast.

But they have yet to return to vast additional territory that researchers say has suitable habitat and abundant prey, including parts of the Pacific Northwest, the southern Rocky Mountains, upstate New York and New England.

Story continues

Environmental groups say wolves could make their way to those places — but only if legal protections remain to prevent them from being shot. Removing them now would put wolves ""at serious risk for ever achieving natural recovery,"" said Diane Bentivegna of the National Wolfwatcher Coalition.

Colorado alone has enough space to support up to 1,000 wolves, according to Carlos Carroll of California's Klamath Center for Conservation Research. He suggested wildlife officials were bowing to political pressure, exerted by elected officials across the West who pushed to limit the wolf's range.

""They've tried to devise their political position first, and then cherry-pick their science to support it,"" Carroll said of the Fish and Wildlife Service.

Maggie Howell of the Wolf Conservation Center in South Salem, N.Y., said the Adirondack Mountains and other parts of the Northeast are ""screaming for a predator like the wolf"" to thin an out-of-control deer herd.

Ashe, however, said it's unrealistic to think wolves can return to all or even most of their former range, even if scientifically feasible.

""Science is an important part of this decision, but really the key is the policy question of when is a species recovered,"" he said. ""Does the wolf have to occupy all the habitat that is available to it in order for it to be recovered? Our answer to that question is no.""

The wolf's resurgence has been unpopular among ranchers and others unhappy about attacks on livestock and popular sport animals — even as hunters and trappers in the last several years killed some 1,600 wolves after protections were lifted in Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Government wildlife agents responding to livestock attacks have killed thousands more in recent decades.

Removing legal protections could ease the hostility in the West, where many ranchers complained they're helpless to protect their herds from marauding attackers.

Hunting advocates also have complained as elk herds dwindle in some areas.

""We can't just say, let them go and let the predators manage the big game. That's not going to work in this day and age,"" said David Allen, president of the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation.

Yet the former director of the Fish and Wildlife Service under President Bill Clinton said the agency's proposal ""is a far cry from what we envisioned for gray wolf recovery when we embarked on this almost 20 years ago.""

""It's a low bar for endangered species recovery,"" said Jamie Rappaport Clark, who was with the agency when wolves were reintroduced in Idaho and Wyoming in the mid-1990s. She now heads the group Defenders of Wildlife.

David Mech, a leading wolf expert and senior scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey in St. Paul, Minn., said wolves already occupy about 80 percent of the territory where people are likely to tolerate them.

The Center for Biological Diversity vowed to challenge the government in court if it takes the animals off the endangered list.

The Humane Society of the United States, which has filed a lawsuit challenging the removal of protections from Great Lakes wolves, is reviewing the government's latest proposal, spokesman Kaitlin Sanderson said.

Ashe said the plan had been reviewed by top administration officials, including new Interior Secretary Sally Jewell. But he dismissed any claims of interference and said the work that went into the plan was exclusively that of the Fish and Wildlife Service.

He said the agency wants to focus future recovery efforts on a small number of wolves belonging to a subspecies, the Mexican gray wolf. Those occur in Arizona and New Mexico, where a protracted and costly reintroduction plan has stumbled in part due to illegal killings.

The agency is calling for a tenfold increase in the territory where biologists are working to rebuild that population, which now numbers 73 animals. Law enforcement efforts to ward off poaching in the region would be bolstered.

Congress Itself Keeps Burning a Dirtier Fuel,"WASHINGTON — As part of the climate change agenda he unveiled this year, President Obama made a commitment to significantly reduce the federal government’s dependence on fossil fuels. The government, he said in a speech in June at Georgetown University, “must lead by example.”

But just two miles from the White House stands the Capitol Power Plant, the largest single source of carbon emissions in the nation’s capital and a concrete example of the government’s inability to green its own turf.

The plant, which provides heating and cooling to the sprawling Capitol campus — 23 buildings that include the Library of Congress, the Supreme Court and Congressional office buildings, in addition to the Capitol building itself — is operated by Congress, and its transition to cleaner energy sources has been mired in national politics for years. But the failure of Congress to modernize its own facility also raises questions about the Obama administration’s ability to limit emissions from existing power plants when it has not been able to do so at a government-run facility so close to home.

The office of the architect of the Capitol, which oversees the operations of the plant, first moved to end the use of coal there in 2000 but was turned back by resistance from powerful coal-state senators who wanted to keep it as the primary fuel. The effort was revived in 2007 as a central part of the Green the Capitol Initiative, led by Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker at the time. The effort was defunded in 2011 after the Republicans took control of the House."

Sandy formed in late October and hit the New York-New Jersey area Oct. 29. This version has been corrected.

Congress approved $9.7 billion in new aid for victims of Hurricane Sandy on Friday, with a face-

saving quick move by the House three days after Speaker John A. Boehner earned scathing criticism from New York and New Jersey Republicans for canceling a late-night vote on the funds.

The bill, which will allow the Federal Emergency Management Agency to pay out claims to those who held federal flood insurance, was approved in the House on a 354 to 67 vote. After the House action, the Senate also adopted the bill in a quick, unanimous voice vote, sending it to President Obama.

Boehner (R-Ohio) seems to have had reason to be concerned about bringing a larger $60 billion spending measure to the floor Tuesday: All the votes against the smaller bill Friday came from his own party members.

They were encouraged by the conservative Club for Growth, which argued that the additional disaster spending should be offset with cuts to other government programs. The continued GOP opposition could spell trouble for a larger $51 billion Sandy bill that Boehner has promised will come before the House on Jan. 15.

And it provided a second example in a week of a bill approved with more Democratic support than Republican backing, an outcome that deeply troubles conservatives about the efficacy of their governing majority in the House.

Former vice presidential candidate and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (Wis.) was among the Republicans opposing the measure. So too were more than a dozen House freshmen who took office Thursday.

Still, the bill’s passage quieted a political storm for Boehner that erupted when he pulled the bill from the floor late Tuesday, worried he would have trouble corralling GOP votes for it from members exhausted from a debate over a bill to avert the “fiscal cliff” by raising taxes on the wealthy.

Boehner’s decision prompted an eruption of anger from lawmakers and others from states affected by the Oct. 29 superstorm. Gov. Chris Christie (R-N.J.) told reporters that Boehner had ignored four calls from him Tuesday night, and he blamed “toxic internal politics” in the Republican caucus for dropping the ball.

The New York Daily News ran a cover with Boehner’s face next to an image of the Statue of Liberty — with a bloody knife in her back.

Canceling the Tuesday vote meant the 112th Congress expired without action, delaying the vote until the 113th Congress took over Thursday. Still, Friday’s vote — with the speedy Senate approval — seems to have quieted the GOP criticism.

Republicans from affected states who had been threatening to withhold their support for Boehner to serve as speaker in the new Congress all backed him when the vote was held Thursday.

Still, Democrats pressed their criticisms of Boehner for the delay, noting that the $60 billion bill that passed the Senate on a bipartisan vote died with the congressional turnover. The fate of the bulk of that bill will not be settled until later this month.

“This was the most callous action I’ve ever seen,” said Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.). “The leadership of this House should be condemned for it.”

Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said he feared that the second, much larger installment of aid would get tripped up in the House in coming weeks.

“To be a bride and left at the altar once is bad enough. To be left twice would be unconscionable,” he said, calling Friday’s measure a “good, but small” step.

But Rep. Scott Garrett (R-N.J.), who was pushing for passage of the legislation, warned colleagues that the nation’s flood insurance program is “unsustainable,” with more money being paid out in claims than is collected in premiums.

“That can’t go on,” he said. “We must work together on that.”

In a joint statement, Christie and New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) praised the House action as a “necessary and critical first step” but said it was only a “down payment” on the $51 billion package.

The House vote was the first significant legislative act of the new Congress. The House later recessed until Jan. 14. Likewise, after taking action on the Sandy-related legislation, the Senate recessed until Jan. 21, when it will return for inaugural ceremonies."

The Arizona Republic

First major Arizona wildfire of the season began around 11%3A30 a.m. MST Tuesday

Burned area had been estimated as high as 11 square miles%2C now estimated at 10 square miles

A human sparked it%2C but officials have not said whether it was intentional or accidental

PRESCOTT, Ariz. — A fire in Arizona's Prescott National Forest that has consumed about 10 square miles of brush and timber is 10 percent contained, officials said Thursday.

The winds are expected to gust until Friday and die down Saturday, while humidity levels may go up, which would aid firefighting efforts, incident commander Tony Sciacca said.



""We can bump the containment up quickly when the wind dies,"" Sciacca said. ""If Mother Nature cooperates in the next couple of days, we hope to tell you we have more containment.""

Costs so far to fight the human-caused blaze, Arizona's first major wildfire of the summer , are between $2.4 million to $2.6 million, Sciacca said.



More than 600 federal, state and local firefighters have been battling the Doce Fire about 8 miles northwest of Prescott in Granite Mountain Wilderness since it was reported at 11 a.m. Tuesday. It is so named because it started near the Doce Pit, a popular target-shooting area.

Mandatory evacuation orders affecting 465 homes remain in place, Sciacca said. He could not give an indication when residents can return home.

Yavapai County Sheriff Scott Mascher said the fire is projected to move in a northwest direction. If that happens, authorities will use a 911 notification to give residents time to prepare for a possible evacuation.

""No structures have been lost, no lives have been lost,"" Mascher said. ""But we are not out of it yet. Overall I think things are going very well.""

Estimates Wednesday had the fire topping 11 square miles, but calculations based on infrared images taken overnight cut down the area.

Sizing up the fire is crucial because ""it's important to know what's burned out there,"" Sciacca said Thursday.

Gov. Jan Brewer on Thursday declared a state of emergency, freeing up $100,000 in state money and allows her to activate the National Guard, if necessary.

Officials said the blaze was human-caused but would not say whether it was accidental or arson. It remains under investigation by the U.S. Forest Service.

Asked how it was determined the fire was human-caused, Prescott National Forest spokeswoman Noel Fletcher said, ""We've not had any thunderstorms come by or any lightening. And so what else would have been the cause?""

Sciacca said ""we are in pretty good shape"" despite losing two DC-10 tankers, which have been pulled to fight a fire in New Mexico.

""We still have four heavy helicopters that are very effective when we do direct tactics,"" he said. ""We are making progress.""

In Chino Valley, about 4 miles northeast of the fire and downwind from it, some residents said they were not worried about the flames. The area was not under evacuation.

""I am not really concerned at this time,"" said Jeff Kella, who has lived Chino Valley about 4 miles northeast and downwind of the fire for 21 years. ""That is, unless it hits the grassy plain that separates the area and the mountain. ... If it gets into the grass, it travels very, very fast. That stuff's dry as a bone.""

Judy Robertson, a 20-year Chino Valley resident, said she was not bothered much by the fire but was keeping the idea of evacuation in the back of her mind.

By afternoon, the winds were causing her to think about leaving.

""The strongest thing is the smell. That's the most alarming,"" she said. ""This is as close as we've seen since I've been here.""

She said if she has to evacuate, she will load up her motor home and head about 15 miles southeast toward Prescott Valley, Ariz.

The Doce Fire broke out on the 11th anniversary of the start of the Rodeo Fire in eastern Arizona. That blaze merged with the Chediski Fire and consumed 732 square miles. The Rodeo-Chediski Fire, the second-largest in state history, burned for nearly three weeks before firefighters were able to bring it under control.

On Wednesday, additional fire restrictions were put into effect because of increasing danger and the risk of human-caused wildfire.

The Coconino, Kaibab, Prescott and Tonto national forests are prohibiting the discharging of firearms, apart from lawful hunting. They also have banned smoking outside of an enclosed vehicle or building; operating internal-combustion engines such as power tools; and welding or using a torch with an open flame.

The restrictions also prohibit using charcoal fires, campfires or stove fires, even in campgrounds with approved sites.

What the anti-science CNN is withholding from its audience, though, is the good news that there actually is no Global Warming. Global temperatures have not increased for fifteen years. Moreover, we have just learned that the Antarctic sea ice is at its highest level in 35 years.

CNN is lying through the dark art of omission. Context is kryptonite to any left-wing media outlet trying to pose as objective.

Moreover, if CNN truly believed that burning energy dooms the planet and mankind, why doesn’t CNN go off the air? The energy this network burns to spew anti-science reports likely puts more carbon in the air in an hour than I will during my entire lifetime — and I regularly burn tires in front of my hippie neighbors.

But that is the whole thing with these anti-science Global Warming truthers, isn’t it — that they don’t behave like people who actually believe burning energy is dooming the planet. And that is because they know it is a lie. Global Warming is a left-wing hoax; it is not some coincidence that the only way to save the planet is to check off every box on The Socialist Wishlist.

When Carol Costello and Ashleigh Banfield rent a single room, ride a bike, and throw away the overused stair-stepper, that might get my attention.

A public comment period is underway through April 22, after which the department will prepare a final statement to help the administration decide whether the pipeline is in the “national interest.” If the conclusion is yes, a Canadian company, TransCanada, gets a permit to build a pipeline to transport toxic tar sands through our heartland, connecting to refineries in the Gulf of Mexico, for likely export to China.

Around the world, emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide continue to soar. Australia is now finishing “the angry summer” — 123 extreme weather records broken in 90 days — which government sources link to climate change. Last year, 2012, was also the hottest year on record in the contiguous United States.

Yet a bipartisan chorus says the pipeline is no big deal. Some suggest the administration is better off focusing on stronger EPA regulations, as if it were an either-or proposition. Others say we need the temporary jobs. Still others torture logic by claiming that not building the pipeline will be worse because that would force the tar sands to be shipped overseas, with the greater carbon footprint that entails — even though analysts say this is the fate of most Keystone XL oil anyway.

The perspective of pipeline apologists is contrary to the laws of physics and basic economics, neither of which gives a damn about politics. Here are a few points the State Department ought to reconsider:

Nothing to see here. The draft review suggests the climate impacts of the pipeline are limited because the project will not substantially “induce growth in the rate of extraction in the oil sands.” This narrow analysis misses the mark. Researchers now say that the Alberta tar sands contain 360 to 510 billion tons of carbon — more than double that of all oil burned in human history. While only a fraction is considered economically recoverable right now, we humans are genius at finding new and better ways to dig junk out of the ground. Digging begets more digging. Once the big spigot is open, TransCanada will have every incentive to milk the massive tar sands basin for all it is worth.

It’s out of our hands. The idea that the tar sands would get developed at the same rate without the pipeline is undercut by mainstream financial analysis and industry documents that show Keystone XL is the linchpin for tar sands expansion in the next decade. Tar sands may get to market without it, but at a slower rate and a much greater cost. For example, Canadian research and investment advisory firm Peters & Co. says moving tar sands by rail would spike costs twofold, from $7 to $11 a barrel to $15 to $20 a barrel.

Some tar sands will inevitably cross the border on trains and in smaller pipelines but not at the scale permitted by Keystone XL. Only with a substantial increase in pipelines to the coasts, and with access to markets overseas, can the tar sands industry meet its eye-popping production targets — a full tripling of output in coming decades — along with the crushing blow that would deliver to our climate.

Going backward is in the national interest. According to law, the administration’s final decision will be based on whether the pipeline is in the “national interest.” While the world will be stuck with the climate damages, the U.S. will be on the hook for spills, environmental degradation and much more. Not only is it a bad marriage but a long one: TransCanada’s estimated annual depreciation rate for “oil pipeline and pumping equipment” is 2% to 2.5%, which means a pipeline with a useful life of 40 to 50 years.

Just last week, a Canadian train slid off the tracks in Minnesota, spewing as much as 30,000 gallons of Canadian crude on U.S. soil. A few days later, a pipeline carrying crude from Canada leaked “a few thousand” barrels in Arkansas. Is this in the national interest?

Once we get a price on carbon that makes fossil fuels pay their true cost, the tar sands will start to shut down. But if the pipeline opens the big spigot in the meantime, it will be difficult to avoid great harm.

The science on climate change has been in for a quarter of a century. There are no more mixed messages, just catastrophe after catastrophe. The president stands at a fork in the road: Rejecting the pipeline will show the world we are serious and determined to be on the right side of history. Approving it will signal we are too entrenched with business-as-usual to do what’s right by the people, planet and future generations.

The allegations were first made by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative Washington, D.C., think tank. It claimed the EPA was not being fair as it weighed whether to charge fees to groups seeking information via Freedom of Information Act requests.

Its research showed liberal groups have their fees for documents waived about 90 percent of the time, while conservative groups are denied fee waivers about 90 percent of the time.

""This activity calls into question the objectivity of the FOIA employees at EPA and undermines public confidence in an agency that is charged with protecting our air and water,"" a group of nearly three dozen House Republicans wrote in a letter to EPA Acting Administrator Bob Perciasepe.

Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., chairman of the Republican Study Committee, said in a separate statement that the findings are ""not a coincidence"" and track with the kind of targeting conducted by the IRS against conservative groups.

""Politics should not play a role in approving or denying fee waivers, and the EPA clearly crossed the line by injecting bias and favoritism into their decision making process,"" he said.

In the letter, he and other lawmakers asked a string of questions on the EPA policy governing fee waivers, including who is in charge of that determination.

The letter follows efforts by the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to probe the allegations.

Perciasepe told the House Energy and Commerce Committee on May 16 that ""our policy is to treat everybody the same,"" and the agency is considering pursuing an investigation.

It was an absolutely false claim, but totally believable.

Early this year, a few news organizations reported that the brown marmorated stink bug was at the top of an Agriculture Department most-unwanted list, the nation’s No. 1 invasive species of interest, the most wanted fugitive among bugs.

As it turned out, the Agriculture Deparment had no such list. An apologetic spokesman said he misunderstood a scientist in the department and passed faulty information to reporters. But that doesn’t mean the agency isn’t out to kill this crop-munching pest from Asia that recently expanded to 40 states since it was first spotted in Pennsylvania 15 years ago.

To the contrary, entomologists are zeroing in on stink bugs, unlocking the mysteries of their behaviors, DNA and even scent, and preparing for an all-out war.

True to their nature, stink bugs — heavily concentrated in Maryland and West Virginia, as well as Pennsylvania — aren’t expected to go down easily, certainly not this summer. “The expectation is high infestation this year,” said Ames Herbert, an extension entomologist at Virginia Tech.

Caption Brown marmorated stink bugs, which took a $37 million bite out of last year’s mid-Atlantic apple crop, have awakened from hibernation. Detected in 33 states and the District of Columbia, brown marmorated stink bugs munch on hundreds of varieties of plants and trees. Matt Rourke/AP Wait 1 second to continue.

How do researchers know? “What we can use as a rough guide is the size of the population from year to year that overwintered,” said Tracy Leskey, a research entomologist for the Agriculture Department. “In 2012, the population was 60 percent higher than 2011. If they survived the winter, we will have many bugs starting in 2013.”

Unlike previous years, when scientists and farmers “kind of got caught with our pants down,” said Robert Shenot — who watched stink bugs damage more than half of his apple crop at Shenot Farm Market, a few miles north of Pittsburgh, in 2010 and 2011 — they will face an array of new weapons developed especially for them.

Last year, USDA scientists and researchers pinpointed a pheromone that male brown marmorated stink bugs emit while feeding; it attracts other males, females and even babies called nymphs to the meal.

They re-created the scent in a laboratory, built a trap and tested it along tree lines, on the edge of farms and in the middle of crop fields. Sure enough, the bugs crept to it and were exterminated.

The triangle-shaped device is a temple of doom, luring the creatures into grooves leading to the synthetic smell that calls them to dinner. Instead of food there is a pest strip, and a pesticide vapor puts them to sleep for good, said Christopher Bergh, a professor of entomology at Virginia Tech.

The traps aren’t killing enough stink bugs to make a sizable dent in the population, Bergh said, but they do give researchers and farmers an indication of how many are lurking and whether they should initiate search-and-destroy missions.

Farmers have to resist “the first knee-jerk reaction . . . to get out there and spray them with chemicals,” Shenot said. “Certain chemicals they tend to take a bath in and laugh at you. They feed a quarter-inch below the surface of the fruit, and you can’t get an insecticide in there. You can spray the stink bug there on your crop, and if another set of stink bugs fly in, they’re not going to be affected at all.”

After observing closely for two years starting in 2011, entomologists developed an improved kill strategy for soybeans, Herbert said. They noticed that stink bugs chewed at “the edge of soybean fields but not deep into the field,” he said.

“We’ve been able to exploit that,” Herbert said. They monitored 25 fields as farmers treated the edge with insecticides. On average, they sprayed 30 percent of the acreage and got 100 percent control of the pest.

“If you spray the edge of the field and it works, they’re saving a lot of money and time,” Herbert said.

It is an epic tug of war with no certain outcome. The brown marmorated stink bug was first spotted in 1998 near Allentown, Pa., after some crept out of a cargo ship, and the population exploded 12 years later, taking a $37 million bite out of the Mid-Atlantic apple crop and a $15 million chunk of Pennsylvania’s peach crop.

By last year, they were either detected or established in 33 states and the District, and then in another seven states as of May. “It’s possible that this bug gets established in every state,” Herbert said. “I don’t see any reason why they wouldn’t.”

Worried scientists at the USDA research lab in Delaware, and others in Oregon and Florida, have been eyeing yet another weapon for years: an Asian parasite wasp about the size of a pinpoint that preys on stink bugs’ eggs.

The federal scientists have carefully tested and retested the creature, hesitating for fear that it might become invasive itself, competing with native wasps for food and territory.

As they waited last year, nature produced a breakthrough. Native wasps that had showed no interest in brown marmorated stink bugs started to develop a taste for their eggs, just as they preyed on the eggs of native stink bugs.

In addition, native birds started snatching and eating the Asian bugs, a breakthrough in the fight against a foreign pest with no natural predator.

“There’s more evidence now that natural enemies are starting to adapt to stink bugs,” Herbert said. “This is one of hundreds of invasive pests that have invaded the U.S. in the last 100 years, and most of them we’ve learned how to deal with them.”

Trouble is, Herbert said, you should never be overconfident with bugs. “Insects will make a liar out of you every time,” he said."

WASHINGTON -– State Department documents released to an environmental group are raising new questions about the hiring of a government contractor to evaluate environmental impacts of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline.

Environmental Resources Management has conflicts of interest that should have prevented it from winning the contract for the analysis of the controversial pipeline, which would carry oil from Canada's oil sands to the U.S. Gulf Coast, the Sierra Club has said. The group filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the State Department seeking documents that would show how Environmental Resources Management was chosen. Sierra Club provided some of the documents it received to The Huffington Post.

But the documents do not indicate that the State Department conducted its own investigation into the company's ties to pipeline operator TransCanada before approving it to produce the analysis. Environmental Resources Management's draft supplemental environmental analysis, released in March, recommended changes to the pipeline route, but declared the project would have ""no significant impacts to most resources."" The Obama administration's decision on the pipeline is expected sometime early next year.

Included in the documents Sierra Club obtained is a memo from a State Department staffer to Kerri-Ann Jones, assistant secretary of state for oceans and international environmental and scientific affairs, that recommends Environmental Resources Management for the pipeline contract.

""ERM is the only candidate that has not worked for TransCanada or its subsidiaries of affiliates, nor has ERM been a third-party contractor on any reviews of TransCanada projects,"" the memo says. The documents include signed forms from ERM and TransCanada affirming that they had not previously worked together, as well as talking points for government staff to use answering press questions about potential conflicts of interest.

""The most alarming thing is the documents that aren't there,"" said Doug Hayes, a staff attorney at Sierra Club. ""So far they've sent us a bunch of documents, and none of them demonstrate that State Department did any independent inquiry into ERM's conflict of interest.""

If State Department officials had looked, they may have found reasons to reject ERM, Hayes said. After ERM's analysis was released, Mother Jones revealed that a key ERM staffer on the project had previously done work for TransCanada, and that two other contractors had done work for ANR Pipeline, a TransCanada subsidiary. Still other ERM employees had worked for companies that would benefit from the pipeline.

The biographies of those ERM staffers had been removed from materials the State Department released with the draft environmental impact statement. Mother Jones reported on the potential conflicts earlier this year after obtaining the version of the biographies before they were redacted by the State Department. Environmental groups seized on those connections, arguing that they should have prevented ERM from getting the contract. They also argued that ERM had not been transparent about this previous work for TransCanada in its disclosure form.

The State Department's Office of Inspector General is now looking into those allegations. The inspector general's report, delayed by the government shutdown, will not be ready until late-February 2014, spokesman Douglas Welty told The Huffington Post.

The department's first environmental analysis for the pipeline was conducted by Cardo Entrix, a company whose previous work for TransCanada prompted environmental groups to complain of conflicts of interest. That led to an investigation by the State Department's inspector general, which found no evidence that TransCanada had ""improperly influenced"" State's selection of the contractor and no actual conflict of interest in hiring Cardno Entrix. But the report dinged the department for failing to independently evaluate the contractor's claim that it had no conflicts and for ""accepting them at face value.""

Sierra Club's FOIA request sought records related to State's approval of ERM for the second study to see what, if anything, the department did differently in evaluating potential conflicts of interest for the new environmental study. ""It looks like State Department did exactly what they did last time, which is take ERM and TransCanada's statements at face value and not do any independent evaluation,"" Hayes said.

In response to questions about the documents, a State Department official said the department doesn't believe there was a conflict of interest in selecting ERM.

""No Environmental Resources Management (ERM) employees working on the review have worked for TransCanada,"" said the official. ""Our rigorous conflict of interest procedures are designed to ensure that no contractors or subcontractors have financial or other interests in the outcome of a project.""

The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Interior both have submitted comments critical of ERM's study. The EPA said the study included ""insufficient information"" about several environmental concerns.

Another document released in response to the FOIA request is a State Department press guidance from of Aug. 3, 2012. It includes this paragraph as a suggested response to reporters' questions about whether ERM had worked with TransCanada before:

No, ERM has neither worked directly for TransCanada before, nor has it worked as a third-party contractor for a federal agency reviewing a TransCanada project. This is also true for subsidiaries of TransCanada.

The FOIA includes another version of the press guidance dated three days later. That document removes the line that says this ""is also true for subsidiaries of TransCanada.""

Ross Hammond, a senior campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said the removal of that line raises more questions about any potential relationships between ERM and TransCanada, and what the State Department knew about them. Hammond said the information that has come out about ties between the contractors and TransCanada should also raises questions about the Keystone report that ERM wrote.

""There's no reason that anyone should have any confidence -- particularly the president, who will be making the decision on this pipeline -- that what they put in this report is true,"" said Hammond."

Pollak'],"Coal Stocks Plummet, Environmentalist Hopes Rise Ahead of Obama's Climate Speech","President Barack Obama will deliver a speech at Georgetown University Tuesday afternoon in which he will call for new regulations aimed at restricting carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal-fired power plants, not just new ones. Previously, Obama had aimed regulations at new coal plants. Shares of U.S. coal stocks plummeted ahead of the speech, though the Washington Post suggested global market turmoil played a role.

The Obama administration has been uniquely hostile to coal and other fossil fuels, despite the fact that the rapid expansion of natural gas development through “fracking” and oil production from shale deposits has driven much of the growth that the U.S. economy has mustered during his presidency. Permits for oil and gas exploration and development on federal land have slowed; offshore oil and gas activity has been blocked, especially after the Deepwater Horizon spill of 2010, even in defiance of the courts; and the Environmental Protection Agency has pushed new emissions rules despite Congress’s refusal to pass a cap-and-trade bill.

Obama has long singled out coal in particular. In January 2008, as he sought to outflank rival presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on the left, then-Sen. Obama promised to “bankrupt” new coal plants. His administration issued heavy-handed new regulations on coal, forcing many plants out of production. And his left-wing supporters in Hollywood have cheered him on, encouraging him to bypass Congress, far from the job losses that will occur. Politicians of both parties in coal-producing state have protested, to little avail.

Earlier this week, seven governors wrote to the president to urge him to stop new EPA regulations on the new source performance standard (NSPS) for new coal power plants, arguing that they would cause plants to be shuttered, and pointing out the industry’s own progress on reducing emissions. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett (R) was one of the seven, and wrote to the president: “It is imperative that abundant natural resources such as coal continue to be available to meet our base load electricity needs. I am convinced that we can achieve this goal, while lowering emissions. Significant technological advancements in generating plant efficiency and emission capture and reduction are within reach, but need regulatory flexibility that does not discriminate against our own home-grown energy resources if they are to be achieved.”

Nevertheless, Obama is expected to announce an expansion of regulations. The New York Times reported last week that the president would seek to apply regulations to existing coal plants as well as new ones.

In his speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Germany last week, President Obama warned of the need to take action against “coastlines that vanish, oceans that rise”–an echo of his much-lampooned 2008 speech in Minneapolis upon winning the Democratic nomination, in which he said that he was “absolutely certain” that future generations would remember his nomination and anticipated victory as the moment that “when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.”

For Obama and his most radical supporters, that moment was much delayed–perhaps, until today."

In a 12-page letter sent as part of the public comment on the draft assessment, the Interior Department repeatedly labels as inaccurate its sister agency’s conclusions that Keystone XL would have short-lived effects on wildlife and only during the project’s construction.

“Given that the project includes not only constructing a pipeline but also related infrastructure, access roads, and power lines and substations, impacts to wildlife are not just related to project construction. Impacts to wildlife from this infrastructure will occur throughout the life of the project (i.e. operation and maintenance phases),” the letter says.

Extending 1,700 miles from Canada’s oil sands to refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast, Keystone XL needs a presidential permit from the State Department because it crosses a U.S. border. The draft assessment focuses on the 875-mile section from the border in Montana through South Dakota to a pipeline hub in Nebraska.

The letter from the Interior Department grimly catalogs many ways Keystone XL could harm wildlife: “species displacement, increased predation rates and predator travel lanes, increased nest parasitism, vehicle collisions with wildlife … invasive plant species, increased wildfire risk, lower wildlife density, increase in collisions with power lines and electrocutions on power poles … and increase in poaching.”

The Interior Department is the second major federal agency to criticize the State Department’s draft environmental impact statement, a detailed look at the potential effects of the proposed pipeline on air, water, endangered species, communities and the economy. In April, the Environmental Protection Agency slammed the assessment, saying it failed to account for what could be considerable greenhouse gas emissions from the project and risks to aquifers along its route.

The Interior Department declined to comment on the letter, referring inquiries to the State Department.

The letter was sent April 29. But the State Department posted it to a website only last week, along with 100,000 other comments received at the same time.

“We look forward to continuing to work with the Department of Interior on the issues described in its letter,” a State Department official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss differences within the administration. “The Department of State continues to review the presidential permit application for the proposed Keystone XL pipeline in a rigorous, transparent and efficient manner.”

The State Department could issue its final environmental impact statement at any time. The Obama administration must then determine whether the pipeline serves the national interest, based not just on the State Department’s analysis, but those of other federal agencies too, such as the EPA and the Interior Department.

In June, President Obama noted the pipeline’s potential effect on climate change, saying, “Our national interest will be served only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution.”

TransCanada, the company that would own Keystone XL, said it was confident the State Department would still conclude the pipeline’s effect on the environment would be minimal.

Advertisement

“As our application shows, there are detailed steps we have taken to mitigate impacts on the environment, sensitive areas, wildlife and communities,” said TransCanada spokesman Shawn Howard. “There are already more than 12,000 pages of technical review that have been published on Keystone XL, and they have stated that there will be a minimal impact on environmental resources along the entire route.”

Most critics of Keystone XL have focused on the potential damage from an oil spill. The Interior Department letter warns of spills, but also highlights day-to-day negative environmental effects.

The letter cautions that birds, such as the least tern and the piping plover, could be threatened in a protected area of the Missouri River in Nebraska, about 40 miles from where Keystone XL would cross the Niobrara River. Changes in water level could affect the birds’ nesting activities, and they could be killed by flying into power lines and other new infrastructure.

The State Department draft analysis also says a fish called the pallid sturgeon would not be affected by “temporary water withdrawals” from rivers. But the Interior Department letter calls the statement unsupported.

The Interior Department also raised concern about how the pipeline might damage wetlands and archaeological sites. And it warned that Keystone XL could create light and noise pollution that could affect people and wildlife alike.

The two children testifying against it have either been crudely insulted or received death threats.

In February, speaking to the Minnesota House Committee on Civil Law, 11-year-old Grace Evans offered this statement:

My name is Grace Evans, and I would like to thank you for letting me speak today. Even though I’m only 11 years old, I know that everyone deserves to have a mom and a dad. If you change the laws that two moms or two dads can get married, it would take away something very important for children like me across the state. My mom is very important to me, because she teaches me things about being a girl. She is kind, thoughtful, gentle and beautiful. She cares for me and others and listens vey well to the things I want to talk to her about. I am learning from her to be a good woman, wife and mother someday. Even though I learned some of these things from my dad, my mom teaches them in a very special way. Without my mom, it would be very hard for me to learn them. She is my role model in how to be a girl and I love her very much. My dad is also very important to me because he protects me and helps me get the confidence to be a girl who is growing up to be a woman. He takes care of problems in a way that my mom cannot. Just like the way my mom could not be the woman she is without my dad, I wouldn’t be the woman I want to be without my dad. Because he is strong, wise and different from my mom, I learn things from him that I would not be able to learn in the same way from my mom. Since every child needs a mom and dad to be born, I don’t think we can change that children need a mom and a dad. I believe God made it that way. I know some disagree, but I want to ask you this question: which parent do I not need, my mom or my dad? I’ll ask again, which parent do I not need, my mom or my dad? I hope that you can see that every child needs a mom and a dad. Please don’t change your law to say otherwise. Thank you for letting me speak today.

Her father, Jeff Evans, revealed the treatment Grace had received from political opponents:

We haven’t had any physical threats, but we’ve had some rather colorful comments about my 11-year-old. I’ve been monitoring it to keep my family safe and have a heads up on it. It’s really shameful the things that people will say, hiding behind an Internet alias. We see it as more representative of where political discourse is in our country, where you can’t take a position without receiving a great deal of flak, which is unfortunate.

YouTube comments included one calling Grace “an 11-year-old bigot.” Another said, “when did 11 year old children become so repugnantly smug? this is gross and offensive, and not just to gay people. single mothers, widowers, divorced parents… i mean,? just shut the fuck up until you until you’ve seen a little more of the world, puppet child.” On the Facebook page for A Minnesota news website, the heading read “Stupid Indoctrinated Child.”

Evans said, “Supporters of gay marriage are deceitfully claiming that the legalization of gay marriage won’t affect our religious freedoms or freedom of speech. I do not believe them. These attacks on Grace are an example of how we have already lost many of these freedoms. In fact, it’s so bad, they aren’t afraid to viciously attack an 11-year-old girl. Imagine what it will be like if gay marriage becomes legal in Minnesota.”

In January, Sarah Crank, 14, received death threats after testifying before the Maryland state senate. She testified:

Hi, I’m Sarah Crank. Today’s my 14th birthday, and it would be the best birthday present ever if you would vote “no” on gay marriage. I really feel bad for the kids who have two parents of the same gender. Even though some kids think it’s fine, they have no idea what kind of wonderful experiences they miss out on. I don’t want more kids to get confused about what’s right and okay. I really don’t want to grow up in a world where marriage isn’t such a special thing anymore.

It’s rather scary to think that when I grow up the legislature or the court can change the definition of any word they want. If they could change the definition of marriage then they could change the definition of any word. People have the choice to be gay, but I don’t want to be affected by their choice. People say that they were born that way, but I’ve met really nice adults who did change. So please vote “no” on gay marriage. Thank you.

TFP Student Action, a Roman Catholic organization, recorded some of the threats on the YouTube video of Sarah’s speech went viral on homosexual websites. Some of them read:

If I ever see this girl, I will kill her. That’s a promise.

Her parents should be exterminated.

Kill this child and his [sic] parent, for my 11 birthday would be a wonderful gift, thanks.”

As Good As You blogger Jeremy Hooper first reported, the boy -- who is not identified -- stood in front of the Winston-Salem church on Easter Sunday with a placard that read, ""Jesus Must Be Your Lord Or He Will Not Be Your Savior.""

""The Bible talks about the homosexuals -- they're worthy of death,"" the boy proclaims, as seen in video footage of the protest which was also posted on Hooper's site. ""They're worthy of death, and you people approve of them! That's why you're going to Hell without Jesus Christ. You can turn from your sin!""

He adds, ""It's time to stop sinning and follow the lord Jesus Christ!""

Last month, footage of an 11-year-old girl testifying against same-sex marriage before the Minnesota House Committee on Civil Law made the blogosphere rounds. (The bill was later passed by the committee, and now awaits a vote in the Senate and House scheduled for later this session.)

“If you change the law to say two moms and two dads can get married, it would take away something very important for children like me across the state,"" the girl read in a prepared statement.

Last month, Green Street United Methodist Church officials said in a statement that ministers at the church would be asked to refrain from performing weddings for any couple inside the sanctuary.

“We are asking our ministers not to perform sacraments of marriage, as far as the wedding vows, wedding rings, and the announcement of the marriage in the sanctuary until the United Methodist Church says it is equitable or same sex couples can get married in the church,” Tim Sturgis, a congregation member, told 88.5 WFDD.

USA TODAY

Alaska senator says she supports right of people %22to marry the person they love and choose%22

Murkowski joins GOP Sens. Rob Portman and Mark Kirk to back gay marriage

Supreme Court is considering two cases dealing with controversial issue

WASHINGTON -- Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska has endorsed same-sex marriage, becoming the third Republican senator to do so.

In a statement posted Wednesday on her website, Murkowski said supporting same-sex marriage is consistent with her values as a ""lifelong Republican"" who believes in ""promoting freedom and limiting the reach of government.""

""I support the right of all Americans to marry the person they love and choose because I believe doing so promotes both values: it keeps politicians out of the most private and personal aspects of people's lives -- while also encouraging more families to form and more adults to make a lifetime commitment to one another,"" she said.

Murkowski joins Republican Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Mark Kirk of Illinois to voice support for the right of same-sex couples to marry. The highly charged issue is taking on new importance as the Supreme Court considers two cases dealing with gay marriage.

The justices, who are trying to complete work this month before their summer break, could rule as early as Thursday on California's gay marriage ban and the federal Defense of Marriage Act.

The Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights advocacy group, praised Murkowski, who had said earlier this year that her views on gay marriage were ""evolving.""

""Senator Murkowski's courageous and principled announcement today sends a clear message that marriage equality must come to all 50 state in this country,"" said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign. ""As the Supreme Court prepares to rule in two landmark marriage cases this month, a growing bipartisan coalition is standing up for the right of all couples to marry -- and there is no turning back that tide.""

Several senators, who were previously opposed or on the fence, issued statements supporting gay marriage in March as the court heard arguments in the two marriage lawsuits.

In her statement, Murkowski said she was influenced in part by an Alaskan family headed by two lesbians who have adopted four siblings to give them a home together. ""This first-class Alaskan family still lives a second-class existence,"" she wrote.

Murkowski, who is Catholic, said she believes religious institutions should have the right to define marriage on their own terms. But she is clear about the government's role.

""Churches must be allowed to define marriage and conduct ceremonies according to their rules,"" she said, ""but the government should not tell people who they have a right to marry through a civil ceremony.""

The real issue at hand is not freedom of speech or same-sex marriage but Chick-fil-A's secretive funding of documented anti-gay hate groups. The national organization Campus Pride made this clear last week in releasing ""5 Simple Facts About Chick-fil-A."" Campus Pride specifically called upon our nation's student leaders to share the truth about Chick-fil-A and its funding of radical-right-wing organizations and documented hate groups.

Through its family-controlled nonprofit arm, Chick-fil-A profits have funded such groups as Eagle Forum, Exodus International, Family Research Council, and Focus on the Family. These groups proudly and aggressively work against the rights of LGBT people, advocating their criminalization, psychological abuse, and death. Chick-fil-A has not disputed any of these facts. The ""5 Simple Facts About Chick-fil-A"" are well documented, showing the funneling of Chick-fil-A profits to anti-gay causes and even a hate group, as determined by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

While Chick-fil-A's leadership has every right to its views, beliefs, and voice, students and administrators alike need to know that revenues going to Chick-fil-A drive funding for groups that are almost certainly in conflict with campus nondiscrimination policies. There is no justification for Chick-fil-A to be on a college campus where there is a responsibility by administrators for a safe learning environment for all students. The actions by Chick-fil-A in taking profits to fund hate groups that harm a population on campus impedes safety and creating a learning environment for academic success.

Thanks to the president of Chick-fil-A, Dan Cathy, the cow façade has been lifted to show what is really behind the billboards and spicy chicken sandwiches. Good people, Christian or not, don't use their corporate profits to fund hate groups or causes that work to defame, criminalize, and execute people.

Colleges and universities have a real problem on their hands in the next few weeks as students come back to campus. You can't just tell students who disagree to not eat the chicken sandwich; that message is irresponsible and harmful to LGBT students. Colleges have to take responsibility for the facts and realize that student-meal-plan money is going to fund a documented hate group that works to aggressively harm students on their campus. This will certainly affect the safety and campus climate of all students.

Read the ""5 Simple Facts About Chick-fil-A."" Campus Pride calls on student leaders and campus newspapers to share that:

Chick-fil-A profits fund documented hate groups that aggressively work against LGBT people, advocating for their criminalization, psychological abuse, or death.

Chick-fil-A profits support the radical-right-wing group Eagle Forum, which supports LGBT people being considered criminals.

Chick-fil-A profits support Exodus International, which claims to ""cure homosexuality"" through psychological coercion of LGBT people. It says LGBT people are ""perverse.""

Chick-fil-A profits support Focus on the Family (FOF) and its off-shoot group, the Family Research Council (FRC), which has been designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. FOF aggressively defames LGBT people as a threat to children, and FRC spent $25,000 to stop the U.S. Congress from condemning Uganda's anti-homosexuality bill, which calls for the execution of gay people in some cases.

Chick-fil-A profits come from you. When you choose Chick-fil-A, you help fund hate groups.

It might have been characteristically blunt, but Robertson neither singled out homosexuals nor questioned the humanity of gay people. Robertson focused on sexual behavior, including the sexual behavior of heterosexuals. The major media are merely using Robertson’s quotes to advance their own anti-Christian bigotry by smearing Christian beliefs as de facto bigotry and launching a McCarthyist campaign to silence Christians.

When you have major media outlets declaratively describing Robertson’s expression of his Christian beliefs as “anti-gay,” what you are really seeing is major media outlets outing themselves as anti-Christian.

Politico. CNN. The Hollywood Reporter. Entertainment Weekly. Yahoo. Variety. And so on…

Robertson listed more than a half-dozen sins other than homosexual behavior, including a number of heterosexual behaviors, and “the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers”.

It is certainly possible to try to disguise anti-gay bigotry as Christianity. Singling out gay people and not distinguishing between homosexuals as people and homosexual behavior are two of the most glaring examples.

But Robertson did neither. What he did do was to speak a Christian truth about various sins, and the media know this.

Anti-sin is not anti-gay.

But because the media and left are desperate to toxify Christianity as bigotry and bully Christians into silence, Robertson’s remarks are seen as the perfect opportunity to do both.

Of course it is an added benefit to the media to try to tarnish a culturally conservative mega-hit, and maybe drive it off the air.

What we have here is nothing more than the media practicing McCarthyism and disguising it as tolerance.

Notice how the media are not reporting on the most important thing Robertson said:

You put in your article that the Robertson family really believes strongly that if the human race loved each other and they loved God, we would just be better off. We ought to just be repentant, turn to God, and let’s get on with it, and everything will turn around.

Governor Sarah Palin put this exactly right when she said this is an attack on “all of us.”

This post has been updated to add a correct Robertson quote about loving the human race.

But Oliveira now faces deportation because current immigration laws do not allow spouses in same-sex marriages to obtain visas. (Gretchen Ertl/For The Washington Post)

In his final legislative act as a senator, Secretary of State John F. Kerry sought to resolve an international dilemma. He filed Senate Bill 48, seeking “permanent resident status for Genesio Januario Oliveira,” a gay Brazilian national facing deportation because he does not qualify for a spousal visa.

Now, President Obama is aiming to grant same-sex couples such as Oliveira and his American husband, Tim Coco, equal immigration rights as their heterosexual counterparts. The proposal could allow up to 40,000 foreign nationals in same-sex relationships to apply for legal residency and, potentially, U.S. citizenship.

But the measure has inspired fierce pushback from congressional Republicans and some religious groups, who say it could sink hopes for a comprehensive agreement aimed at providing a path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants.

The standoff may force Obama to choose between two key interest groups — Hispanics and gays — that helped power his reelection in the fall. The president must weigh how forcefully to push the bill, known as the Uniting American Families Act, while not endangering a long-sought deal to resolve the status of undocumented immigrants, most of whom are Latino.

The same-sex measure was not included in the immigration proposals issued last week by a bipartisan Senate working group, whose overall framework Obama largely embraced. Several key Christian groups that have supported the White House’s immigration push have objected to the measure on the grounds that it would erode traditional marriage.

The issue has prompted an intense lobbying effort on both sides, including a letter to the White House from a coalition of influential church organizations and a series of urgent conference calls between advocates, administration officials and lawmakers.

For Obama, the political sensitivity was evident in the public rollout of his immigration plans last Tuesday. Although the same-sex provision was included in documents distributed by the White House, the president did not mention it in his immigration speech in Las Vegas.

“The president in his plan said that you should treat same-sex families the same way we treat heterosexual families,” White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer said Friday on “Political Capital With Al Hunt.” “It’s wrong to discriminate. It’s a natural extension of the president’s view about same-sex marriage, the view about providing equal rights, no matter who you love.”

But congressional Republicans immediately condemned the idea and warned that the measure imperils broader immigration reform. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), one of the senators on the eight-member bipartisan working group on immigration, said at a Politico breakfast last week that injecting social issues into the debate over immigration legislation “is the best way to derail it.”

“Which is more important: LGBT or border security?” McCain said, using an abbreviation for people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. “I’ll tell you what my priorities are.”

Behind the scenes, the lobbying efforts began before the president’s speech. A coalition of religious groups — including Roman Catholics, evangelicals and Southern Baptists — delivered a letter to the White House last week opposing the same-sex measure.

“It’s an overreach,” said Kevin Appleby, director of migration policy and public affairs at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which signed the letter. “Immigration is hard enough as it is and adding another controversial issue to the mix makes it even harder. I’m surprised the administration would risk sacrificing 11 million people over this issue. It’s very combustible.”

‘We’re always worried’

On a White House conference call with interest groups after Obama’s appearance in Las Vegas, the first question was from an evangelical activist who objected to the provision. Religious groups pushed back again Wednesday on another White House call, according to a person who participated in the conversation.

On the other side, several Senate Democrats, including Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), Richard J. Durbin (Ill.) and Robert Menendez (N.J.), had a conference call with gay organizations blaming Republicans for not including the same-sex provision in the bipartisan immigration proposal.

The advocates were told that Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-

Vt.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, would offer an amendment to include the provision in any comprehensive legislation that is formally introduced, according to a person involved in the call.

Meanwhile, tens of thousands of same-sex couples wait in limbo. Although the Obama administration has been using its prosecutorial discretion to avoid deporting partners who are illegally in the country, many couples say uncertainty makes it impossible to plan for the long term.

“It’s on our mind every day,” said Coco, who has been married to Oliveira since 2005 and lives in Haverhill, Mass. “We’re always worried about our future.”

Obama — who endorsed same-sex marriage in the spring — received broad support and significant campaign funds from the LGBT community. On the campaign trail, Obama often touted as a major achievement his administration’s ending of the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy toward gays.

“He’s proven that especially on lesbian [and] gay issues, when he stands up and works for change, that the American public and Congress comes along with him,” said Steve Ralls, a spokesman for Immigration Equality, a group pushing for same-sex immigration protections. “That will be the case here, too.”

Felipe Sousa-Rodriguez, national field director of GetEqual, a gay civil rights organization, said Obama gave a “really strong vision” for gay rights in his inauguration speech last month.

“I hope that’s more than words and will actually bring concrete actions,” Sousa-Rodriguez said. If Obama does not fight hard for the same-sex provision, he added, “I’ll be highly disappointed.”

Not all gay rights groups are united. Some activists said they would not stand in the way of an immigration deal without the same-sex couples provision if the alternative was no reform deal at all. These activists said an overall policy encouraging citizenship could help up to 700,000 illegal immigrants who are estimated to be gay.

Questions of timing

In the meantime, the Supreme Court is reviewing the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act, a federal law that mandates marriage benefits only for heterosexual couples. Some gay rights advocates said that if the court strikes down the law, perhaps as early as June, the question of a same-sex provision in immigration law could be rendered irrelevant.

That’s little solace for Coco and Oliveira, who spent three years of their marriage apart, after an immigration judge ordered Oli­veira to return to Brazil in 2007. Only after Kerry, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano made personal appeals for the couple in 2010 did immigration officials grant Oliveira a one-year visa on humanitarian grounds.

With that ruling expired, Kerry stepped in again Jan. 22 with his final Senate bill on behalf of Oliveira, who will be allowed to stay in the country as the legislation is deliberated. Coco, an ad agency owner, doesn’t expect it to be approved.

“It took a while for President Obama to evolve on gay marriage, but the nation has evolved much further if you look at the public polls,” Coco said. “I believe the president has some obligation to push the envelope. The time has come.”"

Supreme Court hears arguments in late March in two gay marriage cases

Veterans of George W. Bush White House%2C ex-governors%2C former lawmakers in group

These Republicans follow lead of Ted Olson%2C Bush%27s solicitor general

WASHINGTON — Top Republicans, including veterans of the George W. Bush administration, former members of Congress and ex-governors, are calling on the Supreme Court to support same-sex marriage.

More than 80 prominent leaders will file a friend of the court brief this week in advance of the justices hearing oral arguments in two gay marriage cases. These Republicans are essentially saying gay couples have a constitutional right to marry and want the court to strike down California's Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage.

STORY: Supreme Court to take up gay marriage cases

The signers currently include former governors Jon Huntsman of Utah, Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and William Weld of Massachusetts; former White House chief of staff Ken Mehlman and former national security adviser Stephen Hadley; and retired members of Congress, such as Mary Bono Mack of California and Deborah Pryce of Ohio.

Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman is also on record as backing the legal brief, which is a change of her previous position. When she ran unsuccessfully for California governor in 2010, Whitman supported Proposition 8. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., is the only active member of the House currently listed as supporting the brief.

The friend of the court brief is being organized by the American Foundation for Equal Rights, the advocacy group that is challenging the California ballot measure, which has already been struck down by two lower courts.

The group helped put together the legal team that is challenging Proposition 8, which was headed by former Bush solicitor general Ted Olson and David Boies, best known as the lawyer who handled the 2000 Florida recount challenge for Al Gore.

""The conservative movement toward the freedom to marry is what we like to call the 'Ted Olson effect,'"" said Adam Umhoefer, executive director of the organization. ""We value the support of our conservative colleagues and welcome their voices to the growing majority of Americans who stand for marriage equality.""

The Supreme Court will hear arguments March 26 and March 27 in a pair of same-sex marriage cases. Many briefs have been filed challenging Prop 8, in part because the high court's ruling could have far-reaching impact beyond California on the right of gay men and lesbians to marry.

The other case before the Supreme Court deals with the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman. The case applies to the benefits available to gay couples that are already married."

Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., in December.

Story highlights The Justice Department files first in a series of legal briefs involving two big cases Supreme Court will hear arguments next month on Defense of Marriage Act Lawyers for House GOP say they should be able to defend the marriage law in court U.S. still deciding whether to intervene in second case involving California law

In a preview of a major constitutional showdown at the Supreme Court over same-sex marriage, the Obama administration said on Friday that a federal law denying financial benefits to legally wed gay and lesbian couples is unconstitutional.

The Justice Department filed the first of a series of briefs in a pair of cases dealing with the multilayered issue, outlining the executive branch’s positions.

The high court will hear oral arguments next month on the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a 1996 congressional law that says for federal purposes, marriage is defined as only between one man and one woman.

That means federal tax, Social Security, pension, and bankruptcy benefits, and family medical leave protections – do not apply to gay and lesbian couples.

This case deals with Edith “Edie” Windsor, forced to assume an estate tax bill much larger than other married couples would have to pay. Because her decades-long partner was a woman, the federal government did not recognize the same-sex marriage in legal terms, even though their home state of New York did.

But now, led by President Barack Obama’s recent political about-face, the administration opposes the law.

“Moral opposition to homosexuality, though it may reflect deeply held personal views, is not a legitimate policy objective that can justify unequal treatment of gay and lesbian people” contained in the DOMA law, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli said in the Justice Department’s legal brief.

The separate case from California deals with Proposition 8, a 2008 voter-approved referendum banning same-sex marriage. This after the California high court had earlier concluded same-sex couples could legally wed. That case too will be heard in late March.

Though not a party in the California case, government sources say the Justice Department was prepared next week to file an “amicus” or supporting brief asserting a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, and that Proposition 8 should be struck down as a violation of constitutionally guaranteed “equal protection” of the laws.

Those sources say Obama was expected to make the final call on whether to intervene in the state dispute.

“I have to make sure that I’m not interjecting myself too much in this process, particularly when we’re not a party to the case,” Obama said Wednesday in an interview with CNN affiliate KGO-TV in San Francisco.

Of more immediate concern was the DOMA fight, where the administration is squarely involved. But a tricky gateway or “jurisdictional” question threatens to stall any final consideration of the law’s constitutionality. That was the focus of much of the Friday legal papers.

The DOMA law will be defended by House Republicans, after Obama concluded the law was unconstitutional.

Traditionally, that role would fall to the solicitor general’s office. But Obama, in an election-year stunner, said last May that he supported same-sex marriage.

The president had already ordered Attorney General Eric Holder not to defend DOMA in court. That raised the question of whether any party could rightfully step in and defend the law.

Besides the constitutional issue, the justices had specifically ordered both sides to argue a supplemental question: whether congressional Republicans – operating officially as the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the U.S. House of Representatives – have “standing” or legal authority to make the case.

Lawyers representing the House GOP said Friday that they should be able to take the lead and defend the law, since both Windsor and the Obama administration are taking the same legal position.

“Without the House’s participation,” said attorney Paul Clement, representing House leaders, “it is hard to see how there is any case or controversy here at all. Both Ms. Windsor and the executive agree that DOMA is unconstitutional and that Ms. Windsor was entitled to a [tax] refund. And the lower courts granted them all the relief they requested. Only the House’s intervention provides the adverseness that Article III [federal court jurisdiction] demands.”

But the Justice Department said it alone should present the government’s case.

“House Republicans lack “any basis for supplanting the executive branch’s exclusive role in representing the United States’ interests in this litigation, and has no interests of its own that would satisfy” federal court scrutiny, said administration lawyers.

Windsor’s legal team also said the House leaders could defend DOMA, at least partially, suggesting the woman wants ultimate resolution on the constitutional questions as soon as possible.

“I was devastated by the loss of the great love of my life, and I was also very sick, then had to deal with pulling together enough money to pay for the taxes,” the 83-year-old Windsor told CNN recently. “And it was deeply upsetting.”

The story of Edith and Thea

That fundamental unfairness, as Windsor and her supporters see it, is at the center of DOMA legal fight.

In November, three states – Maryland, Washington, and Maine – approved same-sex marriage, adding to the six states and the District of Columbia that already have done so. Minnesota voters also rejected an effort to ban such unions through a constitutional amendment.

As more states legalize same-sex marriage, one of the key questions the justices may be forced to address is whether a national consensus now exists supporting the idea of expanding an “equal protection” right of marriage to homosexuals.

A bill known as the Respect for Marriage Act is working its way through Congress and would repeal DOMA.

That law does not prohibit states from allowing same-sex marriages, but it also does not force states to recognize them from other states. Most of the current plaintiffs are federal workers, who are not allowed to add their spouses to health care plans, and other benefits.

Many other states, including New Jersey, Illinois, Delaware, Rhode Island and Hawaii, have legalized domestic partnerships and civil unions for such couples – a step designed in most cases to provide the same rights of marriage under state law.

But other states have passed laws or state constitutional amendments banning such marriages. California’s Proposition 8 is the only such referendum that revoked the right after lawmakers and the state courts previously allowed it. That makes it a somewhat unique legal case for review by the justices.

The DOMA cases are U.S. v. Windsor (12-307) and Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the U.S. House of Representatives v. Windsor (12-785)."

Not so for the sovereign Navajo Nation, whose borders spill over into the northeast part of the state and where tribal law is clear: Such unions are banned.

Some Navajo hope to change that, buoyed by the cultural climate shift underscored when the U.S. Supreme Court in June struck down part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Gay marriage is permitted in the District of Columbia and 18 states, the most recent being Utah, although officials there plan to appeal a federal court decision that overturned the state’s ban on same-sex marriage.

For Navajo activists, it won’t be easy.

The Diné Marriage Act, passed in 2005 by the Navajo Nation Council, defines marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman and declares polygamy, unions between family members and same-sex marriages “void and prohibited.”

A grass-roots attempt to block it from becoming law failed when the legislature overrode a veto from the Navajo Nation’s then-president, Joe Shirley Jr.

“The Diné Marriage Act legislation is unnecessary and addresses issues already governed by existing law and by cultural values and our clan system,” Shirley said in a statement posted on the website for the advocacy group Coalition for Navajo Equality, which seeks to repeal the law.

Recently, Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly, who took office in 2011, also backed the effort to allow same-sex marriage. “We’ve got some catching up here to do with our laws, our codes and what we operate our government under,” he said in a statement.

Shelly, who served as Shirley’s vice president from 2007 to 2011, was among 14 council members in 2005 who voted against the override, short of what was needed. Sixty-two voted for the override and 12 delegates abstained.

Despite the high-level support, “only an action by the Navajo Nation Council to repeal the act would change the law,” Jared Touchin, a council spokesman, said in an email. “There is currently no such legislation that attempts to do so.”

While the law states that “the purposes of marriage on the Navajo Nation are to promote strong families and to preserve and strengthen family values,” some Navajo activists say it does the opposite.

“It goes against our tribe’s fundamental teaching of harmony in family,” said Alray Nelson, 27, an openly gay member of the Navajo Nation and part of the Coalition for Navajo Equality. “It’s hard to understand why we implemented something like this because it goes against everything we are founded upon.”

Nelson nonetheless said he was undaunted by the failed effort in 2005 because persuading the council president to veto the measure is still seen as one of the coalition’s biggest accomplishments.

“It was not popular in 2005 to support same-sex marriage,” he said, “so the political climate was already set against the coalition efforts. The coalition basically took a long nap until this year, after the Supreme Court decisions.”

The Supreme Court, in striking down part of the Defense of Marriage Act, declared that same-sex couples who were legally married had the same right to federal benefits as other married couples. The court also upheld a lower court’s invalidation of California’s Proposition 8, clearing the way for same-sex marriage to resume in the state.

Justices did not, however, require states to legalize gay marriage. Even if they had, tribes would almost certainly be exempt from the ruling because of their sovereignty.

“Moving forward, our first goal will be to repeal the act by going through the courts like they did in New Mexico,” Nelson said. “Second, we will continue to have these conversations with family members and community leaders. We are not going directly to lawmakers. We are going to the people who put them into office.”

Some tribes permit same-sex marriage. In 2008, the Coquille Indian Tribe in Oregon became the first in the U.S. to approve a gay marriage law that states “marriage” or “domestic partnership” means a “formal and express civil contract entered into between two persons, regardless of their sex.” Seven others have followed suit, including the Santa Ysabel tribe in San Diego County.

Elizabeth Kronk Warner, director of the Tribal Law & Government Center at the University of Kansas School of Law, said her research showed that tribes historically accepted same-sex unions.

“In many of our tribal cultures, we called gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender members as ‘two spirits,’ because there was a belief that they had two spirits captured within themselves,” she said. “They were treated specially and with a lot of respect.”

Now, there is a struggle between the two-spirit concept and the newer but strong Christian influence, she said.

“I think the national trend is definitely in favor of recognizing same-sex marriage,” said Kronk Warner, a member of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians. “There are already several tribes who recognize same-sex marriages despite state law. ... It’s as complicated an issue among tribes as it is in individual states.”

Touchin, the council spokesman, said there was room for debate on the Navajo law.

“The increased attention placed on gay marriage over the last few years certainly has the potential to make people, including the Navajo Nation’s lawmakers, rethink the issue,” he said. “However, most would agree that the Navajo Nation has taken a conservative approach to gay marriage. … Therefore, until legislation is introduced to address the Diné Marriage Act, we cannot be certain.”

Nelson, however, is confident that change is on the horizon.

“By around this time next year, if the law is repealed ... that’s when we can be proud as a Navajo people.”

The organization%27s policy prohibits the use of Scouting to promote a political agenda.

The two leaders wore their Scout uniforms in the June 2 parade.

They marched with several Scouts in the Utah Pride Parade in Salt Lake City.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Two Boy Scout leaders have been reprimanded by the organization for marching with several Scouts in the Utah Pride Parade in Salt Lake City.

Officials from the Great Salt Lake Council of the Boy Scouts of America say Peter Brownstein and Neil Whitaker violated the organization's policy prohibiting the use of Scouting to promote a political agenda. They had been warned that they would violate the policy if they wore their Scout uniforms in the June 2 parade.

""We were very disappointed that you used Scouting to advance the gay agenda at the Utah Pride Parade,"" council leaders wrote to Brownstein. ""You and others are welcome to participate in the parade as supportive citizens but not as uniformed members of the BSA.""

But Whitaker told The Salt Lake Tribune (http://bit.ly/121mjmh ) that they were not promoting a political agenda, but celebrating a ""cultural event"" similar to the Days of '47 Parade that honors Utah pioneers annually on July 24 and often includes Boy Scouts in uniform.

""We weren't rallying for a politician or political event,"" Whitaker said. ""To me, it was being supportive of my fellow human beings.""

Both leaders refused to sign an apology letter acknowledging they violated Scout policy and were disobedient. The letter warns that a similar offense could lead to revocation of their Scouting membership.

Whitaker and the Scouts wore their uniforms in the parade, but Brownstein did not. Former Scoutmaster Dave McGrath of Idaho Falls, Idaho, also marched in uniform in the parade.

The national organization decided in May, after a contentious vote, to accept openly gay boys as Scouts. But the Scouts still have a ban on gay adults serving as leaders — and gay-rights supporters have vowed to maintain pressure on the national organization.

National BSA spokesman Deron Smith told The Tribune that the national organization backs Utah's council.

""These individuals, many of whom are not registered in Scouting, expressed a personal opinion and do not represent the Boy Scouts of America,"" he wrote by email. ""Scouting is taking appropriate steps to respond to this issue.""

Valarie Larabee, executive director of the Utah Pride Center, criticized the council's reaction. Her group organizes the annual parade.

""Any discipline or questioning of members of the Scouting family who participated in our procession as a member of our color guard, a unit carrying out nation's flag, would be deplorable,"" she said in a statement.

http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/prop-8-gay-marriage-case-085022722--election.html,,[],Who’s who in the Prop 8 gay marriage case,"On Tuesday morning, the Supreme Court hears oral arguments in the first gay marriage case to ever reach the court, Hollingsworth v. Perry.

The legal battle over California's gay marriage ban began more than four years ago, when a majority of voters backed ballot Proposition 8, which rescinded the right to marry from same-sex couples.

Since then, Prop 8 has been struck down by both a district and federal appeals court as discriminatory, and along the way lost its main legal defender: the government of California. After the district court decision, then-Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declined to appeal the case further, leaving a coalition of Prop 8 supporters led by a a former state senator to take up the cause.

The Supreme Court could use the case to issue a broad ruling guaranteeing the right to marriage to same-sex couples--or to shut down gay rights advocates' claims of wrongful exclusion from the institution of marriage altogether. The court also may issue a ruling in between these extremes.

As both sides prepare to argue their cause, we take a look at some of the major faces behind the high-profile case.

The plaintiffs:

Two unmarried same-sex couples in California were handpicked by the well-financed campaign against Prop 8 to challenge the gay marriage ban as discriminatory.

Kris Perry, whose last name is featured in the Hollingsworth v Perry case name, and Sandy Stier married in 2004 in San Francisco, but the state Supreme Court invalidated that marriage only six months later.

They have been together for 13 years, and raised four sons together from previous relationships. Perry, 48, told the Associated Press that “we've lived our lives in this hurry-up-and-wait, pins-and-needles way,” since the case began four years ago.

Paul Katami and Jeff Zarrillo of Burbank, Calif., also were chosen as plaintiffs after gay rights advocates noticed a YouTube video Katami helped make to respond to gay marriage critics called, “Weathering the Storm.” A lawyer involved in the case told The Washington Post that they approached “several couples” about whether they would be interested in in being plaintiffs in the high profile challenge to Prop 8, warning them that their lives could face extra scrutiny if they accepted.

Story continues

""We honestly think of ourselves as kind of regular, everyday guys,"" Katami told USA Today. ""We're not asking for a special right.""

Katami and Zarrillo have been together for 12 years, and hope to get married and have children if their case is successful.

Their attorneys:

The two same-sex couples are represented by Theodore Olson, the former Solicitor General under George W. Bush, and David Boies, a high profile Democratic lawyer. The pair faced off against each other in front of the Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore, but are now teaming up to try to convince the justices that Prop 8 and gay marriage bans in general are discriminatory. The attorneys have made the broader argument that the government has no reason to exclude people from marriage based on sexual orientation. Olson has 20 minutes to argue their case on Tuesday.

The Prop 8 defenders:

Dennis Hollingsworth, a former Republican state senator from the Temecula area, and other supporters of Proposition 8 took responsibility for defending the ban on gay marriage after the California attorney general declined to appeal the district court’s decision striking it down.

Hollingsworth is a leader of Protect Marriage, a group of supporters of Prop 8 who raise money for its legal defense now that the state has bowed out. The group says it is defending the millions of Californians who voted for Prop 8 from having their voices overruled by the courts.

Their attorney:

Charles Cooper, a former Justice Department official under President Ronald Reagan, has been the lead attorney for Proposition 8 since it was first challenged by gay marriage supporters. Hollingsworth reportedly chose Cooper because he thought his skills as an attorney were on par with Olson’s. Cooper has stressed in his briefs that the Supreme Court should not interfere with states’ wishes on gay marriage and argues that the government has legitimate reasons to discourage same-sex couples from marrying. Cooper will have 30 minutes to make his arguments and answer the justices' questions on Tuesday."

John Francis, 65, adopted his 73-year-old gay partner, Gregory, as a means of financial security, ABC News reported. The move came about because the two, who have been together for 45 years, began to worry about what might happen if one of them died. Even though the Supreme Court on Wednesday overturned the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which had defined marriage as between a man and a woman, couples in Pennsylvania and more than 30 other states where same-sex marriage is still not legal face an uphill battle for equal benefits.

""It's humorous to me,"" he told ABC News. ""Gregory was a high school and college jock. Today, I am making dough for blueberry crostata and he is golfing. You're going to think of him as the dad, rather than me. … But it provided us with some level of comfort that we have protected each other as much as we can.""

Visit the CentralVoice to read more about John and Greg's story.

Pennsylvania's inheritance tax law states there is a zero percent tax on transfers to a surviving legal spouse. There is a 4.5 percent tax on transfers to direct descendants and lineal heirs, but a 15 percent tax on transfers to other heirs. Since Pennsylvania does not legally recognize same-sex couples, John and Greg previously fell under the 15 percent bracket; however, by adopting Greg, John has moved them into the 4.5 percent bracket.

“We wanted to protect ourselves from higher inheritance taxes that heterosexual couples do no[t] incur upon the death of one or other spouse,” Francis explained to local LGBT blog CentralVoice.

Since the Supreme Court's landmark DOMA ruling, focus has shifted onto equal rights in states like Pennsylvania. State Rep. Brian Sims (D-Philadelphia), the first openly gay person elected to the Pennsylvania General Assembly, plans to introduce a marriage equality bill in his state in the hopes of getting ""marriage"" redefined as a ""civil contract between two people who enter into matrimony,"" Philadelphia Weekly reported.

However, Sims faces staunch opposition. When he took to the House floor Thursday to discuss the DOMA decision, he was silenced by his conservative peers. Rep. Daryl Metcalfe (R-Butler) later told local radio station WHYY that Sims was barred from making comments that would have been ""an open rebellion against God's law.""

Others think there is a good chance Pennsylvania will rise to equal rights sooner rather than later.

“I think it’s going to be odd for people to be recognized in some states but not in others,"" Christine Bryan of LGBT advocacy group Delta Foundation told CBS station KDKA, ""so I think in some respect the state’s hand is going to be forced."""

(CNN) —

Patrick Dati had reached his breaking point.

With a metal pin in his arm and Vicodin coursing through his veins, he picked up the phone to call his psychiatrist.

Dati had undergone surgery for a broken arm after his then-boyfriend allegedly threw him down the stairs when he tried to leave their home.

Now he sat on the phone with his doctor, explaining why he couldn’t carry on, as he tried to overdose on painkillers.

The attempt to end his life, which landed him in a psychiatric ward for two days, resulted in part because he felt trapped in the abusive relationship and saw no way out.

“I couldn’t let my boyfriend go because he wasn’t allowing me to,” Dati said.

Dati is one of an estimated 3.4% of adults who self-identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, referred to as LGBT, in the United States. He’s also one of a quarter of gay men in America who report having encountered intimate partner violence.

While Dati reached out to LGBT resources for help while he was ensnared in the abusive relationship, including the Center on Halsted Anti-Violence Project’s 24-Hour crisis hot line in Chicago, many in his position find that help is hard to come by.

Now, thanks to new LGBT-inclusive language in the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, signed into law this month, domestic violence victims like Dati will have access to many of the same abuse and trauma services as victims of heterosexual partner violence.

Ty Cobb, the senior legislative counsel at the Human Rights Campaign, said the new language explicitly includes the LGBT community in the largest Violence Against Women Act grant program, the STOP grant program.

Previously, there was no grant money specifically allocated to providing domestic violence services and outreach for the LGBT population.

“This provides funding to care providers who collaborate with prosecution and law enforcement officials to address domestic violence,” Cobb said.

Originally passed in 1994, the Violence Against Women Act provides support for organizations that serve domestic violence victims. President Obama signed the reauthorization into law in Washington on March 7, saying it was a “day of the advocates, a day of the survivors.”

The act’s new language highlights the reality that LGBT people also experience intimate partner and sexual violence.

After the announcement, the president of the National Domestic Violence Hotline, Katie Ray-Jones, said in statement: “This legislation that extends protections to all victims no matter their race, legal status or sexual orientation sends an important message that no victim should be excluded from receiving critical resources that will help them live a life free of abuse.”

Human rights and domestic violence activists say LGBT people are an underserved population when it comes to victim services and outreach.

According to a study by the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, 45% of LGBT victims were turned away when they sought assistance from a domestic violence shelter. Nearly 55% of those who filed for protection orders were denied them.

Lack of access to services is not exclusive to the LGBT community; heterosexual victims are also turned away from shelters, usually for lack of space or funding as opposed to intolerance. According to the Missouri Council Against Sexual and Domestic Violence Services, the state turned away 19,000 victims in 2011 from shelters because of inadequate space.

Still, not all states have laws ensuring the availability of civil orders of protection to LGBT victims, which may further contribute to victims’ isolation.

“When we don’t include LGBT in the conversation, when we have conversations that assume this is violence that only happens to women as perpetrated by men, we aren’t giving LGBT the language to talk about their own relationships,” said Sharon Stapel, the executive director of the New York City Anti-Violence Project.

“By omission, we’re saying ‘you don’t matter – you’re not a part of this.’”

The Violence Against Women Act language comes at a pivotal time, as incidences of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender violence have come under more scrutiny.

A 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey found that the prevalence of intimate partner violence was higher in some LGBT relationships than in their heterosexual counterparts: 61% of bisexual women and 44% of lesbian women reported intimate partner violence versus 35% of heterosexual women. Meanwhile, 26% of gay men and 37% of bisexual men reported being assaulted or stalked by a partner, compared with 29% of heterosexual men.

The special report of the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey was the first of its kind to present comparisons between groups by sexual orientation.

According to Stapel, the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization breaks down the barriers that LGBT people face when they recognize their relationship is unhealthy and violent – and decide to reach out for support.

“Some of those barriers are very unintentional. They are service providers who are used to dealing with violence against women and have these very gendered ways of talking about the problem,” Stapel said.

For instance, if a woman calls a domestic violence hot line, most hot lines will immediately divert to language specific to boyfriends or husbands. Stapel said there’s no intent to discriminate or be insensitive, it’s just an easy assumption because the majority of callers are females with male abusive partners. (According to the National Domestic Violence Hotline, 97% of its callers are female.)

At the same time, the assumption can be alienating.

“The first question makes them think, ‘Oh, can I say that I’m a lesbian?’ Or if a man calls, he is treated suspiciously because the presumption is that he’s an abusive partner calling around looking for his wife or girlfriend,” Stapel said. “The first response that men may have is ‘Oh no, this might not be a friendly place for me to go.’”

Because of the new LGBT provisions, the law has been decried by anti-same-sex-marriage groups, including the United States Conference for Catholic Bishops.

“All persons must be protected from violence, but codifying the classifications ‘sexual orientation’ and ‘gender identity’ as contained in S. 47 is problematic,” the bishops said. “These two classifications are unnecessary to establish the just protections due to all persons. They undermine the meaning and importance of sexual difference. They are unjustly exploited for purposes of marriage redefinition, and marriage is the only institution that unites a man and a woman with each other and with any children born from their union.”

The Human Rights Campaign sees the reauthorization as a landmark achievement.

“One of the most amazing consequences is that not only did the Democratic-led Senate, but the House led by Republicans passed language that prevents discrimination,” Cobb said.

The House passed the Senate’s version of VAWA after the House GOP’s version of the bill, which did not include protection for LGBT people, was defeated.

For domestic violence survivors like Dati, it’s a welcome starting point in acknowledging and understanding the particular challenges of LGBT intimate partner violence.

“The gay community, my friends, supported me because LGBT domestic violence is very common – at least in Chicago,” Dati said. “The people that saw what I was going through were there when I needed them, but it took me going through the abuse first.”

When a friend won’t walk away from abuse

Dati ultimately filed a restraining order when his ex-boyfriend began stalking him at his mother’s house while he recovered from his suicide attempt and other injuries.

While domestic violence in heterosexual relationships certainly isn’t limited to physical abuse, Stapel said emotional abuse is a particularly powerful tactic in LGBT relationships.

“For example, threatening to out your partner to their boss when you live in a state with no employment nondiscrimination protection for being gay, that’s a really powerful threat, no matter what size you are in proportion to your partner,” Stapel said.

Stapel finds the isolation and rejection many LGBT people feel from their families and friends who may not have accepted their lifestyle can also play a major role in how they view their relationships with their partners.

As a way to control their partner, abusers might say things like: If you leave me, who else is going to love you? Who else is going to be there for you?

“It can really put someone who is already feeling insecure about their connections to people in a space where they feel really dependent on their abusive partner,” said Stapel.

Dati, who turns 50 this month, said his experiences led him to become a public advocate against abuse and sexual violence to show that it does, indeed, get better. He has written a book about being a survivor titled “I Am Me.”

“I don’t want to see another person live the way I did,” Dati said. “I went to hell and back and what I tell people now is, I’ll never live with that kind of abuse again.”

The group has already set up shop in Minnesota, where the Legislature may vote as early as next week on a same-sex marriage bill that advocates do not yet have enough votes to pass.

But the group is also beginning a long-term push in more conservative states like West Virginia and Utah, seeking to build conservative support for nondiscrimination laws that could help pave the way for same-sex marriage in coming years. A critical part of the effort, fund strategists said, is building lists of Republican supporters of same-sex marriage around the country that could be used to pressure lawmakers in Washington and elsewhere.

That could prove critical at the state level, where Republicans now control majorities or supermajorities in more than half the state capitols.

“We want to change the complexion of which people are calling their lawmakers from these legislative districts,” said Jeff Cook-McCormac, a senior adviser to the American Unity Fund. “It’s usually gay people calling and saying, ‘We want this.’ What we want is for legislators to hear from their straight friends and neighbors, people who will say, ‘I’m a Republican, and I want this for my neighbors and my friends.’ ”

In Rhode Island, the unity fund helped Republican senators create their message in a way that would help them navigate opposition from more conservative constituents.

“They were a resource of experienced political professionals operating on the Republican side of the aisle,” said State Senator Dawson Hodgson, a Republican who co-sponsored the marriage bill. “It was important to be able to draw on some national level experience in making sure that our Republican perspective in supporting same-sex marriage was at the forefront of our dialogue with constituents.”

Mr. Singer, the fund’s founder, helped bankroll the successful same-sex marriage push in New York two years ago, persuading Republicans in Albany that some of the party’s top donors would be there to help defend them against primary challenges and attacks from same-sex marriage opponents. Despite such successes — including passage of measures in four states last fall either legalizing same-sex marriage or overturning existing bans — same sex-unions remain illegal in most of the country."

Tuesday night, during an appearance on Fox News Channel’s “Hannity,” Sean Hannity asked Dr. Carson about his thoughts on same-sex marriage. Here is Carson’s response in full: [emphasis added]

DR. BEN CARSON

Marriage is between a man and a woman. It is a well-established fundamental pillar of society, and no group — be they gays, be they NAMBLA [North American Man/Boy Love Association], be they people who believe in bestiality — no matter what they are, they don’t get to change the definition. So it’s not something that’s against gays; it’s against anybody who wants to come along and change the fundamental definition of pillars of society. It has significant ramifications.

It took a few days for Media Matters and the rest of the organized-left to gin up the outrage needed to grab hold of the mainstream media’s attention. But by Friday afternoon, Dr. Carson found himself under direct fire. NBC News’ Andrea Mitchell brought Carson on her MSNBC show for a grilling, as did CNN’s Wolf Blitzer.

Mitchell and Blitzer were equally horrified over what they characterized as Carson’s comparing of gay relationships to relationships that are considered immoral and illegal. Carson did apologize, but he also explained (in so many words) that he was not engaging in an argument of comparison, but rather a slippery-slope argument of where changing the definition of marriage could eventually lead.

Obviously that is what Carson was doing. And as shown below, it is a commonplace thing to do and an important consideration when lawyers, judges, and adults discuss significant and fundamental legal changes of the sort raised by the question of same-sex marriage before the Supreme Court.

But that didn’t matter to a CNN and NBC desperate to publicly destroy a man who “doesn’t know his place.” We’ve seen this media playbook before with Clarence Thomas, and most recently with Herman Cain. (In CNN’s defense, they did not stoop as low as NBC News.)

If you want proof that what NBC News and CNN engaged in yesterday was nothing more than an ideological witch hunt against a racial apostate, where was the outrage from this very same media on Tuesday after Justice Sotomayor raised the exact same kind of slippery-slope argument Carson did, herself citing illegal and immoral examples?

Below is from the official Supreme Court transcript of Tuesday’s oral arguments on the constitutionality of Prop 8, which bans same-sex marriage in the state of California. According to page 46 of the transcript, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor (a liberal Obama appointee) compared same-sex relationships to polygamy and the horrors of incest:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Olson, the bottom line that you’re being asked — and — and it is one that I’m interested in the answer: If you say that marriage is a fundamental right, what State restrictions could ever exist? Meaning, what State restrictions with respect to the number of people, with respect to — that could get married — the incest laws, the mother and the child, assuming they are of age — I can — I can accept that the State has probably an overbearing interest on — on protecting the a child until they’re of age to marry, but what’s left?

To be clear, I do not believe Sotomayor compared homosexuality to anything. What she did is what Dr. Carson did: she played devil’s advocate about the slippery-slope of what might come next if we open the Pandora’s box of changing the definition of marriage. And to make that argument, like Dr. Carson, she used illegal and immoral relationships (not homosexuality) as slippery slope concerns should the definition of marriage be held to include gay marriage.

But no one on the left or in the media cared that Sotomayor used the horror of incest to make a point about same-sex marriage — because Sotomayor is a leftist and they know which way she is going to rule. Moreover, the point she was making was obvious.

The point Carson was making was just as obvious. But because the right-leaning Carson is both black and conservative, which makes him a threat to the left-leaning mainstream media’s attempted stranglehold on the Narrative, doesn’t “know his place,” Wolf Blitzer and Andrea Mitchell and NBC News and CNN played “gotcha” with him to “put him back in his place.”

Mitchell and Blitzer are not racists, but they do need to take a step back and realize that, in their zeal to aid and abet the left, they are wielding the same kind of double standards and show-trials of humiliation we saw in the segregated South. Back then it was all about the use of character assassination to keep blacks from obtaining the kind of political power that comes with public prestige. Today the media and left use similar tactics against those the media sees as “apostates” — especially black conservative men.

And the goal is to send a message that says, “Shut up or this will happen to you.”

States%27 rights argument establishes respect of state restrictions on gay marriage.

The Prop. 8 case dismissal closes door to private parties defending initiatives they created.

The court granted state executives %22backdoor%22 veto power over laws they disagree with.

On Wednesday, advocates for marriage equality — and I count myself among them — celebrated the Supreme Court's historic decisions on same sex marriage. The elation was justified.

In Windsor v. United States, the high court unequivocally dismantled the most odious provision of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which would have restricted federal benefits to opposite sex couples.

Also on Wednesday, the Court held that those placing the Proposition 8 case, Hollingsworth v. Perry, on the 2008 ballot in Calif. had no constitutional authority to defend the law in federal courts. The Hollingsworth ruling paved the way for the recognition of same-sex marriages in California, the most populous state in the county, with the highest population of persons identifying as lesbian, gay or bisexual.

Undoubtedly, it was a historic day in our society's evolution towards fulfilling our deepest constitutional commitments to equal protection and equal dignity. Yet, those of us happy to scrap DOMA and Prop. 8 should take heed of some of the less discussed legal and political consequences of these landmark decisions. Inherent in the reasoning of these two cases are at least three important consequences for the future of marriage equality litigation specifically, our political and constitutional order, more generally.

Justice Kennedy framed his majority opinion in Windsor by discussing the traditional powers of states — and not the federal government — to regulate the marriage arena. His concern about equal dignity extended only to those couples in states that had already decided to permit same-sex marriage. In essence, he found it problematic that the federal law stigmatized married gay couples after certain states had chosen to offer them legal protection and benefits.

By emphasizing a states-rights based equality framework, the majority opinion leaves open the possibility of a variegated, national patchwork of marriage laws. If the federal government must respect state decisions regarding the provision of same-sex marriage, must it not respect state decisions restricting marriage as well? Even if such an objection can be overcome, those seeking to defend same-sex marriage bans in other states are left with legal fodder after Windsor.

And because the Prop. 8 case was dismissed on on the technical legal issue of standing, it is a ruling that ultimately narrows access to federal courts. Avoiding the much-anticipated question on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage, it decided that private parties lack the legal right to defend, in federal court, the initiatives they sponsored

Ironically, the curiosity of the five-justice coalition in Hollingsworth was the liberal contingent who joined the opinion (Justices Kagan, Breyer, and Ginsberg), and not the more conservative Justices (Roberts and Scalia) who have traditionally favored limiting federal court access. Indeed, both Justices Roberts and Scalia dissented in the DOMA case on the grounds that the Supreme Court lacked standing to hear the case.

In the end, this odd majority lineup in Hollingsworth clarified for the foreseeable future that citizen-ballot proponents cannot defend the constitutionality of laws they helped craft and advance. This may be the right reading of the Court's prior standing jurisprudence, but it will also closes a door to the courthouse in less sympathetic circumstances.

Finally, by dismissing the case on standing grounds, the Court implicitly allowed state executive officials a backdoor veto power over laws or ballot propositions with which they disagree. Proponents of Prop. 8 were placed in the position of appealing the trial court's ruling because the parties with the legal right to appeal — the governor and attorney general — declined to continue defending the law.

I agree with the underlying reasons for the governor's decision, but it is unsettling that the ultimate fate of a citizen-approved initiative can be thwarted by an unreviewable executive decision. The alternative to such significant exercises of gubernatorial discretion is also troubling; stripping him and other enforcement officials of the discretion to disengage from costly litigation is also likely not in the best interest of state citizens. Such decisions are rare, and voters may punish officials at the polls if they disagree with the decision. Regardless, the potential for this type of discretion to enable state officials to insulate matters from judicial review raises complex issues for our political order.

I am not suggesting that Wednesday's decisions were wrongly decided. Although I hoped the Court would have erased all doubts as to constitutional imperative of marriage equality, I believe the cases were justifiably reasoned. Despite their flaws, they still advance the cause of human equality.

However, it remains important to take stock of the important trade-offs and ancillary effects of these cases. We should still celebrate them, but we should remain aware that these advancements have a price.

http://news.yahoo.com/nevada-senator-comes-gay-during-debate-215504602.html,,[],Nevada senator comes out as gay during debate,"CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) — As Nevada legislators emotionally debated a move toward same-sex marriage, one lawmaker rose to his feet and declared, ""I'm gay.""

Nevada state Sen. Kelvin Atkinson says that he quickly picked up hundreds of new friends on Facebook and followers on Twitter.

""I never considered myself not out,"" said Atkinson, a North Las Vegas Democrat. ""I didn't care who knew, I just didn't ever think that I needed to make a public statement about it.""

However, he was moved to speak out late Monday night after listening to passionate, soul-searching testimony from his colleagues as they debated Senate Joint Resolution 13, which would abolish the heterosexual definition of marriage that's been in the Nevada Constitution since 2002, when voters overwhelmingly approved the Protection of Marriage Act.

""I didn't think. I just knew it was time,"" Atkinson said.

Nevada is one of 29 states with a constitutional provision prohibiting same-sex marriage, and SRJ13 seeks to repeal the law and declare that Nevada recognizes all marriages, regardless of gender. It passed the Senate and is now in the Assembly where passage is likely. If approved by legislators this year and in 2015, it would go before voters in 2016.

The debate brought revelations from lawmakers who described personal evolutions on gay marriage and personal conflicts between religious convictions and their love for gay family members and friends.

State Sen. Mark Hutchison, who is Mormon, said supporters of gay marriage should refrain from categorizing those against it as bigots and intolerant. He said he supports same sex unions, but not marriage.

""I simply cannot do that because of my own religious beliefs and convictions,"" he said.

Atkinson, on the floor, scoffed at comments that gay marriage would threaten the sanctity of marriage.

""If this hurts your marriage, then your marriage was in trouble in the first place,"" he said.

Atkinson said his statement confirmed something that he hadn't tried to hide.

""I know who I am,"" he said. ""My family knows who I am. My daughter knows who I am."""

Peters'],The Gayest Place in America?,"Anyone walking through the Dupont Circle neighborhood the other night would have found themselves fighting for sidewalk space with the hundreds of spectators — many of them straight — who had gathered to watch the 17th Street High Heel Race, an annual sprint for drag queens who tear down the block in heels. And when I tried to make plans a few weekends ago, I found most of my friends were booked solid because they were attending one of two huge gay-themed events: the Human Rights Campaign annual black-tie dinner, featuring Jennifer Lopez as the main event; or the Miss Adams Morgan drag pageant, which is such a large production it takes over the Washington Hilton.

When our federal district is measured against other cities with large gay populations, a comparison that experts say is better than comparing to states, it still ranks at the top of the list. Gary J. Gates, who studies census data for the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, reports that Washington has 18.1 same-sex couples per 1,000 households. That places it eighth among cities with populations larger than 250,000.

Sorry, New York, but you have only 8.75 same-sex couples per 1,000 households. In Manhattan alone, it’s higher, at 16.7, but still not higher than D.C. The top three are San Francisco (30.3 per 1,000), Seattle (23) and Oakland (21). The numbers capture only those who acknowledge being in a same-sex relationship.

Every gay man or lesbian I spoke to for this article had a horror story about what it was like working in the closet, fearing they would be found out. It was only during the Clinton years that the White House finally ended the decades-long practice of denying security clearance to people known to be gay or lesbian. That meant in order to be considered for many high-level jobs involving access to classified information, gays and lesbians had to concoct a web of lies about their personal lives.

Steve Elmendorf, a Democratic lobbyist who worked on Capitol Hill for years, described how he and his gay friends had to make sure they all gave the same references to government agents investigating their backgrounds, an insurance policy so that if the question of their sexual orientation came up, they could be certain no one unpredictable would spill the truth."

The House had been considered the measure’s toughest hurdle. The bill passed 75 to 59 and heads to the state’s Democratic-majority Senate, which is expected to consider it Monday.

Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, has said he will sign the measure.

Eleven states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriage -- including Delaware, which acted Tuesday. Minnesota would be the first Midwestern state to legalize it with legislation. Gay marriage is legal in Iowa because of a 2009 state Supreme Court decision.

TIMELINE: Gay marriage through the years

Minnesota, like Iowa, harbors a Midwestern progressive streak. (The state’s Democratic Party is formally known as the Democratic Farmer Labor Party.) But Thursday’s vote marked a stark reversal from 2011, when -- after a wrenching and emotional debate -- state legislators voted to put a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage on last November’s ballot.

Voters rejected that amendment last year, and same-sex marriage supporters saw an opportunity.

State law bars Minnesota’s government from recognizing same-sex marriages performed in other states. The current bill eliminates that provision and allows civil marriages between same-sex couples. In a nod to conservatives, churches could not be sued if they refused to perform such marriages.

“This isn’t about bigotry, as several people have mentioned,” the bill’s Democratic sponsor, Rep. Karen Clark, said during debate. “This is about honoring difference.… I hope I’ve done a good job of really honoring and respecting the need for people who have a religious objection to marriage between people [of the same sex],” said Clark, who is gay.

Four of the House’s 61 Republicans bucked the party line to vote for the bill, and some of the measure’s foes were circumspect about their opposition.

FULL COVERAGE: Battle over gay marriage

“I do believe that marriage should be between one man and one woman,” said Republican Rep. Jim Abeler, who voted against the bill. “Not all of us in this room or in this capital or this state agree. That’s OK.”

Republican Rep. Tony Cornish was more blunt. “I am not a homophobe or a Neanderthal or a hater -- none of those definitions,” Cornish said. “The reasons ... that I’m voting no -- the basic one is my constituents back home. The majority of them wanted me to vote that way.”

Democratic Rep. Tim Faust gave a short homily on liberty and the separation of church and state on his way to a “yes” vote.

“Ninety-nine-point-nine percent of the time, the people that are opposed to gay marriage, at some point in their discussion, they always say, ‘My Bible says,’” Faust said, adding, “The question that keeps going through my mind over and over again is, do we as a society have the right to impose our religious beliefs on somebody else?”

Democratic Rep. Joe Mullery said of the measure, “If you support equality today, I think you’ll be proud of it for the rest of your life.”

The court concluded arguments early Wednesday afternoon on the challenge to the Defense of Marriage Act provision that defines marriage as between a man and a woman. The hearing was the second in back-to-back gay marriage cases before the court this week, both of which have attracted intense public interest.

In the two-hour hearing Wednesday, Justice Anthony Kennedy, often the decisive vote in close cases, joined the four more liberal justices in raising questions about the provision of the federal Defense of Marriage Act that is being challenged.

Kennedy said the law appears to intrude on the power of states that have chosen to recognize same-sex marriages. Other justices said the law creates what Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg called two classes of marriage, full marriage and ""skim-milk marriage.""

Click to listen to the oral arguments.

The motivation behind the 1996 federal law, passed by large majorities in Congress and signed by President Bill Clinton, was questioned repeatedly by Justice Elena Kagan. She read from a House of Representatives report explaining that the reason for the law was ""to express moral disapproval of homosexuality."" The quote produced an audible reaction in the courtroom.

Paul Clement, representing the House Republican leadership in defending the law, said the more relevant question is whether Congress had ""any rational basis for the statute."" He supplied one, the federal government's interest in treating same-sex couples the same no matter where they live.

Clement said the government does not want military families ""to resist transfer from West Point to Fort Sill because they're going to lose their benefits."" The U.S. Military Academy at West Point is in New York, where same-sex marriage is legal, and Fort Sill is in Oklahoma, where gay marriages are not legal.

The law affects a range of benefits available to married couples, including tax breaks, survivor benefits and health insurance for spouses of federal employees.

It also is possible the court could dismiss the case for procedural reasons, though that prospect seemed less likely than it did in Tuesday's argument over gay marriage in California.

Marital status is relevant in more than 1,100 federal laws that include estate taxes, Social Security survivor benefits and health benefits for federal employees. Lawsuits around the country have led four federal district courts and two appeals courts to strike down the law's Section 3, which defines marriage.

In 2011, the Obama administration abandoned its defense of the law but continues to enforce it. House Republicans are now defending DOMA in the courts.

The justices chose for their review the case of Edith Windsor, 83, of New York, who sued to challenge a $363,000 federal estate tax bill after her partner of 44 years died in 2009.

Windsor, who goes by Edie, married Thea Spyer in 2007 in Canada after doctors told them that Spyer would not live much longer. She suffered from multiple sclerosis for many years. Spyer left everything she had to Windsor.

There is no dispute that if Windsor had been married to a man, her estate tax bill would have been zero.

The U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York agreed with a district judge that the provision of DOMA deprived Windsor of the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the law.

Like the Proposition 8 case from California, Windsor's lawsuit could falter on a legal technicality without a definitive ruling from the high court.

The House Republicans, the Obama administration and a lawyer appointed by the court were to spend part of the hearing discussing whether the House Republican leadership can defend the law in court because the administration decided not to, and whether the administration forfeited its right to participate in the case because it changed its position and now argues that the provision is unconstitutional.

If the Supreme Court finds that it does not have the authority to hear the case, Windsor probably would still get her refund because she won in the lower courts. But there would be no definitive decision about the law from the nation's highest court, and it would remain on the books.

On Tuesday, the justices weighed a fundamental issue: Does the Constitution require that people be allowed to marry whom they choose, regardless of either partner's gender? That case involved California's Proposition 8 ban on gay marriage.

If the justices choose to rule broadly, they could overturn Prop 8 and in doing so invalidate every other restriction on gay marriage in the country.

But the justices suggested Tuesday they could decide the case without issuing a ruling that ripples through all 50 states.

Several justices, including some liberals who seemed open to gay marriage, raised doubts that the case was properly before them. Such an outcome would almost certainly allow gay marriages to resume in California but would have no impact elsewhere.

The justices' statement spanned the gamut. Chief Justice John Roberts said it seemed supporters of gay marriage were trying to change the meaning of the word ""marriage"" by including same-sex couples.

Lawyers representing supporters of the California ban known as Proposition 8 argued that the court should not override the democratic process and impose a judicial solution that would redefine marriage in the some 40 states that do not allow same-sex couples to wed.

Decisions in both cases are expected by June.

Americans as a whole are divided on the issue. A Fox News poll released Thursday showed 49 percent of voters favor legalizing gay marriage, while 46 percent oppose it.

That marks a shift since the question was first asked in 2003 -- when 32 percent said gay marriage should be legal, and 58 percent opposed it.

Gay marriage has been approved in nine states -- Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont, Washington -- and the District of Columbia. But 31 states have amended their constitutions to prohibit same-sex marriage. North Carolina was the most recent example last May.

Support now for same-sex marriage — more than half in favor, about one-third against — is roughly the public divide on the question of public school desegregation in 1954 when the Supreme Court outlawed segregated schools in Brown v. Board of Education. But the court’s call then for states to end racial discrimination in public schools “with all deliberate speed” was a big error. It gave states far too much latitude to move slowly and gave them an excuse for resistance, which delayed desegregation in many school districts for many years. The court should avoid that kind of error in the same-sex-marriage cases. It should broadly declare that under the Constitution the right to marry applies equally to all couples, period, and that this principle applies to the federal government and every state.

The arguments of those defending discrimination against gay couples are beyond far-fetched. Proposition 8’s advocates, for example, contend that restricting marriage to heterosexual couples must be rational because for thousands of years people widely agreed that the institution involved only the union of a man and a woman. That reasoning stinks of the faulty logic used to justify the persistence of all sorts of discrimination. They also argue that marriage’s purpose is to ensure that children are born into stable families; therefore, California should be allowed to limit marriage to only those capable of biological procreation. That is a narrow and insulting view of marriage. Would it then be constitutional to deny sterile heterosexual couples the right to marry? How about older couples? Moreover, lesbians can bear children and gay men can adopt. Why wouldn’t society want their parents to be wed, too?

Statistically speaking, Franklin County should be straighter than John Wayne eating Chick-fil-A. The middle-of-nowhere rectangle in southwest Mississippi -- known for its pine forests, hog hunting and an infamous hate crime -- is home to exactly zero same-sex couples, according to an analysis of census data. In other words: It's a place where gays don't exist. At least not on paper. [...] In a place where ""everybody knows everybody,"" as Richard Pickett put it, very few seem willing to talk about the possibility of gay residents. You could blame that on the would-be gays. ""If (a gay couple) did live together, they would probably keep it quiet,"" the 54-year-old told me. ""They're not going to march up and down the street with a sign"" announcing their homosexuality. The common Franklin County wisdom seems to be that gays, like unicorns or dragons, are living over the next pine-covered hill, out of sight and out of mind. They're not my kids. Not my neighbors. They're somewhere else. Maybe. But here's the thing: There certainly are gay people in Franklin County. And for the most part, they're not in the closet. Many are happy to talk about it. It's their neighbors and families who aren't.

The GOP filibuster strategy is proving to be the tool of choice for draining momentum from President Obama’s reelection mandate. It stops the Democratic majority in the senate from controlling the Senate. And it makes it difficult for the president to put his nominees in place to govern the country. The GOP is betting that voters will blame Democrats for the dysfunction in Congress as much as they blame the GOP. And so far, the bet is paying off, because the press is failing to call out the GOP for an extreme and nasty political strategy of demanding a super-majority of 60 votes —the votes required to break a filibuster — to get anything done.

A lawsuit the federal government filed against JP Morgan in late 2011 alleged the bank consistently overstated the quality of the loans it packaged into mortgage bonds; that it inflated home values to make mortgages seem safer than they were; and that JP Morgan and its brokers didn’t adhere to their own underwriting standards. Federal lawsuits against other Wall Street banks made similar claims. Post-crisis investigations have revealed that outside auditors told banks that they were handling bad mortgages, but the banks stuffed them into bonds and sold them off anyway. The banks did all this while knowing they would have to own any mortgage fraud that investors discovered. Just imagine what they’ll be tempted to pull once they let themselves off that hook.

There comes a point when some folks prove themselves so careless so consistently with the facts that the rest of us should have license to ignore any additional utterance ever to leak from their lips. That time has come with regard to Michele Bachmann. The not-so-esteemed congresswoman from Minnesota crossed a new threshold last week (just how many thresholds can there be?) when she blasted President Obama’s lavish lifestyle of “excess” (a claim of such lavish excess itself that it prompted even Bill O’Reilly to dress her down for it) and called for a repeal of the Affordable Health Care Act “before it literally kills women, kills children, kills senior citizens.” Breathtaking. And I don’t mean that in a positive way.

(CNN) —

The Supreme Court gave proponents of same-sex marriage two major victories in 2013 – striking down parts of the Defense of Marriage Act that denied the same benefits provided to heterosexual spouses to legally married same-sex couples, and allowing same-sex marriages to resume in California. Since then, a lot has has happened, legally, for supporters.

Here’s a look at same-sex marriage in the United States, by the numbers:

37 – U.S. states which allow same-sex marriage, plus the District of Columbia: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

13 – The number of U.S. states with “laws or constitutional amendments that deny the freedom to marry to same-sex couples.”

4 – States involved in the challenge to the U.S. Supreme Court involving state bans on same-sex marriage. At issue is a lower court opinion that upheld same-sex marriage bans in Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee.

1 – U.S. territory where same-sex partners can get married: Guam.

Almost 72% – Percentage of people in the United States who live in a state where same-sex marriage is legal.

9 million - LGBT adults in the United States.

251,695 – Same-sex married couples in the United States in 2013, according to the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey.

60% - Percentage of Americans who support same-sex marriage, according to a May 2015 Gallup Poll.

2001 – The year the Netherlands made same-sex marriage legal. It was the first country in the world to so.

2003 – The year the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it is unconstitutional to criminalize sodomy.

2004 – The year that same-sex marriage became legal in Massachusetts, the first U.S. state to do so.

19 – Countries worldwide where same-sex marriage has been approved in the entire country: Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales), and Uruguay.

2 – The number of countries where same-sex marriage is legal in some areas: Mexico and the United States.

4 – U.S. states that allow civil unions: Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois and New Jersey.

22% – Same-sex couples in the United States raising adopted or foster children, as of March 2015 research by the Williams Institute at UCLA."

Oral arguments in the legal battle to extend the right of marriage to same-sex couples — and to grant federal recognition of such unions — was difficult to imagine even a decade ago.

Oral arguments in the legal battle to extend the right of marriage to same-sex couples — and to grant federal recognition of such unions — was difficult to imagine even a decade ago.

Ian Finkenbinder came to the steps of the Supreme Court wearing the dress uniform from the Army that discharged him after he said he was gay.

John Lewis and Stuart Gaffney donned the black tuxedos and bright blue ties they wore for their 2008 marriage in California.

Carmen Guzman came bearing tearful memories of a step-parent who called her a deviant when she came out, and high school classmates who sneaked up behind her and pushed her down the stairs.

“I have waited my entire life for this day,” said Guzman, of McLean, who arrived with her wife, Ikeita, outside the Supreme Court on the day it heard arguments in the first of two cases involving gay marriage.

Inside the court, the justices were grappling with often highly technical questions involving precedent and standing. But for many of the thousands who massed on the sidewalks and streets outside — some after waiting days to get a coveted seat inside — the issues were intensely personal.

On Tuesday, the Supreme Court took up the Proposition 8 case, the challenge to California’s ban on same-sex marriage. The Post’s Robert Barnes explains what you need to know from the hour of oral arguments. (JulieAnn McKellogg/The Washington Post)

“It’s our very lives that are before the court today,” said Gaffney, 50, recalling being introduced to Lewis at a party 26 years ago and thinking he had just met his future husband. “I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else in the world today. It’s history in the making.”

Many in the crowd played a role in making that history happen.

Jennifer Pizer and Jon Davidson of Lambda Legal, a gay activist group that brought a suit overturning laws that criminalized sodomy, got up at 4:30 a.m. to be near the front of the line for lawyers seeking seats inside the court.

“It’s a little scary,” she said of the uncertainty over how the court will rule. “But we all know we’re living in a very special moment.”

Finkenbinder, an Arab linguist from Seattle who was booted from the Army after announcing his sexual orientation, has become an activist who once chained himself to the White House fence to protest the administration’s now abandoned “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy.

Judging by the signs they carried, the crowd was overwhelmingly composed of people and groups that support marriage equality. Some had conversations, mostly civil, with people supporting the traditional definition of marriage.

“It’s been okay,” said Orlando Irizarry, a pastor from Providence, R.I., of the exchanges between marriage equality supporters and Irizarry’s group holding up a banner reading “Man + Woman = Marriage.”

“What is so beautiful about this nation is you can give your point of view in peace.”

Eight members of the Topeka-based Westboro Baptist Church, who often demonstrate at military funerals, held provocatively worded signs indicating their view that God does not confer grace on homosexuals.

Staking out a position right next to them were several members of Ravensworth Baptist Church in Annandale, which is part of the Association of Welcoming and Affirming Baptists. Before going to the court, they had attended an interfaith service of other religious people who also support same-sex marriage.

“I kept thinking of Martin Luther King standing before that other courthouse in Montgomery,” said Steve Hyde, the Ravensworth pastor. “That’s where he said: ‘How long? Not long.’ I sense something is happening today. It’s a great day to be on the right side of history.”

Others also saw similarities with the civil rights movement. Melissa Wasser, 26, came with several friends from Youngstown State University in Ohio, where she is a junior. She carried a handmade poster that included a wedding portrait of her African American father and white mother.

“My parents used to be illegal, too,” the poster said.

Some tourists, unable to resist the allure of being in town while a potentially landmark case was before the court, rose early to join long lines hoping for coveted seats inside.

Melissa Leathers drove into Washington from Cincinnati on Monday night, planning to show her children the city’s monuments during spring break. But her son, Will, who dreams of becoming a lawyer, helped persuade her to make the Supreme Court their first stop.

“My son turns 18 next week, and all he wanted for his birthday was to get a seat in court so he can hear arguments,” she said.

Afia Bonner and Michele Didero flew in from San Francisco. They voted against Proposition 8, the voter-approved gay marriage ban now before the court, and they wanted to see how it ends, like the last chapter in a book.

But however the judges rule, the young women, both in their early 20s, said they are mindful of how much older gay activists have had to fight and how rapidly American attitudes toward same-sex couples have shifted.

“We started on second base,” said Bonner, who is 23. “It’s sad to think we have to keep on fighting. But every generation has its own battles.”"

Ben Affleck, Padma Lakshmi, Leonardo DiCaprio, Seth MacFarlane, Ricky Martin, Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Kristen Bell are just a few of the celebrities who have unleashed messages about gay marriage this week.

(Photo by Jeff Swensen/Getty Images)

Rick Santorum said the nation's colleges are promoting a ""sea of antagonism toward Christianity"" and ""indoctrinating"" its youth with ideals that support gay marriage, abortion and pornography.

Santorum called in to Tony Perkins' ""Washington Watch"" on Tuesday to talk about the 40th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade ruling. The conversation dealt not only with abortion but also included other ""symptoms"" that have changed the nation.

Perkins spoke broadly, saying pro-choice Americans represent a troubled country that doesn't choose life, meaning ""That is to follow the principals, the teachings, the instructions of God ... You see that as you've been in Washington, D.C. There is a rejection of this idea of truth, and that there is a foundation or morality, which needs to be upheld.""

Santorum agreed, adding that less young people devote themselves to Christianity. ""If you look at the popular culture and what comes out of Hollywood, if you go to our schools and particularly our colleges and universities, they are indoctrinated in a sea of relativism and a sea of antagonism towards Christianity.""

""Abortion is a symptom. Marriage is a symptom. Pornography [is a symptom],"" he continued. ""All of these are symptoms to the fundamental issue that we've gotten away from the truth and the 'Truth-Giver.'""

Santorum has long been against gay marriage and anti-abortion. When he was in the running for the GOP presidential nomination, he vowed to initiate a war on porn if elected. Santorum received his undergraduate degree from Pennsylvania State University, an M.B.A. from the University of Pittsburgh and a J.D. from the Dickinson School of Law but has criticized the notion that college is a critical entry point to the middle class.

""President Obama once said he wants everybody in America to go to college. What a snob!"" Santorum said last February, according to the New York Times. ""There are good, decent men and women who go out and work hard every day and put their skills to the test that aren't taught by some liberal college professor trying to indoctrinate him. I understand why he wants you to go to college. He wants to remake you in his image.""

The Times highlighted a 2008 study that disproved the theory that going to college makes students increasingly liberal. The study found that 18 to 24-year-old students' ideals shifted somewhat leftward, but this was in line with normally occurring shifts in that age group regardless of education."

The justices sounded sharply divided as they considered Proposition 8, California’s ban on gay marriage, and wary of going too far, too fast. None of them spoke up for a sweeping ruling that would require every state to change its marriage laws.

But Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who probably holds the deciding vote, said in the day’s most poignant moment that he was troubled by the effect of Proposition 8 on the nearly 40,000 children in the state being raised by same-sex couples. The court should hear “the voice of these children,” he said. “They want their parents to have full recognition and full status” that goes with marriage.

Kennedy, who has written two previous decisions in favor of gay rights, sounded anguished, admitting he was “wrestling” with whether to extend the same anti-discrimination protection to gays that the court gives to women but also expressed concern about taking the court “into unchartered waters” or over a “cliff.”

The court’s liberal justices more forcefully attacked the argument by Proposition 8 proponents that the purpose of marriage was for procreation, with Justice Elena Kagan asking at one point whether states could ban marriage between couples older than 55.

Charles J. Cooper, who argued for Proposition 8, said that would not be constitutional, adding that at least one member of an elderly couple would probably still be fertile, drawing laughter from the courtroom.

“Lots of people who get married can’t have children,” said Justice Stephen G. Breyer.

The arguments opened two days of hearings by the court on the controversial issue of same-sex marriage. On Wednesday, the justices will hear a constitutional challenge to the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, which bans federal benefits for 130,000 legally married gay couples, including 18,000 couples in California.

The Obama administration and gay rights advocates say the provision is discriminatory and denies the married couples the “equal protection of the laws.” Appeals courts in Boston and New York have ruled it unconstitutional.

CHEAT SHEET: Your guide to Prop. 8 and DOMA

California’s voters approved Proposition 8 in 2008 to limit marriage to a man and a woman. However, the referendum was challenged in federal court in San Francisco and struck down by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals last year on the grounds it took away from gays and lesbians a right to marry that they had won in the state courts.

If the Supreme Court had turned down the appeal in the California case, it would have had the effect of restoring gay marriage in California. Such a move would not have set a legal precedent nor would it have forced a change in the states that forbid gay marriage.

Kennedy’s comments, combined with those of the four liberal justices, suggest the five will combine to seek a narrow approach in the California case. They could reject the appeal from the sponsors of Proposition 8 on the grounds that they lack legal “standing” to speak for the state of California. They could dismiss the appeal and let stand the 9th Circuit’s ruling. Or they could write a limited opinion that finds the California ballot measure unconstitutional. All three options would have the effect of allowing gay marriage in California.

Tuesday’s arguments highlighted deep philosophical divisions between liberals and conservatives over the potential effects of extending the right to marry to same-sex couples.

On the court’s right wing, Justice Antonin Scalia jumped most forcefully to defend Proposition 8. “There’s considerable disagreement among sociologists as to what [are] the consequences of raising a child in a single-sex family, whether that is harmful to the child or not,” he said.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. questioned whether a court should change “this institution that’s been around since time immemorial.”

“When the institution of marriage developed historically,” Roberts said, it “didn’t include homosexual couples.”

Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., a third conservative member of the court, suggested it was too soon to make a decision, another point made by those backing the California ban.

“You want us to step in and render a decision based on an assessment of the effects of this institution, which is newer than cellphones or the Internet,” Alito told Theodore B. Olson, the attorney challenging California’s ban. “I mean we … do not have the ability to see the future.”

Advertisement

Joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, the most conservative justices appear to have four solid votes against any constitutional right for same-sex marriage.

But the court’s liberal justices repeatedly pressed Cooper to explain why committed gay couples should be denied the right to marry.

“What harm (do) you see happening?” Kagan asked at one point, demanding examples of “when and how and what harm to the institution of marriage or to opposite-sex couples” could come.

Cooper demurred, explaining that the more pertinent question was what benefit a state like California could derive from allowing gays and lesbians to marry.

Cooper has argued that traditional marriage has the benefit of fostering child-bearing, a purpose he warned could be subverted by same-sex marriage. “It will refocus the purpose of marriage and the definition of marriage away from the raising of children and to the emotional needs and desires of adults, of adult couples,” he said.

Despite the back and forth over the fundamental implications of gay marriage, much of the argument Tuesday focused on possible procedural flaws in the case.

Roberts and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg questioned whether the sponsors of Proposition 8 had legal standing to defend it in the Supreme Court.

“Have we ever granted standing to the proponents of a ballot measure?” Ginsburg asked.

But Kennedy, a California native, said California law on ballot measures gave a special responsibility to the sponsors of initiatives. He said they could represent the people of the state when its officials refused to defend a measure approved by the voters.

This exchange suggested Kennedy was not looking for a way for the court to duck a ruling on California’s ban on gay marriage.

The justices meet behind closed doors later this week to vote on the two gay marriage cases. But what they decide is not likely to be known until late June.

Several states with constitutional prohibitions on same-sex marriage have implemented rules in the past several weeks saying that same-sex married couples in their states will have to file state taxes as individuals.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury ruling recognizing same-sex married couples even if they live in states that do not, was issued in August in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision earlier this year to overturn the federal Defense of Marriage Act. The Treasury's new rule covers all federal tax matters where marriage is involved, including filing status.

North Dakota Tax Commissioner Cory Fong (R) wrote an email to state Rep. Kylie Oversen (D-Grand Forks) in late September explaining North Dakota's policy:

Because the North Dakota Constitution does not recognize same sex marriages, the married filing status cannot be recognized for same-sex couples at the state level. Instead, each individual will complete a new supplemental schedule that instructs them on how to report their separate share of the joint federal taxable income. The information on the completed schedule will then be used by each individual to fill out their respective state tax return. The filing status selected by each individual on the state tax return must be either single or head of household.

Last week, Kansas Revenue Secretary Nick Jordan made a similar announcement, while the Idaho Tax Commission also indicated that same-sex married couples would be treated as singles on their state filings.

In Kansas, Tom Witt, the executive director of Equality Kansas, told The Huffington Post that the state revenue department's ruling may actually violate a state law that allows married couples to use their federal tax returns to determine their state return.

""The administration should really follow state law and federal guidelines, and stop discriminating against gay and lesbian couples in the state,"" Witt told HuffPost.

Kansas Revenue Department spokeswoman Jeannine Koranda disagreed with Witt, saying that the state constitutional amendment barring same-sex marriage trumps the federal law. She noted that the revenue department is taking steps to help same-sex couples, like developing guidelines on how to use the federally adjusted gross incomes from an IRS worksheet to complete state returns.

But Witt said that he believes the state will be sued over this.

""If we get sued and go to the courts, and the court decides it is not constitutional, then we will address it,"" Kansas state Rep. J.R. Claeys (R-Salina) told HuffPost. Claeys said he agrees with the rule changes, noting that same-sex marriage is banned in the Kansas constitution.

North Dakota Deputy Tax Commissioner Ryan Rauschenberger told HuffPost that his department also wants to streamline the process for same-sex married couples. He said under the North Dakota rules, same-sex couples would be able to divide their federal taxable income between them for state tax purposes. Rauschenberger said rough estimates show those filing as singles under this plan would pay less in taxes than if they filed as a married couple.

""It is a pretty streamlined process,"" Rauschenberger said.

In Idaho, the state tax commission will require same-sex married couples to prepare paperwork as singles for the state, in addition to their federal tax preparation.

In North Dakota, Rauschenberger said allowing joint filing will have to be addressed by amending the constitutional ban on same-sex marriage and noted that state lawmakers don't reconvene until January 2015. Anything the state adopted would have to face a statewide referendum.

Oversen said she would like to bring up the issue with her colleagues in the Legislature, but said it would be a tough climb. ""We can't even get same sex housing discrimination banned yet,"" she said."
http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/26/news/companies/starbucks-gay-marriage/,2013-03-26 00:00:00,['Aaron Smith'],Starbucks CEO holds his ground on gay marriage,"Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz dug in his heels about gay marriage after an investor complained that the company's support was eroding its bottom line.

""If you feel respectfully that you can get a higher return [than] the 38% you got last year, it's a free country,"" said Schultz, during the annual shareholders meeting on March 21. ""You could sell your shares at Starbucks and buy shares in other companies.""

In January 2012, Starbucks joined Microsoft (MSFT) and Nike (NKE) in announcing support of a Washington state bill to legalize same-sex marriage, which ultimately passed.

In March 2012, the National Organization for Marriage instituted a ""Dump Starbucks"" boycott because of the company's support of gay marriage. Investor-analyst Tom Stauber attributed his disappointment in Starbucks (SBUX) stock to this boycott, according to the shareholders' meeting transcript.

""It's my understanding, something like tens of thousands of people signed on this particular boycott,"" said Stauber. ""And then the [first quarter] after this boycott was announced, our sales and our earnings ... were [a] bit disappointing.""

Starbucks stock and dividends rose 7.6% from March 2012 to March 2013. (The 38% to which Schultz referred was for fiscal year 2012: From October 2011 to September 2012.)

Stauber complained that Starbucks' stock price had underperformed the S&P 500 over the last year.

""Until January a year ago, we existed without making gay marriage a core value of our company,"" said Stauber. ""Hence we did quite well.""

The National Organization for Marriage did not return a call from CNNMoney, but its website says more than 56,000 people have joined its boycott.

Starbucks has long been a supporter of same-sex marriage. In 2011, the company was among a group of 70 businesses and organizations that filed a brief in federal court opposing the Defense of Marriage Act, which restricts the definition of marriage to that between a man and a woman. The Supreme Court will hear arguments as to the legality of DOMA on Wednesday.

During the shareholders' meeting, Schultz emphasized that Starbucks employs more than 200,000 people and ""we want to embrace diversity of all kinds.""

Many major companies have publicly taken a stance on gay marriage. Dan Cathy, CEO of Chick-Fil-A, announced his opposition to gay marriage last year. Business surged as customers lined up at the fast food chain to show their support, while gay couples staged a ""kiss day"" in protest.

An extraordinary finale to a history-making term once again revealed the Supreme Court to be Washington’s most unpredictable institution.

Or at least that’s how it must appear.

One day’s decision left essentially untouched the court’s controversial permission to let race play some role in college admissions. It was followed the next day by a decision overruling Congress and striking down the heart of the Voting Rights Act, which has protected minority voters for nearly half a century.

A year ago, a conservative court frequently at odds with President Obama and his administration ended its term by saving the president’s signature domestic achievement, the Affordable Care Act.

The follow-up this term was again a victory for the president on his most pressing item before the court: gay rights.

And so another term ended with surprising praise from the president.

At a news conference in Africa, Obama on Thursday declared the court’s 5 to 4 decision striking down the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act a “victory for American democracy.”

“I believe at the root of who we are as a people, who we are as Americans is the basic precept that we are all equal under the law,” Obama said. “We believe in basic fairness. And what I think yesterday’s ruling signifies is one more step towards ensuring that those basic principles apply to everybody.”

Said Pamela Harris, former head of the Georgetown Law Center’s Supreme Court Institute and a onetime Obama White House lawyer: “If you weren’t paying close attention, you might say, ‘What a liberal Supreme Court we have.’ ”

Roles on the bench

Instead, it is a court in which two men — Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy — play outsize roles. They are the keys to understanding the court’s sometimes contradictory messages, and that will likely be the case so long as they serve together.

Their influence changes with the cases that arise each term for the court.

This year was Kennedy’s term, partly because he is more moderate than his colleagues on both the left and the right, but also because he holds “a combination of views that are idiosyncratic,” said Richard Garnett, a Notre Dame law professor.

View Graphic The Supreme Court’s 2012-2013 term made history by striking down key elements of the Voting Rights Act and the Defense of Marriage Act, both in 5 to 4 decisions. See how agreement on the court breaks down in this interactive graphic.

They include a strong belief in state’s rights, an aversion to racial classifications and a somewhat libertarian view on issues of privacy, Garnett said. Kennedy has written the court’s most important gay rights decisions. That jurisprudence fit perfectly with the civil rights cases that ended up this year on the court’s docket.

In the three major cases that ended the court’s term — affirmative action in higher education, the Voting Rights Act and the Defense of Marriage Act — Kennedy was the only justice in the majority each time.

It’s a role he is eager to play.

“Justice Kennedy believes the court is the exclusive arbitrator of the Constitution,” said Walter Dellinger, a lawyer who served in the solicitor general’s office.

A line in Kennedy’s majority opinion in the DOMA case, saying the court must decide the case because of its “primary role in determining the constitutionality of a law,” drew scorn from a dissenting Justice Antonin Scalia.

“It is an assertion of judicial supremacy over the people’s Representatives in Congress and the Executive,” Scalia wrote. “It envisions a Supreme Court standing (or rather enthroned) at the apex of government, empowered to decide all constitutional questions, always and everywhere ‘primary’ in its role.”

Such concerns rang hollow to the court’s liberals, who were on the losing side in the voting rights case. They said that Kennedy and the right trampled over the 15th Amendment’s command that Congress pass laws protecting minority voting rights, and that the court should defer to that judgment.

“Where is the court’s usual restraint?” asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

Roberts’s function

But that is where Roberts played a key role, one that he seemed to have set up earlier in his tenure.

Racial classifications, increasingly unpopular with the public, are an enemy that Roberts and Kennedy share. Kennedy, who joined the court in 1988, has long held that view, and Roberts fought the practice as a young lawyer in the Reagan White House. In his first term on the court, in a case about minority voting districts, he denounced “this sordid business, divvying us up by race.”

He has similarly been critical of the way the Voting Rights Act singled out some states for special oversight. “Is it the government’s submission that the citizens in the South are more racist than citizens in the North?” he asked Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. during oral arguments in the challenge brought by Shelby County, Ala. But he has also been willing to bide his time.

In a case from 2009, he wrote that the court had serious questions about the formula used by Congress to decide which states should be subject to special oversight. When nothing was done, he used the Shelby County case to strike down the formula, effectively ending the oversight and saying Congress had left the court “no choice.”

The on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand decisions on minority rights and same-sex marriage might strike the public as balancing. Polls show the public has a generally favorable opinion of the court. Although a majority of the justices were appointed by Republican presidents, polls show Democrats actually have a higher opinion of it.

And some of the court’s alignments on less-noticed cases defy classifications. Several times this term Scalia teamed with the liberals on criminal procedure issues, for instance.

Steven R. Shapiro, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, has been frank in the past about wanting to keep some issues that his organization cares about away from Supreme Court review.

But this year, his group prevailed in four of the six cases in which it participated. “It is a complex institution dealing with complex issues,” he said.

Eric Posner, a law professor at the University of Chicago, said it will not be good for the court if the term is remembered for the Voting Rights Act and DOMA decisions, both of which he found poorly reasoned. When the court appears to be striking down legislation with which it simply disagrees, he said, “that can create a backlash.”"

The Supreme Court handed down its landmark ruling striking down DOMA this week. The news dominated the roundtable on ""Meet the Press,"" where Jim DeMint and Ralph Reed expressed their opposition to the decision.

DeMint argued that marriage between a man and a woman is ""better for children."" Maddow objected, saying that denying same-sex couples the right to marry was ""humiliating and demeaning"" for kids raised by gay parents.

She continued: ""Gay people exist. There's nothing we can do in public policy that makes more of us exist, or less of us exist. And you guys have been arguing for a generation that public policy ought to essentially demean gay people as a way of expressing disapproval of the fact that we exist, but you don't make any less of us exist. You just are arguing in favor of more discrimination, and more discrimination doesn't make straight people's lives any better.""

Reed said that Maddow's argument would mean that Obama, who first stated his support for gay marriage last May, was a ""bigot"" until fourteen months ago.

""No one's calling anybody a bigot,"" Maddow shot back. ""You're the only one who's saying 'bigot.'""

Reed also said that the decision would spur Republican voters to action in the mid-term elections. Maddow pointed out that opponents of gay marriage recently challenged gay marriage in three major votes, and lost all three."

Nelson's support came after numerous Democratic senators backed gay marriage in advance of Supreme Court cases on the Defense of Marriage Act and California's gay marriage ban, Proposition 8. Two Democratic senators, Bob Casey (Pa.) and Tom Carper (Del.), declared their support earlier this week. Sen.

Last-ditch attempt to halt licenses is turned down

Decision came just as gay pride parade got underway

Same-sex marriage opponents had asked Supreme Court to intervene

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy on Sunday denied a last-ditch request from the sponsors of California's now-overturned gay marriage ban to halt the issuance of same-sex marriage licenses in the nation's most populous state.

Kennedy turned away the appeal with no additional comment just as San Francisco's gay pride parade was getting underway in San Francisco, where dozens of couples have gotten married since Friday and where the clerk's office was expected to issue more licenses on Sunday.

PRIDE ON PARADE:Court wins boost San Francisco celebration

Same-sex marriage opponents asked Kennedy to step in on Saturday, a day after the federal appeals court in San Francisco allowed same-sex marriages to go forward.

The opponents said the appeals court had acted about three weeks too soon when it cleared the way Friday for same-sex marriages to be legal in California for the first time in 4 ½ years by lifting a hold it had imposed on such unions while a lawsuit challenging Proposition 8 made its way to and through the high court.

Under Supreme Court rules, the losing side in a legal dispute has 25 days to request a rehearing. While such requests are almost never granted, the high court said that it wouldn't finalize its judgment in the case at least until after that waiting period elapsed.

Proposition 8 supporters could continue their efforts to halt gay marriage by filing their request with another Supreme Court justice. They also have another 21 days to seek a rehearing before the high court.

The Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that Proposition 8's backers lacked standing to defend the 2008 law because California's governor and attorney general have declined to defend the ban.

Then on Friday, the 9th Circuit appeared to have removed the last obstacle to making same sex matrimony legal again in California when it removed its hold on a lower court's 2010 order directing state officials to stop enforcing the ban.

Within hours, same sex couples were seeking marriage licenses. The two couples who sued to overturn Proposition 8 were wed in San Francisco and Los Angeles Friday.

Organizers of the gay pride parade have invited newly married couples to a VIP reception at San Francisco City Hall on Sunday afternoon."

This week, the Supreme Court will consider the constitutionality of two laws: Proposition 8, passed by the citizens of California in 2008; and the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), passed by the House (342-67) and Senate (85-14) and signed by President Clinton in 1996. The court has an opportunity to affirm the meaning and purpose of marriage and the American democratic process.

Marriage is the first institution of society. It brings together one man and one woman as husband and wife to be father and mother to their children. Just as it takes one man and one woman to create a child, the unique contributions of mother and father provide the ideal environment to raise a child.

Marriage is the beginning of family, and family is the foundation of society. Redefining marriage would further undermine an institution already weakened by pervasive infidelity and divorce. We need to promote a culture of marriage and family, not further dilute it.

Some say redefining marriage to include same-sex couples would strengthen marriage culture. They say marriage should be for any two people who love each other.

Love is an important part of marriage, but not a basis for public policy. What if more than two people love one another? What happens when the feelings fade? The government has no business regulating romance between adults. It has a vital interest in the institution that creates and nurtures the next generation.

This understanding requires no judgment about the morality of homosexuality. Many non-marital relationships are worthy of rights and responsibilities, including same-sex romantic couples, siblings, and friends who choose to care for one another.

Where the law is inadequate, we should pursue legislative solutions. For example, central to the DOMA case is a tax disparity. Rather than redefine marriage, why not simply eliminate the estate tax?

In a free society, the people's will prevails in the competition of ideas. Forty-one states have affirmed the meaning of marriage. The court should honor the process by allowing it to continue.

Gingrich spoke about the issue of same-sex marriage during an interview with The Huffington Post in December. Although he defended his belief that marriage is between a man and a woman, the former House Speaker said the GOP needs to progress with the times.

""It is in every family. It is in every community,"" he told HuffPost. ""The momentum is clearly now in the direction in finding some way to ... accommodate and deal with reality. And the reality is going to be that in a number of American states -- and it will be more after 2014 -- gay relationships will be legal, period.""

On Thursday, Right Wing Watch posted a video response to Gingrich's same-sex marriage comments made by Navy chaplain Gordon Klingenschmitt, according to Raw Story. In the video, the chaplain says Gingrich is wholly misguided in pandering to the left and ""homosexual sin.""

The chaplain cites a Bible passage from Romans, Chapter 1, which reads ""the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another ... that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.”

“It’s not like Newt is personally engaging in homosexual activity, but the Bible condemns him now because he takes pleasure in those that do that sort of thing,” Klingenschmitt explained. “When the Bible condemns his endorsement of homosexual sin then he has become one of the sinners condemned by Romans, Chapter 1.”

Klingenschmitt continued to say Gingrich is tempted by ""demonic voices"" that tell him ""Okay, it's not really a sin. We ought to endorse this"" simply to get more votes in a possible 2016 presidential run.

The chaplain, who belongs to an evangelical sect of the Episcopal Church and was disgraced in 2006 for disobeying an order, is not the only one to speak out against Gingrich's evolved view on same-sex marriage. Frank Schubert, National Political Director for the National Organization for Marriage (NOM), called the politician's comments both ""stupid"" and ""ridiculous.""

Gingrich was previously vocal against same-sex marriage. He went so far as to compare it to paganism, saying, ""The effort to create alternatives to marriage between a man and a woman are perfectly natural pagan behaviors, but they are a fundamental violation of our civilization."" While running for the GOP presidential nomination, he also vowed to enforce the Defense of Marriage Act.

Watch Gordon Klingenschmitt's video below. He discusses Newt Gingrich around the 5-minute mark.

UPDATE: Gordon Klingenschmitt wrote HuffPost to clarify that he never said he believes Newt Gingrich to be worthy of death. According to the video, however, he did state that the Bible holds ""homosexual acts are worthy of death"" and that the Bible also equally condemns those who ""take pleasure in those who do that sort of thing."""

N.J. Supreme Court refuses to allow stay in same-sex marriage case

Court will rule later whether the state should allow gay marriages permanently

Thirteen states%2C many in the Northeast%2C now recognize gay marriage.

TRENTON -- Gay couples in New Jersey will be able to marry starting Monday.

The state Supreme Court Friday turned down Republican Gov. Chris Christie's administration request to delay same-sex marriages, clearing the way for the weddings to begin Oct. 21.

A lower-court judge had earlier ruled that same-sex weddings must be allowed starting Monday, and the administration requested a stay.

The Christie administration has also appealed a lower court decision that the state should allow same-sex marriages, and the high court is expected to hear arguments and render a decision on the broader issue over the next three months.

The ruling by the justices against the motion was unanimous, a sign that the administration's prospects for the full appeal are bleak.

""The State has advanced a number of arguments, but none of them overcome this reality: same-sex couples who cannot marry are not treated equally under the law today. The harm to them is real, not abstract or speculative,"" wrote Chief Justice Stuart Rabner in the decision.

""We applied settled legal standards and determined that the state has not shown a reasonable probability it will succeed on the merits,'' Rabner wrote.

Steven Goldstein, the former head of Garden State Equality, which filed the original lawsuit with other parties, said the court's decision on the stay allows the same-sex couples to ""begin to tear down its Berlin Wall separating straight people who have had total freedom and LGBT who have not.""

""Imagine the happiness you'd feel if you won the Super Bowl, the Nobel Prize and an Academy Award all in a single moment, and multiply it by a million. That's how we LGBT New Jerseyans feel right now,"" Goldstein said.

Assemblyman Reed Gusciora, a Mercer County Democrat who is openly gay, said he hoped the Christie administration would move quickly to provide guidance to municipalities dealing with an influx of same-sex couples seeking to get married.

""Equality has won out once again and I thank the Supreme Court for ruling on the side of justice,"" Gusciora said.

Thirteen states, many in the Northeast, now recognize gay marriage."

After the Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act on Wednesday, the restaurant chain's president and chief operating officer, Dan Cathy, apparently tweeted an anti-gay response to the ruling.

The court ruled Wednesday morning that DOMA, which barred the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages, even in states where the union has already been legalized, is unconstitutional. Following the decision, the Supreme Court also dropped the case for Proposition 8, California's same-sex marriage ban.

Upon hearing the news, some celebrated for equality while others complained about how society has changed for the worse. Cathy, who made headlines last summer for saying his company supports the ""biblical definition"" of marriage, stood with the latter camp.

The Wall Street Journal's Speakeasy reporter Charles Passy was the first to report that Cathy reportedly tweeted an anti-gay marriage statement following the DOMA verdict. A reader sent Passy the tweet, which said it was a ""sad day"" for the nation and that the ""founding fathers would be ashamed."" The post has been deleted.

The tweet is still available on Topsy, an online platform that can index and trackback tweets and web pages.

In a statement emailed to The Huffington Post on Thursday, a spokesperson for the fast-food restaurant discussed the company's stance, but wouldn't directly comment on Cathy's tweet. ""Dan Cathy, like everyone in this country, has his own views. However, Chick-fil-A is focused on providing great-tasting food and genuine hospitality to everyone,"" spokesman Jerry Johnston said.

Cathy's statement may not come as much of a surprise to some. The COO said in 2012 that ""we are inviting God’s judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at him and say, ‘We know better than you as to what constitutes a marriage,'"" the New York Times noted.

A backlash ensued after Cathy confirmed his anti-gay stance and his company was found to have ties to anti-gay groups, but Chick-fil-A claimed its only mission is to ""treat every person with honor, dignity and respect"" regardless of ""belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender."" The famed fried chicken joint has since tried to distance itself from any discrimination. Last September, it was reported that Chick-fil-A stopped donating to right-wing groups that oppose same-sex marriage. Cathy himself even seemed to progress, embracing a more open dialogue and befriending LGBT activist Shane Windmeyer, the founder and executive director of pro-LGBT college group Campus Pride.

UPDATE: 2:16 p.m. -- Chick-fil-A spokesman Jerry Johnston reached out to HuffPost Thursday afternoon to explain why Cathy decided to pull the tweet, saying, ""He realized his views didn’t necessarily represent the views of all customers, restaurant owners and employees and didn’t want to distract them from providing a great restaurant experience."""

The two children testifying against it have either been crudely insulted or received death threats.

In February, speaking to the Minnesota House Committee on Civil Law, 11-year-old Grace Evans offered this statement:

My name is Grace Evans, and I would like to thank you for letting me speak today. Even though I’m only 11 years old, I know that everyone deserves to have a mom and a dad. If you change the laws that two moms or two dads can get married, it would take away something very important for children like me across the state. My mom is very important to me, because she teaches me things about being a girl. She is kind, thoughtful, gentle and beautiful. She cares for me and others and listens vey well to the things I want to talk to her about. I am learning from her to be a good woman, wife and mother someday. Even though I learned some of these things from my dad, my mom teaches them in a very special way. Without my mom, it would be very hard for me to learn them. She is my role model in how to be a girl and I love her very much. My dad is also very important to me because he protects me and helps me get the confidence to be a girl who is growing up to be a woman. He takes care of problems in a way that my mom cannot. Just like the way my mom could not be the woman she is without my dad, I wouldn’t be the woman I want to be without my dad. Because he is strong, wise and different from my mom, I learn things from him that I would not be able to learn in the same way from my mom. Since every child needs a mom and dad to be born, I don’t think we can change that children need a mom and a dad. I believe God made it that way. I know some disagree, but I want to ask you this question: which parent do I not need, my mom or my dad? I’ll ask again, which parent do I not need, my mom or my dad? I hope that you can see that every child needs a mom and a dad. Please don’t change your law to say otherwise. Thank you for letting me speak today.

Her father, Jeff Evans, revealed the treatment Grace had received from political opponents:

We haven’t had any physical threats, but we’ve had some rather colorful comments about my 11-year-old. I’ve been monitoring it to keep my family safe and have a heads up on it. It’s really shameful the things that people will say, hiding behind an Internet alias. We see it as more representative of where political discourse is in our country, where you can’t take a position without receiving a great deal of flak, which is unfortunate.

YouTube comments included one calling Grace “an 11-year-old bigot.” Another said, “when did 11 year old children become so repugnantly smug? this is gross and offensive, and not just to gay people. single mothers, widowers, divorced parents… i mean,? just shut the fuck up until you until you’ve seen a little more of the world, puppet child.” On the Facebook page for A Minnesota news website, the heading read “Stupid Indoctrinated Child.”

Evans said, “Supporters of gay marriage are deceitfully claiming that the legalization of gay marriage won’t affect our religious freedoms or freedom of speech. I do not believe them. These attacks on Grace are an example of how we have already lost many of these freedoms. In fact, it’s so bad, they aren’t afraid to viciously attack an 11-year-old girl. Imagine what it will be like if gay marriage becomes legal in Minnesota.”

In January, Sarah Crank, 14, received death threats after testifying before the Maryland state senate. She testified:

Hi, I’m Sarah Crank. Today’s my 14th birthday, and it would be the best birthday present ever if you would vote “no” on gay marriage. I really feel bad for the kids who have two parents of the same gender. Even though some kids think it’s fine, they have no idea what kind of wonderful experiences they miss out on. I don’t want more kids to get confused about what’s right and okay. I really don’t want to grow up in a world where marriage isn’t such a special thing anymore.

It’s rather scary to think that when I grow up the legislature or the court can change the definition of any word they want. If they could change the definition of marriage then they could change the definition of any word. People have the choice to be gay, but I don’t want to be affected by their choice. People say that they were born that way, but I’ve met really nice adults who did change. So please vote “no” on gay marriage. Thank you.

TFP Student Action, a Roman Catholic organization, recorded some of the threats on the YouTube video of Sarah’s speech went viral on homosexual websites. Some of them read:

If I ever see this girl, I will kill her. That’s a promise.

Her parents should be exterminated.

Kill this child and his [sic] parent, for my 11 birthday would be a wonderful gift, thanks.”

Accordingly, more and more people are starting to acknowledge the flawed nature of all arguments which oppose the legalization of same-sex marriage. This article discusses 10 of the most common positions presented by opponents of marriage equality and outlines why each deserves a failing grade.

1. Nature: ""It's Not Natural"" (FAIL)

The most basic argument presented by gay marriage opponents purports that marriage between two people of the same sex is ""not natural"" and is in violation of the ""natural order."" At this level of the debate there is very little exploration of the inherent validity (or otherwise) of same-sex marriage but rather a fixation on the notion that homosexuality is unnatural: ""It's Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve,"" the opponents quip. In reality, marriage is a societal institution. The natural world didn't create marriage, humans did. Nature-themed arguments against gay marriage say little about the societal institution of marriage but reveal a lot about the homophobia and heterosexism of those who present such arguments. In this regard, the disapproval isn't about gay marriage per se -- it's more about discomfort with homosexuality, period.

2. Procreation: ""Marriage is for Procreation"" (FAIL)

With the procreation argument, opponents of equality argue that the institution of marriage is essentially in place to assist with procreation and the raising of children. They reason that because two people of the same sex cannot procreate that they should not be allowed to marry. While the production of children may indeed be a feature of many heterosexual marriages the capacity to procreate does not determine the legal validity of such marriages. There are many married straight couples who cannot biologically have children or who choose not to. The procreation argument ignores the fact that people marry for a wide range of reasons unrelated to procreation including love, friendship and companionship.

3. Religion: ""It's Against My Religion"" (FAIL)



Christianity-based arguments lead the way in efforts to oppose the legalization of same-sex marriage in America. References to the Bible, the ""sinful"" nature of homosexuality, and ""religious beliefs"" are regularly made by those who seek to rationalize their support of discrimination via religion. Marriage is a religious institution, they argue, and not one for society to tamper with. Given that the U.S.A. is a secular nation, religion should play no role in any discussion about civil and societal laws. In order to legally marry there is absolutely no requirement for a religious ceremony to be held. In this sense, marriage is not a religious institution but a socio-legal one governed by the state. Religious beliefs about marriage should never be enshrined in laws in ways that restrict the freedom of others who do not share those beliefs.

4. Redefinition: ""You're Trying to Redefine the Institution"" (FAIL)

Opponents argue that marriage has always been between a man and a woman and that it should stay that way. They say that efforts to legalize same-sex marriage will fundamentally alter the institution for the worse. History reveals, however, that marriage laws in the U.S.A. and in countries across the globe have been modified repeatedly in response to evolving cultural norms. There was a time when women were the legal property of their husbands. There was a time when a man and a woman of different races couldn't marry each other. There was even a time when not one country in the world had legalized same-sex marriage! Removing discrimination from the institution of marriage does not redefine ""marriage"" -- it simply makes the institution more accessible and reflects the evolution of society.

5. Sanctity: ""It's a Threat to the Sanctity of (Opposite-Sex) Marriage"" (FAIL)

With roots in religion, the sanctity argument posits that marriage is a ""sacred"" institution that only heterosexual couples should have access to. Allowing same-sex couples to marry apparently poses a ""threat"" to ""traditional marriage"" as though somehow heterosexual married couples will all be at risk of divorcing when two people of the same sex marry each other. If those who use the ""sanctity"" argument were genuinely concerned about the institution of marriage they'd focus their efforts on helping those straight married couples who are at risk of divorcing. If marriage was so ""sacred"" they'd also be pursuing the outlawing of heterosexual divorce. They do neither of these things. The only married straight couples impacted by the legalization of gay marriage are those in which one of the parties is a closet-case gay person who dreams of coming out and marrying someone of the same sex!

6. Children: ""It Will Harm the Children"" (FAIL)

Opponents of equality frequently make use of flawed research studies to insinuate that allowing same-sex couples to marry will somehow harm children. They argue that children need a ""mom and a dad"" in order to flourish in life and that legalizing same-sex marriage denies children this opportunity of ""normalcy."" Multiple studies across the social sciences have repeatedly demonstrated that there is no difference in psychosocial outcomes between children raised by opposite-sex couples and those raised by same-sex couples. There is no evidence that children are psychologically harmed by having two dads or two moms. The American Psychological Association (APA), the American Sociological Association (ASA), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has each endorsed the legalization of same-sex marriage and its capacity to provide a stable familial framework for children.

7. Reverse Discrimination: ""Religious People Will Be Discriminated Against"" (FAIL)

Some opponents of marriage equality describe a future in which religious people become the new ""victims"" of oppression. They talk of charity-based religious organizations being ""forced out of business"" for ""sticking to their beliefs"" about marriage. In this reverse scenario, gay people are apparently ""hateful"" for wanting to be treated equally in society. How dare we demand equal rights and criticize those who discriminate against us! In no state of the U.S.A. in which gay marriage is legal is a church legally required to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies. Religious groups and churches are still free to pick and choose who they will and won't marry. Organizations that receive public money, however, and which must adhere to anti-discrimination laws, should rightly be challenged if they engage in discrimination against a protected class of people.

8. Slippery Slope: ""It Will Lead to Marriage Involving Animals, Siblings, Children, or Groups of People!"" (FAIL)

Slippery slopes arguments suggest that legalizing gay marriage will serve as a ""gateway"" for the legalization of marriage involving animals, siblings, children, or groups of people. People who present these scenarios portray a catastrophic future with society crumbling under the weight of rampant immorality and social discord. Efforts to legalize same-sex marriage, however, simply aim to provide same-sex couples with equal access to marriage laws -- there is no intention to change the fundamental definition of marriage as the legal union between two adult human beings who have no direct biological connection with each other. Facts are useful in this regard: of the fifteen countries and 12 U.S. states that have legalized same-sex marriage, none of them has subsequently legalized marriage involving animals, children, siblings, or groups of people.

9. Civil Unions: ""Civil Unions Are Good Enough"" (FAIL)

Some opponents of same-sex marriage support the creation of a ""separate but equal"" platform in which straight couples and gay couples receive the same relationship rights and benefits, but from within different institutional frameworks. They argue that ""marriage"" should be left exclusively for opposite-sex couples and that same-sex couples should be granted ""civil unions."" History has demonstrated that this ""separate but equal"" approach doesn't work. Various countries and American states which initially permitted ""civil unions"" for same-sex couples have subsequently enacted marriage equality legislation. These jurisdictions have pursued such changes because civil union legislation, no matter how valiant the effort, is not able to provide the same rights and benefits as legal marriage. In essence, having a two-class system continues to maintain the erroneous notion that one group (straight people) is more superior to another group (LGBT people).

10. States' Rights: ""States Have the Right to Oppose It"" (FAIL)

This position stresses that states have a constitutional right to make their own decisions about the legalization of same-sex marriage which may include banning it. Ironically, most advocates of this argument also support the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a law which allows the federal government to deny more than one thousand federal rights and benefits to same-sex couples legally married at the state level. The maintenance of a system which allows some states to recognize same-sex marriage and others not to, and which allows the federal government to ignore legal same-sex marriages performed at the state level, sets up a cumbersome and extremely complicated national map of unequal rights and legal nightmares. Those who support a ""states' rights"" approach to same-sex marriage should at least be consistent and drop their support of a federal government act (DOMA) which essentially tramples states' rights.

Conclusion: Marriage Equality is the Future -- Embrace it!

There is no logical or reasonable basis for denying same-sex couples access to secular marriage laws. Opposing the inevitable (marriage equality) is a waste of time, money and energy. I urge all of those who oppose gay marriage to start focusing on their own lives, to accept that they don't need to marry a person of the same sex, and to recognize the right of all Americans to be treated equally under the law: ""liberty and justice for all"" should not come with a disclaimer.

""You may be as straight as an arrow, and you may have a friend that is as straight as an arrow,” she told the Journal. “Say you had a great job with the government where you had this wonderful health plan. I mean, what would prohibit you from saying that you’re gay, and y’all get married and still live as separate, but you get all the benefits? I just see so much abuse in this it’s unreal. I believe a husband and a wife should be a man and a woman, the benefits should be for a man and a woman. There is no way that this is about equality. To me, it’s all about a free ride.”

It's theoretically possible that such a scenario could happen, but there isn't any evidence of widespread fraud following the adoption of gay marriage in nine states and the District of Columbia. Though fictional, the premise of the 2007 Adam Sandler movie ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry"" was a pair of straight firefighters getting domestic partnership status.

Everhart does not note the possibility of marriage fraud among opposite-sex couples, though others have warned against marriage fraud committed in order to get immigration benefits. In reality, the number of proven cases of such fraud is extremely small.

Everhart also said she could not understand how two gay people could ever have sex. ""If it was natural, they would have the equipment to have a sexual relationship,"" she told the Journal."

Governmental redefinition of marriage is a power grab that attacks civil society.

How can the law teach that fathers are essential if policy redesigns marriage to make them optional%3F

We can treat citizens fairly and fix policy problems without redefining marriage.

There seems to be much confusion in the current debate over marriage. Hopefully it's not being done on purpose to cloud the issue. Let's make one thing very clear: those of us who support marriage as it has been since the dawn of time respect the liberty of others to live their lives as they choose. But governmental redefinition of marriage is a power grab that attacks civil society.

That's right. We cannot hope to limit government if we do not stand up for marriage. Marriage is the foundation of America's cultural stability and economic prosperity. As the Supreme Court considers two cases challenging marriage as the union of a man and a woman, it should resist a ruling that would usurp authority from citizens and their elected officials, which would be the biggest power grab of them all.

Without strong families grounded in marriage, we cannot hold back the ever-expanding power of government. As the marriage culture weakens, Big Government grows. Just look how the welfare state has expanded as the unwed childbearing rate has grown from single digits in the 1960s to more than 40% today.

Marriage policy exists to encourage a man and a woman to commit to each other permanently and exclusively as husband and wife and to be father and mother to any children. Sound marriage policy strengthens civil society and reduces the role of government.

The erosion of marriage costs taxpayers. And it's not just conservatives who say this. Even the left-leaning think tank, Brookings Institution, attributed $229 billion in welfare expenditures between 1970 and 1996 to the breakdown of marriage.

Marriage is our best anti-poverty program. As the Heritage Foundation's welfare expert Robert Rector has pointed out, marriage reduces the probability a child will be poor by 80%, dramatically diminishing the odds of ending up on welfare.

Even President Obama agrees that the facts about family breakdown are well-established. As he said in his 2008 fatherhood speech: ""We know the statistics -- that children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools and twenty times more likely to end up in prison. They are more likely to have behavioral problems, or run away from home, or become teenage parents themselves. And the foundations of our community are weaker because of it.""

Fathers matter, and marriage helps to connect fathers to mothers and children.

But how can the law teach that fathers are essential if policy redesigns marriage to make fathers optional? Redefining marriage would reject the ideal that a child needs a mom and a dad.

Decades of research show that children generally do best when raised by a married mother and father. If marriage policy teaches a lie about what marriage is, and delinks childbearing and rearing from marriage, it would result in liberals advocating for more state intervention to pick up the pieces of a broken marriage culture and cause welfare programs to grow even more.

Redefining marriage does not simply enlarge its scope to include more people, as some suggest. No, it rejects the twin realities at the heart of the institution: marriage is based on the biological fact that reproduction depends on a man and a woman and children need a mother and a father. It replaces it with an entirely new principle: that marriage is whatever emotional bond the government says it is.

We can treat citizens fairly and fix policy problems without redefining marriage. The lawsuit before the Supreme Court on the Defense of Marriage Act, for example, involves a woman in a lesbian relationship who was forced to pay more than $350,000 in federal estate taxes when her partner passed away because she didn't qualify for a marital exemption. This is why we have argued for eliminating the estate tax for more than 15 years.

The death tax is bad tax policy, period -- for all Americans. We can remove this burden without rushing to abolish marriage as the union of a man and a woman. Everyone is free to love whom they want but no one is entitled to redefine a foundational institution of civil society that has existed for centuries.

Whatever anyone thinks about marriage as a policy matter, unelected judges shouldn't try to settle this question for the entire country. The Supreme Court should uphold marriage and restore to the American people the authority to determine marriage policy. It's time to restore constitutional government and that means standing up for our most fundamental, pre-political institution: marriage, the union of one man and one woman.

The Supreme Court has yet to announce its decision on the two gay marriage cases. However, that has not stopped conservatives from pledging to defy marriage equality, if the high court makes a pro-LGBT decision.

In a letter released Thursday, more than 200 conservative activists -- ranging from the Catholic League’s Bill Donohue to Oklahoma State Rep. Sally Kern (R) -- vowed to ignore any ruling in favor of same-sex couples. The group of endorsers, signing under the moniker of Freedom Federation, is composed of anti-LGBT Christian conservatives, many of whom have fallen from prominence in recent years.

""We stand together as Christians in defense of marriage and the family and society founded upon them,"" the letter reads.

Liberty Counsel head Mat Staver and Deacon Keith Fournier, the editor-in-chief of Catholic Online, drafted the ""Marriage Solidarity Statement"" that attacks marriage equality by invoking ""Natural Moral Law"" and questioning the authority of the Supreme Court.

""This Natural Moral Law gives us the norms we need to build truly human and humane societies and govern ourselves. It should also inform our positive law or we will become lawless and devolve into anarchy,"" the statement warns. ""Redefining the very institution of marriage is improper and outside the authority of the State. The Supreme Court has no authority to redefine marriage.""

While the letter ends with a vague threat that the signers must draw a line on the definition of marriage and will not cross it, the statement does not specify what the Freedom Federation intends to do if the Supreme Court rules in favor of marriage equality.

Raw Story makes a good point, writing: ""What, exactly, they intend to do is unclear, since their churches presumably do not perform same sex unions, and because they themselves do not work in the wedding business or grant marriage licenses.""

The Supreme Court is expected to release its decision on the two marriage equality cases, Hollingsworth v. Perry and United States v. Windsor, sometime next week. The former questions whether California's Proposition 8 violated the constitution, while the later challenges the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act's definition of marriage.

Though an online HuffPost/YouGov survey conducted earlier this month indicated that Americans are sharply divided on whether the court should overturn DOMA, another poll released by Pew Research revealed that 72 percent of Americans say the recognition of same-sex marriage is ""inevitable.""

But this would have been unthinkable five years ago.

It was just three months ago that the White House and media piled on a reverend for preaching the Bible’s teachings on homosexuality. The result was his invitation to speak at Obama’s inauguration being rescinded.

This would have been unthinkable five years ago.

With the election of Pope Francis, we have news anchors openly clamoring that the Church is out of step on same-sex marriage.

This would have been unthinkable five years ago.

Fifteen years ago, the same leftists and media assuring us today that same-sex marriage won’t be imposed on the Church were telling us that civil unions (which I’ve always supported) would never lead to gay marriage.

With all that in mind, am I really supposed to buy that, within five years (maybe five days), the left and the media won’t be incessantly asking this question: “If the Church cannot legally refuse to marry an interracial couple, how can it legally refuse same-sex couples?”

There are many good and well-intentioned people who believe same-sex couples should be allowed to marry. Much of the support from the right comes from our “live and let live” philosophy, which I share. But another liberty is on the line, and that is religious liberty. This push from the media has never been about allowing gay couples to marry; it’s about the left’s lifelong crusade to destroy the Church.

The endgame is to declare the Bible and Christian beliefs de facto bigotry:

I have a right to defend myself. And to point out the hypocrisy of people who justify anti-gay bigotry by pointing to the Bible, and insisting we must live by the code of Leviticus on this one issue and no other.

That is not some crackpot talking. That is Dan Savage, who has worked with no less than President Obama. And Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi… And the media loves him.

Once this idea turns into anything close to mainstream with the left, the left’s legal harassment and outright harassment against the Church will be unceasing. (Muslims, of course, will never be bothered.)

Offering committed same-sex couples the same legal rights (and headaches) married couples enjoy is something I have supported for about twenty years.

Civil unions are something I feel strongly enough about that, here in North Carolina, I did not vote in favor of making same-sex marriage unconstitutional last year. My concern was that the wording of the referendum would give lawmakers the power to ban civil unions.

But I oppose same-sex marriage because marriage is a sacrament, and there is a big difference between asking one to be tolerant, and demanding one condone.

Being gay is no more a sin than being straight. But just as straight people can engage in sinful behavior, so can gays. Asking me to condone anyone’s sinful behavior is asking too much. That is the complete opposite of bigotry, by the way — you know, applying the exact same standard to everyone.

But when the State and its media attempt to force the Church to condone such a thing (and they will), what is unthinkable to many of the well-intentioned today will become a terrible reality.

UPDATE: Erick Erickson at RedState:

Within a year or two we will see Christian schools attacked for refusing to admit students whose parents are gay. We will see churches suffer the loss of their tax exempt status for refusing to hold gay weddings. We will see private businesses shut down because they refuse to treat as legitimate that which perverts God’s own established plan. In some places this is already happening. … The left cannot allow Christians to continue to preach the full gospel. We already see this in, of all places, Canada. Gay marriage is incompatible with a religion that preaches that the unrepentant are condemned, even of a sin the world has decided is not one. The religious freedom will eventually be ended through the judiciary. We should work to extend that freedom as long as we can. Now many of you have read through this and you are shaking your head in denial. “No way this is possible,” you say. But then just a decade ago no one seriously considered gay marriage as possible. And we are already seeing signs we’re headed in this direction. It’s coming. Get ready.

By Treena Shapiro

HONOLULU, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Hawaii's House of Representatives approved a bill on Friday to legalize same-sex marriage in the overwhelmingly Democratic state popular as a wedding and honeymoon destination, paving the way for anticipated final passage in the Senate next week.

The measure cleared the House in a late-night vote of 30-19, with six of the chamber's seven Republicans joining 13 Democrats in opposing the legislation. Two Democrats were absent for the vote.

Governor Neil Abercrombie has indicated he would swiftly sign the measure into law, making Hawaii the 15th or 16th U.S. state to extend marriage rights to gay and lesbian couples, depending on when the governor of Illinois signs that state's bill.

As currently drafted, the Hawaii bill would take effect on Dec. 2.

""This is about a move toward acceptance, tolerance and compassion,"" Representative Sylvia Luke, chairwoman of the House Finance Committee, said as the House floor debate began hours before the vote.

The vote in Hawaii comes at a time of increasing momentum for gay marriage in the courts, at the ballot box and statehouses across the country.

Hawaii's Supreme Court ruled two decades ago that banning same-sex marriage was discriminatory, helping to advance gay rights nationwide but also sparking a backlash that kept the legislature passing a bill on the issue.

With public opinion shifting, Abercrombie, a first-term Democrat, called the state legislature into special session late last month to consider a bill that rolls back a 1994 statute defining marriage as between a man and a woman only.

The Senate overwhelmingly approved the measure last Wednesday, with a 20-4 vote. Three Democrats joined the state's only Republican senator in voting against the bill.

Because the measure was amended in the House, it must return to the Senate for final adoption. The Senate is precluded by legislative rules from acting before next Tuesday, aides say.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Clayton Hee was quoted in the Honolulu Star Advertiser as saying he expected the Senate would accept the House version quickly.

GAY RIGHTS VS. RELIGIOUS FREEDOM

Abercrombie, who served more than two decades in the U.S. House of Representatives before running for governor in 2010, signed a same-sex civil unions bill into law two years ago. His predecessor, Republican Linda Lingle, vetoed a civil unions bill in 2010.

The governor has said the proposal was crafted to address opponents' concerns that legalizing gay marriage would infringe on religious freedoms. The proposal exempts clergy and churches from having to perform same-sex marriages.

Only six states and the District of Columbia recognized same-sex marriage a year ago, but the number has since more than doubled, due in most cases to litigation over the issue.

Three states - Maine, Maryland and Washington - became the first to extend marriage rights to same-sex couples by popular vote with passage of ballot initiatives last November.

Last month, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie dropped his legal opposition to gay marriage, making his state the 14th to legalize same-sex weddings.

Illinois, whose legislature gave final approval to a same-sex marriage bill on Tuesday, would become the 15th state, unless Abercrombie manages to beat Illinois Governor Pat Quinn to the punch. (Writing by Steve Gorman; Editing by Louise Ireland and Sonya Hepinstall)"

Fully one in seven adults (14%) say they’ve changed their mind about gay rights, often because they have a friend or family member who is gay, according to the new national poll by the independent Pew Research Center.

Recently, another national poll, by the Washington Post and ABC News, found that support for gay marriage is now at an all-time high, as the Supreme Court prepares to take up the issue, including a test of California’s Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriages.

The Pew poll shows less lopsided support for gay marriage than the Post/ABC poll, but both surveys reflect similar shifts in favor of same-sex unions. The Pew poll also traces the causes of the wider social shift, one of the biggest on any issue question over the past decade. These roots are worth examining, even if some may not seem overly surprising—like the fact that the emergence of a younger, more tolerant generation has a lot to do with the overall change in public attitudes.

TIMELINE: Gay marriage through the years

In the 18-32 age bracket, support for same-sex marriage is at 70%. Ten years ago, among members of the same generation, it was 51%. But support for same-sex marriage has also increased among those born between 1928 and 1945; in 2003, just 17% were in favor, and today that figure is 31%.

Among those who’ve changed their minds about gay marriage, one in four (25%) say it’s just because they’ve grown older. One in five (20%) say today’s world is different and this change is inevitable. Nearly as many (18%) say they think that government should no longer intrude in people’s lives in this way and that individuals should be free to do what makes them happy. Almost one in three (32%) say it’s because they know someone who is gay. And 13% credit a belief in individual rights or various moral or religious teachings for their change of heart.

The shifting attitudes toward same-sex marriage closely track changing opinions about homosexuality. Today, a slight majority of Americans (51%) says that same-sex marriage isn’t a threat to traditional families. A decade ago, when Massachusetts became the first state to permit same-sex marriage, most people (56%) said the practice would undermine the traditional family and only 39% said it wasn’t a threat.

Evolving opinions toward gay and lesbian rights closely resemble other social and political divides, the study finds. For example, nearly two in three Democrats (63%) disagrees with the notion that allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally undermines the traditional family, while just 33% agree. In 2003, Democrats were evenly split on the question. Among independents, growing support for gay marriage has largely paralleled increases among Democrats.

At the same time, Republican attitudes are little changed. In 2003, 59% of Republicans said homosexuality should be discouraged; today that figure is 54%, according to Pew’s polling. The percentage of Republicans who favor gay marriage stands at 27% today, versus 21% a decade ago.

There is a gender gap on gay marriage (women are in favor; men are opposed), as well as an age divide. Those over 50 are against gay marriage, with resistance highest among those over 65. Americans with a high school education or less are opposed, while support for gay marriage is highest among college graduates. Income levels, too, reflect differences of opinion; those with family incomes above $75,000 support gay marriage, while those who earn less are evenly split. Regionally, support for gay marriage is highest in the Northeast and the West, while opposition is highest in the South. The Midwest is more evenly divided, with those favoring gay marriage slightly outnumbering opponents (48% to 43%), according to the Pew survey.

Among religious groups, only white mainline Protestants have registered substantial changes on gay issues, the study finds. A majority in 2003 (58%) said gay marriage would go against their religious beliefs; today that figure is 44%. Evangelical Protestants remain strongly opposed to gay marriage, while the highest level of support is among those who list their religious preference as unaffiliated.

For students of polling, the Pew study offers an instructive look at the ways that the wording of survey questions can generate seemingly divergent results on the same issue.

Compared with the ABC/Post survey, the Pew poll found significantly lower support overall, even though the two polls were conducted within a few days of each other.

Nor were the differences some sampling glitch. The way that Post/ABC pollsters ask Americans about gay marriage has consistently produced a balance of opinion more favorable to legalization than Pew’s polls. Those polled by the Post and ABC News are offered a simple choice: “Do you think it should be legal or illegal for gay and lesbian couples to get married?”

Pew asks a more complicated question: “Do you strongly favor, favor, oppose, or strongly oppose allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally?” Pew’s results reflect a much closer division of opinion on the issue (a 5-percentage-point difference in favor of gay marriage, versus a 32-point pro-marriage tilt in the latest Post/ABC survey).

But, as the Pew study notes, “the two polls tell the same story: significant growth in support for same-sex marriage over the last 10 years.”

He Has Covered The Supreme Court Since November']",Scalia finds his predictions on same-sex-marriage ruling being borne out,"As smart as they are, Supreme Court justices sometimes falter when they predict the consequences of their decisions.

Dissenting justices are usually the most vocal, forecasting far-reaching and often calamitous results from what they see as the poorly reasoned rulings of the majority. Regardless of the ideology of the justice issuing the doomsday warnings, they often do not live up to the hyperbole.

So give Justice Antonin Scalia credit — or condolences.

When the court last June struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act and said the federal government must recognize same-sex marriages performed in those states where it was legal, Scalia sounded a loud warning.

While the five-member majority of the court said it was not deciding whether a constitutional right to marriage must be extended to same-sex couples, Scalia said the reasoning of the decision made that outcome practically preordained.

“It takes real cheek for today’s majority to assure us, as it is going out the door, that a constitutional requirement to give formal recognition to same-sex marriage is not at issue here,” Scalia wrote.

Instead, “the majority arms well every challenger to a state law restricting marriage to its traditional definition,” Scalia wrote, and such suits are a “second . . . shoe to be dropped later.”

Scalia’s words have been highlighted in the two recent decisions about same-sex marriage that will return the issue to the Supreme Court.

U.S. District Judge Timothy Black cited the dissent in a ruling that said Ohio, which bans same-sex unions, must recognize on a death certificate a marriage that was performed in another state.

“Just as Justice Scalia predicted — the lower courts are applying the Supreme Court’s decision, as they must, and the question is presented whether a state can do what the federal government cannot — i.e., discriminate against same-sex couples . . . simply because the majority of the voters don’t like homosexuality (or at least didn’t in 2004),” wrote Black (the ellipses and parenthesis are his).

“Under the Constitution of the United States, the answer is no.”

In Utah, where just before Christmas a federal judge struck down that state’s constitutional amendment forbidding same-sex unions, Scalia’s words played a prominent role both in the challengers’ arguments and the ruling.

Attorneys Peggy A. Tomsic and James E. Magleby, representing a gay male couple and two lesbian couples, relied in part on Scalia’s interpretation of the majority’s DOMA decision, U.S. v. Windsor.

Scalia, they said, recognized the opinion “for what it is: a holding that would bind lower courts, such as this court, if presented a constitutional challenge to state laws banning same-sex marriage.”

In their filings, the lawyers bold-faced the Scalia dissent for emphasis:

(“[T]he view that this Court will take of state prohibition of same-sex marriage is indicated beyond mistaking in today’s opinion. . . . [T]he real rationale of today’s opinion . . . is that DOMA is motivated by ‘bare . . . desire to harm’ couples in same-sex marriages. . . . How easy is it, indeed how inevitable, to reach the same conclusion with regard to state laws denying same-sex couples marital status.”)

And U.S. District Judge Robert J. Shelby mentioned Scalia’s dissent throughout his lengthy opinion and concluded: “The court agrees with Justice Scalia’s interpretation of Windsor and finds that the important federalism concerns at issue here are nevertheless insufficient to save a state-law prohibition that denies the Plaintiffs their rights to due process and equal protection under the law.”

Of course, Scalia did not say in his Windsor dissent that lower courts must adopt such an interpretation.

“Lower federal courts and state courts can distinguish today’s case when the issue before them is state denial of marital status to same-sex couples,” he wrote, adding: “Lord, an opinion with such scatter-shot rationales as this one . . . can be distinguished in many ways.”

Still, as Scalia pointed out, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy’s DOMA decision practically provided a blueprint for how such challenges might be successful.

It is not surprising that judges might want to quote a conservative justice when striking down what voters have put in place. Ohio and Utah voters amended their state constitutions to ban same-sex marriages in 2004, along with other states. Black and Shelby were nominated by President Obama.

Shelby’s decision, and his reliance on Scalia, has gotten the most attention from legal commentators. “In Striking Down Utah’s Gay Marriage Ban, Judge Gives Scalia Big Bear Hug,” read the headline on the liberal Talking Points Memo.

And University of Illinois law professor Jason Mazzone set off a hot debate on the legal website Balkinization when he wrote that Shelby’s opinion “would have appeared considerably more judicial had he resisted the urge to give Justice Scalia the finger.”

Shelby, 43, does not have the reputation as a firebrand. He had been on the bench only six months when he was assigned the same-sex marriage case Kitchen v. Herbert. He was previously a Salt Lake City lawyer and was honored for his service in Operation Desert Storm while in the Utah National Guard.

He was endorsed by both of Utah’s Republican senators, and Sen. Mike Lee, a constitutional conservative popular with the tea party movement, called Shelby “preeminently qualified” and predicted he would be “an outstanding judge.”

The state of Utah has said it will ask the Supreme Court to stay Shelby’s ruling and stop same-sex marriages while an appeals court considers the merits of the decision. Shelby and a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Denver noted the state failed initially to ask for a stay and has not proven the kind of harm that would warrant one.

In the meantime, marriages in Utah have broken records, according to a review in the Salt Lake Tribune. By last Thursday, the newspaper reported, more than 900 same-sex couples had been married across the state, despite the holiday and some counties refusing to issue licenses until Gov. Gary R. Herbert (R) directed them to follow Shelby’s order.

According to estimates from the plaintiffs’ filing in the court, that is about one-fourth of the gay couples living in the state."
http://news.yahoo.com/more-wines-coming-support-gay-200018865.html,,[],More wines coming out in support of gay marriage,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Wineries are coming out loud and proud in their support of gay marriage. They're putting it right on the label.

""Little by little, we're breaking down the barrier,"" says Gary Saperstein of Out in the Vineyard, an events and tour company based in Sonoma wine country that caters to gay travelers.

One of the barrier-breakers is Same Sex Meritage, a red blend that sends its message on the bottle and at the cash register — $1 for every bottle sold is donated to the advocacy group Freedom to Marry.

""It's the right thing to do,"" says Matt Gold, who is based in Chicago and teamed with Josh Stein of Stein Family Wines in California to make the wine, which launched last December. Meritage is a brand name that refers to a Bordeaux-style blend. And, of course, it sounds a lot like marriage.

Gold and Stein see their business partnership as a way to make wine and make a statement. ""Everyone should have the right to marry. Everyone should have the same rights as anyone else,"" says Gold.

Same Sex Meritage isn't the only wine reaching out to the LGBT community.

Egalite, a bubbly from the Burgundy region of France, was launched earlier this year with the name — French for equality — reflecting the wine's origins as a Burgundy cremant (sparkling wine) and its support for the gay community. Each quarter, a portion of profits is donated to a LGBT nonprofit organization chosen by fans of the wine on Facebook; $15,000 has been donated since the wine's January launch.

From Stand Tall Wines, there's Genetic Pinot Noir, which refers to sexual orientation having genetic origins. Stand Tall Wines was founded by Larisa Stephenson and partner Dana Sabin. The wine is being made in the Napa Valley using grapes shipped from Oregon's Willamette Valley and 1 percent of Genetic sales is being donated to the Napa LBGTQ Project (which is the process of changing its name to LGBTQ Connection).

And though it doesn't have a message-specific label, Barefoot Wine & Bubbly has been supporting marriage rights for gays for 25 years, donating to local LGBT centers and other organizations, investing in Pride Week events, even putting up a 20-foot-tall inflatable wedding cake in front of San Francisco's City Hall to show support for gay marriage.

Story continues

""We definitely love to celebrate the LGBT community and all of its progress,"" says Jerime Black, Barefoot's national LGBT sales and marketing manager. ""Barefoot really is all about fun. It's taking the stuffiness out of wine.""

OK, so not too many major wine companies have an LGBT marketing manager. So far as he knows, Black is the only one of his kind. ""I like to say I have the gay man's dream job,"" he jokes. But there has been a growing awareness of the importance of that community.

Along with the philosophical statements, the marketing effort makes good economic sense. Saperstein credits some of the awareness of LGBT consumers to the economic crisis. With consumers cutting back on luxury purchases, producers started studying the market, looking for niches.

Out in the Vineyard sponsors a Gay Wine Weekend each June and this year had more than 30 wineries involved at various levels of participation.

For Sonoma and Napa Valley producers, the LGBT market is a particularly good fit since the wine regions are close to San Francisco and its substantial gay population which, Saperstein points out, includes a lot of people who love food and wine.

As with all marketing, it's important to back up the message with a real commitment. ""Don't think it's a one-time hit and you're going to get a payback right away. You have to show the community that you care,"" says Saperstein.

Gold's aware that message-specific wines are in danger of being dismissed as a gimmick, which is why he and Stein work to make sure the wine in the bottle lives up to the label.

""We have to have a good quality wine,"" he says. ""Otherwise people are only going to buy it once.""

USA TODAY

Law forbids licensed therapists from using therapy to change sexual orientation of minors

Christie%27s decision seen as a victory for gay rights groups

Republican has walked line on same-sex marriage

Supporters of same-sex marriage say they have greater hope New Jersey will soon allow it after Republican Gov. Chris Christie signed legislation Monday banning the controversial practice of ""conversion"" therapy for gay youth.

New Jersey is only the second state in the nation, after California, to forbid licensed therapists from using therapy to try to change the sexual orientation of minors. But the state is the only one in the Northeast not to allow gay couples to marry: Christie vetoed same-sex marriage legislation last year.

Christie said that while he is concerned about ""government limiting parental choice on the care and treatment of their own children,'' he sided with expert opinion from the American Psychological Association that so-called conversion therapy can lead to depression, suicidal thoughts and substance abuse in teenagers.

The conversion therapy law ""sets a national precedent on not allowing this abuse to go forward,'' said Troy Stevenson, executive director of Garden State Equality, which supported the ban.

Christie has said that he believes that sexual preference is a trait people are born with and that, although his Catholic faith calls homosexuality a sin, he does not.

""He recognizes what many opponents of marriage equality do not recognize, which is that gay people are not in need of treatment,'' said state Sen. Raymond Lesniak, a Democrat who sponsored the legislation. ""That's certainly an important statement to make and he made that with his signing of the bill.'' Supporting same-sex marriage is ""a natural next step,'' Lesniak said.

Christie is cruising to re-election in November despite New Jersey's Democratic lean. But as a likely 2016 presidential candidate who will have to appeal to party conservatives in early primary contests, Christie has walked a careful line on gay issues.

When he vetoed the same-sex marriage law last year, he said the state should hold a referendum on the issue instead. In June, he criticized the Supreme Court's decision striking down a ban on federal rights for same-sex married couples. At the same time, the governor said he is ""adamant'' that same-sex couples deserve equal legal protection and vows to abide by a same-sex marriage law if the voters approve it. He also appointed the first openly gay judge to the state's Supreme Court.

""We welcome what he did today, we're glad he agrees that people don't choose their sexuality and we think that means that every person and every couple in New Jersey should be treated with full respect and that means freedom to marry,'' said Marc Solomon of Freedom to Marry, a same-sex marriage advocacy group.

Gay marriage advocates are pursuing two strategies. A court case argues that New Jersey's civil unions law does not protect equal treatment for gay couples; a decision is expected next month but may be appealed to the state Supreme Court. Gay rights groups are also intensively lobbying state legislators to overturn Christie's veto of the same-sex marriage bill. An override must occur before mid-January.

""I truly believe, if you look at this bill, if you look at the massive swell of support, there is definitely a road to getting this override accomplished.'' ' Stevenson said. The conversion therapy ban passed with a vetoproof majority. ""It definitely shows what the mindset of the legislature is.''

But Christie has forbidden Republicans who support same sex marriage to overturn his veto, gay rights advocates say. ""The governor's position is that you don't override his vetoes. And we haven't been able to,'' says Senate President Steve Sweeney, a Democrat.

Groups lobbying for same sex marriage hope Republican legislators will be more willing to vote against the governor after November, when Christie, if re-elected, would become a lame duck. ""I wouldn't expect his colleagues to vote against his wishes right before the election. That might be a little too much,'' Lesniak said.

The political climate is quickly changing in favor of gay marriage, Solomon said. ""From my experience with and understanding of New Jersey, understanding of where voters are, where their constituents are, and how far Republicans have moved on this issue, particularly Republicans from the northeast – we're not talking about Alabama here – this should not be impossible at all.''

(CNN) —

Edith Windsor, who filed the original case that could upend the Defense of Marriage Act, says just getting the case to this point is a kind of victory.

“We’ve made a huge step forward and a huge difference in how people look at us,” she said. “And so, it’ll happen. Another year if not now.”

It was the death of Windsor’s life partner, Thea Clara Spyer, that led to the case.

Theirs was not a fleeting romance – the women were together 42 years sharing ups and downs, laughs and tears. They also shared what they’d earned together, including from Windsor’s job as a programmer with IBM and Spyer’s work as a psychologist.

5 things we learned from day one of oral arguments

“We were mildly affluent and extremely happy,” Windsor said. “We were like most couples.”

But even after they married in 2007 in Toronto, some 40 years into their courtship, the two women were not “like most couples” in the eyes of the state of New York, where they lived, nor in the eyes of the U.S. government, which under the Defense of Marriage Act mandates that a spouse, as legally defined, must be a person of the opposite sex.

This fact hit Windsor hard in 2009, while in a hospital after suffering a heart attack a month after Spyer’s death. As she recovered and mourned, Windsor realized she faced a hefty bill for inheritance taxes – $363,053 more than was warranted, she later claimed in court – because Spyer was, in legal terms, little more than a friend.

“It was incredible indignation,” Windsor recalled feeling. “Just the numbers were so cruel.”

This anger gave way to action. Why, she and her lawyers argued, should her relationship with Spyer be any different when it came to rights, taxes and more than a heterosexual couple? Why should Windsor have to pay, literally, for losing her soulmate – even though, by 2009, New York courts had recognized that “foreign same-sex marriages” should be recognized in the state as valid?

In October, Windsor got an answer in the form of a ruling opinion from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. That court found, in her favor, that the Defense of Marriage Act violates the Constitution’s equal protection clause and thus she shouldn’t have had to pay an inheritance tax after her partner’s death. This follows a similar ruling, in May, from another federal appeals court in Boston.

Federal appeals court strikes down Defense of Marriage Act

Neither opinion settles the matter for good. That is expected to happen when the Supreme Court will weigh the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act through the prism of Windsor and Spyer’s story. It is one of two cases related to same-sex marriage that the high court is considering. The other addresses California’s Proposition 8. The court is expected to rule on both cases by mid-June.

Even with those cases pending, Windsor said last fall – when the lower court decided in her favor, three years after Spyer’s death – that she felt she could finally breathe and celebrate.

It was a day she relished, and one she didn’t entirely expect after all her heartache.

“What I’m feeling is elated,” Windsor said. “Did I ever think it could come to be, altogether? … Not a chance in hell.”

By the numbers: Same-sex marriage

Instant chemistry in Greenwich Village

Born in Philadelphia in 1929, on the eve of the Great Depression, Windsor graduated from Temple University and earned a master’s degree, in 1957, from New York University, according to a fall 2011 story in the latter school’s alumni magazine.

She had come to New York hoping for a fresh start after a brief marriage, according to the report. And professionally, she found it – working for NYU’s math department and soon entering data into its UNIVAC, one of a few dozen of the huge commercial computers then in operation. Her knack for programming eventually helped her land a job, and to excel, at IBM.

But something was missing in her life, personally.

Or, as Windsor put it more succinctly, “I suddenly couldn’t take it anymore.”

In the documentary “Edie and Thea: A Very Long Engagement,” she recalled pleading with an old friend to take her “where the lesbians go.” And so Windsor spent one Friday night at Portofino, a restaurant in New York’s Greenwich Village.

“Somebody brought Thea over and introduced her. And we ended up dancing,” she recalled.

“And we immediately just fit,” added Spyer, on the documentary.

Timeline: Same-sex marriage

After reuniting two years later, according to their New York Times’ wedding announcement, their connection proved deep and lasting. In 1967, Spyer proposed marriage with a round diamond pin. A year later, they purchased a house together in Southampton, according to the NYU Alumni Magazine story.

Yet while the gay rights’ movement took off after the 1969 Stonewall Riots, which occurred while Windsor and Spyer were vacationing in Italy, an actual marriage – a legal union – seemed out of the question.

Marriage, at last, and then heartache

Regardless, their love remained strong.

On the documentary, filmed around 2007, Spyer said, “Each one of us, in fact, looks different from how we looked when we met. But if I look at Edie now, she looks exactly the same to me. Exactly the same.”

Windsor had halted her new career as a gay rights activist to help care for her partner, who suffered from multiple sclerosis. And it was after getting a “bad prognosis (that) I had another year to live and that was it” that Spyer proposed again.

“And I said yes,” Windsor recalled. “She said, ‘So do I.’ “

Video shows Spyer being pushed through the airport in her wheelchair. It was from that seat – on May 22, 2007, at Toronto’s Sheraton Gateway Hotel – that she gave her vows to make their marriage official in Canada.

“I, Thea Spyer, choose you, Edith Windsor, to be my lawful, wedded spouse,” she said. “For richer and for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part.”

Married same-sex couple awaits epic high court appeal

Having happily gone four decades without, Windsor soon realized how much the marriage meant to her. It made her and Spyer’s love legitimate and all the more real.

“It’s different because somewhere you’re a hidden person, and suddenly you’re a citizen of the world,” she said in October of 2012.

But what happened as Spyer’s condition worsened, and after her death, proved a stark reminder they were not legally united in their own country. And the fact that New York legalized same-sex marriage in 2011 didn’t mean that Windsor, for example, would suddenly get back the hundreds of thousands of dollars in inheritance tax that she’d given to the government.

That could happen, however, if the Supreme Court upholds the appeals court ruling. That is Windsor’s hope, as is that whether a committed couple is heterosexual or homosexual becomes irrelevant within the next decade.

In the meantime, Windsor said she’s proud to fight for something bigger than herself and the legitimacy of her union with Spyer. She hopes, through her struggle, to help make it so gay teenagers can “fall in love knowing there’s a future,” that children of gay couples won’t feel the need to explain their families, and that homophobia becomes a thing of the past.

“I feel like I’m representing them.”

Couple fights for right to marry"
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/21/group-sues-california-over-new-transgender-bathroom-law/,2013-12-21 00:00:00,[],Group sues California over new transgender bathroom law,"Groups trying to overturn a new California law allowing transgender students to choose public school restrooms and sports teams that correspond with their expressed genders have filed a lawsuit claiming state officials are unfairly refusing to count signatures seeking a referendum.

Sacramento-based Privacy For All Students, a coalition of conservative groups, filed the lawsuit Thursday against the secretary of state and two counties.

It says a courier delivered signatures collected in Tulare ahead of a deadline of Nov. 10, but offices were closed early before the three-day weekend. In Mono County, a courier dropped the signatures in a county mail slot a day before the deadline, but workers did not return to their jobs until the deadline had passed, according to the plaintiffs.

The plaintiffs say the secretary of state's office is refusing to validate the signatures from the two counties.

The secretary of state's office did not immediately return phone calls on Friday seeking comment.

Opponents of the law that goes into effect on Jan. 1 said they have collected enough signatures for an initiative that would repeal it.

Counties, however, were still reviewing the signatures.

The coalition submitted 620,000 signatures to get the initiative on the November 2014 ballot, said Frank Schubert, political strategist handling the signature gathering effort.

To qualify, at least 505,000 valid signatures of registered voters must be verified through a random sampling.

After that, it is likely the state would order a full review before the measure could be placed on a ballot.

California is the first state to pass a law allowing such choices by transgender K-12 students.

One provision gives them the choice of playing on boys or girls sports teams. It also allows them to choose which restroom they use.

Opponents say the law would violate the privacy of the majority of students and some might try to claim to be another gender simply to gain access to bathrooms.

School officials say decisions would be made under careful scrutiny involving parents, counselors, teachers, staff and the student.

The goal of the law is to reduce discrimination against transgender students."

Supreme Court hears arguments in late March in two gay marriage cases

Veterans of George W. Bush White House%2C ex-governors%2C former lawmakers in group

These Republicans follow lead of Ted Olson%2C Bush%27s solicitor general

WASHINGTON — Top Republicans, including veterans of the George W. Bush administration, former members of Congress and ex-governors, are calling on the Supreme Court to support same-sex marriage.

More than 80 prominent leaders will file a friend of the court brief this week in advance of the justices hearing oral arguments in two gay marriage cases. These Republicans are essentially saying gay couples have a constitutional right to marry and want the court to strike down California's Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage.

STORY: Supreme Court to take up gay marriage cases

The signers currently include former governors Jon Huntsman of Utah, Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and William Weld of Massachusetts; former White House chief of staff Ken Mehlman and former national security adviser Stephen Hadley; and retired members of Congress, such as Mary Bono Mack of California and Deborah Pryce of Ohio.

Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman is also on record as backing the legal brief, which is a change of her previous position. When she ran unsuccessfully for California governor in 2010, Whitman supported Proposition 8. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., is the only active member of the House currently listed as supporting the brief.

The friend of the court brief is being organized by the American Foundation for Equal Rights, the advocacy group that is challenging the California ballot measure, which has already been struck down by two lower courts.

The group helped put together the legal team that is challenging Proposition 8, which was headed by former Bush solicitor general Ted Olson and David Boies, best known as the lawyer who handled the 2000 Florida recount challenge for Al Gore.

""The conservative movement toward the freedom to marry is what we like to call the 'Ted Olson effect,'"" said Adam Umhoefer, executive director of the organization. ""We value the support of our conservative colleagues and welcome their voices to the growing majority of Americans who stand for marriage equality.""

The Supreme Court will hear arguments March 26 and March 27 in a pair of same-sex marriage cases. Many briefs have been filed challenging Prop 8, in part because the high court's ruling could have far-reaching impact beyond California on the right of gay men and lesbians to marry.

The other case before the Supreme Court deals with the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman. The case applies to the benefits available to gay couples that are already married."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/opinion/the-white-house-joins-the-fight-on-gay-marriage.html,2013-03-01 00:00:00,[],The White House Joins the Fight on Gay Marriage - The New York Times,"President Obama made good on the promise of his second Inaugural Address on Thursday by joining the fight to overturn California’s ban on same-sex marriage. Since he declared that marriage equality is part of the road “through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall,” we can’t imagine how he could have sat this one out.

The administration’s brief to the Supreme Court was a legally and symbolically important repudiation of Proposition 8, the 2008 voter referendum that amended California’s Constitution to forbid bestowing the title of marriage on a union between two people of the same sex — a right the California Supreme Court had found to be fundamental under the State Constitution.

Like the arguments made by the lawyers for those who seek to overturn Proposition 8, and by a group of prominent Republicans earlier this week, the government’s brief says any law attempting to ban same-sex marriage must be subjected to heightened scrutiny because it singles out a class of Americans, historically subject to discrimination, for unequal treatment.

The brief said California’s civil unions law provides the rights and protections of marriage, so Proposition 8’s denial of the designation of marriage “does not substantially further any important governmental interest.”"

But one person they should make time to listen to is 12-year-old Daniel Martinez-Leffew, a San Francisco boy who was adopted by two gay men.

Daniel recently made this impassioned public video plea to U.S. Supreme Court Justice John G. Roberts, who is himself the father of adopted children.

The 12-year-old explains that while his medical problems made it difficult for prospective parents to embrace him, his two gay fathers happily welcomed him and his infant sister into their home—effectively changing the course of their lives for the better

Transplanted out of long-term foster care and into a permanent home, Daniel has been able to thrive thanks to the love and support of his two fathers. And even at his young age, he's sensitive to the fact that his nontraditional family is worthy of the same legal protections as others. “I know you have a tough decision to make with the gay marriage issue, but my family is just as valuable and worthwhile as any other.”

What's so inspiring about his story is not only that Daniel found a positive ending to his story, but that he's fighting so hard to make sure his dads do as well.

“Within five years, we will bring marriage equality to all 50 states,” Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, pledged to supporters massed on the sidewalk outside the Supreme Court shortly after the court’s decisions Wednesday.

The rulings will bring to 13 the number of states, along with the District of Columbia, allowing gay marriage; together they account for about a third of the country’s population. But among the remaining states are many deeply conservative ones that probably will resist the nationwide shift toward acceptance of same-sex relationships.

Over the next 18 months, gay rights groups plan legislative or ballot campaigns in at least five states -- Illinois, New Jersey, Nevada, Oregon and Hawaii -- aimed at lengthening the list on their side. Same-sex marriage is also before the courts in New Mexico, where the state law is unclear.

Ultimately, however, advocates of same-sex marriage believe that they will have to argue the issue once again before the high court.

“The strategy has always been to secure a critical mass of states and a critical mass of public opinion in favor of marriage equality, and with that climate engage the Supreme Court,” said Evan Wolfson, president of Freedom to Marry and one of the leading strategists for the same-sex marriage movement.

Gay right groups also have begun to lobby the Obama administration to quickly clarify the rules for federal programs to ensure that the maximum number of same-sex couples qualify for federal benefits.

Opponents of same-sex marriage, who had backed national laws such as the Defense of Marriage Act, hope to slow the movement by insisting that the issue now be decided on a state-by-state basis.

“In the U.S., marriage has traditionally been defined by state law, and I believe each state, acting through their elected representatives or the ballot, should decide their own definition of marriage,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who is widely seen as a potential GOP presidential nominee in the next election, said in a statement.

“These types of disagreements should be settled through the democratic process, as the founders intended, not through litigation and court pronouncements.”

For gay rights advocates, the key to success is establishing equal marriage rights for same-sex couples as the norm in the eyes of the American public. Wednesday’s rulings indicate that a majority of the justices sympathize with the legal arguments in favor of same-sex marriage. The more widely public opinion and the law come to accept same-sex unions, the more willing a future Supreme Court will be to adopt those arguments and sweep away the remaining barriers, they believe.

Opponents largely share that assessment. As a result, the two sides probably will battle on a number of fronts.

One early set of skirmishes will center on the hundreds of federal programs that Wednesday’s rulings have opened to same-sex couples married in states where gay marriage is recognized.

As gay rights groups push the administration to ensure that those benefits are available to the greatest extent possible, opponents of same-sex marriage, including some Republican leaders in Congress, already have pushed back. They portray the effort as an attempt to federalize same-sex marriage rights.

Currently, some federal programs recognize marriages based on the law in the state in which a couple lives. Others look to the law in the state in which the marriage was celebrated. As a result, a gay couple who marry legally in California, then retire in Arizona, for example, might keep some federal benefits but lose others.

Leaders of gay rights organizations talked with Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. and other administration officials Wednesday to press their case that all programs should base their decisions on the law of the state in which the marriage was licensed, thereby eliminating the risk that a couple might lose benefits by moving.

Administration officials say they are studying that issue, hoping to avoid what one referred to as “unforced errors” that might prompt further lawsuits over benefits.

Some programs, such as the immigration system, already use the standard that gay rights groups prefer. As a result, gay rights groups say they believe the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will now be able to award lawful permanent residency to same-sex spouses of American citizens regardless of what state the American partner lives in.

“This decision is literally life changing for more than 36,000 families in the U.S. and many more living in exile abroad,” said Rachel B. Tiven, executive director of Immigration Equality, a legal aid and advocacy organization based in New York that pushes for federal immigration benefits for married same-sex couples.

Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said her department planned to issue guidance to immigration officials soon.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel also announced that the Pentagon would move quickly to extend benefits to same-sex couples.

http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2013/03/hillary-clinton-portman-gay-marriage.html,,[],"Hillary Clinton, Portman and gay marriage: What took her so long?","I’m sorry, did I miss something?

Is Hillary Clinton, the Democrats’ presumptive 2016 presidential nominee, just now coming out now in support of gay marriage? How weird.

How is it possible that Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican stalwart who hails from the most conservative part of Ohio, beat her to the punch last week?

The gay marriage issue is just turning this world upside down.

As the U.S. Supreme Court considers whether to overturn California’s law against gay marriage and the federal Defense of Marriage Act, every influential voice matters.

Certainly, the justices are not immune to the pull of history. They undoubtedly know that in the last 10 years, support for legalizing gay marriage has leapt. In the most recent ABC News/Washington Post poll, http://www.langerresearch.com/uploads/1147a5GayMarriage.pdf 58% support it, vs. 37% a decade ago.

President Obama has been out in favor of gay marriage for months, so it’s not as if the issue’s embrace by another high-profile liberal is going to make a difference to the justices. And Hillary can’t even be said to be a leader in her own family; both her husband, Bill, and daughter, Chelsea, are on record supporting gay marriage. Was anyone, anywhere holding his or her breath that Hillary would not support gay marriage?

By contrast, if you want to talk about courage, if you want to know who really put something on the line to support gay marriage, talk about Portman, a man whose anti-gay marriage cred is nothing short of impeccable. He was a cosponsor of the federal Defense of Marriage Act and has long espoused the idea that heterosexual-only marriage is a core value.

You can tick right down through the Republican platform and find virtually nothing with which this man disagrees. His party loyalty is one of the main reasons -- besides being a native of a swing state -- that Mitt Romney came close to choosing him as his running mate last year. This is a man who simply does not color outside the political lines.

Until now.

Two years ago, his oldest child, Will, told his parents, Rob and Jane, that he is gay. And that it was not a choice. In an op-ed for the Columbus Dispatch, Portman said he had decided to support gay marriage because of Will, who is now a freshman at Yale.

“Ronald Reagan said all great change in America begins at the dinner table, and that’s been the case in my family,” wrote Portman. “With the overwhelming majority of young people in support of allowing gay couples to marry, in some respects the issue has become more generational than partisan.'

Portman, a freshman senator who is up for reelection in 2016, is the only Republican in the Senate who supports gay marriage.

Despite surveys showing increasing support in the U.S. for gay marriage, Ohio conservatives have clung to the fact that in 2004, a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage passed in their state with 62% of the vote.

The chairman of the Ohio Republican Party has said publicly the party will stand by Portman. Closer to Portman’s home in Cincinnati, Hamilton County GOP Chairman Alex Triantafilou said many younger Republicans are excited, but “a very vocal group of strong social conservatives” has made its displeasure known.

“Rob is so beloved here and so respected that he’s getting a lot of personal support,” said Triantafilou. “I don’t know that he will lead a revolution on this topic right away, though.”

Indeed. “It’s gonna cost him his seat,” predicted Phil Burress, president of Citizens for Community Values, a conservative evangelical group. Burress told me Monday that Portman, a good friend for decades, called him to share his change of heart about gay marriage the night before he went public.

Portman started off by saying he had “some bad news” and sounded depressed, said Burress, who “nearly dropped the phone” when Portman told him the reason for his call."

After all, 73% of Americans still identify as Christian, according to a 2012 Pew Forum Study. So the fact that many churchgoers have changed their views about gay civil rights in recent years is one of the major under-reported reasons why same-sex marriage is now legal in nine states. It is also one of the reasons that the constitutional challenge to Proposition 8, which took away gay Californians’ right to marry, may get a hearing in the Supreme Court this term (an announcement is expected on Monday).

According to the Pew Forum, a majority of mainline Protestants and Roman Catholics now favor legalizing same-sex marriage. So when our more conservative Christian kin claim that gay marriage is against God and against the Bible, we beg to differ. And since Christians are a “people of the Word,” we look to the Bible to justify our thinking. That’s essential to Christianity, although all too often we get it wrong, at least at first.

In various eras, those who claimed to follow Christ used specific Bible passages to argue that the Inquisition was God’s will, the Crusades were a good idea, slavery was legitimate, women should not be allowed to own property or have the right to vote, disabled people must have sinned to deserve their disabilities and God hated Jews.

TIMELINE: Gay marriage chronology

Although each of these beliefs was based on the literal words of a particular Bible passage, all of them were in opposition to the message and life of Jesus and the prophets. So when Christians eventually rejected these positions, they returned to the Scriptures, in their original form, to reconsider the text.

This time around, it’s the same process. Most New Testament Greek scholars now point out that there are only three passages that deal with homosexuality in the New Testament — Romans 1:23-27, 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 and 1 Timothy 1:9-10 — and those passages don’t deal with homosexuality as we define it today but rather with temple prostitution and other abuses. Because of dated (and often loved) translations, many versions of the Bible imply otherwise.

Advertisement

As for the Old Testament, some Christians cite Leviticus 20:13, which commands death for men who lie with men. But most of us acknowledge that if we took all of the Old Testament’s orders literally, at least half of us wouldn’t make it to age 40, because of commands to kill those who commit adultery (Leviticus 20:10), kill rebellious sons who disobey their parents (Deuteronomy 21:18-21), kill anyone who works on the Sabbath (Exodus 31:15) and the like.

Jesus never addressed the subject of homosexuality, other than what can be inferred from his example of loving and accepting everyone, especially the oppressed and those whom the religious establishment considered unclean.

Advertisement

Some Christians will disagree, pointing out that Jesus said marriage was between a man and a woman. What they are referring to is Mark 10:2-12, where Jesus protested the practice of men getting rid of inconvenient wives by simply handing them a certificate of divorce.

In this passage Jesus is objecting to a system that excessively penalized women, often causing financial devastation, loss of children and other unjust consequences. He was not saying anything about same-sex marriage, which didn’t exist at the time.

Advertisement

Jesus never spoke against homosexuality, but he did speak very clearly against divorce. Yet the majority of churches today — including those who view same-sex marriage as a sin — not only accept divorced members but also allow them to be church leaders. Why? Because marriage and divorce were different institutions in the time of Christ, and there are valid reasons for contemporary cultures to allow divorce in certain cases.

If you surmise that in 30 AD two men or two women marrying would have been anathema had it even been under consideration, you’re probably right. But why not make the same cultural allowances for gay couples 2,000 years later that Christian churches have long made for the divorced (as well as women, the disabled, and others who faced discrimination back then)?

Literalism, says LGBT activist and Episcopal priest Susan Russell, leads to using Bible passages as weapons. “Instead of taking the Bible literally,” she says, “we should take it seriously, with deep faithfulness to the Old and New Testaments’ core values of compassion, justice and peace.”

An ever-growing number of Christian clergy and lay people now believe that rejecting gay civil rights because of a literal adherence to certain verses directly contradicts these themes. They point out how these views are hurting all of the church, especially its most vulnerable members: young gay people who are convinced that their very essence is sinful. Furthermore, they can no longer support unjust laws that penalize committed same-sex couples and their families.

As more and more church members thoughtfully and prayerfully confront the evidence, it will only be a matter of time before the majority of Christians of all stripes become allies rather than antagonists for justice and equal rights for gay people. Then we will come out on the right side of history once again.

http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/05/25/1094817/-Remembering-LGBT-History-How-World-War-II-Changed-Gay-and-Lesbian-Life-in-America,2012-05-25 00:00:00,"['This Content Is Not Subject To Review Daily Kos Staff Prior To Publication.', 'Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags']",Remembering LGBT History: How World War II Changed Gay and Lesbian Life in America,"Long before the signing of DADT in 1993, homosexual activity was explicitly targeted in the United States military. As far back as the Revolutionary War, sodomy was forbidden in the military and, in many instances, punished harshly. After World War I, when homosexuality was just trickling down into public discourse from medical professionals who had defined the homosexual as a ""sexual invert,"" the military began to make efforts to exclude gays and lesbians from service. This continued throughout the 1930s.

Then, Pearl Harbor happened and the United States went to war. Suddenly, excluding gays and lesbians from military service wasn't as important. After all, every warm body was needed to win the war. Women were allowed to enlist in the Women's Army Corps (WAC), and every patriotic American was expected to join in the war effort in some way. This isn't to say that gays and lesbians were well-treated or allowed to be open in the military. But, from 1939 to 1945, they were policed much less and, in many cases, allowed to flourish within the confines of the military.

World War II was quite unusual in the way that it so fundamentally changed American society. Over fifteen million Americans moved to urban centers to work in defense jobs, and just about as many men were drafted. Women entered the job market en masse. African Americans moved to the North. Ethnic Mexicans were shipped into California to replace the ""relocated"" Japanese-Americans. Normalcy was turned on its head as just about every facet of life, from family structure to gender roles, changed. The war also had quite an effect on American gay life, even if we don't talk about that as much when we discuss World War II.

Like many other Americans, gays and lesbians flocked to the military. Some simply wanted to serve their country in its time of need. Some lesbians saw WAC life as a way to meet and live with other lesbians. Some joined the military not realizing they were gay or lesbian until they were exposed to others of their kind. Whatever their individual reasons, many gays and lesbians rushed to enlist after Pearl Harbor. As I said above, policing of gays and lesbians did not end during World War II, and this extended to the recruitment process. Medical professionals were ""trained"" to spot homosexuals based on physical characteristics, behavior, and vocabulary. The interview screening process that each man and woman entering the military had to go through took all of three minutes, during which time homosexuality was supposed to be spotted by the interviewer. As you can imagine, not many were ""spotted."" Bob Ruffing, a gay man who enlisted in the navy, recalls:



I walked into this office, and there was this man who was a screaming belle--lots of gold braid but he was a queen if ever I saw one. And he asked me the standard questions, ending up with, ""Did you ever have any homosexual experiences?"" Well, I looked him right in the eye and said, ""No."" And he looked right back and said, ""That's good."" Both of us lying through our teeth!

Sometimes [a relationship] can become an intimacy that may eventually take some form of sexual expression. It may appear that, almost spontaneously, such a relationship has sprung up between two women, neither of whom is a confirmed active homosexual.

...women having the appearance of perverts have been observed at Fort Oglethorpe;...these women affect mannish appearance by haircut, by the manner of wearing the clothing, by posture, by stride, by seeking ""to date"" other girls such as a man would, and when with other girls pay all the bills...These addicts have certain signals by which they recognize each other...The signal is said to be a whistle of the ""Hawaiian War Chant.""...Expressions common between them are said to include, ""We're going to have a gay time tonight""; ""Are you in the mood?"" and ""Messing around.""

Getting in was easy. And the reality was that, once in, it was not that easy to be discharged for homosexual activity, especially in the WAC. WAC policy was made clear in a secret lecture given in 1943 which warned against ""indulging in witch hunting or speculation."" The lecture also acknowledged:This policy became all the more clear in an incident that took place in 1944. After a complaint from the mother of a WAC recruit, the Inspector General's office sent a team to investigate. Witnesses testified:Yet, despite this ""damning"" evidence, the team concluded that no homosexual ""addicts"" existed in the WAC, and an effort was made to retain all of these women. The need for bodies trumped the need for purity.

Gay men had a slightly less easier time in the military. If a man was caught having sex with another man, it was treated as a very serious crime. The guilty could be sent to the brigs, where guards enjoyed beating gay prisoners. They also faced discharge (covered in more detail below).

In spite of this, gay male culture, in many ways, flourished in the military. Drag shows were quite popular during the war, and many men gladly dressed up in women's clothing to put on a good show for their comrades. Homoerotic behavior was prevalent in the barracks. One wartime psychiatric study of barracks life noted:



In the barracks, usually when the men are getting undressed...various persons will ""kiddingly"" assume the role of overt homosexual. One soldier, returning from the shower in the nude, will be greeted with catcalls, salacious whistling, comments like ""Hey Joe! You shouldn't go around like that--you don't know what that does to me!"" Joe will respond by wriggling his hips in feminine fashion after coyly draping a towel around himself...Others act the part of active solicitors for sexual favors. ""How much do you want for sleeping with me tonight?""; ""Come into my bed and I'll give you the time of your life.""

In addition to the blatant homoeroticism in barracks life, there were ample opportunities for gay men to meet other gay men and form queer social networks and even romantic and sexual relationships. Such networks were often referred to as the ""fruit corner"" or the ""fruit salad."" As derogatory as these terms seem, there was not much discrimination perpetrated against gay soldiers by their fellow comrades. Long before DADT, it was very much a ""don't ask, don't tell"" environment. If you were gay and in a sexual relationship, nothing could be proven unless you were caught.

Not to mention, there were numerous opportunities for gay men to explore the queer nightlife on weekend passes and furloughs in American urban centers. Gay servicemen could be found in gay bars, cruising parks, and hooking up with queer civilians. Despite the rhetorically anti-gay policies of the military, there were many ways for gay soldiers to fly under the radar during World War II.

Of course, not everybody was so fortunate. Many gays and lesbians were discharged for homosexual activity. These were called ""blue discharges""--a sort of middle ground between honorable and dishonorable, since homosexuality was considered a psychiatric condition. But the blue discharges ruined many lives. They were reserved for ""undesirable"" men and women and were often marked ""HS"" or some other code for homosexual. This would effectively disqualify the veteran from receiving any GI rights or benefits, and it barred many discharged soldiers from getting civilian jobs. In addition, during the discharge proceedings, accused gays and lesbians were often locked away in military psychiatric wards, where psychiatrists performed experiments on them to develop new techniques for identifying other gays and lesbians. One such ""discovery"" was the ""Gag Reflex Test,"" which was said to identify a gay man by sticking a tongue depressor down his throat. If his gag reflex did not kick in, the study concluded, it was because he had performed fellatio so many times that the reflex would no longer work. These are the kinds of sick studies the government paid for to keep as many gays and lesbians out of the military as possible.

After World War II ended, life returned to ""normal"" in many ways. Women were forced from the job market in great numbers and expected to return to being housewives. Men returned to civilian jobs. And gay and lesbian witch hunts resumed in the military, in greater force than ever. Without the urgent need for bodies, authorities made every effort to weed out as many homosexuals as possible. At a WAC unit in Tokyo, 500 women were discharged at once. Gay men stationed in Europe were loaded onto ""queer"" ships and sent home with dishonorable discharges. The anti-gay backlash after the war was swift and vicious.

This backlash, of course, extended to the civilian world. State legislatures cracked down on homosexuality. Congress held hearings on gays and lesbians in the government, leading to the purge known as the Lavender Scare. Gay and lesbian bars were placed under surveillance. Anti-gay crusades were launched in towns and cities across the United States. The semi-tolerance of the World War II years was short-lived indeed.

In spite of this, World War II and the ensuing anti-gay backlash had a profound impact on gay and lesbian life in America. Rural gay men and lesbians were able to leave their small towns and experience a gay and lesbian culture they never knew existed. Military life enabled many men and women to accept themselves as gay and lesbian and to devote their post-war lives to working for their rights. Among the first gay rights activists in twentieth-century America were those affected by the blue discharges. Many gay and lesbian veterans--discharged for homosexual activity or not--came out completely. Some participated in homophile organizations such as the Mattachine Society and the Daughters of Bilitis. In short, the war and its semi-tolerance--as well as its more repressive side--helped solidify gay and lesbian identity. World War II spawned many gay and lesbian activists, allowed many men and women to live openly about their sexuality, and laid the groundwork for the homophile movement. It is not an exaggeration to say that the war helped lay the foundation for Stonewall and the resulting gay liberation movement. We gays and lesbians have much to owe to World War II.

The material in this diary was taken from two sources, both written by gay historian Allan Bérubé. His chapter in the edited collection Hidden from History: Reclaiming the Gay and Lesbian Past entitled ""Marching to a Different Drummer: Lesbian and Gay GIs in World War II"" is a useful brief overview of the subject. For a more detailed account, I wholeheartedly recommend his incredible book Coming Out Under Fire: The History of Gay Men and Women in World War II. If you're interested in this subject, you should definitely read this book, as there is so much material that I was not able to adequately cover in this short diary."

When Barack Obama was running for President in 2008, I thought he was serious about protecting the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community from workplace discrimination. He made two key promises — that he would sign an executive order providing workplace protections by federal contractors, and that he would help pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), ending workplace discrimination by all employers. I contributed to the campaign, expecting that if elected, he would keep his word to fight for our community.

Five years later, I’m still waiting. Despite having this executive order sitting on his desk, the president has yet to pick up his pen. While many employers have added nondiscrimination policies on their own, prominent holdouts such as Exxon Mobil set a damaging, dangerous precedent. Millions of LGBT Americans continue to experience the enormous pain of living and working in the closet, not allowed to acknowledge who we are and who we love.

As a gray-haired, 56-year-old lesbian, I don’t have time to wait another generation for equality — it’s been almost 40 years since similar legislation to ENDA was first introduced in Congress. And being polite hasn’t gotten us any closer to it becoming a reality.

When I attended a Democratic National Committee (DNC) fundraiser a few days ago, I brought this sense of urgency. When I blurted out my comments during the first lady’s speech, it was a spontaneous reaction to her saying, “Right now, today, we have an obligation to stand up for those kids.” I needed to speak up for LGBT youth, who make up 40 percent of homeless youth — kicked out onto the street because parents and workplaces won’t accept them for who they are — and for LGBT parents, whose lack of workplace protections imperils their children’s futures.

Michelle Obama is only the latest political figure to face an impassioned heckler. From Reagan to Romney, and Clinton to Christie we look at how politicians have handled the uninvited interlocutors. (The Fold/The Washington Post)

Some have said that the first lady wasn’t a proper target because she is not an elected official. However, time and again, the first lady has come to our community and asked us to “max out” on our contributions to the DNC. In fact, she had just made the same request of several hundred LGBT attendees, days after Senate Democrats had refused to include same-sex binational couples in their immigration reform bill. Despite the Democratic Party happily cashing LGBT checks, I have not seen the Obama administration “max out” on the myriad ways that the government could protect the LGBT community.

For most of my life, I have been in one closet or another, as my “coming out” process took decades. I remained in the work closet the longest, as a public servant doing environmental and consumer protection work. In the mid-90s, in the final round of interviews for a position I was offered and accepted, I was asked why I was moving to the area. I lied and responded that I was moving to help take care of a “family member.” The interviewer seemed satisfied with the response, not wanting to pry further and assuming it was an elderly parent. In truth, it was my partner of seven years — who I felt I had to hide and whose humanity I felt ashamed to acknowledge.

After years of these lonely, isolating and dehumanizing experiences, I’ve only recently been able to find the strength to advocate for myself and millions of others.

It is in small moments each day that LGBT Americans have to make choices about whether to acknowledge the truth of our own lives or hide ourselves away. We make choices about displaying family photos on a desk, or eating lunch alone to avoid questions about weekend plans, or ducking away from co-workers while out at dinner with friends. And it is in these moments that low-income LGBT Americans must choose between their humanity and a paycheck — knowing that making ends meet often means slowly chipping away at one’s identity.

Mrs. Obama has accomplished extraordinary things and is inarguably the conscience of the White House. She understands injustice at a deep level, and it was that political conscience I was hoping to stir at this week’s fundraiser. Some have said it was disrespectful for a white woman to interrupt an African American woman, or for an activist to interrupt the first lady. All I can say is that in that moment, I could no longer remain silent while standing in front of one of our country’s most powerful political figures. I spoke up for the millions of LGBT Americans who have to make small and excruciating choices each day about the extent to which they are able to live safe and honest lives.

My hope is that the first lady sees me as just one of millions who are desperate to participate fully in the American dream — a dream she is helping to build for millions across this country. After being locked out of that dream for so long, I hope President Obama considers the desperation we all feel for equality and signs this executive order."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/athletics/23722954,,[],Yelena Isinbayeva says anti-gay remarks were 'misunderstood',"Russian athlete Yelena Isinbayeva says she may have been ""misunderstood"" over comments condemning homosexuality and insists she is against discrimination.

On Thursday, the 31-year-old world pole vault champion backed new anti-gay laws brought in by her country.

But in a statement on Friday, she said: ""English is not my first language and I think I may have been misunderstood.

quote What I wanted to say was that people should respect the laws of other countries, particularly when they are guests Yelena Isinbayeva

""I am opposed to any discrimination against gay people on the grounds of their sexuality.""

Isinbayeva's initial comments attracted widespread criticism, with British Commonwealth Games heptathlon gold medallist Louise Hazel saying Isinbayeva's role as a Youth Olympics ambassador should be reviewed.

A sporting icon in Russia who has set 28 world records, Isinbayeva was appointed in the role in 2010 by International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Jacques Rogge.

She added on Friday: ""What I wanted to say was that people should respect the laws of other countries, particularly when they are guests,"" in a statement released via athletics' world governing body the IAAF.

Russia's president Vladimir Putin signed a law in June making it illegal to give under-18s information about homosexuality.

The move has been widely condemned and has led to calls for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi - where Isinbayeva will be the mayor of the main athletes' village.

Pundits critical of Isinbayeva comments

In response, earlier this week, United States runner Nick Symmonds dedicated his world 800m silver medal to his gay and lesbian friends, while Swedish high jumper Emma Green-Tregaro painted her fingernails in the colours of the rainbow flag.

Speaking in English at a news conference on Thursday, Isinbayeva had said of Green-Tregaro's actions: ""It's disrespectful to our country, disrespectful to our citizens because we are Russians.

""Maybe we are different than European people and people from different lands. We have our law which everyone has to respect. When we go to different countries, we try to follow their rules.

quote We can only reiterate that the Olympic Games should be open to all, free of discrimination The International Olympic Committee

""We are not trying to set our rules over there. We are just trying to be respectful.

""We consider ourselves, like normal, standard people, we just live boys with women, girls with boys. It comes from the history.

""I hope the problem won't ruin our Olympic Games in Sochi.""

The IOC said in a statement: ""Clearly English is not her mother tongue and she has now clarified that she was misunderstood and that she is 'opposed to any kind of discrimination against gay people'.

""We can only reiterate that the Olympic Games should be open to all, free of discrimination, and that applies to spectators, officials, media and of course athletes.""

The IAAF's secretary general, Essar Gabriel, welcomed Yelena Isinbayeva's latest statement.

""I think Yelena is very genuine about this,"" he told the BBC. ""I know Yelena very well myself, it is correct her English and her understanding of English is not the best and it's great that she sought to explain exactly what she meant.

""She is somebody who has a great heart, and if she has a lack of English language which we know of she certainly should be careful. When I saw them [Thursday's comments] I thought that doesn't respond to the character and what we know of Yelena."""

America's right place is at the vanguard of the quest for freedom and equality. The country was founded on that principle, as a nation whose very identity is built on equal rights and true freedom for its citizens. Wednesday's twin decisions by the Supreme Court in favor of gay equality allowed the country to move closer to its founding ideals.

That is not just good news for gay Americans, for their families and for the United States. It is excellent news for the cause of freedom and equality around the globe, and not just for gay people.

What happens in the U.S. matters. It influences views everywhere. That's why when the high court ruled that the federal law perversely named the ""Defense of Marriage Act"" or DOMA is unconstitutional and allowed the anti-gay marriage Proposition 8 in California to be struck down, the news rippled to all corners of the world.

You can be sure the news brought smiles to faces in the Middle East, in Africa and elsewhere.

The U.S. is hardly the first country to have laws and court rulings in favor of equality for gays. In fact, America has fallen far behind in what is now a worldwide movement -- and there is a very long way to go before gays in America can claim they are treated equally, if only by the law.

The Netherlands was the first country to fully legalize gay marriage. It did it without much fanfare in 2000. Since then, more than a dozen countries have followed suit. Gay couples have marriage equality in all corners of the world, not just in liberal Scandinavian nations such as Denmark and Norway, but also in Latin America -- in Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay -- and as far away as South Africa and New Zealand.

Most of the world, however, is not as open to equality. As recently as last year, Iran executed young men by public hanging. It is one of several countries where homosexuality is punishable by death. In many other places, the punishment is prison. In many more, there are intense legal and social restrictions.

In Uganda, the names and addresses of gay activists have been published in the local media, triggering violent attacks, and a pending law would impose life imprisonment for gays and up to three years for anyone who knows and fails to report homosexuals. American evangelists have promoted the crackdown.

In Russia, just this month the Russian parliament passed a law banning ""propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations."" Gay rights demonstrators have been brutally beaten in what has almost become a ritual in Russia and elsewhere.

Despite intense and often well-founded criticism of the United States and complaints that its rhetoric doesn't match its behavior, America wields enormous social, cultural and political sway around the planet.

The court ruling on same sex marriage will be read carefully by some jurists in some countries. Its words may find their way to other rulings.

Other people will read just a few key words.

The DOMA decision by Justice Anthony Kennedy centered on one of the most fundamental concepts of democracy: the notion of equal protection. The ruling articulates an idea that will resonate in the many nations struggling with internal divisions and just learning the meaning of democracy and freedom. Kennedy spelled it out. A government cannot simply deny equality; it cannot treat one group of people differently without a legitimate purpose.

Most people will only see a headline. They will see pictures of celebrations in the United States. They will hear that in the United States gay couples can now marry. That is not quite correct. In most U.S. states same-sex couples cannot marry, although some experts believe the language of the Kennedy decision provides the arguments that will soon make that possible.

Kennedy, the court, the activists and lawyers who brought these decisions may not have thought much about the rest of the world when working on this case. But the whole world was indeed watching.

The whole world started watching a long time ago. More than 300 years ago, Thomas Jefferson appealed to an international audience when he wrote the Declaration of Independence. In the very first paragraph he said ""respect to the opinions of mankind"" was the reason why Americans had to spell out their decision to break free from the British.

""We hold these truths to be self-evident,"" he explained ""that all men are created equal."" And he added that government is created for the purpose of securing unalienable rights, including ""Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.""

That is the essence of America, and it is the reason why the country has exerted such a powerful appeal to those seeking freedom over the centuries.

The U.S. has very plainly strayed on many occasions from that path it so highly charted for itself. But the country has also shown a remarkable ability to correct course because its people have never become so jaded as to forget those founding ideals.

One reason America has succeeded for centuries in staying at the forefront of history is that history, as Georg Hegel said, is the unfolding of an awareness of freedom. A country that stands on the side of freedom and equality is inevitably a country on the right side of history.

With the two Supreme Court rulings, the U.S. edges closer to the vanguard. That's good for America, and it's a very good thing for the world.

That Depends,"By most measures, it's never been a better time to be gay. But all the encouraging steps toward a more accepting America may not mean much when you're called ""faggot"", and slammed into a locker.

Polling shows that America has never been on better terms with sexual diversity -- from equal economic rights to gay marriage to the belief that gay issues will one day be non-issues. In younger demographics, we're already there. A recent Gallup-USA Today poll showed that among those 18 to 29, 73 percent are fine with same-sex marriage.

The same poll showed that people who identify as gay, lesbian or transgender, are more optimistic than ever. Three out of four said they were generally out with others, and nine in ten said their communities have become more accepting.

The media's LGBT portrayal has gone from invisible to mainstream. Gay couple Cam and Mitchell are the affectionately hilarious heart of TV's Modern Family. Neil Patrick Harris is an openly gay man, who plays a ladies' man, for an audience that doesn't care. How I Met Your Mother was just renewed for a ninth season.

The last election deepened the twilight of the day when gay marriage (or gay anything) could bring out the conservative electorate. On gay issues, the religious right finds itself a drum line in search of a lost parade.

But does tolerance trickle down? What does statistical and prime-time acceptance mean in the unforgiving halls of an average junior high?

Journalist and activist Dan Savage -- whose It Gets Better LGBT suicide prevention project has literally saved lives -- calls these days of dawning sexual enlightenment ""the best of times and the worst of times.""

For those with accepting families, progressive communities, and determined school support, LGBT life -- indeed -- has never been better. For others, it can actually be tougher than the days of closeted anonymity. Seeing validation and acceptance in the media, while experiencing rejection and bullying in life can be especially isolating. If the world is OK with being gay; why isn't it OK with me?

Both straight and gay students say being called ""gay"" is the single worst form of harassment. Gay students hear anti-gay slurs as often as 26 times a day. LGBT students are three times as likely as non-LGBT students to say they don't feel safe at school. Some 90 percent of them report being harassed or assaulted in the past year.

School days can be harrowing for anyone who is different: too short, too heavy, too skinny, too shy, too anything that puts them in the sights of the predators inevitably drawn to the social stragglers. Multiply that by the pain experienced by a child whose difference - real or perceived -- crosses into the perilous territory of sexual identity, and different can take on life-altering dimensions.

There is a clear connection between childhood bullying and self-esteem. The consequences are measured in depression, self-loathing (maybe they're right about me), anger, hopelessness and -- tragically -- suicide. Although factors other than sexuality are certainly involved, LGBT students are four times more likely than hetero students to take their own lives.

True, the worst of the harassment tends to be a point in time. A seven year study of U.K. teens, by educational psychology professor Joseph Robinson, University of Illinois, Urbana- Champagne, published in the current issue of Pediatrics, reports that LGBT bullying goes down with age. More than 50 percent of gay and bisexual boys were bullied at ages 13-14, versus only 6 percent at ages 18-20. That implies that bullies grow out of it, or that older youth can simply avoid them. Probably both.

The vulnerable years may be few. But in those years: What cues are delivered? What life lessons are taught? What beliefs are shaped about personal value and place in the world?

Yes, things are getting better. But the emotional wilds of an average middle, junior and even high school are never going to be as welcoming as polls and sitcom plot lines would have us believe. It's a mistake to confuse progress with solution. Bullying is real, it leaves scars, and we still have a long way to go.

(CNN) —

Lawyers for groups opposed to same-sex marriage in California petitioned to reverse a federal appeals court order that OK’d the resumption of such unions – doing so a day after that ruling.

Attorneys applied Saturday to the U.S. Supreme Court for “an immediate order vacating” a decision Friday by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, according to copies of the document from ProtectMarriage.com and the Alliance Defending Freedom. That appeals court Friday lifted a previous injunction on same-sex marriages in California, “effective immediately.”

“Without the immediate relief requested by this Application, the Ninth Circuit will circumvent the proper rules and procedures established by this Court,” the application says.

Those on the other side of the debate, meanwhile, think the appeals court acted appropriately.

“The Ninth Circuit had broad discretion as to whether to stay the injunction pending appeal,” said Manny Rivera, a spokesman for the American Foundation for Equal Rights. “Now that the Supreme Court has decided that the injunction against Proposition 8 must stand, it was entirely appropriate for the Ninth Circuit to dissolve its stay of that injunction.”

California’s Supreme Court struck down the state’s ban on same-sex marriage in May 2008, ruling that the state’s constitution gives “this basic civil right to (marry to) all Californians, whether gay or heterosexual, and to same-sex couples as well as to opposite-sex couples.”

But months later, 52% of voters backed Proposition 8 to once again restrict marriages so that they can only be between a man and a woman.

The measure put gay and lesbian marriages on hold, though lawsuits followed.

State officials declined to stand behind Proposition 8 – and, thus, its prohibition on gay marriage – though private parties did step in and offer to do so.

A federal appeals court later ruled that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional, though it still issued a stay on same-sex marriages until the U.S. Supreme Court could weigh in.

That happened in a 5-4 decision Wednesday, when the high court dismissed an appeal of that federal court ruling on jurisdictional grounds. That meant Friday’s news – the resumption of same-sex marriages in California – was expected, even though it wasn’t known when it would happen.

Supreme Court cases rest of citizens who sued, made history

ProtectMarriage.com and Alliance Defending Freedom say it shouldn’t have happened then, at the least.

In their emergency application, affiliated lawyers claimed the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals “lacked jurisdiction to issue its order purporting to dissolve the stay.” They reasoned that this appeals court wasn’t authorized to weigh in until the Supreme Court “sends a certified copy of the judgment to the Ninth Circuit.”

Among other arguments, the application also stated that “permitting the Ninth Circuit to prematurely dissolve its stay order would effectively deprive petitioners of a meaningful opportunity to exercise their right to petition for rehearing.”

Such petitions for the Supreme Court to reconsider a case must be filed within 25 days after a ruling has been made.

It’s unclear if and/or when the high court might consider this request. Justices recently began a recess after issuing a number of pivotal rulings last week.

And there’s no immediate indication it will have any impact on same-sex weddings taking place around California. Gov. Jerry Brown issued a directive on Friday telling authorities in “58 California counties that same-sex marriage is now legal in California and that marriage licenses must be issued to same-sex couples immediately.”

Attorney General Kamala Harris, in fact, performed one of the first such unions – between Kristin Perry and Sandra Stier, who were one of the couples who sued to stop a voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage from taking effect – at San Francisco’s City Hall.

Process begins to allow federal benefits for same-sex spouses

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/23/ohio-gay-marriage-ban-rejected-in-narrow-ruling/,2013-12-23 00:00:00,[],Ohio gay marriage ban rejected in narrow ruling,"A federal judge Monday ordered Ohio authorities to recognize gay marriages on death certificates, saying the state's ban on such unions is unconstitutional and that states cannot discriminate against same-sex couples simply because some voters don't like homosexuality.

Although Judge Timothy Black's ruling applies only to death certificates, his statements about Ohio's gay-marriage ban are sweeping, unequivocal, and are expected to incite further litigation challenging the law. Ohio's attorney general said the state will appeal.

Black cited the Supreme Court's June decision striking down part of a federal anti-gay marriage law, saying that the lower courts are now tasked with applying that ruling.

""And the question presented is whether a state can do what the federal government cannot — i.e., discriminate against same-sex couples ... simply because the majority of the voters don't like homosexuality (or at least didn't in 2004),"" Black said in reference to the year Ohio's gay marriage ban passed. ""Under the Constitution of the United States, the answer is no.""

Eighteen states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex weddings, up from six before the Supreme Court decision.

Black wrote that ""once you get married lawfully in one state, another state cannot summarily take your marriage away,"" saying the right to remain married is recognized as a fundamental liberty in the U.S. Constitution.

""When a state effectively terminates the marriage of a same-sex couple married in another jurisdiction, it intrudes into the realm of private marital, family, and intimate relations specifically protected by the Supreme Court,"" he wrote.

Black referenced Ohio's historical practice of recognizing other out-of-state marriages even though they can't legally be performed in Ohio, such as those involving cousins or minors.

Black's decision stems from a lawsuit in July by two gay Ohio men whose spouses recently died and wanted to be recognized on their death certificates as married. The two couples got married over the summer in states that allow same-sex marriage.

Black said ""there is absolutely no evidence that the state of Ohio or its citizens will be harmed"" by his ruling but that without it, the harm would be severe for two men who filed the lawsuit because it would strip them of the dignity and recognition given to opposite-sex couples.

Black ordered the state not only to recognize the marriages of the two men who filed the lawsuit on their respective spouses' death certificate but also to communicate his orders to anyone in the state involved in completing death certificates.

Attorney General Mike DeWine said the state will take its case to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, also based in Cincinnati. He called Monday's decision ""not a huge surprise,"" given earlier rulings Black made in the case.

""Our job is to defend the Ohio Constitution and state statutes ... and that's what we intend to do,"" DeWine said.

Bridget Coontz, the attorney who argued on behalf of the state, said Wednesday in court that in the Supreme Court's historic June decision, the justices also found that states have the right to decide for themselves whether to recognize gay marriage, and Ohio voters decided not to in 2004.

""Ohio doesn't want Delaware or Maryland to define who is married under Ohio law,"" she said. ""To allow that to happen would allow one state to set the marriage policy for all others.""

Civil rights attorney Al Gerhardstein argued to Black that the case was ""about love surviving death"" and said that the state had no right to recognize certain out-of-state marriages and not others.

Black sided with Gerhardstein, saying that constitutional rights trump Ohio's gay marriage ban, questioning whether it was passed for a legitimate state interest ""other than simply maintaining a 'traditional' definition of marriage.""

He quoted then-Gov. Robert Taft who said in 2004 that the law was intended ""to reaffirm existing Ohio law with respect to our most basic, rooted, and time-honored institution: marriage between a man and a woman.""

Black wrote that ""the fact that a form of discrimination has been 'traditional' is a reason to be more skeptical of its rationality.""

""No hypothetical justification can overcome the clear primary purpose and practical effect of the marriage bans ... to disparage and demean the dignity of same-sex couples in the eyes of the state and the wider community,"" Black wrote."

At the time Atty. Gen. Eric Holder, who had previously defended the law, said the Justice Department determined that DOMA was no longer constitutional.

Holder today called the Supreme Court’s ruling on DOMA “an enormous triumph for equal protection under the law for all Americans.”

Holder said in a statement that the Department of Justice would work “expeditiously” to implement the court’s decision.

“Despite this momentous victory, our nation’s journey – towards equality, opportunity and justice for everyone in this country – is far from over,” Holder said. “ Important, life-changing work remains before us.

12:20 p.m.: Celebrities took to Twitter today to express their satisfaction with two Supreme Court decisions on gay marriage. Many of Hollywood’s elite have supported marriage equality for years, helping to raise money and awareness for the cause as they promote their work.

Neil Patrick Harris supported marriage equality and tweeted soon after the Supreme Court released its decision.

“Huzzah! Christmas comes six months early this year! (Less one day…),” Harris said.

“Prop 8 is over, and so is DOMA,” she tweeted. “Congratulations everyone. And I mean everyone.”

Perhaps actress Kristen Bell’s reaction took things the farthest. Bell and her fiance, Dax Shepard, both advocates for marriage equality, formally announced their engagement following the decisions.

Bell proposed to her husband over Twitter: ”.@daxshepard1 will you marry me? Xo #marriageequality #loveislove,” she wrote to Shepard.

11:32 a.m.: More than 16 years after he signed the Defense of Marriage Act, former President Bill Clinton completed his about face on Wednesday, applauding the Supreme Court’s decision to strike it down.

As he campaigned for reelection in 1996, Clinton signed DOMA, which defined marriage as between a man and a woman under federal law.

The former president has gradually retreated from his action in the years since he signed the bill into law. And finally this month, Clinton disowned the DOMA altogether and urged the Supreme Court to overturn it.

In a joint statement issued with his wife Hilary Clinton on Wednesday, the former President said that the court’s decision “recognized that discrimination towards any group holds us all back in our efforts to form a more perfect union.

“We are also encouraged that marriage equality may soon return to California,” the Clintons said.

11:05 a.m.: Religious leaders, drawing on their faith traditions and beliefs, are commenting on the U.S. Supreme Court’s same-sex marriage rulings:

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in a statement, said that it was “irrevocably committed to strengthening traditional marriage between a man and a woman.”

“By ruling that supporters of Proposition 8 lacked standing to bring this case to court, the Supreme Court has highlighted troubling questions about how our democratic and judicial system operates,” said the church, which heavily backed the Proposition 8 ballot measure that banned same-sex marriage in California. “Many Californians will wonder if there is something fundamentally wrong when their government will not defend or protect a popular vote that reflects the views of a majority of their citizens.“

Catholic Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York and Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone of San Francisco, in a joint statement, called Wednesday “a tragic day for marriage and our nation.”

“The Court got it wrong,” the pair’s statement said. “The federal government ought to respect the truth that marriage is the union of one man and one woman, even where states fail to do so.”

Advertisement

The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, in its own statement, said its belief in marriage between one man and one woman was “unalterable” but bowed to the court’s ruling, stating that “Judaism teaches respect for others and we condemn discrimination against individuals.”

“We do not expect that secular law will always align with our viewpoint,” the union said. “Ultimately, decisions on social policy remain with the democratic process, and today the process has spoken and we accord the process and its result the utmost respect.”

The Rev. J. Bennett Guess, executive minister of the United Church of Christ’s Local Church Ministries, applauded the decisions outright.

“This is a great day for marriage equality, for all couples, gay or straight, because the Supreme Court has underscored the central point that marriage is ultimately about deep commitment between two people who love one another, not prescribed gender roles,” Guess said. “While we still yearn for the day when equal marriage is fully legal, granted and protected in all 50 states, this is a significant step toward full freedom and recognition for LGBT people by the U.S. federal government.”

10:42 a.m.: Conservatives bemoaned the U.S. Supreme Court’s rulings on same-sex marriage Wednesday.

“Jesus wept,” former Arkansas Republican Gov. Mike Huckabee tweeted after the rulings. “5 people in robes said they are bigger than the voters of CA and Congress combined. And bigger than God. May He forgive us all.”

Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann said that the court’s action “will undermine the best interest of children and the best interests of the United States.”

“For thousands of years of recorded human history, no society has defended the legal standard of marriage as anything other than between man and woman,” she said. “Only since 2000 have we seen a redefinition of this foundational unit of society in various nations. … Today, the U.S. Supreme Court decided to join the trend, despite the clear will of the people’s representatives through DOMA.

Conservative media personality Glenn Beck, on his radio program, worried about dissolving the definition of marriage as being between one man and one woman: “Who are you to say that if I’m a devout Muslim, and I come over here and have three wives, who are you to say -- if I’m an American citizen -- that I can’t have multiple marriages?”

While the rulings were a setback, the Supreme Court’s did not hand down a decision about other states’ gay-marriage ban, prompting conservative leaders to urge same-sex marriage opponents to take their fight to a state-by-state level.

“It is my hope that states will define marriage as the union between one man and one woman,” Republican U.S. House speaker John Boehner said in a statement.

10:06 a.m.: NEW YORK -- At a news conference Wednesday, Edith Windsor, 83, the lesbian widow from New York who brought the case against the Defense of Marriage Act, remembered her deceased spouse Thea Spyer, saying “Thea would have been so happy and proud to see how far we have come in our fight to ensure that all gay and lesbian couples are treated with the dignity and respect that they deserve.”

Windsor filed the suit after she was required to pay $363,000 in estate taxes after the death of her longtime partner and spouse. A surviving spouse would not owe any such tax if the government had recognized their marriage as legal.

“DOMA violated the fundamentally American principles of fairness and equality "" she said. “Because of today’s Supreme Court ruling every child born today will be able to grow up in a world without doma -- a world where the federal government won’t discriminate against their marriages no matter who they are.

Windsor said she cried in joy upon hearing the ruling and never let herself become too sure she would win.

“I thought our arguments were sound and everyone else’s were insane” said Windsor, clad in a black pantsuit and long string of pearls. She said she had prepared two speeches: “One was a total win. One was total loss.”

Asked what prompted her at her age to launch the fight, Windsor described the heartbreak after Spyer’s death, followed by the anger at getting a $360,000 bill from the IRS. She said she was “overwhelmed by a sense of injustice and unfairness” and decided to “sue to get my money back.”

Windsor described the legal battle as “joyous” because of the activism it sparked. “If I had to survive Thea, what a glorious way to do it.”

9:45 a.m.: Elected officials from California and states across the nation that already allow gay marriage voiced their support following two landmark Supreme Court decisions.

Wednesday, the court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act and cleared the way for gay marriages in California in a procedural decision.

Senator Barbara Boxer said her spirits were “soaring” following the decisions. The Supreme Court, she said, “reaffirmed the promise of America by rejecting two blatantly unconstitutional measures that discriminated against millions of our families.”

In Los Angeles, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa called the decisions “another momentous step on the path to full equality.”

“By striking down the Defense of Marriage Act, the Supreme Court has affirmed a basic American truth: bigotry and bias have no place in our laws,” he said.

Meanwhile, politicians from Massachusetts and New York, where gay marriage is already legal, lauded the high court.

“In the weeks and months ahead, the nation will realize what we in Boston and Massachusetts have long known: we should be free to marry the person we love,” Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino said in a statement. “We are one Boston – a victory for our gay and lesbian friends is a victory for all of us.

New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo called the decisions “groundbreaking civil rights victories for the LGBT community.”

“It is my hope that today’s breakthrough decisions will propel our nation forward and finally allow all Americans to be granted the same rights and protections under the law,” he said.

9:07 a.m.: President Obama applauded the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act Wednesday, calling it “discrimination enshrined in law.”

“It treated loving, committed gay and lesbian couples as a separate and lesser class of people. The Supreme Court has righted that wrong, and our country is better off for it. We are a people who declared that we are all created equal – and the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.”

Obama said he has directed his staff to “review all relevant federal statutes to ensure this decision, including its implications for Federal benefits and obligations, is implemented swiftly and smoothly.”

However, he also nodded to the sensitivity of the issue, acknowledging that “our nation’s commitment to religious freedom is also vital.”

“How religious institutions define and consecrate marriage has always been up to those institutions,” he said. “Nothing about this decision – which applies only to civil marriages – changes that.”

Still, the President called the rulings “a victory” for couples that have fought for equal treatment.

“The laws of our land are catching up to the fundamental truth that millions of Americans hold in our hearts: when all Americans are treated as equal, no matter who they are or whom they love, we are all more free.”

8:44 a.m.: Supporters of Prop. 8 and the Defense of Marriage Act released statements Wednesday criticizing the Supreme Court’s decisions, saying the rulings stripped power from voters and lawmakers.

Andy Pugno, general counsel for ProtectMarriage.com, the official proponent of Proposition 8 said his organization was “pleased that the Supreme Court has reversed the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals’ misguided decision that sought to invalidate Proposition 8.”

Advertisement

“For the more than seven million Californians who have seen their vote stripped away from them, little by little, over the course of five years, that decision is gratifying.”

He continued: “While it is unfortunate that the Court’s ruling does not directly resolve questions about the scope of the trial court’s order against Prop 8, we will continue to defend Prop 8 and seek its enforcement until such time as there is a binding statewide order that renders Prop 8 unenforceable.”

House Speaker John Boehner issued a reminder that “Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis and President Clinton signed it into law.”

“While I am obviously disappointed in the ruling, it is always critical that we protect our system of checks and balances. A robust national debate over marriage will continue in the public square, and it is my hope that states will define marriage as the union between one man and one woman.”

8:24 a.m.: California Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom tweeted his praise of the ruling Wednesday morning:

8:08 a.m.: Many of the most important players in the cases that unfolded this morning held a news conference outside the Supreme Court Wednesday morning.

Attorney David Boies, who argued the Prop. 8 case before the court, called Wednesday “a wonderful day.”

“This is a wonderful day for our plaintiffs,” he said. “It’s a wonderful day for everyone around this country, and in California in particular, that wants to be able to marry the person they love. But it’s a wonderful day for America because we have now taken another important step toward guaranteeing the promise that is in our constitution … that all people are created equal.”

Kris Perry, a plaintiff in the Prop. 8 case, said the decision sends a message to the nation’s children.

“We believe that the importance of this case was to send a message to the children of this country that you are just as good as everybody else no matter who you are, no matter who your parents are,” she said. “Today we can go back to California and say to our own children – all four of our boys – your family is just as good as everybody else’s family.”

7:35 a.m.: The Supreme Court today opened the door for same-sex marriages to resume in California by turning away the defenders of Proposition 8.

The court’s procedural action sends the case back to California, where state and federal judges and the state’s top officials have said they support gay marriage as a matter of equal rights.

In a statement, the committee said:

“Today is a very good day -- both for the married couples who will finally enjoy the federal benefits and protections they’ve been denied for years, and for all Americans who want to live in a country where everyone is treated equally under the law.

By striking down the unconstitutional Defense of Marriage Act, the Supreme Court took an important step toward equality -- but we still have so much further to go.

Equality shouldn’t be a partisan issue, but unfortunately, right now it is. The Republicans oppose marriage equality in their official party platform, and the vast majority of my Republican colleagues in Congress agree with that position.

Given how much progress we’ve made on this issue in such a short period of time, it’d be easy to think that achieving full equality for all Americans is inevitable.

But that’s not true. If we hadn’t fought for it, today wouldn’t have happened.”

7:07 a.m.: The Supreme Court struck down a key part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act today, ruling that legally married same-sex couples are entitled to the same rights as all other married couples.

The decision voids the section of the 1996 law that denied tax breaks and other federal benefits to more than 100,000 gay couples who have married legally.

The court could resolve the case in a variety of ways.

It could uphold or reject Proposition 8, dismiss the case as improvidently granted, return the case to an appeals court for reconsideration or rule that ProtectMarriage, the sponsors of the marriage ban, did not have legal standing to bring the appeal.

Supreme Court justices sounded closely split on gay marriage when the Prop. 8 case was argued before them in March. Much attention fell on Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who, in the run-up to Wednesday’s expected decision, has beenwidely seen as the swing vote on a deeply divided court.

The court is expected to issue a decesion between 7 a.m. and 7:30 a.m. Wednesday.

The resolution reaffirms our core belief in doing one%27s %22duty to God.%22

Changing adult standards would have conflicted with the virtues of our chartered partners.

We will work to stay focused on that which unites us.

The Boy Scouts of America is part of the fabric of this nation. Our focus is on working together to deliver the nation's foremost youth program of character development and values-based leadership training. Somehow, Scouting has become one of the focal points in the debate on homosexuality. However, it is not the role of the Boy Scouts to resolve this complex issue, nor can the decision we will make today.

In 2000, the Supreme Court ruled that the BSA has the right to set its membership standards. It is worth noting that the court's decision was not about whether homosexuality is right or wrong; rather, it affirmed that private organizations have the right to set membership rules based on their beliefs and values.

At the BSA's National Annual Meeting today, the 1,400 voting members of our National Council will vote on a proposed resolution that would end the restriction on gay youth membership. That's the right decision for Boy Scouts.

Duty to God

Today's proposed resolution reaffirms our core belief in doing one's ""duty to God."" It would remove the restriction denying membership to youth on the basis of sexual orientation alone and would maintain the current membership policy for all adult leaders. Further, the resolution reinforces that Scouting is a youth program, and that any sexual conduct, heterosexual or homosexual, is contrary to the virtues of Scouting. It also prohibits the use of the organization to promote or advance any social or political positions or agendas.

While some people wish the proposed resolution would go further, it was clear from our listening phase that changing adult standards would have conflicted with the majority of our partners, 70% of which are religious organizations, and would have disrupted our ability to deliver Scouting. Conversely, some have asserted that the proposed change for youth runs counter to the values of, and raises concerns among, Scouting's religious chartered organizations. We are unaware of any major religious chartered organization that believes a youth member simply stating he or she is attracted to the same sex, but not engaging in sexual activity, should make him or her unwelcome in their congregation. We reviewed a variety of policy options and concluded this option would provide kids a place to belong while they learn and grow.

About the kids

The change to the Boy Scouts of America's membership policy is not the result of pressure from outside; it is the result of extensive dialogue within the Scouting family. Parents, adults in the Scouting community and teens alike tend to agree that youth should not be denied the benefits of Scouting. The resolution is not about adults; it is about what is best for young people.

Some have voiced concerns that this proposal could put children at risk of being abused. The BSA makes no connection between sexual abuse and homosexuality. The nation's leading experts agree. The BSA has stringent polices that protect the safety and privacy of youth and has always worked to ensure that it is a supportive and safe environment.

The BSA's executive committee unanimously presented this resolution because it stays true to Scouting's mission and remains focused on kids. No matter what your opinion is on this issue, America needs Scouting, and our policies must be based on what is in the best interest of our nation's children.

http://news.yahoo.com/supreme-court-gives-gay-marriage-historic-boost-211537407.html,,[],Supreme Court gives gay marriage historic boost,"WASHINGTON (AP) — In a historic day for gay rights, the Supreme Court gave the nation's legally married gay couples equal federal footing with all other married Americans on Wednesday and also cleared the way for same-sex marriages to resume in California.

In deciding its first cases on the issue, the high court did not issue the sweeping declaration sought by gay rights advocates that would have allowed same-sex couples to marry anywhere in the country. But in two rulings, both by bare 5-4 majorities, the justices gave gay marriage supporters encouragement in confronting the nationwide patchwork of laws that outlaw such unions in roughly three dozen states.

Gay-rights supporters cheered and hugged outside the court. Opponents said they mourned the rulings and vowed to keep up their fight.

In the first of the narrow rulings in its final session of the term, the court wiped away part of a federal anti-gay marriage law, the Defense of Marriage Act, that has kept legally married same-sex couples from receiving tax, health and pension benefits that are otherwise available to married couples.

Justice Anthony Kennedy, joined by the four liberal justices, said the purpose of the law was to impose a disadvantage and ""a stigma upon all who enter into same-sex marriages made lawful by the unquestioned authority of the states.""

President Barack Obama praised the court's ruling against the federal marriage act, labeling the law ""discrimination enshrined in law.""

""It treated loving, committed gay and lesbian couples as a separate and lesser class of people,"" Obama said in a statement. ""The Supreme Court has righted that wrong, and our country is better off for it.""

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said he was disappointed in the outcome of the federal marriage case and hoped states continue to define marriage as the union of a man and a woman. Boehner, as speaker, had stepped in as the main defender of the law before the court after the Obama administration declined to defend it.

Story continues

The other case, dealing with California's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, was resolved by an unusual lineup of justices in a technical legal fashion that said nothing about gay marriage. But the effect was to leave in place a trial court's declaration that California's Proposition 8 ban was unconstitutional. Gov. Jerry Brown quickly ordered that marriage licenses be issued to gay couples as soon as a federal appeals court lifts its hold on the lower court ruling. That will take least 25 days, the appeals court said.

California, where gay marriage was briefly legal in 2008, would be the 13th state, along with the District of Columbia, to allow same-sex couples to marry and would raise the share of the U.S. population in gay marriage states to 30 percent. Six states have adopted same-sex marriage in the past year, amid a rapid evolution in public opinion that now shows majority support for the right to marry in most polls.

The 12 other states are Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.

The day's rulings are clear for people who were married and live in states that allow same-sex marriage. They now are eligible for federal benefits.

The picture is more complicated for same-sex couples who traveled to another state to get married, or who have moved from a gay marriage state since being wed.

Their eligibility depends on the benefits they are seeking. For instance, immigration law focuses on where people were married, not where they live. But eligibility for Social Security survivor benefits basically depend on where a couple is living when a spouse dies.

This confusing array of regulations is reflected more broadly in the disparate treatment of gay couples between states. And the court's decision did not touch on another part of the federal marriage law that says a state does not have to recognize a same-sex marriage performed elsewhere.

Indeed, the outcome of the cases had supporters of gay marriage already anticipating their next trip to the high court, which they reason will be needed to legalize same-sex unions in all 50 states.

The Human Rights Campaign's president, Chad Griffin, said his goal is to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide within five years through a combination of ballot measures, court challenges and expansion of anti-discrimination laws.

The rulings came 10 years to the day after the court's Lawrence v. Texas decision that struck down state bans on gay sex. In his dissent at the time, Justice Antonin Scalia predicted the ruling would lead to same-sex marriage.

On Wednesday, Scalia issued another pungent dissent in the Defense of Marriage Act case in which he made a new prediction that the ruling would be used to upend state restrictions on marriage. Kennedy's majority opinion insisted the decision was limited to legally married same-sex couples.

Scalia read aloud in a packed courtroom that included the two couples who sued for the right to marry in California. On the bench, Justice Elena Kagan, who voted to strike down DOMA, watched Scalia impassively as he read.

""It takes real cheek for today's majority to assure us, as it is going out the door, that a constitutional requirement to give formal recognition to same-sex marriage is not at issue here_when what has preceded that assurance is a lecture on how superior the majority's moral judgment in favor of same-sex marriage is to the Congress' hateful moral judgment against it. I promise you this: The only thing that will 'confine' the court's holding is its sense of what it can get away with,"" Scalia said.

Scalia and Justice Samuel Alito, who also wrote a dissenting opinion, said their view is that Constitution does not require states to allow gay and lesbian couples to marry.

Outside the court, some in the crowd hugged and others jumped up and down just after 10 a.m. EDT when the DOMA decision was announced. Many people were on their cellphones monitoring Twitter, news sites and blogs for word of the decision. And there were cheers as runners came down the steps with the decision in hand and turned them over to reporters who quickly flipped through the decisions.

Chants of ""Thank you"" and ""U-S-A"" came from the crowd as plaintiffs in the cases descended the court's marbled steps. Most of those in the crowd appeared to support gay marriage, although there was at least one man who held a sign promoting marriage as between a man and a woman.

In New York City's Greenwich Village, the Stonewall Inn, where a riot in 1969 sparked the gay rights movement, erupted in cheers and whooping.

Mary Jo Kennedy, 58 was there with her wife Jo-Ann Shain, 60, and their daughter Aliya Shain, 25.

She came with a sign that could be flipped either way and was holding up the side that says ""SCOTUS made our family legal"".

They have been together 31 years and got married the day it became legal in New York.

Others were not celebrating.

""We mourn for America's future, but we are not without hope,"" said Tim Wildmon, president of American Family Association, in a statement.

Said. Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council: ""Time is not on the side of those seeking to create same-sex 'marriage.' As the American people are given time to experience the actual consequences of redefining marriage, the public debate and opposition to the redefinition of natural marriage will undoubtedly intensify.""

The federal marriage law had been struck down by several federal courts, and the justices chose to take up the case of 84-year-old Edith Windsor of New York, who sued to challenge a $363,000 federal estate tax bill after her partner of 44 years died in 2009.

Windsor, who goes by Edie, married Thea Spyer in 2007 after doctors told them Spyer would not live much longer. Spyer had suffered from multiple sclerosis for many years. She left everything she had to Windsor.

Windsor arrived at a news conference in New York after the ruling to applause from her supporters and said she felt ""joyous, just joyous.""

Windsor would have paid nothing in inheritance taxes if she had been married to a man. Now she is eligible for a refund.

In the case involving the federal Defense of Marriage Act, Justice Kennedy was joined by the court's four liberal justices. In the California ruling, which was not along ideological lines, Chief Justice John Roberts' opinion was joined by Scalia and three of those liberal court members: Kagan, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer.

The Nevada Senate voted 12-9 Monday night to begin the process of repealing the gay marriage ban from the state Constitution, a move to legalize unions between gays and lesbians.

TIMELINE: Gay marriage chronology

Supported by 11 Democrats and one Republican, the bill, Senate Joint Resolution 13, would amend the state Constitution to remove a provision declaring that marriage is only between a man and a woman. The measure also includes wording guaranteeing that religious organizations do not have to perform such unions -- a move to molify two senators who are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

The night’s most surprising moment came when Sen. Kelvin Atkinson, a Democrat from North Las Vegas, told his colleagues that he was gay and proud of it.

“I’m black. I’m gay,” he said in a shaky voice. “I know this is the first time many of you have heard me say that I am a black, gay male.”

Atkinson argued that gay marriage does not threaten any legal or moral definition of the union.

“If this hurts your marriage,” he said, “then your marriage was in trouble in the first place.”

The measue still has a way to to before gay marriage is a reality in Nevada. The idea still must pass the Assembly, where the Democrats have a 27-15 edge. It also must be passed by lawmakers next year and approved by voters in 2016.

A woman who answered the phone in Atkinson’s Carson City office told the Los Angeles Times that the legislator was deluged with interview requests and was trying to accommodate them while tending to his Senate duties.

One legislator might be out of the closet, but another says he’s probably in trouble with his church.

Sen. Ruben Kiheun said his “more progressive” girlfriend nagged him over his resistance to gay marriage, before he voted for the bill Monday.

After the vote, he told fellow legislators: “I don’t know if I’ll be allowed in church on Sunday.”

The organization%27s policy prohibits the use of Scouting to promote a political agenda.

The two leaders wore their Scout uniforms in the June 2 parade.

They marched with several Scouts in the Utah Pride Parade in Salt Lake City.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Two Boy Scout leaders have been reprimanded by the organization for marching with several Scouts in the Utah Pride Parade in Salt Lake City.

Officials from the Great Salt Lake Council of the Boy Scouts of America say Peter Brownstein and Neil Whitaker violated the organization's policy prohibiting the use of Scouting to promote a political agenda. They had been warned that they would violate the policy if they wore their Scout uniforms in the June 2 parade.

""We were very disappointed that you used Scouting to advance the gay agenda at the Utah Pride Parade,"" council leaders wrote to Brownstein. ""You and others are welcome to participate in the parade as supportive citizens but not as uniformed members of the BSA.""

But Whitaker told The Salt Lake Tribune (http://bit.ly/121mjmh ) that they were not promoting a political agenda, but celebrating a ""cultural event"" similar to the Days of '47 Parade that honors Utah pioneers annually on July 24 and often includes Boy Scouts in uniform.

""We weren't rallying for a politician or political event,"" Whitaker said. ""To me, it was being supportive of my fellow human beings.""

Both leaders refused to sign an apology letter acknowledging they violated Scout policy and were disobedient. The letter warns that a similar offense could lead to revocation of their Scouting membership.

Whitaker and the Scouts wore their uniforms in the parade, but Brownstein did not. Former Scoutmaster Dave McGrath of Idaho Falls, Idaho, also marched in uniform in the parade.

The national organization decided in May, after a contentious vote, to accept openly gay boys as Scouts. But the Scouts still have a ban on gay adults serving as leaders — and gay-rights supporters have vowed to maintain pressure on the national organization.

National BSA spokesman Deron Smith told The Tribune that the national organization backs Utah's council.

""These individuals, many of whom are not registered in Scouting, expressed a personal opinion and do not represent the Boy Scouts of America,"" he wrote by email. ""Scouting is taking appropriate steps to respond to this issue.""

Valarie Larabee, executive director of the Utah Pride Center, criticized the council's reaction. Her group organizes the annual parade.

""Any discipline or questioning of members of the Scouting family who participated in our procession as a member of our color guard, a unit carrying out nation's flag, would be deplorable,"" she said in a statement.

(CNN) – Former first lady Laura Bush, who is one of three prominent Republicans featured in a new ad supporting same-sex marriage, has asked the spot's creator to remove a clip of her espousing support for equal marriage rights.

""Mrs. Bush did not approve of her inclusion in this advertisement nor is she associated in any way with the group that made the ad,"" Anne MacDonald, a spokeswoman for the former first lady, wrote in a statement Thursday. ""When she became aware of the advertisement Tuesday night, we requested that the group remove her from it.""



The ad, from the Respect for Marriage Coalition, features Bush speaking in a 2010 CNN interview with Larry King.

""When couples are committed to each other and love each other then they ought to have the same sort of rights that everyone has,"" she is shown saying.

Those remarks came as a surprise at the time, since she appeared to be breaking ranks on the issue with her husband, former President George W. Bush. In 2011, her daughter Barbara appeared in a television spot for another pro-gay marriage group, the Human Rights Campaign.

UPDATE: Group switches ad after Laura Bush’s request

The spot also features clips of former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Secretary of State Colin Powell voicing their support for same-sex marriage rights. A spokeswoman for Powell said Thursday they weren't contacted for permission to use the clip, but that ""his remarks are in the public domain and we have not asked them to remove it.""

A spokesman for Cheney did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the ad Thursday morning. The Respect for Marriage Coalition similarly did not respond to a query on whether they would remove Bush from their spot.

The group said Wednesday they would spend $1 million to air the spot nationally, as well as run print ads in major newspapers utilizing the same quotes from the Republicans who back equal marriage rights.

""None of us would want to be told we can't marry the person we love,"" a narrator says introducing the clips. ""That's why a growing majority of Americans believe it's time to allow marriage for gay and lesbian couples.""

The ad shows Colin Powell, the former Secretary of State under George W. Bush, supporting same-sex marriage in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer from May.

""Allowing them to live together with the protection of law, it seems to me is the way we should be moving in this country,"" Powell said on CNN's ""The Situation Room.""

That interview reflected a shift for Powell, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff when the military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy was implemented.

A third Republican, former Vice President Dick Cheney, is shown in the spot saying ""Freedom means freedom for everyone."" Cheney's younger daughter Mary wed her longtime partner Heather Poe in June. They were married in Washington, D.C., which legalized same-sex marriage in 2009.

And a Democrat, President Barack Obama, is shown during his January inauguration address declaring ""Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law.""

The new ad campaign comes as the Supreme Court prepares to tackle the issue of same-sex marriage this spring. Last year the high court agreed to hear two constitutional challenges to state and federal laws dealing with the recognition of gay and lesbian couples to legally wed.

Oral arguments will be held on March 26 and 27, with a ruling by late June."

John Francis, 65, adopted his 73-year-old gay partner, Gregory, as a means of financial security, ABC News reported. The move came about because the two, who have been together for 45 years, began to worry about what might happen if one of them died. Even though the Supreme Court on Wednesday overturned the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which had defined marriage as between a man and a woman, couples in Pennsylvania and more than 30 other states where same-sex marriage is still not legal face an uphill battle for equal benefits.

""It's humorous to me,"" he told ABC News. ""Gregory was a high school and college jock. Today, I am making dough for blueberry crostata and he is golfing. You're going to think of him as the dad, rather than me. … But it provided us with some level of comfort that we have protected each other as much as we can.""

Visit the CentralVoice to read more about John and Greg's story.

Pennsylvania's inheritance tax law states there is a zero percent tax on transfers to a surviving legal spouse. There is a 4.5 percent tax on transfers to direct descendants and lineal heirs, but a 15 percent tax on transfers to other heirs. Since Pennsylvania does not legally recognize same-sex couples, John and Greg previously fell under the 15 percent bracket; however, by adopting Greg, John has moved them into the 4.5 percent bracket.

“We wanted to protect ourselves from higher inheritance taxes that heterosexual couples do no[t] incur upon the death of one or other spouse,” Francis explained to local LGBT blog CentralVoice.

Since the Supreme Court's landmark DOMA ruling, focus has shifted onto equal rights in states like Pennsylvania. State Rep. Brian Sims (D-Philadelphia), the first openly gay person elected to the Pennsylvania General Assembly, plans to introduce a marriage equality bill in his state in the hopes of getting ""marriage"" redefined as a ""civil contract between two people who enter into matrimony,"" Philadelphia Weekly reported.

However, Sims faces staunch opposition. When he took to the House floor Thursday to discuss the DOMA decision, he was silenced by his conservative peers. Rep. Daryl Metcalfe (R-Butler) later told local radio station WHYY that Sims was barred from making comments that would have been ""an open rebellion against God's law.""

Others think there is a good chance Pennsylvania will rise to equal rights sooner rather than later.

“I think it’s going to be odd for people to be recognized in some states but not in others,"" Christine Bryan of LGBT advocacy group Delta Foundation told CBS station KDKA, ""so I think in some respect the state’s hand is going to be forced."""

The move comes just days before the U.S. Supreme Court takes up the issue of same-sex marriage and follows a poll showing more than half of Americans support such marriages.

Tuesday evening, Bisbee City Council members voted to allow the next best thing to gay marriage. In a first reading of an ordinance, adding a chapter to its city charter, they cleared the way for civil unions. The vote by the seven-member council was unanimous, making it likely to pass on a final vote scheduled in two weeks.

“I think it’s time,” Mayor Adriana Zavala Badal said of the proposal. “We’ve been working on this as a country for a long time.”

The ordinance, which allows for a form of union regardless of the sexual orientation of the couple, would be effective only within Bisbee and affect certain benefits and policies within the city. Bisbee, situated along the U.S.-Mexico border, has about 5,600 residents.

Bisbee’s proposal borrowed language from a civil union bill proposed in the state Legislature, a measure unlikely to pass the two Republican-controlled chambers. Arizona has a law dating back to 1996 that defines marriage between one male and one female. Five years ago, Arizona voters approved adding the language of that law to the state’s constitution.

The state bill and Bisbee’s proposed ordinance do not mention same-sex marriage but do raise the issue of equality.

“It is in the best interest of the city of Bisbee to refuse to continue to remain silent on this issue, in the face of discriminatory practices that are inconsistent with the principles upon which our country was founded,” the ordinance states.

It’s unclear whether state officials will challenge Bisbee’s proposed ordinance if it passes a final vote.

Although the Arizona Constitution defines a marriage between a man and a woman, it doesn’t appear to forbid same-sex civil unions, said Jack Tweedie, director of children and families program at the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Still, it’s uncertain whether Bisbee officials have the authority to sanction such civil unions, Tweedie said.

“At some point we may be told that we can no longer do this,” Zavala Badal said.

A civil union certificate would allow a slew of city benefits for an unwed couple, such as disability or compensation for the partners of city workers and even family discounts at the local pool. Currently, partners don’t qualify.

As it stands now, there are several important life decisions that are not available to unwed partners, Zavala Badal said. For instance, partners cannot give authorization as to where their loved one should be buried in the city’s cemetery. Only family members can make that decision.

Councilman Gene Connors introduced the ordinance after the idea came up in conversation with someone else a month ago. “From her point of view, it would bring people to town and generate revenue,” Connors said.

He agreed about the possible economic reward, but as the vote came closer, Conners said, the potential revenue didn’t matter that much.

“It just absolutely had to happen … for the right reasons,” Connors said. He represents a neighborhood known as Old Bisbee, which has a substantial gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community.

“We [in Arizona] get a lot of bad press,” Connors said. “But Bisbee is a really a special town and it’s pretty wonderful to be here.”

He Left The Newspaper In']",Federal judge backs same-sex marriages in Utah; state to appeal,"A federal judge on Friday struck down Utah’s same-sex marriage ban, making the state where the powerful Mormon Church has fought gay marriage the latest front in the legal battle over marriage rights.

In a 53-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Robert J. Shelby held that Utah’s law passed by voters in 2004 violates the federal right of gay and lesbian couples to due process and equal protection under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution.

“The state’s current laws deny its gay and lesbian citizens their fundamental right to marry and, in so doing, demean the dignity of these same-sex couples for no rational reason,” Shelby wrote. “Accordingly, the court finds that these laws are unconstitutional.”

Utah will appeal the ruling to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, Ryan Bruckman, a spokesman for the state attorney general’s office, said in a telephone call to the Los Angeles Times. He said the state will also seek an emergency stay to prevent any gay marriages from taking place.

Even as he spoke, at least one county clerk in Salt Lake County has begun issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

The state’s attorney general’s office did not have an immediate comment on whether it will seek an appeal in the case.

The Utah ruling comes a day after New Mexico’s Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage, by ruling that it is unconstitutional to deny a marriage license to gay and lesbian couples. New Mexico became the 17th state, along with the District of Columbia, to allow same-sex marriages.

Earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down portions of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, in effect, recognizing same-sex marriages for the purpose of receiving federal benefits. The legislation has led to a flurry of lawsuits to force states to legalize same-sex marriages. Other states, including Hawaii and Illinois, recently legalized gay marriages through legislative action.

In September 2013, a New Jersey judge cited the DOMA ruling in a state case, holding that the state constitution requires the recognition of same-sex marriages.

That ruling effectively brought same-sex marriage to New Jersey after Gov. Chris Christie decided not to appeal. In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, challenges in many other states are still pending.

But Utah, the home of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, holds a special place because of the state’s history opposing gay marriage and the Mormon Church’s strong opposition.

Clifford Rosky, chairman of the board of the advocacy group Equality Utah, and a professor of law at the University of Utah, praised the decision, which he called careful and well-reasoned. “This is one of the decisions that recognizes that every individual has the right to marry the person he or she loves.”

Rosky also said he expects the state to appeal the decision to the 10th Circuit, but given the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling, that could cause a problem for the appeals court.

You would have to travel to one of those states to get married.”

The second issue being presented before the Supreme Court addresses a more expansive question, about who has the right to marry. It challenges Proposition 8, a California ballot initiative banning same-sex marriage. “The Prop 8 case is a broader case than the DOMA case because the remedy in the Prop 8 case would be, at a minimum, to allow same-sex couples in California to marry,” said James D. Esseks, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s project dealing with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues, “and it might also be that every state in the country has to allow same-sex couples to marry.”

The court, of course, could keep the laws as they are now, or go in any of several other directions. But let’s look at how life would change for same-sex couples if they woke up one June morning to learn that, at the very least, the Defense of Marriage Act had been dismantled.

I turned to a same-sex couple I interviewed more than four years ago, Jeff Friedman and Andrew Zwerin, of Rockville Centre, N.Y., to see how they would fare. Back then, they told me about a slightly torn manila folder stuffed with documents — their marriage license, their son’s adoption decree, among other things — that proved they were a family. They didn’t travel far without it.

The couple, both 44, still have the folder, which is now showing even more signs of wear. Mr. Friedman said they would continue to carry it around even if DOMA were overturned because they wanted to be sure their family was recognized wherever they may go. That’s especially important, they said, because they have had to prove their family status to hospital staff members on more than one occasion. And unfortunately, they’ve had to make more than a dozen trips to the emergency room because their 9-year-old son, Joshua, battles allergies and asthma. On one occasion, when Josh was barely breathing because of a severe asthma attack, a nurse wouldn’t admit the family to the pediatric unit even after the couple provided a birth certificate that named them as the parents. The nurse was waiting for a mother."

Ed Sullivan Jr. of Mundelein said Sunday he will support a bill to allow gay marriage in Illinois, becoming the second House Republican to do so and first among leadership.

Sullivan, who is chairman of the House Republican campaign organization, said his decision to back same-sex marriage represented a personal and family evolution on the issue. Previously an opponent of civil unions, Sullivan told the Tribune that his mother-in-law, who lives in the southwest suburbs, has been in a same-sex relationship.

""The first reaction from people might be, 'Well he might be voting for that just because of his mother-in-law,'"" Sullivan said. ""The reality is, because my mother-in-law is gay, I have more of an understanding and familiarity with same-sex couples.""

A state representative since 2003, Sullivan and state Rep. Ron Sandack of Downers Grove are the only House Republicans to publicly announce their backing of the same-sex marriage bill, which already passed the state Senate. With House lawmakers returning to Springfield on Monday after a two-week break, supporters of the measure have said they were within a dozen votes of the 60 needed to pass it.

Sullivan said he believes more Republicans among the 47 in the House will sign on.

""There is tremendous momentum leading up to this vote. I think we're very close,"" he said. ""There's many of my colleagues that have talked about this, that have said it's the right thing to do.""

Same-sex marriage has been controversial for Republicans in the state. Illinois GOP Chairman Pat Brady urged lawmakers to pass the bill, but some social conservatives unsuccessfully sought his ouster because his position conflicted with a plank in the state Republican platform opposing same-sex marriage.

Recently, U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk, a Brady supporter, announced his support for gay marriage, becoming the second U.S. Senate Republican to do so.

""This issue for me … goes to the core of fairness — marriage equality for all people. I think it is in line with … what I believe, and I personally believe it is in line with what our party believes, and that's trying to treat people with fairness,"" Sullivan said.

Sullivan said he believes his decision follows the wishes of voters in his northwest suburban district. He acknowledged that opponents cite their religious beliefs but said the bill contains strong religious protections.

""I try to err on the side of being a public servant and serving my district as opposed to potentially being a politician and just serving that subset (opposed based on religion) and those within my party who don't necessarily want this to pass,"" he said. ""I look at this as a freedom, as a conservative view of treating people equally.""

I'd say right about now the Supreme Mormon Poohbahs and their servants in the Utah government are not having an easy time keeping the eggnog down.

Hmmm.

That news broke AFTER 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve. Those 10th Circuit Judges must really have wanted to get this out; at the very least their clerks must have been working until the last minute today.

From Equality on Trial. Part of the Order:



Having considered the district court’s decision and the parties’ arguments concerning the stay factors, we conclude that a stay is not warranted. Accordingly, we deny Defendants-Appellants’ emergency motions for a stay pending appeal and for a temporary stay. In addition, we direct expedited consideration of this appeal. The Clerk is directed to issue a separate order setting deadlines for briefing.



The text of the decision, ordering an expedited hearing of the appeal itself.:



This is an appeal from a district court order concluding that Utah’s prohibition on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional as a violation of due process and equal protection.

Defendants-Appellants seek a stay pending appeal and a temporary stay while the court considers the stay request. Plaintiffs-Appellees have filed a response. A stay pending appeal is governed by the following factors: (1) the likelihood of success on appeal; (2) the threat of irreparable harm if the stay is not granted; (3) the absence of harm to opposing parties if the stay is granted; and (4) any risk of harm to the public interest. Homans v. City of Albuquerque, 264 F.3d 1240, 1243 (10th Cir.2001); 10th Cir. R. 8.1. The first two factors are the most critical, and they require more than a mere possibility of success and irreparable harm, respectively. Nken v. Holder , 556 U.S. 418, 434-35 (2009). Having considered the district court’s decision and the parties’ arguments concerning the stay factors, we conclude that a stay is not warranted. Accordingly, we deny Defendants-Appellants’ emergency motions for a stay pending appeal and for a temporary stay. In addition, we direct expedited consideration of this appeal. The Clerk is directed to issue a separate order setting deadlines for briefing.

The brief comes as the White House is considering whether to weigh in on the same-sex marriage case; at this point, the Republicans who signed the document are taking a more expansive stance than President Obama, who favors same-sex marriage but has said he would leave it to the states, as opposed to making it a constitutional right.

The list of Republicans on the brief now tallies more than 100, organizers say. It now includes Beth Myers, who ran Mr. Romney’s 2008 campaign and was a senior adviser to him in 2012; Charles Bass, a former member of Congress from New Hampshire; and Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist who advised Senator John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign. Also on the list is B. J. Nikkel, who made national news last year when she became the only Republican on the Colorado House Judiciary Committee to vote in favor of same-sex civil unions. She previously worked as district director for Representative Marilyn Musgrave, a former congresswoman whose signature issue in Washington was banning same-sex marriage.

The brief, organized by Ken Mehlman, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee who is gay, will be filed on Thursday as a friend-of-the-court, or amicus, brief to a lawsuit that seeks to overturn Proposition 8, a California ballot initiative that forbids same-sex marriage, and all similar bans. The landmark case will be heard alongside a request that the court overturn the 1996 federal Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage for the purposes of federal law as the union between a man and a woman."

WASHINGTON — They were the towheaded sisters who tagged along on campaigns, polite and smiling, as their father rose through Wyoming and then Washington politics to become one of the most powerful men in the country.

“We were as close as sisters can be,” recalled Mary Cheney of her relationship with her older sister, Liz.

But now, a feud between the two has spilled into public view, involving social media, an angry same-sex spouse, a high-profile election and a father who feels uncomfortably caught between his two children.

The situation has deteriorated so much that the two sisters have not spoken since the summer, and the quarrel threatens to get in the way of something former Vice President Dick Cheney desperately wants — a United States Senate seat for Liz.

Things erupted on Sunday when Mary Cheney, a lesbian, and her wife were at home watching “Fox News Sunday” — their usual weekend ritual. Liz Cheney appeared on the show and said that she opposed same-sex marriage, describing it as “just an area where we disagree,” referring to her sister. Taken aback and hurt, Mary Cheney took to her Facebook page to blast back: “Liz — this isn’t just an issue on which we disagree you’re just wrong — and on the wrong side of history.”

Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com

But then Mary Cheney’s wife, Heather Poe, went further, touching on Liz Cheney’s relocation from Northern Virginia to Wyoming to seek office. (Liz Cheney is already battling accusations of carpetbagging in the race.)

“I can’t help but wonder how Liz would feel if as she moved from state to state, she discovered that her family was protected in one but not the other,” Ms. Poe wrote on her Facebook page. “Yes, Liz,” she added, “in fifteen states and the District of Columbia you are my sister-in-law.”

The feud reveals tensions not just within the family but in the Republican Party more broadly as it seeks to respond to both a changing America and an energized, fervently conservative base.

Indeed, while Liz Cheney seeks to make clear her opposition to same-sex marriage, her father more than a decade ago was able to embrace fairly moderate views on the subject, breaking publicly with President George W. Bush over Mr. Bush’s support for a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. He has gone further still since then, telling Barbara Walters in 2011, “I certainly don’t have any problem with” same-sex marriage.

But Ms. Cheney, in her bid to defeat Republican Senator Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming, is running to his right and seeking to capture conservatives and Tea Party enthusiasts.

Liz Cheney on Sunday declined to directly address the remarks from her sister and sister-in-law, but said in an email: “I love my sister and her family and have always tried to be compassionate towards them. I believe that is the Christian way to behave.”

People who have spoken to Liz Cheney say she is irritated that her sister is making their dispute public and believes it is hypocritical for Mary Cheney to take such a hard line now, given that she worked for the re-election of President Bush, an opponent of same-sex marriage.

The relationship between the two sisters used to be quite different. The daughters drew especially close when their father ran as Mr. Bush’s running mate in 2000 and eventually became a figure of great controversy and enormous power as vice president. After Mr. Cheney left office in 2009, politically bruised and physically ailing, the sisters, who lived 15 minutes apart in Washington’s tony Northern Virginia suburbs, would join their parents for a standing Sunday dinner at Liz’s house in McLean each week, along with their families, including Ms. Poe.

Mary Cheney, 44, said in a phone interview Sunday that she presumed her sister shared her father’s views on marriage, and that view was reinforced because Liz Cheney “was always very supportive” of her relationship with Ms. Poe and the couple’s two children. She learned otherwise in August when Liz Cheney declared, shortly after announcing her Senate candidacy, that she was opposed to same-sex marriage rights. Mary Cheney said it is now “impossible” for the sisters to reconcile as long as Liz Cheney maintains that position.

“What amazes me is that she says she’s running to be a new generation of leader,” Mary Cheney said, citing her 47-year-old sister’s slogan in her campaign against Mr. Enzi, 69. “I’m not sure how sticking to the positions of the last 20 or 30 years is the best way to do that.”

Mary Cheney said it was her wife’s idea for the couple to take to Facebook to respond to Liz’s televised remarks. Ms. Poe seemed especially hurt that her sister-in-law had acted so embracing toward them in private, and then took this public position.

“Liz has been a guest in our home, has spent time and shared holidays with our children, and when Mary and I got married in 2012 — she didn’t hesitate to tell us how happy she was for us,” Ms. Poe wrote. “To have her say she doesn’t support our right to marry is offensive to say the least.”

In the interview, Mary Cheney, who is a longtime political consultant, said she would continue to raise the matter. Reminded by a reporter that such criticism could complicate her sister’s Senate campaign, Mary Cheney offered a clipped answer reminiscent of her father’s terse style. “O.K.,” she said, before letting silence fill the air.

It is not the substance of the issue that could hurt Liz Cheney in Wyoming — her opponent also opposes same-sex marriage. But the ugly family drama and questions about what Liz Cheney truly believes could reinforce questions about her authenticity in a place where many voters have met their politicians in person and are already skeptical of an outsider like Ms. Cheney, who has lived elsewhere for much of her life. Ms. Cheney’s first ad, which she released last week, was devoted entirely to emphasizing her family’s Wyoming roots.

Wyoming, a sprawling but sparsely populated state, has rarely seen such high-profile primaries, and this one has already featured an ugly Cheney family episode: After former Wyoming Senator Alan Simpson, a longtime friend of the family who served with Mr. Cheney in the state’s congressional delegation, fretted to The New York Times this summer about how Liz Cheney’s challenge of Mr. Enzi would be divisive among the state’s Republicans, Lynne Cheney, the sisters’ mother and Mr. Cheney’s wife, confronted him at a charity event and told him to “just shut up” — three times, Mr. Simpson claimed. When Lynne Cheney later said that the exchange never happened, Mr. Simpson called her denial “a damn baldfaced lie.”

The former vice president is active and visible in his daughter’s Senate bid and this Wednesday, he will join her in Denver for a fund-raiser to benefit her campaign. Early polls show Liz Cheney trailing Mr. Enzi, but her fund-raising since declaring her candidacy has been robust.

As for Mary Cheney, she said that when she gets together with her parents these days, they know which subjects not to bring up. “They come over for dinner and we don’t talk about Liz or the race,” she said. “There is so much more to talk about.”

The Cheneys have tried to be “as neutral as they can,” added Mary Cheney, who just returned from a pheasant hunting trip with her father in South Dakota. “My parents are stuck in an awful position.”

As for the coming holidays, Mary Cheney said that her parents will come to her and Ms. Poe’s Northern Virginia home for Thanksgiving and that she assumed her older sister would be in Wyoming.

At Christmas, the whole Cheney clan will head to the Jackson Hole area in Wyoming, where Liz Cheney now lives. But Mary Cheney said of her sister, “I will not be seeing her.”"

Huppke', 'Cynthia Dizikes', 'Chicago Tribune Reporters']",Gay marriage bill fails to go to vote in Illinois House,"SPRINGFIELD -- For Illinois' gay marriage proponents, it was supposed to be a historic week culminating in a collective ""I do"" from Springfield lawmakers.

Thousands tuned in to social media and live streams throughout the day Friday, sending tweets and other messages of hope as they waited for the Illinois House to call a vote on the legalization of gay marriage. Gay couples who had traveled to the state Capitol were invited to view the action from the speaker's gallery. And during breaks, families paused to snap smiling pictures with sponsoring Rep. Greg Harris, D-Chicago.

But as the hours wore on, the optimism and energy dissolved in the face of strong opposition from Catholic and conservative African-American church groups, leading Harris to rise on the floor and tearfully announce that he would not call the bill — there wasn't enough support after all.

His speech was greeted by the angry shouts of dozens of supporters who had been waiting all day to watch the history-making event.

""It felt like someone knocked me to the floor,"" said Robyne O'Mara, who has been in a same-sex relationship for the past three decades and took off work Friday to be at the Capitol. ""They failed us.""

Illinois had appeared poised to become the 13th state to approve same-sex marriage. Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn promised to sign the bill. Democrats held veto-proof majorities in the House and Senate. President Barack Obama called for its passage during a Thursday night fundraiser in his home city, and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel was a major backer as well.

As anticipation reached a frenzied level Friday, so too did Harris' lobbying efforts. He spent hours going desk to desk surveying colleagues, occasionally stepping out of the chamber to hold meetings and huddling on the floor with House Speaker Michael Madigan and with Sen. Heather Steans, D-Chicago, who shepherded the measure through the Senate on a 34-21 vote on Feb. 14.

In the end, however, Harris declined to point the finger at any one group of lawmakers for the failure to vote, saying individual members had to make up their own mind and that several colleagues had asked to have the summer to weigh the issue in their district, with the promise they would return in November prepared to support same-sex marriage.

""This was the hardest thing I've done in my life,"" Harris said of the decision to wait.

Under the bill, the definition of marriage in Illinois would have changed from an act between a man and a woman to one between two people. Civil unions could have been converted to marriages within a year of the law going on the books. The legislation would not have required religious organizations to perform a marriage of gay couples, and church officials would not have been forced to allow their facilities to be used by gay couples seeking to marry.

The legalization of same-sex marriage in Illinois would also have far broader impact on couples if the U.S. Supreme Court overrules the Defense of Marriage Act. The court is expected to rule in June. If the act is struck down, the federal government will recognize same-sex marriages, giving gay couples the full array of rights available to married heterosexual couples.

The push for gay marriage comes just two years after Illinois legalized civil unions for same-sex couples and reflects shifting attitudes in favor of same-sex marriage.

For years, gay rights activists in Illinois fought for legalization of civil unions while slowly working toward a marriage bill. The marriage bill got nowhere, but civil unions were legalized in 2011, giving gay couples across Illinois the opportunity to have the same state-level rights as married couples.

After passage of the civil unions bill, thousands of Illinois couples took advantage of the new law, but many said they weren't satisfied and felt the civil union classification created a second class that wasn't quite marriage.

While advocates have brought forth a lengthy lineup of religious leaders who endorse gay marriage, Catholics and conservative African-American church groups have provided fierce opposition. They argue that same-sex marriage violates the basic tenets of the Bible, which call for marriage to be only between a man and a woman.

In the wake of Friday's nonvote, Bishop Larry Trotter, co-chairman of the African American Clergy Coalition, released a statement applauding members of the Illinois Legislative Black Caucus for ""showing extreme courage in their defense of traditional marriage in Illinois.""

""Today our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ has won!"" Trotter wrote. ""Pastor James Meeks, Bishop Lance Davis and I are so proud of the God fearing Black Caucus members who withstood the pressure of the LGBT forces and allowed God's word concerning marriage to remain between one man and one woman in Illinois.""

Advocates argue that a prohibition on gay marriage goes against American values of equality and fairness.

Jim Bennett, Midwest regional director of the gay rights group Lambda Legal, said Friday that he was profoundly disappointed.

""I was completely shocked,"" Bennett said. ""Even the signs going in today and even past lunch we were all feeling very good.""

The dismay resonated beyond Springfield.

In Chicago, Mona Noriega had been glued to her computer and smartphone all week, anxiously awaiting the expected vote.

""I warned my people in my office that I had my computer on in the background and I might just have to stop (the meeting) if they got to marriage equality,"" Noriega said Friday afternoon.

But by the evening, Noriega received a Facebook message that the efforts to bring a vote had imploded.

""Oh, oh what a disappointment,"" she said.

Harris said efforts weren't helped by Quinn's repeated demands to call the bill in recent weeks. Quinn insisted there were enough votes to pass the bill, a situation Harris noted could peel votes off if lawmakers felt their ""yes"" wasn't needed to get the measure over the top.

Other gay rights advocates contended Harris didn't do enough to reach out to minority lawmakers during the negotiation process, noting that African-American and Latino lawmakers were heavily targeted by the Roman Catholic Church and conservative black church groups opposed to gay marriage."

The ruling applies even to gay couples who live in states where their union is not recognized -- so long as they were married in a state that allows same-sex marriage.

""Today's ruling provides certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide."" said Secretary Jacob J. Lew in a statement. ""This ruling also assures legally married same-sex couples that they can move freely throughout the country knowing that their federal filing status will not change.""

The U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service announcement comes on the heels of the landmark Supreme Court ruling in June that said same-sex couples are entitled to federal benefits. The ruling struck down the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act that blocked federal recognition of gay marriage.

The ruling applies to filing status, personal and dependency exemptions, standard deduction, employee benefits, IRAs, earned income tax credits and child tax credits, according to the Treasury Department and IRS statement.

The ruling does not apply to those in registered domestic partnerships or civil unions.



Thirteen states and Washington, D.C., have legalized same-sex marriage as of August: California, Delaware, Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Washington, Vermont, Rhode Island, New York, Minnesota and New Hampshire.

Several Native American tribes and some counties in New Mexico have also allowed marriage licenses to be issued.

Before Thursday's ruling, same-sex couples that had married had to declare themselves as ""unmarried"" on federal income tax forms. The Human Rights Campaign, a civil rights organization, said that cost the average same-sex couple more than $1,000 a year in additional taxes. It also meant that gay couples could not inherit property without it being taxed.

""No family should have to worry about losing important federal rights and benefits, simply because they live in a state that doesn't recognize them as equal under the law,"" Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement.

In the anti-marriage camp, Brian Brown, president of National Organization for Marriage, denounced the ruling in a statement.

""The Treasury Department is grossly overstepping its authority,"" Brown said. ""The Obama administration is intent on forcing same-sex marriage on an unwilling public."""

The primates held the first conference in Jerusalem in 2008, five years after openly gay New Hampshire Bishop Gene Robinson was consecrated in the Episcopal Church. The action threw the communion into disarray.

At the Jerusalem meeting, the primates called for the creation of an Anglican province in North America to rival the Episcopal Church. Five years later, the primates say the new Anglican province, known as the Anglican Church in North America, is thriving.

Now, the archbishop of Nigeria and archbishops in East Africa have organized the second Global Anglican Future Conference at which they hope to accelerate the process that began in Jerusalem. The so-called GAFCON II meeting will take place Oct. 21-26 in Nairobi.

“We have succeeded in consolidation,” said Ugandan Anglican Archbishop Stanley Ntagali.

“Anglican churches have been planted in North America. The clergy trust one another to preach according to the Bible,” he said. “But the crisis in the communion continues to deepen as more (homosexual) consecrations occur.”

In addition to the consecration of gay bishops, the African primates are concerned with the growing acceptance of same-sex unions in the West. They say attempts to discipline the Episcopal Church were not successful, and, as a result, a “spiritual cancer” has spread to other provinces, including the Anglican Church of Canada, the Church of England, the Scottish Episcopal Church, the Church in Wales, and the Anglican Church of Southern Africa.

In their words, GAFCON II seeks to restore good order, theological integrity and biblical faithfulness.

“We need to see the overthrow by some churches of the creation order of female and male as just one symptom of the disease,” wrote Kenyan Anglican Archbishop Eliud Wabukala, chairman of the GAFCON primates’ council in a letter to the conference dated Thursday (Aug. 22). “The cause is spiritual.”

The primates remain optimistic that Archbishop Justin Welby, the new global leader of the Anglican Communion, may prevent a split since he is on record as being opposed to gay consecrations.

“The primates are happy with Welby since he has been attending our meetings,” said Ntagali. “He has taken time to follow what we are doing and he understands we are not breaking the communion.”

“I believe America is at its best when we champion the freedom and dignity of every human being,’’ Mrs. Clinton said in a video posted Monday on the Internet by the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights advocacy group. Her announcement comes as the Supreme Court is about to hear two landmark gay rights cases that advocates hope will make same-sex marriage legal in all 50 states.

Mrs. Clinton’s announcement represents a switch in position; as a presidential candidate in 2008, she explicitly opposed same-sex marriage, saying that she favored civil unions but that decisions about the legality of marriage should be left to the states. (Until last year, President Obama took that position as well; the president now favors a right to marriage for gay couples.) But Mrs. Clinton did take steps to protect gay couples when she was secretary of state, work that she said “inspired me to think anew” about the values she holds.

“L.G.B.T. Americans are our colleagues, our teachers, our soldiers, our friends, our loved ones, and they are full and equal citizens and deserve the rights of citizenship,’’ she said in the six-minute video, using the abbreviation for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender. “That includes marriage.’’

Mrs. Clinton spoke in the video of the recent wedding of her own daughter, Chelsea, saying, “I wish every parent that same joy.’’

Mrs. Clinton and her family have longstanding ties to the Human Rights Campaign. The group’s president, Chad Griffin, was born in Hope, Ark. – Bill Clinton’s hometown – and got his start in politics volunteering for Mr. Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign. The former president and Chelsea Clinton expressed their support for same-sex marriage when it was under consideration in the New York State legislature.

And just last week, Mr. Clinton expressed his explicit support for overturning the federal Defense of Marriage Act, the 1996 law — which he signed — that requires the federal government to view marriage as between a man and a woman for legal purposes."

The Supreme Court handed down major victories for gay marriage. The Post’s Robert Barnes breaks down the DOMA and Proposition 8 decisions from the courthouse steps. (The Fold/The Washington Post)

An extraordinary finale to a history-making term once again revealed the Supreme Court to be Washington’s most unpredictable institution.

Or at least that’s how it must appear.

One day’s decision left essentially untouched the court’s controversial permission to let race play some role in college admissions. It was followed the next day by a decision overruling Congress and striking down the heart of the Voting Rights Act, which has protected minority voters for nearly half a century.

A year ago, a conservative court frequently at odds with President Obama and his administration ended its term by saving the president’s signature domestic achievement, the Affordable Care Act.

The follow-up this term was again a victory for the president on his most pressing item before the court: gay rights.

And so another term ended with surprising praise from the president.

At a news conference in Africa, Obama on Thursday declared the court’s 5 to 4 decision striking down the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act a “victory for American democracy.”

“I believe at the root of who we are as a people, who we are as Americans is the basic precept that we are all equal under the law,” Obama said. “We believe in basic fairness. And what I think yesterday’s ruling signifies is one more step towards ensuring that those basic principles apply to everybody.”

Said Pamela Harris, former head of the Georgetown Law Center’s Supreme Court Institute and a onetime Obama White House lawyer: “If you weren’t paying close attention, you might say, ‘What a liberal Supreme Court we have.’ ”

Roles on the bench

Instead, it is a court in which two men — Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy — play outsize roles. They are the keys to understanding the court’s sometimes contradictory messages, and that will likely be the case so long as they serve together.

Their influence changes with the cases that arise each term for the court.

This year was Kennedy’s term, partly because he is more moderate than his colleagues on both the left and the right, but also because he holds “a combination of views that are idiosyncratic,” said Richard Garnett, a Notre Dame law professor.

View Graphic The Supreme Court’s 2012-2013 term made history by striking down key elements of the Voting Rights Act and the Defense of Marriage Act, both in 5 to 4 decisions. See how agreement on the court breaks down in this interactive graphic.

They include a strong belief in state’s rights, an aversion to racial classifications and a somewhat libertarian view on issues of privacy, Garnett said. Kennedy has written the court’s most important gay rights decisions. That jurisprudence fit perfectly with the civil rights cases that ended up this year on the court’s docket.

In the three major cases that ended the court’s term — affirmative action in higher education, the Voting Rights Act and the Defense of Marriage Act — Kennedy was the only justice in the majority each time.

It’s a role he is eager to play.

“Justice Kennedy believes the court is the exclusive arbitrator of the Constitution,” said Walter Dellinger, a lawyer who served in the solicitor general’s office.

A line in Kennedy’s majority opinion in the DOMA case, saying the court must decide the case because of its “primary role in determining the constitutionality of a law,” drew scorn from a dissenting Justice Antonin Scalia.

“It is an assertion of judicial supremacy over the people’s Representatives in Congress and the Executive,” Scalia wrote. “It envisions a Supreme Court standing (or rather enthroned) at the apex of government, empowered to decide all constitutional questions, always and everywhere ‘primary’ in its role.”

Such concerns rang hollow to the court’s liberals, who were on the losing side in the voting rights case. They said that Kennedy and the right trampled over the 15th Amendment’s command that Congress pass laws protecting minority voting rights, and that the court should defer to that judgment.

“Where is the court’s usual restraint?” asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

Roberts’s function

But that is where Roberts played a key role, one that he seemed to have set up earlier in his tenure.

Racial classifications, increasingly unpopular with the public, are an enemy that Roberts and Kennedy share. Kennedy, who joined the court in 1988, has long held that view, and Roberts fought the practice as a young lawyer in the Reagan White House. In his first term on the court, in a case about minority voting districts, he denounced “this sordid business, divvying us up by race.”

He has similarly been critical of the way the Voting Rights Act singled out some states for special oversight. “Is it the government’s submission that the citizens in the South are more racist than citizens in the North?” he asked Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. during oral arguments in the challenge brought by Shelby County, Ala. But he has also been willing to bide his time.

In a case from 2009, he wrote that the court had serious questions about the formula used by Congress to decide which states should be subject to special oversight. When nothing was done, he used the Shelby County case to strike down the formula, effectively ending the oversight and saying Congress had left the court “no choice.”

The on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand decisions on minority rights and same-sex marriage might strike the public as balancing. Polls show the public has a generally favorable opinion of the court. Although a majority of the justices were appointed by Republican presidents, polls show Democrats actually have a higher opinion of it.

And some of the court’s alignments on less-noticed cases defy classifications. Several times this term Scalia teamed with the liberals on criminal procedure issues, for instance.

Steven R. Shapiro, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, has been frank in the past about wanting to keep some issues that his organization cares about away from Supreme Court review.

But this year, his group prevailed in four of the six cases in which it participated. “It is a complex institution dealing with complex issues,” he said.

Eric Posner, a law professor at the University of Chicago, said it will not be good for the court if the term is remembered for the Voting Rights Act and DOMA decisions, both of which he found poorly reasoned. When the court appears to be striking down legislation with which it simply disagrees, he said, “that can create a backlash.”"

(CNN) - Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri announced her support for same-sex marriage on Monday, joining high-profile names on both sides of the aisle who have endorsed the right for gay couples to legally wed.

""I have come to the conclusion that our government should not limit the right to marry based on who you love,"" she wrote on her Tumblr page. ""While churches should never be required to conduct marriages outside of their religious beliefs, neither should the government tell people who they have a right to marry.""

Her public endorsement comes as the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments this week on challenges to Proposition 8, the voter-approved same-sex marriage ban in California, as well as the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a 1996 congressional law that says for federal purposes, marriage is defined as only between one man and one woman.

Republican Sen. Rob Portman also reversed his stance on the issue and announced his support earlier this month, citing his gay son as a big reason for his change of heart. Last week, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also publicly backed the issue.

And in February, a chorus of prominent Republicans, including former GOP presidential candidate Jon Huntsman, signed onto an amicus brief that advocated for the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex marriage.

McCaskill, who was recently sworn into a second term and is not up for re-election until 2018, says her views have ""changed over time""

""As many of my gay and lesbian friends, colleagues and staff embrace long term committed relationships, I find myself unable to look them in the eye without honestly confronting this uncomfortable inequality,"" she wrote, adding that her decision is ""simply the right thing to do.""

McCaskill was considered one of the most vulnerable Democrats in 2012 but survived re-election after her Republican opponent, Rep. Todd Akin, made controversial comments about rape.

The senator, in posting her announcement, also cited a Bible verse: I Corinthians 13, which says ""And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.""

""Good people disagree with me,"" she wrote. ""On the other hand, my children have a hard time understanding why this is even controversial. I think history will agree with my children.""

A majority of Supreme Court justices expressed concern Wednesday about a federal law that bars same sex marriage, signaling the nation's highest court may be poised to extend a potentially historic victory to the gay rights movement.

Hearing arguments in the second of two major gay marriage cases over two days, the probing questions from both wings of the court suggest the Defense of Marriage Act, which bars the federal government from recognizing same sex marriage in states where it is legal, could be struck down. Such a decision would be breakthrough for supporters of same sex nuptials, who until now have measured progress at a state by state level.

But the fundamental question of whether gay couples can marry in the U.S. will most likely not be settled by the court this time. Striking down DOMA would likely benefit only married same sex couples in the nine states (and the District of Columbia) where their marriages are legal. And a day earlier, justices hinted they might toss a challenge to Prop 8, a California law banning gay marriage, on procedural grounds.

Justices across the spectrum Wednesday seemed troubled by DOMA, which was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1996. Clinton has since announced his opposition to the law.

The court's conservative leaning justices asked pointed questions about whether the law was anti-federalist, since it intrudes into states' traditional right to regulate marriage. The more liberal justices seemed amenable to the argument that DOMA discriminates against gay people and was passed with the clear intention of excluding an unpopular group.

Justices could strike down the law in a narrow way that would force the federal government to recognize same-sex marriages only in states where it's already allowed. There's a chance the court could rule more broadly, making dozens of state gay marriage bans legally vulnerable. Such an expansive ruling from the court is considered much less likely.

Story continues

The Justice Department would typically defend a federal law being challenged in the Supreme Court, but he Obama administration has declined to do so because it believes it is unconstitutional. Paul Clement, an attorney chosen by House Republicans who support DOMA, defended it instead.

Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative-leaning swing vote who has written two landmark opinions affirming gay rights, seemed unconvinced by the argument advanced by Clement that DOMA defines marriage as only between opposite-sex couples to avoid confusion. Clement said that the federal government has an interest in ""uniformity,"" and had passed the law to avoid having to treat same-sex couples differently based on whether they live in states that allow gay marriage or not.

Kennedy pointed out that DOMA excludes married same-sex couples in more than 1,100 federal statutes and laws, which has a substantial impact on the ""day to day life"" of those couples and their children. He said the law does not provide uniformity because it affects ""only one aspect of marriage.""

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said excluding married gay couples from sick leave, tax benefits, Social Security survivor benefits, and hundreds of other federal benefits and obligations, relegates same-sex couples to a ""skim milk marriage"" that is substantially worse than what heterosexual couples are allowed.

Justice Elena Kagan suggested that the law was not passed for uniformity's sake, but to discriminate. She read aloud from the House report on the law when it passed 17 years ago saying it expressed ""moral disapproval of homosexuality.""

Chief Justice John Roberts objected to the argument that Congress passed DOMA based on a dislike or hatred for gays and lesbians. He asked Attorney General Donald Verrilli, representing the Obama administration, whether he believed the 84 senators who voted for it at the time were all motivated by animus. Verrilli said the lawmakers could have voted for DOMA due to a ""lack of careful reflection,"" but that the law discriminates no matter why it was passed.

Roberts also objected to Attorney Roberta Kaplan's characterization of gay people as a disadvantaged minority group lacking political power.

""As far as I can tell, political figures are falling over themselves to endorse your case,"" Roberts said.

But Roberts did seem concerned by the federalist argument. He, Kennedy and Justice Samuel Alito posed tough questions about whether the federal government was overreaching with the statute. Kennedy said DOMA did not seem to recognize states's ""historical"" responsibility for marriage and suggested the central question of the case is whether the federal government has the authority to regulate marriage.

Both attorneys arguing to strike down DOMA refused to make a federalist argument against the law, however -- instead insisting it was a discrimination case.

Before even getting to the merits of the case, the justices spent nearly an hour grappling with whether they should decide it at all because of procedural issues.They appointed Harvard professor Vicki Jackson to make the case that House Republicans do not have the legal right, or standing, to appeal the lower court's decision.

Several justices were also critical of the Obama administration's decision to stop defending the law in court while still enforcing it. Roberts appeared to have serious doubts about the case's procedural issues, repeatedly saying that it is ""unprecedented"" for the U.S. government to appeal a case even when the parties agreed with a lower court's ruling.

The two gay marriage cases before the court this term have been dogged by procedural concerns, as both were left orphaned by public officials who no longer wanted to defend them.

On Tuesday, Kennedy wondered whether the court should have agreed to hear the Proposition 8 case at all. Other justices suggested they were skeptical that supporters of Proposition 8 had standing to appeal the case once California officials decided to drop it.

It's possible that neither case could end with a decision. In DOMA, that means the lower court's decision would stand and DOMA would be illegal in the Third Circuit. The plaintiff, Edith Windsor, would be repaid the $360,000 she had to pay in estate taxes when her wife died because the government didn't recognize her marriage in New York, where gay marriage is legal. In the Proposition 8 case, gay marriage would most likely become legal in California if the justices throw it out on standing or do not reach a majority."

(CNN) —

The Supreme Court will hear arguments this week in two same-sex marriage cases. Whatever the justices do, the outcome seems foreordained. When 80% of Americans under 30 agree about something, that something will happen – it’s only a matter of time.

But while straight young Americans support marriage for gays, increasingly they opt against marriage for themselves. Nearly half of American children, 48%, are now born to unmarried women. Among women without college degrees, and of all races, unwed motherhood has become the norm.

This is the crisis of the American family. Whether same-sex marriage proceeds fast or slow, whether it extends to all 50 states or stops with the current nine plus the District of Columbia, the crisis will be the same.

Marriage and the Supreme Court: Five things to watch

Chuck Kennedy David Frum

Children born to single parents face much longer odds in life than children born to married parents. (A new study by ThirdWay.org suggests that the harms are especially intense for boys, less so for girls.) “Odds” are not rules, of course. There are always exceptions.

On average, however, children born to married mothers and fathers are more likely to finish college, more likely to avoid prison and more likely to form marriages themselves than children born to single parents. And precisely because the harms of single parenthood tend to be self-replicating, the breakdown of marriage threatens to harden into a caste divide, with some families launched into cycles of downward mobility because of the unstable relationships of parents or grandparents or great-grandparents.

For 20 years, Americans have fiercely debated whether gays – who constitute maybe 3% of the population – should be allowed to marry each other. Meanwhile, Americans have given short shrift to what is happening to the 97% of the population that is allowed to marry, but increasingly opts not to do so.

One reason we’ve given the single-parenthood problem short shrift is that we lack good ideas about how to address it. The core of the problem seems to be the decline of male wages relative to female wages. The New York Times this week quoted an MIT economist, Michael Greenstone:

“I think the greatest, most astonishing fact that I am aware of in social science right now is that women have been able to hear the labor market screaming out ‘You need more education’ and have been able to respond to that, and men have not. And it’s very, very scary for economists because people should be responding to price signals. And men are not. It’s a fact in need of an explanation.”

As men (on average) finish less education, as male wages (on average) decline, men become less attractive as marital partners. As Harvard’s Christopher Jencks – a left-leaning academic, it should be stressed – said in that same New York Times piece: “Single-parent families tend to emerge in places where the men already are a mess.”

Sutter: The county where no one’s gay

But how do we make men without a college education less of a mess? This is the master problem of American society, and not only American society. Everywhere in the developed world, the decline of mass-production industries has put pressure on the roles and incomes of working-class and middle-class men. The expansion of government and service industries has opened new opportunities for women, of which working-class and middle-class men seem less able to avail themselves.

It’s important to note that men in full-time work continue to earn more than women in full-time work.

But that bottom-line number conceals a widening divergence between the family patterns of the college-educated top one-third, where family life is increasingly stable, and those of the non-college-educated bottom two-thirds, where family life is increasingly disrupted.

It’s the family life of the bottom two-thirds that is the family policy challenge of the 21st century. The debate over same-sex marriage is yesteryear’s issue. It’s settled, whether the Supreme Court knows it or not. But how to ensure that the next generation of American children enjoys the more equal chance and the wider opportunities from a more universal commitment to marriage – that debate needs to begin.

What does the bible say about homosexuality?

Leviticus 20:13 states, “If there is a man who lies with a male

as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a

detestable act; they shall surely be put to death."" Their blood

guiltiness is upon them.”

Romans 1:27 states in part, “the men abandoned the natural

function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another,

men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own

persons the due penalty of their error.”

These are just two of the verses that Christians quote to say

homosexuality is against the will of God. It is a detestable act and

they should die. Indecent. A sin. Verses used to condemn. Used to

fuel the fire of hatred and discrimination. You are not normal.

Something is wrong with you. Used to convert the homosexual into a

heterosexual.

There is another verse that is virtually ignored by Christians.

It simply states the reality of homosexuality. It goes against the

prevailing belief of many Christians that homosexuality is a sin

because it does not condemn. The verse says, “For there are eunuchs

who are born thus from their mothers womb, and there are eunuchs who

are made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who are eunuchs for the

kingdom of heavens sake. Let those who can accept it, accept it.”

Matthew 19:12.

What does a eunuch have to do with homosexuality? The question

should be: What is a eunuch? According to Webster’s dictionary a

eunuch is a “castrated man, esp. one employed in a harem.” Then the

question that follows: What is castrate? “Remove the testicles,

deprive of the power of generation.” In other words, a eunuch is a

male that had his testicles surgically removed which makes it

biologically impossible for him to impregnate a female.

The definition of a eunuch does not make any sense in the first

part of Matthew 19:12. The verse said “For there are eunuchs born

thus from their mother's womb.“ How can a man who's testicles were

surgically removed be “born thus from his mothers womb?” “Born thus”

does not include anything that involves surgical alteration. “Born

thus” exclusively includes the way God made him. The way he developed

in the womb, physically and mentally. So who is the eunuch that is

“born thus?”

To find the eunuch that is “born thus” one needs to read the

chapter from the beginning. This section of the chapter talks about

marriage that is an intimate physical relationship traditionally

between a male and female. The last words used in many Christian

marriage ceremonies is found there, “what God has joined together let

no man separate.” It also talks about adultery and divorce. One is

the betrayal and the other the ending of an intimate physical

relationship.

Following this discussion the question is asked, “His disciples

said to Him, “If such is the case of the man with his wife, it is

better not to marry?” But he said to them, “all cannot accept this

saying, but only those to whom it has been given.” Matthew 19:10

and 11. Scholars tend to think that Matthew 19:12 speaks of people

apart from the normal heterosexual relationships because of the

question the disciples asked. The surgically altered eunuch is

outside the normal heterosexual relationship and is more aptly

explained by : “eunuchs who are made eunuchs by men.” Then there

are “eunuchs who are eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake.” Monks

and priests who have either taken a vow of celibacy and /or castrated

are outside normal heterosexual relationships. But who is the eunuch

that is outside normal heterosexual relationships and is “born thus

from his mother's womb?”

Homosexuality, say Christians, is a lifestyle choice. Homosexuals

say that it is not a lifestyle choice, it is the way God made them.

The way they were born. Since Matthew 19 begins with a discussion of

heterosexual intimate physical relationships and then tells of eunuchs

apart from normal heterosexual relationships there is only one

explanation of to the eunuch “born thus” refers.

As shown, the Bible contradicts itself on the subject of

homosexuality. Leviticus and Romans condemn while Matthew just accepts

it as a reality. What are Christians to believe about homosexuality?

In general, Christians believe the Bible is the literal word of

God. God inspired Moses to write Leviticus 20:13 and God inspired

Paul to write Romans 1:27. Who are Moses and Paul? Both men are

revered in Christianity as truly great men, but despite all they did

and wrote they are only two human, imperfect, mortal men.

In general, Christians attribute the words in Matthew 19:12 to

be the actual spoken words of Jesus himself. Who is Jesus? Jesus is,

in the Trinitarian view, the son of God, the Messiah, the Christ,

perfect, sinless, immortal, divine. “The word became flesh.” The

essence of God in the flesh. Three manifestations of God. Father,

son, and holy spirit. Jesus is the human embodiment in the trinity

of God. Then, in the Trinitarian view, the words of Matthew 19:12 are

words spoken by God himself.

My question to the Trinitarian: What words are you going to

believe? Whose words are you going to follow? The words of imperfect

mortal men or the words spoken by God?

What about the Christians who do not hold the Trinitarian view?

Whatever word or words used to describe who Jesus is, in the many

facets of Christianity, the authority of Jesus is greater than any

other figure in the Bible. He is the Messiah, the Christ, the son of

God, or the son of man. The question remains the same. Whose words

are you going to follow? “He who is able to accept it, let him accept

it.” Jesus understood the reality of homosexuality. Why not

Christians?

Judaism traditionally views homosexuality as a detestable act as

written in Leviticus. What would the Book of Matthew have to do with

Jews? The Book of Matthew is the transformation of Judaism to

Christianity. It clearly has the Judaic perspective until the end of

the book and diverges into Christianity. Chapter 19 is well before the

end of the book and not yet tainted by the transformation. Leviticus

was written, at least, two or three thousand years before Matthew.

This suggests a change in the Judaic view of homosexuality. Over the

last two thousand years this view has been lost or forgotten. A

change from the “detestable act; they shall surely be put to death”

to a more humane “born thus” view.

What about the atheist or agnostic who views homosexuality as wrong?

The only way to answer them is in a historical perspective. The

colonization and conquest of the Americas was primarily done with

technological superiority. Bows and arrows against guns and cannons.

The Europeans brought their Christian culture with them to the

Americas. In the process of exterminating the “savage” Indian, the

European colonists missed a culture that was superior in many ways.

For example, Indian culture lacked the extreme poverty that was seen

throughout Europe at the time. In many ways the Indian tribal culture

was more highly developed and compassionate than that of Europe.

While the European and American Christian culture saw homosexuality

as a sin, homosexuals among the American Indians were accepted and

valued members of the village.

Why do so many see homosexuality as wrong? Ignorance? Yes. To

promote an agenda? Yes. Male heterosexual aversion to homosexuality?

Again, Yes. If none of the preceding arguments convince you then you

will never be convinced. It is the narrowness of the mind that blinds

the truth. After speaking of the eunuchs Jesus said, “All cannot

accept this saying, but only those to whom it has been given.”

SALT LAKE CITY (RNS) -- In the week since a federal judge overturned Utah’s ban on same-sex marriage, the number of weddings in the state has skyrocketed, shattering records and accruing thousands of dollars for Utah’s 29 counties.

As of close of business Thursday (Dec. 26), more than 1,225 marriage licenses had been issued in Utah since last Friday (Dec. 20). Of those, at least 74 percent, or 905 licenses, were issued to gay and lesbian couples.

Marriage licenses in Utah cost between $30 and $50, depending on the county.

With an average marriage license costing $40, counties in Utah made a grand total of more than $49,000 in the three-and-a-half days most county clerk’s offices were open this week.

About three-quarters of that money came from gay and lesbian couples seeking marriage licenses in the immediate aftermath of U.S. District Judge Robert J. Shelby’s ruling that overturned a statewide ban on same-sex marriages.

Salt Lake County shattered a previously held record of 85 marriages in a given day, by handing out 353 on Monday (Dec. 23) — the first full day of issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

On the other hand, Piute, a small county of about 1,500 people in the center of the state, was of several counties with no takers. Had any Piute couples requested a license, they would have been denied anyway.

County Clerk Valeen Brown is on vacation until Monday (Dec. 30), officials said. So, Piute officials suspended all marriage license activity until Brown returns.

Utah County — which made national news this week when Shelly Eyre and her partner Cheryl Haws declared that they would sue its clerk for denying gay and lesbian couples — was doling out certificates Thursday to all.

“Moving forward, we probably won’t keep track of how many same-sex couples versus opposite-sex couples we issue licenses to,” said Bryan Thompson, the county’s clerk and auditor. “I don’t see any reason to differentiate between them.”

http://news.yahoo.com/utah-asks-supreme-court-block-same-sex-unions-205801270--politics.html,,[],Utah asks Supreme Court to block same-sex unions,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Utah took its fight against gay marriage to the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday, asking the high court to suspend same-sex unions that became legal when a judge struck down the state's voter-approved ban.

The heavily Mormon state wants the marriages to stop while it appeals a judge's decision, which said banning gay couples from marrying violates their right to equal treatment under the law.

In papers filed Tuesday, the state asked Justice Sonia Sotomayor to overturn a decision that has led to more than 900 gay marriages in Utah. Sotomayor handles emergency requests from Utah and other Rocky Mountain states.

Sotomayor responded by setting a deadline of by noon Friday for legal briefs from same-sex couples. She can act by herself or get the rest of the court involved.

""Numerous same-sex marriages are now occurring every day in Utah,"" Utah lawyers complain in the filing. ""Each one is an affront not only to the interests of the state and its citizens in being able to define marriage through ordinary democratic channels, but also to this court's unique role as final arbiter.""

Also Tuesday, the Utah Attorney General's Office advertised a formal bid request to outside law firms for help preparing the appeals.

State officials have said it could cost $2 million, bringing criticism from a lawyer for couples who sued to overturn the ban and say Utah should give up the fight.

""We are disappointed that Utah will spend millions of dollars in taxpayer's money, to attempt to reinstate laws which deny due process and equal protection to all of Utah's citizens,"" the lawyer, James Magleby, said Tuesday.

Utah insists that states have the authority to define marriage as between a man and woman. ""That states have a powerful interest in controlling the definition of marriage within their borders is indisputable,"" Utah said in the filing.

U.S. District Judge Robert Shelby's decision on Dec. 20 came as a shock to many in the state, which approved the ban on same-sex marriage in 2004.

Story continues

Shelby and the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals have already refused to halt weddings while the state appeals what it calls a ""rush to marry."" Magleby argued that because so many couples have already married, ""there is no emergency need for a stay.""

Shelby's decision came late on a Friday afternoon and sent people rushing to a county clerk's office in Salt Lake City — about 3 miles from the headquarters of the Mormon church — for marriage licenses. The following Monday, 353 more gay and lesbian couples grabbed a license, some camping out overnight to get in line early the next morning.

After the 10th Circuit Court refused to halt the ruling, the few county clerks who had refused to issue licenses changed course. Officials say things have slowed down after a run on marriage licenses that started hours after Shelby's decision.

Since then, Gov. Gary Herbert has directed state agencies to comply with Shelby's order, meaning gay couples are eligible for food stamps and welfare, among other benefits. The state Tax Commission said it was looking at changing tax returns to allow same-sex couples to file jointly, although it didn't immediately give assurances that will happen.

Nearly two-thirds of Utah's 2.8 million residents are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and Mormons dominate the state's legal and political circles. The Mormon church was one of the leading forces behind California's short-lived ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8.

The church says it stands by its support for ""traditional marriage"" and hopes a higher court validates its belief that marriage is between a man and woman.

In the papers filed Tuesday, Utah argues that children are best raised by a mother and father in a good relationship.

""On average children navigate developmental stages more easily, perform better academically, have fewer emotional disorders and become better functioning adults when reared in that environment,"" it says."

That means the political fight will go on and on. Yes, the new conventional wisdom is that gay-rights advocates are certain to win the war, but, without a clear declaration from the high court that marriage equality is a constitutional right, there are many battles yet to be fought. And the easy ones are largely over. Getting approval of same-sex marriage in places such as Washington or California or the liberal Northeast is a cinch compared to what it will take to change hearts and minds and laws in states such as Alabama and Oklahoma and Utah.

A very hard task remains and the irony is that, for heterosexuals, getting married is ridiculously easy. Any pair of drunk, heterosexual fools in Las Vegas can fall in love over the craps table, run off to find an all-night chapel and wake to find themselves with hangovers, cheap wedding rings and membership in the sacred club of husbands and wives.

In 2004, Britney Spears showed up at the Little White Wedding Chapel in Vegas and married her childhood friend, Jason Allen Alexander, only to have their union annulled 55 hours later. Britney is hardly the only celebrity to have perfected the art of marriage as a short-lived publicity stunt (take a bow, Kim Kardashian!). Then there was blond bimbo Anna Nicole Smith who married an 89-year-old billionaire without having to prove it was for love, not for the inheritance.

Many fabled movie stars – Elizabeth Taylor and Zsa Zsa Gabor come immediately to mind – adored being married and had the multiple spouses to prove it. Marital antics are not just a Hollywood thing, though. No matter who they are or where they live or how many times they may have proved inept at matrimony or just plain unwise in the choice of a mate, anybody can get married and divorced and married over and over again – as long as he or she is not gay.

Meth addicts and gang-bangers can legally tie the knot and often do – sometime after the births of their children and before their own premature death. Even inmates in prison are sometimes allowed to marry. But two men who have built a home and spent devoted, monogamous decades together still cannot get married in most states.

That is not to say that gay people will prove to be any more successful and smart at marriage than straight Americans. I already am acquainted with two lesbian couples who married as soon as they could do it legally and divorced within a couple of years. Homosexuals are human. They will be just as foolish and unskilled at creating wedded bliss as the rest of us. But if a couple of gay guys or lesbian gals want to swill Gimlets and Cosmopolitans and then stagger to the altar at some neon-lit Las Vegas wedding chapel, they should have as much right to their folly as any other Americans."

Gays hoping to join the Boy Scouts will have to wait until at least May after the organization’s executive board put off a vote on lifting its outright ban on openly homosexual scouts and troop leaders.

The board had been expected to vote Wednesday on a proposal to let local groups set their own policies, but said instead that it needs more time to get comment on the issue from its members.

“After careful consideration and extensive dialogue within the Scouting family, along with comments from those outside the organization, the volunteer officers of the Boy Scouts of America’s National Executive Board concluded that due to the complexity of this issue, the organization needs time for a more deliberate review of its membership policy,” the board said in a written statement.

The decision will now be made at the organization’s annual meeting in May. About 1,400 members of the group’s national council will take part during that gathering, the board said.

In the meantime, the organization will “further engage representatives of Scouting’s membership and listen to their perspectives and concerns.”

Opinion: Ban on gays hurts Scouting

The decision disappointed critics who had hoped to see the organization end its ban despite a 2000 Supreme Court ruling saying it had the right to keep it.

“Every day that the Boy Scouts of America delay action is another day that discrimination prevails,” said Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin. “Now is the time for action. Young Americans, gay and straight, are hurt by the inaction associated with today’s news. The BSA leadership should end this awful policy once and for all, and open the proud tradition of Scouting to all.”

Others hope the delay will provide time to lobby the Boy Scouts to scrap the plan.

“This issue is not a gay rights issue,” said Utah scout leader Eric Montague. “It’s a gender attraction issue and it’s also a politics issue. As a local scout leader, I don’t need to worry about gay rights – that shouldn’t be my role; that shouldn’t be what I do. And to push that decision upon me is not the best way to go.”

Conservative groups and some religious organizations have argued against making any change, saying it would dilute the Boy Scout message of morality and potentially destroy the organization.

The Boy Scouts announced last month that the organization would consider changing the policy, a sharp reversal of its previous support for excluding openly gay members and scout leaders.

The new policy would allow local leaders to decide “consistent with each organization’s mission, principles or religious beliefs” whether to open troops they sponsor to openly gay people, the group said in a statement at the time.

The proposal comes more than a decade after a Supreme Court ruling that found the organization has the right to keep gays out, but also amid declining participation in the venerable American institution.

Membership in Boy Scouts has declined by about a third since 1999. About 2.7 million people now participate in scouting nationwide, with more than 70% of troops affiliated with a church or religious groups.

The organization has also endured frequent criticism from gay rights groups and other critics who say the Boy Scouts should not endorse discrimination.

Activists hail a watershed moment in gay rights movement

Among more recent controversies, the organization came under fire last year after Jennifer Tyrrell, an Ohio den leader, was dismissed by her local Boy Scout officials for being a lesbian.

On Tuesday, Tyrell delivered a petition she said was signed by 1.4 million people supporting the change.

Before Wednesday’s announcement of the delay, she said she was looking forward to the change, but added it would not go far enough.

“If this ban is lifted, it’s a great first step,” she said Wednesday on CNN’s “Starting Point.” “But it’s still going to lead to kids being rejected. Families are still going to be turned away.”

Brandy Pryde, a troop leader who participated in a prayer vigil outside the Boy Scouts headquarters Wednesday, said her church would pull support from scouting if the change goes through.

“What happens when we go camping and there’s units that allow gays and homosexuals and there’s units that don’t, how are we going to keep them separated from those units and how are we going to instill in our kids Christian values and the biblical truth if that’s allowed in our program?” she said.

A poll released Monday suggests the public is in favor of lifting the ban. The poll, conducted January 30 to February 4 by Quinnipiac University, found 55% of respondents favored lifting the ban. The school said 33% were opposed. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.3 percentage points.

President Barack Obama, who is honorary president of the national organization by virtue of his office, also supports opening troops to everyone.

On Wednesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the administration had no comment on the Boy Scouts decision.

“You know that the president believes the Boy Scouts is a valuable organization that has helped educate and build character in American boys for more than a century,” Carney said. “He also, as you know, opposes discrimination in all forms. And as such, believes – as he said just on Sunday – that gay Americans ought to be able to participate in the Boy Scouts. But in terms of the process of their evaluation of their policies, I don’t have a comment.”

Conservative politicians and religious leaders have said that changing the policy would dilute the organization’s voice and mission.

Scouting goes through a rough patch

Some, including former Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum, have argued the change could destroy scouting. Richard Land of the Southern Baptist Convention said the change could be a “catastrophe.”

“What they’ve said to us and to other religious leaders is that they are doing this under pressure, and we’re going to give people what basically amounts to a local option,” Land said. “You can’t have a local option of a core conviction.”

Changing the policy against having openly gay leaders or Scouts “would be a grave mistake,” the conservative Family Research Council and dozens of other groups said in a half-page ad in USA Today this week.

The message called on the Boy Scouts to “show courage” and “stand firm for timeless values.”

“Every American who believes in freedom of thought and religious liberty should be alarmed by the attacks upon the Boy Scouts, who have had core convictions about morality for 100 years,” the ad said. “Every Scout takes an oath to keep himself ‘morally straight.’ The Boy Scouts have every right to include sexual conduct in how they define that term.”

But others say scouting is suffering because of its policy on gays, not despite it.

Eagle Scout Zach Wahls, founder of Scouts for Equality, says the ban has backfired.

When he was 10, Wahls’ Cub Scout pack had to find a new home because the Boy Scouts of America’s policy violated the nondiscrimination rule of the school district that hosted it.

“I was confused, because my den mother, Jackie – who is my actual mother – was a lesbian, and nobody in our unit had any issue with that,” Wahls wrote. The pack managed to find another sponsor – a nearby church – but “some parents pulled their kids from the pack, uncomfortable with entrusting their sons to an organization they believed engaged in discrimination.”

Roberts Jr.

“I am so excited,” said Podrasky, an accountant and the first cousin of the chief justice on his mother’s side. “I feel quite honored and overwhelmed.”

Roberts is a conservative appointed by President George W. Bush in 2005. Podrasky, who is more liberal, said she rooted for his nomination to be approved by the U.S. Senate. “He is family,” she said.

Podrasky lives in San Francisco and usually sees Roberts only on family occasions. His mother is her godmother, whom she adores. She said Roberts knows she is gay and introduced her along with other relatives during his Senate confirmation hearing. She hopes he will meet her partner of four years, Grace Fasano, during their Washington visit. The couple flew to Washington on Sunday.

“He is a smart man,” she said. “He is a good man. I believe he sees where the tide is going. I do trust him. I absolutely trust that he will go in a good direction.”

Podrasky obtained the highly coveted courtroom seats by emailing Roberts’ sister, Peggy Roberts, and then going through his secretary. Roberts knows she is attending, she said. She, her partner, her sister and her niece will attend Tuesday’s arguments on Proposition 8. On Wednesday, her father will take her niece’s place for the hearing on the challenge to the Defense of Marriage Act.

TIMELINE: Gay marriage across the U.S.

Although Podrasky has no personal knowledge of her cousin’s views on same-sex marriage, she expects the court will overturn the 2008 ballot initiative, leaving her free to marry Fasano.

“I am definitely ready,” she said.

In the weeks before the November 2008 election, Podrasky carried a sign that said, “Prop. 8 is hate,” at a BART station and handed out fliers on a college campus. She called the passage of the gay marriage ban “such a blow.”

The San Francisco-based National Center for Lesbian Rights, which has fought for marriage rights, invited Podrasky to do a guest column about being related to the chief justice. The column will be emailed to members Monday.

“Everyone in this country has a family member who is part of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community…,” she wrote. “As a Californian, I want nothing more than to marry my wonderful girlfriend. And as a tax-paying citizen, I seek basic fairness.”

She said she does not know whether having a lesbian family member would influence Roberts’ thinking.

“Everybody knows somebody” who is gay, she said. “It probably impacts everybody.”

Mary Cheney, one of ex-Vice President Dick Cheney’s two daughters, has taken to Facebook to blast her older sibling, Elizabeth, a Wyoming Senate candidate, for the latter’s stance on same-sex marriage, The New York Times is reporting.

Mary Cheney, openly lesbian and married to Heather Poe since 2012, reportedly posted to her personal page on the social media site: “For the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage.

“Freedom means freedom for everyone. That means that all families — regardless of how they look or how they are made — all families are entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other.”

[pullquote]

The Times reports Liz Cheney on Friday first articulated her position on the controversial subject, saying it should be something for voters to decide on a state-by-state basis, and not a matter for “judges” or “legislators.”

“I am not pro-gay marriage,” Liz Cheney reportedly said. “I believe the issue of marriage must be decided by the states, and by the people in the states, not by judges and not even by legislators, but by the people themselves.”

Her sister replied by pulling no punches.

“It’s not something to be decided by a show of hands,” Mary Cheney reportedly wrote on her personal Facebook page, concluding her internecine post by saying, “Please like and share if you agree.”

Elizabeth Cheney declared in July she plans to challenge incumbent Senator Mike Enzi, also a Republican, in the state’s Republican primary. The election is slated for 2014.

Former Vice President Cheney has publicly voiced support for same-sex marriage and, mirroring Elizabeth’s stance, has reportedly said the matter should be decided on a state-by-state basis."

DOMA has been declared unconstitutional in several lower courts

The 1996 law defines marriage as between a man and a woman

It%27s possible the justices ultimately will sidestep a far-reaching decision

The Supreme Court turns Wednesday from the threshold issue of sanctioning same-sex marriage to one with financial repercussions: Can the federal government deny benefits to those already married?

At issue is the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a 1996 law passed overwhelmingly by Congress and signed by President Clinton that defines marriage as between a man and a woman. (Clinton has said he has changed his mind about the law.) At the time of its passage, no states had legalized gay marriage, but now nine states and the District of Columbia have done so — and legally wed gay couples are denied federal benefits.

The case accepted by the court from among several it could have taken features Edith Windsor, an 83-year-old New York widow who married her partner of four decades, Thea Spyer, in 2007. When Spyer died in 2009, Windsor was socked with a $363,000 estate tax bill that she would have avoided if Thea had been ""Theo.""

Now in failing health but a hero within the gay rights community, Windsor is expected to be in court today to hear her lawyer present her case. And not only her lawyer — the federal government also takes her side, which is both a benefit and a potential curse.

As was the case Tuesday, the unusual array of plaintiffs and respondents presents the court with some initial questions to hash out. The federal government is no longer defending its own law and has joined forces with its opponents. So is there any dispute left? And can the House Republican leadership, which has taken up the defense of DOMA, replace the Obama administration in court?

Those questions will be debated for nearly an hour before the two sides get to the merits of the case. It's possible the justices ultimately will sidestep a far-reaching decision when they issue their ruling, most likely in late June.

The justices could have avoided taking the Proposition 8 case, but they were forced to tackle DOMA because it had been declared unconstitutional in several lower courts. They chose from among overlapping cases, including challenges to the law from New England, New York and California.

The plaintiffs in those cases — married same-sex couples, widows and widowers in states where gay marriage is or previously was legal — are seeking the same federal benefits accorded opposite-sex couples."

It is the same unit (3) recognized by the laws of nature, the (4) laws of government, and (5) civilized societies for thousands of years: (6) one man, married to one woman, with so many children as God should see fit to entrust to their care through birth or adoption.

If that happens, the high priests and priestesses of political correctness will have done irreparable harm to yet another pillar of the American paradigm for our patriotic, wholesome culture — “God, the flag, mom and apple pie.”

The Obama administration makes the incredible assertion that motherhood is superfluous to rebut an argument that the traditional two-parent family, led by both a mother and a father, provides the ideal situation to raise a child. In defiance of biology, nature and common sense, the administration argues that children need neither a father nor a mother and that having two fathers or two mothers or more is just as good as having one of each.

Government, both federal and state, has a legitimate and defensible interest in ensuring that children conceived by a mother and father are, in fact, raised by their biological mothers and fathers whenever possible.

(1) Says you. (2) Except the ""multiple wives"" ones. (3) There is no ""marriage"" at all in the ""laws of nature"", and you have no earthly clue what the ""laws of nature"" even might be, and ""family"" in nature is the result of anything from pair bonding to harems to gang rape to ritual murder to situational hermaphroditism to the male of the species biting the female upon which his body is slowly dissolved and absorbed into the female until only only the testicles are left, so shut up about what the supposed laws of nature say we should be doing to get ourselves in a family way and (4) see (2), and (5) see (2) and (4) and a whole mess of civilized societies who thought having a young boy on the side was the purest form of love there could be and (6) I'm just going to point out, yet a-freaking-gain, that the whole concept of ""marriage"" has been for nearly all of human history a question of property rights, and the spouse counted as a useful but not necessarily decisive portion of the property. I now have an absolute hatred for the sack that is Tim Huelskamp because he managed to hork up nearly every self-centered, pompous-assed non-argument used by outright morons in the span of one quick paragraph, and there really ought to be a rule saying if you do that the general citizenrygets to put you in the official congressional Dunk Tank and start flinging balls until somebody gets lucky.God damn it, here we have a person honestly using ""God, the flag, mom and apple pie"" as the pillars of ""the American paradigm,"" and they're not doing it ironically, neither the ""apple pie"" or the ""paradigm"" part. No, Tim here means it literally, and goes on to say that Bloomberg's soda ban and Michelle Obama's gentle-but-possibly-Hitlerish suggestions that our nation's kids get up off their fat asses every once in a while means that apple pie is under attack. This screed isn't an April Fool's prank, this is a April Fool's way of life, preached about by an April Fool's mind, taken as a holy god damn April Fool's sacrament.You are an idiot, and nobody's arguing anything about that, and by the way you are an idiot. Do you think—and we're just going to explore this for one second, before my migraine ends this entire path of debate—that if we do not allow same-sex marriage, those children are suddenly going to get a mom and a dad? That there are gay couples out there who, if we deny same-sex marriage, will say, ""Oh, rats, well, I guess I am now going to form a lifelong partnership with the opposite gender, which will suck for me but now my hypothetical future child will at least have appropriate biological nurturing."" No. This does not happen. I hate you for thinking that this will somehow happen—that the only thing standing between every child and the one-man, one-woman parenting that a great many of them do not currently have is to deny gay Americans certain legal and tax structurings.You, Tim Huelskamp, are a monster. Here you say that children should be raised by their biological mothers and fathers, and yet you say yourself that you've adopted four of them. You are a terrible person. Those children will never know the love of a genetically related male/female pairing placed in that prime nurturing role, and I can only assume it's because you, you bastard, adopted them rather than letting them rot in an orphanage or on the streets where they could get a better appreciation of why it is they would want that thing.

I don't even want to go through all of Huelskamp's drivel; it's all just a collection of other people's most vapid thoughts, dumbed down, beaten up, then put in The Sack and tossed into op-ed form. It hurts. But the main argument, such as it is, is that if we let gay marriage take place then gay people are going to somehow god damn take our god damn children and raise them in god damn non-preferentially-biological households because god damn magic, and it would be better to not allow marriage equality at all than allow that. He's not even talking about ""gay Americans should not adopt children"", which would be at least something vaguely approaching the point he roughly purports to be orbiting around, he's saying that the Supreme Court recognizing same-sex relationships as existing things at all is an affront to ""motherhood"" and ""God"" and, sweet Jeebus, ""apple pie.""

This. This is why I have come to thoroughly despise this entire debate. Because it is not earnest, it is not thoughtful, it is not anything but the tin-eared rantings of bigoted, dull-minded twerps who know they don't like same sex marriages being recognized, but can't rustle up so much as even the slightest actual, substantive non-God-says-so argument against the thing. God does not care what the tax status of same-sex couples is, nor do I expect the big guy on the cloud has a pressing interest in making sure a pair of people can't get hospital visitation or other legal rights if they don't have the proper combination of non-matching genitalia. Even if we were to all stipulate that a one-mom-one-dad family is better for the children than a one-mom or one-dad single-parent version in all cases, full stop, which itself is an implausible argument, you had at least better occupy yourself with explaining why you think a two-dad version has to be inferior to a single father, or a two-mom version worse than the single mom version, and not this damn generic high fructose corn syrup of arguments, this blanket assertion that if we somehow discriminate more it will result in unspecified magic in which we don't have single parents or foster homes or divorce or cheating spouses or broken homes or abusive parents or one bad traffic accident or teenage moms or Those Damn People Who Think Different From Me anymore.

This is what happens when the last blowhards in an argument know they have lost. This is what happens when all sensible people have, at long last, moved on, leaving only the dim bulbs and the lard-for-brains and the burlap sacks of discount-grade asbestos to prop up the dying cause. You get people like this guy, droning on with mealy-mouthed phrases that mean nothing, mustered for an argument that doesn't even make any internal sense, mustered because the only people left on the loser's side of the debate are people who do not give a damn whether their arguments make any sense, and all regurgitated up by whatever die-hard friendly rag has not yet evolved sufficient shame to know how silly it all looks. I will be very, very glad when these people evolve that sense of shame. Anytime now, please."

The devout Christian, Florida native was a superstar kicker for the Middle Tennessee State's Blue Raiders; he is also openly gay. As an athlete at a Southern college, Gendreau was not only a successul team member, but he also felt accepted by his teammates. Now, he has his sights set on the National Football League (NFL).

Gendreau gave an exclusive interview to OutSports' Cyd Zeigler about life as an openly gay college athlete and his NFL prospects, revealing that when he came out to his MT team in freshman year, they fully embraced him.

""Everyone just saw him as a football player,"" MT holder and team punter Josh Davis told OutSports. ""He was just one of the guys. The fact that he proved himself on the field, there was a respect for him.""

The 5-foot, 10-inch kicker, who graduated from MT last year, knows the NFL is a long-shot for him this year. Gendreau is currently a free agent, and only the New York Jets and Carolina Panthers are likely to draft a kicker this year. Still, it isn't impossible.

""It's totally legit that he can get into the league,"" Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe, who is also a gay rights advocate, told OutSports. ""Place-kicking is all about doing this one specific skill set. And if you can do that, you can make it whether you’ve been out of football for one year or 10 years.""

If he does make it into the NFL, Gendreau would not only be the first gay professional football player, but he would also be the first professional player to enter the league openly gay.

Gay players in sports have been especially controversial lately. Former Baltimore Ravens linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo revealed earlier this month that as many as four current football players are in talks to come out in the near future. Following this statement, the NFL met with gay rights groups to discuss enacting policies to end homophobia and combat discrimination.

The NFL would likely embrace a player like Gendreau, and why not? The first openly gay, male athlete will likely rake in millions in endorsement deals and garner major attention for the team.

""We have seen time and time again that diversity is a benefit,"" Hudson Taylor, founder and executive director of pro-tolerance nonprofit Athlete Ally, previously told The Huffington Post. ""It's a benefit in corporate America; it's a benefit in schools; and it's a benefit in sports. An athletic culture that welcomes and includes LGBT athletes will ultimately draw improved talent and create more unified and respectful team cultures.""

""These ideas are resonating for the sports community at all levels, from the leagues to the players to the corporate sponsors. And perhaps most importantly, they are resonating for fans,"" he continued. ""Though a player's decision to come out is intensely personal and something about which only he or she knows best, it is a promising time as the sports community welcomes those decisions and the corporate community incentivizes them."""

Gingrich spoke about the issue of same-sex marriage during an interview with The Huffington Post in December. Although he defended his belief that marriage is between a man and a woman, the former House Speaker said the GOP needs to progress with the times.

""It is in every family. It is in every community,"" he told HuffPost. ""The momentum is clearly now in the direction in finding some way to ... accommodate and deal with reality. And the reality is going to be that in a number of American states -- and it will be more after 2014 -- gay relationships will be legal, period.""

On Thursday, Right Wing Watch posted a video response to Gingrich's same-sex marriage comments made by Navy chaplain Gordon Klingenschmitt, according to Raw Story. In the video, the chaplain says Gingrich is wholly misguided in pandering to the left and ""homosexual sin.""

The chaplain cites a Bible passage from Romans, Chapter 1, which reads ""the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another ... that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.”

“It’s not like Newt is personally engaging in homosexual activity, but the Bible condemns him now because he takes pleasure in those that do that sort of thing,” Klingenschmitt explained. “When the Bible condemns his endorsement of homosexual sin then he has become one of the sinners condemned by Romans, Chapter 1.”

Klingenschmitt continued to say Gingrich is tempted by ""demonic voices"" that tell him ""Okay, it's not really a sin. We ought to endorse this"" simply to get more votes in a possible 2016 presidential run.

The chaplain, who belongs to an evangelical sect of the Episcopal Church and was disgraced in 2006 for disobeying an order, is not the only one to speak out against Gingrich's evolved view on same-sex marriage. Frank Schubert, National Political Director for the National Organization for Marriage (NOM), called the politician's comments both ""stupid"" and ""ridiculous.""

Gingrich was previously vocal against same-sex marriage. He went so far as to compare it to paganism, saying, ""The effort to create alternatives to marriage between a man and a woman are perfectly natural pagan behaviors, but they are a fundamental violation of our civilization."" While running for the GOP presidential nomination, he also vowed to enforce the Defense of Marriage Act.

Watch Gordon Klingenschmitt's video below. He discusses Newt Gingrich around the 5-minute mark.

UPDATE: Gordon Klingenschmitt wrote HuffPost to clarify that he never said he believes Newt Gingrich to be worthy of death. According to the video, however, he did state that the Bible holds ""homosexual acts are worthy of death"" and that the Bible also equally condemns those who ""take pleasure in those who do that sort of thing."""
http://news.yahoo.com/churches-changing-bylaws-gay-marriage-ruling-153638830.html,,[],Churches changing bylaws after gay marriage ruling,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Worried they could be sued by gay couples, some churches are changing their bylaws to reflect their view that the Bible allows only marriage between one man and one woman.

Although there have been lawsuits against wedding industry businesses that refuse to serve gay couples, attorneys promoting the bylaw changes say they don't know of any lawsuits against churches.

Critics say the changes are unnecessary, but some churches fear that it's only a matter of time before one of them is sued.

""I thought marriage was always between one man and one woman, but the Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision said no,"" said Gregory S. Erwin, an attorney for the Louisiana Baptist Convention, an association of Southern Baptist churches and one several groups advising churches to change their bylaws. ""I think it's better to be prepared because the law is changing. America is changing.""

In a June decision, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a provision of the federal Defense of Marriage Act that defined marriage as between a man and a woman for purposes of federal law. A second decision was more technical but essentially ushered in legal gay marriage in California.

Kevin Snider is an attorney with the Pacific Justice Institute, a nonprofit legal defense group that specializes in conservative Christian issues. His organization released a model marriage policy a few years ago in response to a statewide gay marriage fight in California. Snider said some religious leaders have been threatened with lawsuits for declining to perform same-sex wedding ceremonies.

Dean Inserra, head pastor of the 1,000-member City Church Tallahassee, based in Florida, said he does not want to be alarmist, but his church is looking into how best to address the issue.

Inserra said he already has had to say no to gay friends who wanted him to perform a wedding ceremony.

""We have some gay couples that attend our church. What happens when they ask us to do their wedding?"" Inserra said. ""What happens when we say no? Is it going to be treated like a civil rights thing?""

Story continues

Critics, including some gay Christian leaders, argue that the changes amount to a solution looking for a problem.

""They seem to be under the impression that there is this huge movement with the goal of forcing them to perform ceremonies that violate their freedom of religion,"" said Justin Lee, executive director of the Gay Christian Network, a nonprofit that provides support for gay Christians and their friends and families and encourages churches to be more welcoming.

""If anyone tried to force a church to perform a ceremony against their will, I would be the first person to stand up in that church's defense.""

Thirteen states and the District of Columbia now recognize gay marriage.

Some Christian denominations, such as the United Church of Christ, accept gay marriage. The Episcopal Church recently approved a blessing for same-sex couples, but each bishop must decide whether to allow the ceremony in his or her local diocese.

The majority of Christian denominations, however, view homosexual relationships as sinful. In more hierarchical denominations, like the Roman Catholic Church or the United Methodist Church, individual churches are bound by the policies of the larger denomination. But nondenominational churches and those loosely affiliated with more established groups often individually decide how to address social issues such as gay marriage.

Eric Rassbach is an attorney with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a public interest legal group that defends the free expression rights of all faiths. He said it is unlikely the government would try to force a pastor to perform a same-sex marriage, but churches that rent out their facilities to the general public could face problems if they refuse to rent to gay couples.

Although his organization has not advocated it, he said it could strengthen a church's legal position to adopt a statement explaining its beliefs about marriage.

""A number of groups don't have a written doctrine,"" Rassbach said. ""Say a group like the Primitive Baptists — they don't want a written-down credo, but the courts like written-down things.""

Rassbach said it was important for churches to get their beliefs in writing before a dispute arises, otherwise it can look to a court as if something was done after the fact as an attempt to cover up hostility to gays.

Airline Baptist Church Senior Pastor Chad Mills said members of the public use their facilities in Bossier City, La., for many activities, including Zumba classes. In the past, anyone who could pay the fee was allowed to reserve the space. But recently, the church changed its rental policy to allow wedding-related events only for male-female couples.

Some denominations are less concerned about the Supreme Court rulings. The Assemblies of God, the group of churches comprising the world's largest Pentecostal denomination, sought legal advice after the rulings. An attorney for the group distributed a memo to ministers saying there was no reason to change their bylaws.

However, the memo also said that ""doing so is not inappropriate, and may be warranted based on future rulings by the Supreme Court and other state and federal courts.""

The bylaw changes are coming at a time when many churches are wrestling with gay marriage in general and are working hard to be more welcoming to gays and lesbians.

""It's probably one of the most difficult issues our churches are facing right now,"" said Doug Anderson, a national coordinator with the evangelical Vineyard Church. ""It's almost an impossible situation to reconcile what's going on in our culture, and our whole theology of welcoming and loving people, versus what it says in the Bible."""

(CNN) —

If Rush Limbaugh says same-sex marriage is inevitable, it’s inevitable. Here’s what the conservative radio host had to say about the topic on a recent show:

“This issue is lost. I don’t care what the Supreme Court does. This is now inevitable. And it’s inevitable because we lost the language on this.”

In a separate clip, he says he would agree with gay rights activists who claim the “genie isn’t going to get put back in the bottle” on this issue. “I think the inertia is clearly moving in the direction that there is going to be gay marriage, at some point, nationwide.”

Edythe McNamee/CNN John D. Sutter

Does he sound begrudging? Yes. Do I care? No. If the King Conservative is endorsing the inevitability of same-sex marriage, then my generation – the one demographers talk about when they mention the “sea change” in public opinion on this topic; the people born after 1981 who support “gay marriage” at a rate of 70% – will live to see it happen.

That’s so exciting that I almost want to end the column right here and now. Who cares what the Supreme Court decides? Rush said equality is on the way!

But then the question becomes: How soon?

And: What happens until then?

Finally: Doesn’t this in-between part matter?

Those doubts are what bother me about a new and hotly debated Time magazine cover that declares, quite prematurely, and in all-caps: “Gay marriage already won.”

“The Supreme Court hasn’t made up its mind,” the subhead says, “but America has.”

The trouble: America hasn’t.

New-York-America has. Washington-America has. California-America, which voted in 2008 to ban same-sex marriage, could easily overturn that law if a new election were held today.

Sutter: Gays live in 50 Americas

But there are plenty of gay and lesbian people who live in states like South Carolina, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Georgia – where far different views dominate the discourse.

Unless the Supreme Court rules broadly against California’s ban on same-sex marriage, which seems unlikely to the smart people who have been dissecting the arguments, then some gay people could be waiting decades for equal rights under the law.

How long, exactly, is the subject of some debate.

“In Republican-leaning red states, which uniformly have banned gay marriage, few seem to be having second thoughts,” writes Ronald Brownstein in the National Journal.

“For the near future, the nation appears locked onto a trajectory in which almost all reliably blue states will establish gay marriage (or civil unions) and possibly not a single reliably red state will follow.”

Trajectory, locked. Awesome.

I did find a glimmer of hope, however, in an analysis from Nate Silver, The New York Times blogger and data wiz who correctly predicted the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.

Silver says even the reddest of the red states will change eventually.

Thirty-two states would support same-sex marriage in a popular vote by the year 2016, he writes in a recent blog post. “And by 2020, voters in 44 states would do so, assuming that same-sex marriage continues to gain support at roughly its previous rate.”

The six states left out? South Carolina, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi, according to his analysis. With Mississippi being last.

I recently spent some time in that state, which passed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage by a majority vote of 86%. In states like that, gay people find it difficult in some communities just to exist, much less hold commitment ceremonies.

I met gay kids who had been harassed at school; a couple that keep a security camera on their porch; and a man who says he was fired because of his sexual orientation. (That’s legal in Mississippi and 28 other states, by the way, and it’s something no one’s talking about.)

Opinion: Which state matches your values on LGBT rights?

The conversation is changing – there are plenty of proud, brave and openly gay people living in the Deep South – but it’s happening at an uneven clip.

And these delays matter for real people.

In Mississippi, I met folks like L.B. and Sara Bell, who are legally married in Connecticut but don’t get any of the rights that go with that partnership in the Hospitality State. They told me they would like to start a family but worry about both of them getting custody, since Mississippi bans adoption by same-sex parents. Sara, who would like to carry the child, is 31. If same-sex marriage isn’t legalized until, say, 2030, she would be 48.

It would be nice to overlook this mushy, awkward middle period – our county’s pimply adolescence on gay rights – and jump straight to an all-inclusive future.

But these teenage years matter. They affect how millions of Americans live today. And the transition could also affect what type of nation we become. Let’s hope they go by quickly.

Most Americans, however, know this self-proclaimed defender of the Constitution and freedoms and whatnot mostly from his alcohol-fueled boating crash last year (and yes, there were injuries, and yes, he's still facing charges).

In this new, miserably depressing story on Dwyer, he cites two things as the reasons for the ""increased"" drinking that culminated in his crash with another boat, causing him multiple injuries and fracturing the skull of a five-year-old girl. The first is his 2011 separation from his wife. The second is the pressure of being in the legislature, but more specifically, that time other legislators ""betrayed"" him by not being sufficiently anti-gay-marriage themselves:



Dwyer says he felt sold out when Dels. Tiffany Alston, Wade Kach and Bob Costa voted for same-sex marriage, an issue he spent years crusading against. Dwyer told reporters one day before the vote that he had enough support to block the bill. Kach, a Republican from Baltimore County, and Alston, a former Democrat from Prince George’s County, voted against the bill in committee. But Kach changed his vote after hearing testimony from gay couples. Alston shifted her vote after her amendment was adopted. Kach and Costa, of Deale, were the only two House Republicans to vote for the bill. It passed the House by two votes in February. “I had no time to do anything,” Dwyer said. “Had I known earlier, I could have taken some action.” It was petitioned to the November ballot and passed by 52 percent of voters state wide. Voters in Dwyer’s district, however, rejected it. “That betrayal really affected me,” he said. “I was physically ill. You pour your heart into an issue like that and it’s devastating.” He said his drinking culminated in the crash.

So an intense hatred of gay marriage—and not having that hatred reciprocated by his fellow legislators and voters—is what drove this poor defender of proper marriage and proper faith to booze up and crash his damn boat into another boat. That's some powerful hatred, right there.

In the wake of the crash, Dwyer did not resign as any decent person might, instead gaudily announcing he needs to stay put to ""defend individual liberty against unconstitutional laws,"" but he does admit he needs to rebuild ""trust"" with voters. I don't know that voters should be keen on reelecting someone whose past reaction to other people being insufficiently anti-gay was to booze up and nearly get some people killed, but I am not from Maryland, I am not a Republican voter, and Dwyer seems confident that all will be forgiven, allowing him to get back to expressing his obsessively anti-gay frustrations in some hopefully less child-skull-fracturing ways.

And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what it means to be an American religious conservative.

USA TODAY

President Obama plans to meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights activists while he's in Russia this week for the G-20 summit.

Igor Kochetkov of LGBT Network told the Associated Press that his group is accepting an invitation to meet with Obama in St. Petersburg on Thursday. The St. Petersburg-based advocacy group Coming Out said it was invited but hasn't decided whether to go.

The White House did not have immediate comment on the meeting, which was first reported by BuzzFeed, other than to say Obama plans on meeting with civil society leaders while in St. Petersburg.

Russia has faced international criticism since it passed a law in June banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors. The Russians have also faced international scorn for another law that bans adoptions by countries allowing same-sex marriages.

Human rights groups have reported there's been an uptick of violence against the country's LGBT community since the laws passed. The legislation has led to calls for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.

Last month, Obama said he didn't support boycotting the Sochi games, because he didn't want to penalize American athletes. But Obama has been sharply critical of the Russian laws.

""Nobody is more offended than me by some of the anti-gay and lesbian legislation that you've been seeing in Russia,"" Obama said last month.

The meeting will almost certainly add tension to the already tense relationship between Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Obama canceled a scheduled meeting with Putin in Moscow before the G-20 summit. The cancellation followed a string of disputes, including Russia's decision to grant asylum to former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden and its blocking of action by the United Nations Security Council against Syria."

As thousands of demonstrators on both sides of America's long-standing gay rights divide rallied outside, the court heard a spirited, 80-minute oral argument on whether to let stand a California ban on same-sex marriage.

Despite the case being one of the most eagerly anticipated legal showdowns of the year, some of the nine justices showed an unwillingness to dive headfirst into the delicate and divisive issue.

Though polls show growing support among Americans for gay marriage, only nine states recognize it, while 30 states have constitutional amendments prohibiting it.

Justice Anthony Kennedy, a potential swing vote, gave a clear indication of where he stood when he warned of the court entering ""uncharted waters.""

It was the first of two days of arguments. On Wednesday, the court will consider the related question of whether the 1996 federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which denies federal benefits to married same-sex couples, should be struck down.

Rulings in both cases are not expected until June.

In making his antipathy to a broad ruling clear, Kennedy even raised the prospect of the court dismissing the case altogether, a relatively unusual move that would leave intact a federal appeals court ruling that had earlier struck down the California law, known as Proposition 8.

If dismissal were the outcome of the Supreme Court's consideration of Proposition 8, gay marriages in California could proceed, but the case would have no impact on other states, as gay rights activists had hoped. It would also mean that the high court could stay silent on the issue, at least in the short term.

Kennedy was not the only one with reservations. Justice Samuel Alito also urged caution, noting that gay marriage, as a concept, is ""newer than cellphones and the Internet.""

None of the justices indicated support for the Obama administration's compromise solution, which would strike down Proposition 8 and require the eight other states that already recognize civil unions or domestic partnerships to allow gays and lesbians to marry.

COMPETING RALLIES

Outside the court, demonstrators did not share the justices' reluctance to take a clear stand, with hundreds gathered representing both sides. Anti-gay marriage protesters marched past the imposing Supreme Court building accompanied by police on motorcycles, drawing jeers and shouts from a pro-gay marriage rally, but there were no physical confrontations.

""No hate - we just disagree!"" yelled one marcher, holding a sign that proclaimed children do best with a mother and father.

Jay Golon, a New York City educator who was at the pro-gay marriage rally, said he has many students with same-sex parents.

""It's a family,"" he said. ""That's all.""

Inside the hushed courtroom, filled to capacity with lawyers and spectators, some of whom had waited for days to get a seat, it quickly became apparent that the justices were more interested in legal technicalities than flowery rhetoric.

One key issue is whether California opponents of gay marriage even had a right to be heard in federal court.

If the court were to find the proponents did not have standing, then it would not reach the merits of that case. That would mean that an earlier federal district court ruling that struck down Proposition 8 would be left intact. Further litigation would ensue over whether the district court rule would apply statewide.

U.S. citizens, in general, do not have a right to sue to enforce laws they favor. Chief Justice John Roberts pressed lawyer Charles Cooper, who represents gay marriage opponents, on why his clients are any different as they seek to enforce Proposition 8.

""I don't think we've ever allowed anything like that,"" Roberts said.

DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE

On the broader question of same-sex marriage, pressed by attorney Theodore Olson on behalf of two California same-sex couples, some conservative justices seemed eager to raise objections to the court making a definitive statement, citing a lack of scientific data on same-sex couples raising children.

Justice Antonin Scalia said there is ""considerable disagreement"" about whether gays and lesbians should be able to raise children.

Kennedy agreed that there is ""substance to the point that sociological information is new.""

On the liberal wing, justices probed Cooper on his assertion that the government's interest in promoting procreation is a primary reason for limiting the definition of marriage.

Both Justice Elena Kagan and Justice Stephen Breyer questioned Cooper on how his definition of marriage squares with the fact that infertile opposite-sex couples can marry.

""There are lots of people who get married who can't have children,"" Breyer said.

The court will reconvene on Wednesday morning to weigh the DOMA statute.

Unlike Proposition 8, that case does not give the court the opportunity to issue a broad ruling for or against gay marriage because the case relates only to a federal law that limits the definition of marriage to opposite-sex couples for the purposes of federal benefits.

Ken Bencomo, 45, of Rancho Cucamonga, was fired from his teaching position at the Catholic girls school after photos of his wedding to partner Christopher Persky, 32, were published in a local newspaper last month.

They were among the first couples to be married at the San Bernardino County assessor–recorder’s office after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing gay couples to marry in California.

TIMELINE: Gay marriage across the U.S.

Bencomo had worked at St. Lucy’s for 17 years and school administrators knew of his sexual orientation for most of that time, his attorney, Patrick McGarrigle, said.

Former students said Bencomo was a popular teacher who was a mentor and involved in many school activities. They demonstrated in front of the school Thursday morning to show their support and demand he be rehired.

“Come with powerful voices, ready to sing our Alma Mater and show the SL administration — ‘We Are That Change!’” the group’s Facebook page said.

An online petition to reinstate Bencomo has gathered more than 49,000 signatures.

Brittany Littleton, a 2008 graduate who created the petition, said Bencomo’s firing was a shock.

“He never made it part of the discussion and he never pushed his personal life on us,” she said. “But we knew, the school knew, teachers knew — it was never a problem.”

In a statement released through an attorney earlier this month, the school said it is “a community of faith for those who wish to express, practice and adhere to values in education based on the Roman Catholic tradition.”

“While the school does not discriminate against teachers or other school employees based on their private lifestyle choices, public displays of behavior that are directly contrary to church teachings are inconsistent with these values,” the statement reads. “These values are incorporated into the contractual obligations of each of our instructors and other employees.”

http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/prop-8-gay-marriage-case-085022722--election.html,,[],Who’s who in the Prop 8 gay marriage case,"On Tuesday morning, the Supreme Court hears oral arguments in the first gay marriage case to ever reach the court, Hollingsworth v. Perry.

The legal battle over California's gay marriage ban began more than four years ago, when a majority of voters backed ballot Proposition 8, which rescinded the right to marry from same-sex couples.

Since then, Prop 8 has been struck down by both a district and federal appeals court as discriminatory, and along the way lost its main legal defender: the government of California. After the district court decision, then-Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declined to appeal the case further, leaving a coalition of Prop 8 supporters led by a a former state senator to take up the cause.

The Supreme Court could use the case to issue a broad ruling guaranteeing the right to marriage to same-sex couples--or to shut down gay rights advocates' claims of wrongful exclusion from the institution of marriage altogether. The court also may issue a ruling in between these extremes.

As both sides prepare to argue their cause, we take a look at some of the major faces behind the high-profile case.

The plaintiffs:

Two unmarried same-sex couples in California were handpicked by the well-financed campaign against Prop 8 to challenge the gay marriage ban as discriminatory.

Kris Perry, whose last name is featured in the Hollingsworth v Perry case name, and Sandy Stier married in 2004 in San Francisco, but the state Supreme Court invalidated that marriage only six months later.

They have been together for 13 years, and raised four sons together from previous relationships. Perry, 48, told the Associated Press that “we've lived our lives in this hurry-up-and-wait, pins-and-needles way,” since the case began four years ago.

Paul Katami and Jeff Zarrillo of Burbank, Calif., also were chosen as plaintiffs after gay rights advocates noticed a YouTube video Katami helped make to respond to gay marriage critics called, “Weathering the Storm.” A lawyer involved in the case told The Washington Post that they approached “several couples” about whether they would be interested in in being plaintiffs in the high profile challenge to Prop 8, warning them that their lives could face extra scrutiny if they accepted.

Story continues

""We honestly think of ourselves as kind of regular, everyday guys,"" Katami told USA Today. ""We're not asking for a special right.""

Katami and Zarrillo have been together for 12 years, and hope to get married and have children if their case is successful.

Their attorneys:

The two same-sex couples are represented by Theodore Olson, the former Solicitor General under George W. Bush, and David Boies, a high profile Democratic lawyer. The pair faced off against each other in front of the Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore, but are now teaming up to try to convince the justices that Prop 8 and gay marriage bans in general are discriminatory. The attorneys have made the broader argument that the government has no reason to exclude people from marriage based on sexual orientation. Olson has 20 minutes to argue their case on Tuesday.

The Prop 8 defenders:

Dennis Hollingsworth, a former Republican state senator from the Temecula area, and other supporters of Proposition 8 took responsibility for defending the ban on gay marriage after the California attorney general declined to appeal the district court’s decision striking it down.

Hollingsworth is a leader of Protect Marriage, a group of supporters of Prop 8 who raise money for its legal defense now that the state has bowed out. The group says it is defending the millions of Californians who voted for Prop 8 from having their voices overruled by the courts.

Their attorney:

Charles Cooper, a former Justice Department official under President Ronald Reagan, has been the lead attorney for Proposition 8 since it was first challenged by gay marriage supporters. Hollingsworth reportedly chose Cooper because he thought his skills as an attorney were on par with Olson’s. Cooper has stressed in his briefs that the Supreme Court should not interfere with states’ wishes on gay marriage and argues that the government has legitimate reasons to discourage same-sex couples from marrying. Cooper will have 30 minutes to make his arguments and answer the justices' questions on Tuesday."

Law bans discrimination in employment and housing

Some critics say law wasn%27t needed

Only 3 Kentucky cities have adopted similar ordinances

VICCO, Ky. -- Mayor Johnny Cummings answered his cellphone with its insistent air-horn ring tone over and over Wednesday morning, juggling his reading glasses, a takeout coffee cup and a succession of cigarettes.

Cummings' most immediate concern, as he worked out of the brick storefront City Hall, was keeping tabs on the waterworks crew as it switched on pumps to prevent overflows amid a persistent downpour.

But Cummings couldn't avoid the inquiries from the media, both in person and by phone, about how this tiny coal-mining community in Eastern Kentucky's Perry County had become the smallest municipality in America known to have approved an ordinance protecting gays and lesbians from discrimination.

City commissioners voted 3-1 on Monday to approve ordinances banning discrimination, by employers and by sellers and renters of housing, on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, as well as race, religion, age and gender.

Cummings, a fifth-generation resident of Vicco, also finds himself fielding questions about what it's like to be an openly gay mayor in a socially, religiously and politically conservative region of Appalachia.

Cummings sees the Vicco vote as part of a larger effort to revive the city of 334, which has struggled in the more than half-century since the end of its mining boom.

""Kentucky had so many small towns that were just dying and withering away, and Vicco was one of them,"" Cummings said. ""We want to change the reputation of the town. It's always been something that everyone made fun of — just a small, little town, redneck rough and tough.""

Cummings would just as soon talk about other ordinances also passed last Monday — imposing a curfew to reduce loitering and expanding zones where alcohol can be sold, in an effort to attract a restaurant.

Cummings would like to talk about how the city has sharply reduced leaks in its once-porous waterlines, balanced its budget and begun plans for a new park and community center to give young people a positive outlet in a region raked by drug abuse.

But Cummings acknowledges he was pleased that ""the gay mayor and the heterosexual commissioners"" were able to have a lengthy and respectful deliberation before Monday's vote. Part of the debate was whether other city efforts at revitalization would be eclipsed.

""It was just something that was right,"" he said. ""We never thought it would be such a hoopla.""

Was it needed?

Tim Engle, the sole commissioner to vote against the ordinance, said he felt that voting for the measure would amount to endorsing homosexuality.

""I'm a Christian, and I don't believe in that lifestyle,"" he said.

But he also said it wasn't necessary. Nobody is discriminating, he said, saying that in his own music recording and retail business — just around the corner from Cummings' hair salon — ""I'm 100 percent fair with everybody."" And he considers Cummings a friend.

""When my dad died, Johnny was the first one on my mother's doorstep,"" he said.

Truman Hurt, a retired coal miner and a Pentecostal lay preacher living on the outskirts of Vicco, said he hasn't talked to anyone in favor of the measure. Hurt said he disagrees on this issue with liberal activists with whom he has worked for years, attempting to hold coal companies accountable to health and environmental regulations.

""What they're really against is the Bible,"" he said of ordinance proponents, as he sat by his window-lit Bible, open to the book of John.

""I have no problem being fair to people, but this is well beyond fairness,"" he said, saying it supersedes ""the right of a business owner to say no to anyone. That includes me. ... That's what freedom's all about.""

Protection still rare

Until Vicco, only three Kentucky cities — Louisville, Lexington and Covington — had adopted similar ordinances banning discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Henderson repealed a short-lived one in 2001.

The Vicco vote came out of contact between Eastern Kentucky and other statewide gay-rights activists who began promoting such ordinances in nearby Berea and Richmond, said Chris Hartman, spokesman for the Fairness Coalition.

The Kentucky heartland may not seem promising territory for such measures.

Perry County voted for Republican Mitt Romney by a 4-1 margin in the 2012 presidential election, with similarly lopsided results in much of rural Kentucky. A defining issue in the campaign was Democratic President Barack Obama's support for expanded gay rights.

But Hartman said people in many smaller communities ""feel they're already practicing the values a fairness law reflects, and so it's been exciting to hear that over and over."" The ultimate goal, Hartman said, is for a statewide law.

But Martin Cothran, senior policy analyst for the Family Foundation of Kentucky, said there ""doesn't seem to be any kind of epidemic of discrimination"" requiring such laws.

While religious organizations are exempt, he cited the case of a Christian business owner in Lexington who faces a discrimination complaint for refusing to print T-shirts for a gay-advocacy group.

Providing a recourse

But Tony Vaughn, chief of Vicco's one-man police department, said it makes sense to enact such laws to give people a legal recourse if discrimination does occur.

""Until people start stepping up to the plate, there's no action,"" he said, lauding Vicco commissioners for having ""enough brass about them to be on the forefront.""

Cummings said he hopes the measure will project a progressive image to employers that might help revitalize Vicco, which is in a valley between steep cliffs about a dozen miles' drive southeast from the county seat of Hazard.

From the 1930s to 1950s, coal camps dotted the mountainsides and brought thousands to its once-thriving business district to shop, drink, dance and, often, brawl. The city even took its name from a onetime major employer, the Virginia Iron Coal and Coke Co.

But its population is about half what it was at its formal incorporation in 1964, and even then a Courier-Journal profile described many familiar challenges — a need to attract businesses and residents and improve public works.

Now Vicco has a half-dozen businesses — including a bank, music store and Cummings' hair salon — as well as three churches and no stoplights on or near its modest Main Street.

Many locals work outside of town in the coal and health care industries, Cummings said.

The 50-year-old mayor — who traces his local roots to great-great-grandparents who operated a hotel — said that when he was a teenager, ""everyone knew I was gay before I did.""

""There was always some name calling, but not that much,"" he said. ""That's probably the main reason I stayed.""

He spent some time in California and South Carolina, but ""I've always come back."" More than two decades ago, he and a business partner located the Scissors hair salon on Main Street.

Cummings has long been involved in civic activities such as helping organize holiday celebrations, serving on the city commission and getting elected mayor last year.

""I've been told I live in a dream world,"" he added. But, ""I think if you do what you think's right and treat other people fairly, people respect that.""

'I'm all for fairness'

At Your Place restaurant, a home-style diner just up the highway from central Vicco, owner Evalee Bowling said locals are more concerned about the current economic struggles of the coal industry than about the ordinances. But she had no problems with the measures.

""I'm all for fairness,"" she said, adding of gay people, ""If they come in here, I treat them like any other customer.""

Diner patron Russell Akemon of Hazard, who formerly lived near the center of Vicco, said he didn't see the ordinances as controversial.

""I don't think anybody has anything against them,"" he said. ""What they do is their business, I guess. I don't particularly agree with it. That don't make me dislike them."""

But Sprigg and other evangelicals say changing attitudes toward homosexuality have created a new victim: closeted Christians who believe the Bible condemns homosexuality but will not say so publicly for fear of being labeled a hateful bigot.

“In the current culture, it takes more courage for someone like Chris Broussard to speak out than for someone like Jason Collins to come out,” says Sprigg, a former pastor. “The media will hail someone who comes out of the closet as gay, but someone who simply expresses their personal religious views about homosexual conduct is attacked.”

Oh boy! So the breakdown as far as I can see is groups like the Family Research Council really want to have bigoted views and talk about them a lot -- in their case, in the context of advocating for actually damaging, actually discriminatory policy initiatives. They just don't want to be called on it. Fun fact: You can believe whatever you want to believe and advocate for whatever social policies you see fit. However, if those beliefs and social policies are hateful and bigoted, you may in fact be called a hateful bigot. The Bible does not provide a mystic force field that protects you from criticism. You'd think that biblical literalists would have a better understanding of cause and effect. Unfortunately not. But Sprigg continued:I've already written about Chris Broussard's views about Jason Collins at length . But suffice it to say, you can't pick which parts of the Bible you decide you want to follow. For example, never saying one word about the morals of an entire sports league notorious for pre-marital and extra-marital sex, but once an athlete comes out as gay, feeling the need to pontificate on what does or doesn't make a ""true Christian."" But I digress. More importantly, the fact that anyone would think it's easier for Mr. Broussard to ""come out"" as a person who thinks homosexuality is wrong versus Mr. Collins' actually coming out is laughable.

There's a reason that it's taken so long for a man to step forward as the first openly gay athlete in one of the major sports. There's also a reason why the person who stepped forward is nearing or at the end of his career. Besides the media circus and having millions of strangers suddenly keenly interested in your intimate life, there are downsides like it's still perfectly legal to fire someone in most of the United States for simply being gay (further fun fact: the FRC is predictably adamant in its defense of those laws). And if that weren't enough, there's a real potential for violence. According to the LA Times, hate crimes against LGBT people are on the rose by 13% from 2009-2010. Among that group minorities were even more likely to be targeted. 2011 saw the highest number of anti-gay murders ever reported. Yes, yes, what courage Mr. Broussard had. He should get a medal because by espousing bigoted claims, some think him an asshole. If only he had it as easy as Jason Collins.

If I were a betting man, I would put $0.00 or less on the table for the possibility that facts, reason, logic or actual cudgels could be used effectively to beat any sense into the FRC or their mouth-breathing fanbase. Haters, as the saying goes, gonna hate. The most obnoxious part of this conversation to me is that a major media news outlet not owned by Rupert Murdoch -- CNN, ever the fucking baby-splitter -- is giving wide-eyed, credulous airtime to these ludicrous and offensive claims as if they are a meaningful part of an ongoing social conversation. There are a ton of interesting ways to cover the changing attitudes in America toward homosexuality and what that means for our past, present and future as a nation. But when the team representing the Obviously Wrong Side of History insists on having a little bitchfit about how they're the ones now being oppressed, this is not a reason for raising the alarm and slamming on the brakes for some soulful reflection on empirically idiotic claims. This is the time to play those people a very sad song on the world's tiniest little violin -- and let the rest of us dance into the future."

Officials want to await outcome of Supreme Court cases

Poll late last year shows slim majority don%27t want constitutional ban

Soonest measure could go before voters would be 2014

INDIANAPOLIS — Lawmakers will not take up a proposed constitutional ban on same-sex marriages this year, leaders of the Republican-dominated Indiana General Assembly said Thursday.

The legislature will wait on same-sex marriage amendment until 2014, state Senate President Pro Tem David Long and House Speaker Brian Bosma said.

The two said they wanted to see how the U.S. Supreme Court would rule on the issue this summer on the legality of California's similar constitutional amendment and a federal law that denies benefits to same-sex couples.

Indiana already is one of 37 states, either in state law or a constitutional amendment, that specify marriages must be between a man and a woman. Nine states and the District of Columbia permit same-sex marriage.

In 2011, the Indiana legislature passed a bill to amend the state constitution to ban gay marriages and civil unions but must vote a second time to put the measure on a ballot so voters statewide can decide.

""We could find ourselves in the very inadvisable situation of having a matter on the ballot in 2014 that has been ruled unconstitutional and there is no means of removing it from the ballot,"" said Bosma, an Indianapolis Republican.

Senate Republicans voted overwhelmingly to postpone the issue, said Long, a Republican from Fort Wayne, Ind.

A Ball State University poll of 602 Indiana adults taken in November before the Supreme Court decided to take up both the California case and federal Defense of Marriage Act found that 54% of those polled opposed changing the Indiana constitution to ban same-sex marriage; 38% supported it.

Yet residents were split on legalizing gay marriage with 45% favoring legalization and 45% opposing it. About 55% supported legalizing civil unions that would give same-sex couples the same rights as married heterosexual couples. The survey had an error margin of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.

""The marriage amendment could have easily passed this year,"" said Eric Miller, who has pushed for adoption of the Indiana ban for years as head of the conservative advocacy group Advance America. ""And there will be tremendous pressure, including financial pressure, on the 150 legislators to kill the amendment in a House or Senate committee next year and to stop it on the floor of the House and Senate.""

Advocates say they can defeat the proposal if given the time to educate the public about it.

""We are going to keep working to tell our stories and share our stories with the public so that if it does come to a vote, they will understand what an impact this will have,"" said Annette Gross, Indiana coordinator for Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays.

The language of the proposed amendment also rules out future approval of civil unions and raises questions about whether businesses would be able to offer domestic-partner benefits to same-sex couples: ""A legal status identical or substantially similar to that of marriage for unmarried individuals shall not be valid or recognized.""

The legislature's delay of a vote does not affect how soon the measure could be added to the state constitution.

Two years ago, the General Assembly overwhelmingly approved the proposed amendment but must vote on it again by next year to send it to voters in the 2014 general election. With no general election this year, 2014 is the soonest the measure could come before voters."

Carson has since said he apologizes for having offended anyone and indicated he might withdraw from the commencement role, though he says his words are being misconstrued.

Carson -- who rocketed to political fame after criticizing President Obama's policies during the National Prayer Breakfast, which Obama attended -- made the gay marriage comments on Fox News Tuesday night.

Host Sean Hannity asked Carson his opinion on same-sex marriage, given the Supreme Court's consideration of two gay marriage cases this week.

""Marriage is between a man and a woman,"" Carson said. ""It's a well-established, fundamental pillar of society and no group, be they gays, be they NAMBLA, be they people who believe in bestiality -- it doesn't matter what they are, they don't get to change the definition.""

Students accused Carson of effectively comparing ""gay relationships with pedophilia and bestiality.""

The Health and Human Rights Student Group began circulating a petition, linked out of its Facebook page, challenging Carson's selection as the 2013 commencement speaker for the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.

""At the time of his nomination, Dr. Carson was known to most of us as a world-class neurosurgeon and passionate advocate for education. Many of us had read his books and looked up to him as a role model in our careers,"" the group said. ""Since then, however, several public events have cast serious doubt on the appropriateness of having Dr. Carson speak at our graduation.""

The group cited his gay marriage comments, but also his comments at the National Prayer Breakfast -- Carson was hailed by conservatives, and even landed a speaking role at the Conservative Political Action Conference, for his remarks in February.

The commencement address may be in doubt.

Asked about the students' objections, Carson on Friday told MSNBC it's ""their day and the last thing I would want to do is rain on their parade.""

Asked whether he's told the university he would not deliver the address, Carson said he was ""waiting for appropriate channels.""

Carson also told the Baltimore Sun that people ""have completely taken the wrong meaning out of what I was saying.""

He added: ""Now perhaps the examples were not the best choice of words, and I certainly apologize if I offended anyone. But the point that I was making was that no group of individuals, whoever they are, whatever their belief systems, gets to change traditional definitions."""

No, DOMA was the demon seed of a hate group.","Back in 1995, a group of individuals, including Don Wildmon, met in Memphis, Tennessee, because of what had happened in Hawaii where the court imposed same-sex marriage. Of course the folks there pushed back in the state of Hawaii. But then there was a concern that this could happen across the country. And so a group of leaders met in Memphis, Tennessee, and talked about the need to solidify marriage and by preventing states from imposing definition of marriage on the states. So the concept of the Defense of Marriage Act—wasn't called that at the time—originated, and actually we took it back to our policy shop at FRC and formulated the policy and actually gave it the name Defense of Marriage Act.

If you are a devout Christian, Jew or Muslim, or just believe that homosexuality is wrong, and the law gives homosexuality protected status, then your personal beliefs are now outside civil law. The entire civil rights apparatus can be brought against you. Businessmen will have to subsidize homosexuality or face legal sanction; schoolchildren will have to be taught that homosexuality is equivalent to marital love.

Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan showed Wednesday that in 1996, the House passed the Defense of Marriage Act not to gently respect tradition but ""to express moral disapproval of homosexuality."" Paul Clement, the law's defender in court, tried to claim that's not so, but the more you look at the origins of DOMA, the more you realize that there is no way a law conceived so directly out of hatred can represent anything but hatred. DOMA didn't originate in the House, GLAAD reminds us. Rather, it came out of a coalition of hard-right groups like the Family Research Council, and from there to Congress. Current FRC head Tony Perkins explains:The rollout of DOMA included Peter LaBarbera , who likes to talk about ""homo-fascism"" and has said ""We need to stop conceding the moral high ground in a fearful bid to appear 'tolerant,'"" and Robert Knight , who just this week wrote that ""the left’s drive for 'gay rights' poses the greatest domestic threat to the freedoms of religion, speech and assembly."" It included a C-SPAN-televised FRC briefing for Capitol Hill staff at which Knight claimed that:At the same briefing, another ""expert"" argued that ""Every argument for gay marriage is an argument that would support polygamy."" That same person argued, on another occasion, that the Supreme Court's Romer v. Evans decision that states can't ban anti-discrimination laws was a terrible, terrible thing because making it illegal to discriminate against gay people is in effect discriminating against bigots (or, as he put it, religious people).

This was the origination and the push for DOMA. There is no way to disguise it as anything but hate. And there is no way to seriously claim that in the not quite 17 years since the law's passage it has miraculously transmuted from hate to ... whatever Paul Clement is now claiming with his repeated invocations of the law as ""rational."""

Under the latest measure, the definition of marriage would be changed in state law from an act between a man and a woman to one between two people. Civil unions could be converted to marriages within a year of the law going onto the books.



The legislation would not require religious organizations to perform a marriage of gay couples, and church officials would not be forced to allow their facilities to be used by gay couples seeking to marry.



While advocates have brought forth a lengthy line-up of religious leaders who have endorsed gay marriage, Catholics and conservative African American church groups have provided fierce opposition. They argue same-sex marriage violates the basic tenets of the Bible, which call for marriage to be only between a man and a woman.



Advocates argue a prohibition on gay marriage goes against American values of equality and fairness.

http://news.yahoo.com/gay-rights-bill-moves-forward-opposition-silent-205737899--election.html,,[],Gay rights bill moves forward as opposition silent,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Invoking the Declaration of Independence, proponents of a bill that would outlaw discrimination against gays in the workplace argued on Tuesday that the measure is rooted in fundamental fairness for all Americans.

Republican opponents of the measure were largely silent, neither addressing the issue on the second day of Senate debate nor commenting unless asked. Written statements from some rendered their judgment that the bill would result in costly, frivolous lawsuits and mandate federal law based on sexuality.

The Senate moved closer to completing its work on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act that would prohibit workplace discrimination against gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said a final vote in the Senate is possible by week's end.

Senate passage of the bill would represent a major victory for advocates of gay rights just months after the Supreme Court affirmed gay marriage and granted federal benefits to legally married same-sex couples and three years after Congress ended the ban on gays serving openly in the military.

Illinois was poised to become the 15th state to legalize gay marriage after the state's Legislature gave its final approval Tuesday, sending it to the governor, who has said he'll sign it.

""I don't believe in discriminating against anybody,"" said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a backer of the measure who voted against a similar, narrower bill 17 years ago. Hatch said the bill has language ensuring religious freedom that he expects the Senate to toughen.

The measure, however, faces strong opposition in the Republican-controlled House, where Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, maintains that it is unnecessary and could prove too expensive and litigious for businesses.

Resistance remains within GOP ranks even as the national party, looking beyond core older voters, tries to be more inclusive. Republicans struggled to win over young people and independents in the 2012 presidential election.

Story continues

Asked why he opposed the bill, Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., said the measure is ""somewhat pandering to the special groups that I think should not have to be singled out by themselves. I think they're normal citizens like everybody else.""

A bipartisan group of senators pressed ahead with the legislation, casting it as a clear sign of Americans' greater acceptance of homosexuality that has significantly changed the political dynamic.

A Pew Research survey in June found that more Americans said homosexuality should be accepted rather than discouraged by society by a margin of 60 percent to 31 percent. Opinions were more evenly divided 10 years ago.

""What changed is society has changed,"" said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. ""Personal attitudes have changed, business is for it. There's just widespread support for taking these other steps in passing a civil rights bill.""

A chief sponsor of the measure, Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., said that in his home state, Nike supports the measure.

About 88 percent of Fortune 500 companies have adopted nondiscrimination policies that include sexual orientation, according to the Human Rights Campaign. About 57 percent of those companies include gender identity.

""It's time to end this discrimination,"" Merkley said in a Senate speech. ""It's certainly about the vision of the Declaration of Independence that has the promise of life, liberty and pursuit of happiness as the founding motivation.""

Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy said his home state of Connecticut has had a discrimination law since 1991 and frivolous lawsuits are uncommon. Based on the latest data from 2009 and 2010, 53 of 1,740 employment-based complaints were based on sexual orientation, Murphy said.

""Fifty years from now history is going to judge no less harshly those that voted against this act as it judges now those that voted against some of the civil rights acts of the 1950s and 1960s,"" Murphy said.

Current federal law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, race and national origin. But it doesn't stop an employer from firing or refusing to hire workers because they are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender.

The bill would bar employers with 15 or more workers from using a person's sexual orientation or gender identity as the basis for making employment decisions, including hiring, firing, compensation or promotion. The bill would exempt religious institutions and the military.

Sens. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., were crafting an amendment to the bill that would prevent federal, state and local governments from retaliating against religious groups that are exempt from the law.

""It focuses on religious liberty,"" Portman said. ""It provides a non-retaliation clause in the federal law comparable to what a lot of states have.""

Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., was working on an amendment to expand the number of groups that are covered under the religious exemption.

Portman, Ayotte and Toomey were the last three Republicans who voted Monday night to advance the bill as it past its first hurdle on a 61-30 vote. After the vote, Portman's son Will, a student at Yale, tweeted, ""Go dad ... Sens Portman and Toomey vote yes. Cloture is reached on #ENDA.""

The Ohio senator announced in March that he supports same-sex marriage, saying his views began changing in 2011, when his son told his parents he was gay and that it wasn't a choice but ""part of who he was.""

Portman said he exchanged messages with his son after the vote."

That appeared to leave the court with an all-or-nothing choice on the merits: either a ruling that would require same-sex marriage in all 50 states or one that would say that all states may do as they wish. Neither choice seemed attractive to a majority of the justices.

Five members of the court asked questions indicating that they might vote to dismiss the case on the threshold issue that supporters of Proposition 8 lacked standing to appeal a lower court’s decision. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., whose questions on the merits indicated discomfort with requiring states to allow same-sex marriage, seemed particularly interested in the standing issue.

Justice Kennedy seemed more open to the possibility that the proponents of Proposition 8 had standing, but he twice asked lawyers why the court should not dismiss the case outright. When the justices have second thoughts about agreeing to hear a case, they sometimes dismiss it as “improvidently granted.”

Questions from the justices do not always reliably forecast votes, of course, and many of the justices also indicated their views of the central issue presented in the case."

(CNN) —

If Rush Limbaugh says same-sex marriage is inevitable, it’s inevitable. Here’s what the conservative radio host had to say about the topic on a recent show:

“This issue is lost. I don’t care what the Supreme Court does. This is now inevitable. And it’s inevitable because we lost the language on this.”

In a separate clip, he says he would agree with gay rights activists who claim the “genie isn’t going to get put back in the bottle” on this issue. “I think the inertia is clearly moving in the direction that there is going to be gay marriage, at some point, nationwide.”

Edythe McNamee/CNN John D. Sutter

Does he sound begrudging? Yes. Do I care? No. If the King Conservative is endorsing the inevitability of same-sex marriage, then my generation – the one demographers talk about when they mention the “sea change” in public opinion on this topic; the people born after 1981 who support “gay marriage” at a rate of 70% – will live to see it happen.

That’s so exciting that I almost want to end the column right here and now. Who cares what the Supreme Court decides? Rush said equality is on the way!

But then the question becomes: How soon?

And: What happens until then?

Finally: Doesn’t this in-between part matter?

Those doubts are what bother me about a new and hotly debated Time magazine cover that declares, quite prematurely, and in all-caps: “Gay marriage already won.”

“The Supreme Court hasn’t made up its mind,” the subhead says, “but America has.”

The trouble: America hasn’t.

New-York-America has. Washington-America has. California-America, which voted in 2008 to ban same-sex marriage, could easily overturn that law if a new election were held today.

Sutter: Gays live in 50 Americas

But there are plenty of gay and lesbian people who live in states like South Carolina, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Georgia – where far different views dominate the discourse.

Unless the Supreme Court rules broadly against California’s ban on same-sex marriage, which seems unlikely to the smart people who have been dissecting the arguments, then some gay people could be waiting decades for equal rights under the law.

How long, exactly, is the subject of some debate.

“In Republican-leaning red states, which uniformly have banned gay marriage, few seem to be having second thoughts,” writes Ronald Brownstein in the National Journal.

“For the near future, the nation appears locked onto a trajectory in which almost all reliably blue states will establish gay marriage (or civil unions) and possibly not a single reliably red state will follow.”

Trajectory, locked. Awesome.

I did find a glimmer of hope, however, in an analysis from Nate Silver, The New York Times blogger and data wiz who correctly predicted the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.

Silver says even the reddest of the red states will change eventually.

Thirty-two states would support same-sex marriage in a popular vote by the year 2016, he writes in a recent blog post. “And by 2020, voters in 44 states would do so, assuming that same-sex marriage continues to gain support at roughly its previous rate.”

The six states left out? South Carolina, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi, according to his analysis. With Mississippi being last.

I recently spent some time in that state, which passed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage by a majority vote of 86%. In states like that, gay people find it difficult in some communities just to exist, much less hold commitment ceremonies.

I met gay kids who had been harassed at school; a couple that keep a security camera on their porch; and a man who says he was fired because of his sexual orientation. (That’s legal in Mississippi and 28 other states, by the way, and it’s something no one’s talking about.)

Opinion: Which state matches your values on LGBT rights?

The conversation is changing – there are plenty of proud, brave and openly gay people living in the Deep South – but it’s happening at an uneven clip.

And these delays matter for real people.

In Mississippi, I met folks like L.B. and Sara Bell, who are legally married in Connecticut but don’t get any of the rights that go with that partnership in the Hospitality State. They told me they would like to start a family but worry about both of them getting custody, since Mississippi bans adoption by same-sex parents. Sara, who would like to carry the child, is 31. If same-sex marriage isn’t legalized until, say, 2030, she would be 48.

It would be nice to overlook this mushy, awkward middle period – our county’s pimply adolescence on gay rights – and jump straight to an all-inclusive future.

But these teenage years matter. They affect how millions of Americans live today. And the transition could also affect what type of nation we become. Let’s hope they go by quickly.

In an interview with CBS News airing during the Super Bowl show Sunday, Obama said, “My attitude is that gays and lesbians should have access and opportunity the same way everybody else does, in every institution and walk of life.” He called the Scouts “a great institution” that offers skills that benefit children throughout their lives.

The Scouts announced last week that its national board would discuss allowing local groups to decide whether to admit gays. The board’s meeting begins in Irving, Texas, on Monday.

The announcement follows a decades-old determination to bar homosexual boys and adult leaders – a ban the Scouts reaffirmed in July.

Weeks after the organization did so, the White House told the Washington Blade that Obama opposed the ban.

The president considers the Scouts “a valuable organization that has helped educate and build character,” White House spokesman Shin Inouye said in the statement, which continued: “He also opposes discrimination in all forms, and as such opposes this policy that discriminates on basis of sexual orientation.”

Obama is honorary president of the Boy Scouts of America.

“The policy change under discussion would allow the religious, civic or educational organizations that oversee and deliver scouting to determine how to address this issue,” Scouts spokesman Deron Smith said in a statement. “The Boy Scouts would not, under any circumstances, dictate a position to units, members or parents.”

The proposed change is likely to be controversial. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, an Eagle Scout, says he will defend the current policy. In addition, a majority of local chartering groups are faith-based, including the Roman Catholic and Mormon churches. Both are likely to continue to bar gay scouts and leaders, whatever the Boy Scouts’ national board decides.

Ian Finkenbinder came to the steps of the Supreme Court wearing the dress uniform from the Army that discharged him after he said he was gay.

John Lewis and Stuart Gaffney donned the black tuxedos and bright blue ties they wore for their 2008 marriage in California.

Carmen Guzman came bearing tearful memories of a step-parent who called her a deviant when she came out, and high school classmates who sneaked up behind her and pushed her down the stairs.

“I have waited my entire life for this day,” said Guzman, of McLean, who arrived with her wife, Ikeita, outside the Supreme Court on the day it heard arguments in the first of two cases involving gay marriage.

Inside the court, the justices were grappling with often highly technical questions involving precedent and standing. But for many of the thousands who massed on the sidewalks and streets outside — some after waiting days to get a coveted seat inside — the issues were intensely personal.

On Tuesday, the Supreme Court took up the Proposition 8 case, the challenge to California’s ban on same-sex marriage. The Post’s Robert Barnes explains what you need to know from the hour of oral arguments. (JulieAnn McKellogg/The Washington Post)

“It’s our very lives that are before the court today,” said Gaffney, 50, recalling being introduced to Lewis at a party 26 years ago and thinking he had just met his future husband. “I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else in the world today. It’s history in the making.”

Many in the crowd played a role in making that history happen.

Jennifer Pizer and Jon Davidson of Lambda Legal, a gay activist group that brought a suit overturning laws that criminalized sodomy, got up at 4:30 a.m. to be near the front of the line for lawyers seeking seats inside the court.

“It’s a little scary,” she said of the uncertainty over how the court will rule. “But we all know we’re living in a very special moment.”

Finkenbinder, an Arab linguist from Seattle who was booted from the Army after announcing his sexual orientation, has become an activist who once chained himself to the White House fence to protest the administration’s now abandoned “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy.

Judging by the signs they carried, the crowd was overwhelmingly composed of people and groups that support marriage equality. Some had conversations, mostly civil, with people supporting the traditional definition of marriage.

“It’s been okay,” said Orlando Irizarry, a pastor from Providence, R.I., of the exchanges between marriage equality supporters and Irizarry’s group holding up a banner reading “Man + Woman = Marriage.”

“What is so beautiful about this nation is you can give your point of view in peace.”

Eight members of the Topeka-based Westboro Baptist Church, who often demonstrate at military funerals, held provocatively worded signs indicating their view that God does not confer grace on homosexuals.

Staking out a position right next to them were several members of Ravensworth Baptist Church in Annandale, which is part of the Association of Welcoming and Affirming Baptists. Before going to the court, they had attended an interfaith service of other religious people who also support same-sex marriage.

“I kept thinking of Martin Luther King standing before that other courthouse in Montgomery,” said Steve Hyde, the Ravensworth pastor. “That’s where he said: ‘How long? Not long.’ I sense something is happening today. It’s a great day to be on the right side of history.”

Others also saw similarities with the civil rights movement. Melissa Wasser, 26, came with several friends from Youngstown State University in Ohio, where she is a junior. She carried a handmade poster that included a wedding portrait of her African American father and white mother.

“My parents used to be illegal, too,” the poster said.

Some tourists, unable to resist the allure of being in town while a potentially landmark case was before the court, rose early to join long lines hoping for coveted seats inside.

Melissa Leathers drove into Washington from Cincinnati on Monday night, planning to show her children the city’s monuments during spring break. But her son, Will, who dreams of becoming a lawyer, helped persuade her to make the Supreme Court their first stop.

“My son turns 18 next week, and all he wanted for his birthday was to get a seat in court so he can hear arguments,” she said.

Afia Bonner and Michele Didero flew in from San Francisco. They voted against Proposition 8, the voter-approved gay marriage ban now before the court, and they wanted to see how it ends, like the last chapter in a book.

But however the judges rule, the young women, both in their early 20s, said they are mindful of how much older gay activists have had to fight and how rapidly American attitudes toward same-sex couples have shifted.

“We started on second base,” said Bonner, who is 23. “It’s sad to think we have to keep on fighting. But every generation has its own battles.”"

http://news.yahoo.com/gay-rights-bill-moves-forward-opposition-silent-205737899--election.html,,[],Gay rights bill moves forward as opposition silent,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Invoking the Declaration of Independence, proponents of a bill that would outlaw discrimination against gays in the workplace argued on Tuesday that the measure is rooted in fundamental fairness for all Americans.

Republican opponents of the measure were largely silent, neither addressing the issue on the second day of Senate debate nor commenting unless asked. Written statements from some rendered their judgment that the bill would result in costly, frivolous lawsuits and mandate federal law based on sexuality.

The Senate moved closer to completing its work on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act that would prohibit workplace discrimination against gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said a final vote in the Senate is possible by week's end.

Senate passage of the bill would represent a major victory for advocates of gay rights just months after the Supreme Court affirmed gay marriage and granted federal benefits to legally married same-sex couples and three years after Congress ended the ban on gays serving openly in the military.

Illinois was poised to become the 15th state to legalize gay marriage after the state's Legislature gave its final approval Tuesday, sending it to the governor, who has said he'll sign it.

""I don't believe in discriminating against anybody,"" said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a backer of the measure who voted against a similar, narrower bill 17 years ago. Hatch said the bill has language ensuring religious freedom that he expects the Senate to toughen.

The measure, however, faces strong opposition in the Republican-controlled House, where Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, maintains that it is unnecessary and could prove too expensive and litigious for businesses.

Resistance remains within GOP ranks even as the national party, looking beyond core older voters, tries to be more inclusive. Republicans struggled to win over young people and independents in the 2012 presidential election.

Story continues

Asked why he opposed the bill, Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., said the measure is ""somewhat pandering to the special groups that I think should not have to be singled out by themselves. I think they're normal citizens like everybody else.""

A bipartisan group of senators pressed ahead with the legislation, casting it as a clear sign of Americans' greater acceptance of homosexuality that has significantly changed the political dynamic.

A Pew Research survey in June found that more Americans said homosexuality should be accepted rather than discouraged by society by a margin of 60 percent to 31 percent. Opinions were more evenly divided 10 years ago.

""What changed is society has changed,"" said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. ""Personal attitudes have changed, business is for it. There's just widespread support for taking these other steps in passing a civil rights bill.""

A chief sponsor of the measure, Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., said that in his home state, Nike supports the measure.

About 88 percent of Fortune 500 companies have adopted nondiscrimination policies that include sexual orientation, according to the Human Rights Campaign. About 57 percent of those companies include gender identity.

""It's time to end this discrimination,"" Merkley said in a Senate speech. ""It's certainly about the vision of the Declaration of Independence that has the promise of life, liberty and pursuit of happiness as the founding motivation.""

Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy said his home state of Connecticut has had a discrimination law since 1991 and frivolous lawsuits are uncommon. Based on the latest data from 2009 and 2010, 53 of 1,740 employment-based complaints were based on sexual orientation, Murphy said.

""Fifty years from now history is going to judge no less harshly those that voted against this act as it judges now those that voted against some of the civil rights acts of the 1950s and 1960s,"" Murphy said.

Current federal law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, race and national origin. But it doesn't stop an employer from firing or refusing to hire workers because they are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender.

The bill would bar employers with 15 or more workers from using a person's sexual orientation or gender identity as the basis for making employment decisions, including hiring, firing, compensation or promotion. The bill would exempt religious institutions and the military.

Sens. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., were crafting an amendment to the bill that would prevent federal, state and local governments from retaliating against religious groups that are exempt from the law.

""It focuses on religious liberty,"" Portman said. ""It provides a non-retaliation clause in the federal law comparable to what a lot of states have.""

Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., was working on an amendment to expand the number of groups that are covered under the religious exemption.

Portman, Ayotte and Toomey were the last three Republicans who voted Monday night to advance the bill as it past its first hurdle on a 61-30 vote. After the vote, Portman's son Will, a student at Yale, tweeted, ""Go dad ... Sens Portman and Toomey vote yes. Cloture is reached on #ENDA.""

The Ohio senator announced in March that he supports same-sex marriage, saying his views began changing in 2011, when his son told his parents he was gay and that it wasn't a choice but ""part of who he was.""

Portman said he exchanged messages with his son after the vote."
"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-same-sex-marriage-support-poll-20130320,0,7171048.story",2013-03-20 07:00:00,[],<b>Poll: </b>Acceptance of same-sex marriage on the rise,"WASHINGTON -- A new public opinion survey is the latest to confirm a major social trend that shows no sign of ebbing: rising acceptance of same-sex marriage and homosexuality in America.

Fully one in seven adults (14%) say they’ve changed their mind about gay rights, often because they have a friend or family member who is gay, according to the new national poll by the independent Pew Research Center.

Recently, another national poll, by the Washington Post and ABC News, found that support for gay marriage is now at an all-time high, as the Supreme Court prepares to take up the issue, including a test of California’s Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriages.

The Pew poll shows less lopsided support for gay marriage than the Post/ABC poll, but both surveys reflect similar shifts in favor of same-sex unions. The Pew poll also traces the causes of the wider social shift, one of the biggest on any issue question over the past decade. These roots are worth examining, even if some may not seem overly surprising—like the fact that the emergence of a younger, more tolerant generation has a lot to do with the overall change in public attitudes.

TIMELINE: Gay marriage through the years

In the 18-32 age bracket, support for same-sex marriage is at 70%. Ten years ago, among members of the same generation, it was 51%. But support for same-sex marriage has also increased among those born between 1928 and 1945; in 2003, just 17% were in favor, and today that figure is 31%.

Among those who’ve changed their minds about gay marriage, one in four (25%) say it’s just because they’ve grown older. One in five (20%) say today’s world is different and this change is inevitable. Nearly as many (18%) say they think that government should no longer intrude in people’s lives in this way and that individuals should be free to do what makes them happy. Almost one in three (32%) say it’s because they know someone who is gay. And 13% credit a belief in individual rights or various moral or religious teachings for their change of heart.

The shifting attitudes toward same-sex marriage closely track changing opinions about homosexuality. Today, a slight majority of Americans (51%) says that same-sex marriage isn’t a threat to traditional families. A decade ago, when Massachusetts became the first state to permit same-sex marriage, most people (56%) said the practice would undermine the traditional family and only 39% said it wasn’t a threat.

Evolving opinions toward gay and lesbian rights closely resemble other social and political divides, the study finds. For example, nearly two in three Democrats (63%) disagrees with the notion that allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally undermines the traditional family, while just 33% agree. In 2003, Democrats were evenly split on the question. Among independents, growing support for gay marriage has largely paralleled increases among Democrats.

At the same time, Republican attitudes are little changed. In 2003, 59% of Republicans said homosexuality should be discouraged; today that figure is 54%, according to Pew’s polling. The percentage of Republicans who favor gay marriage stands at 27% today, versus 21% a decade ago.

There is a gender gap on gay marriage (women are in favor; men are opposed), as well as an age divide. Those over 50 are against gay marriage, with resistance highest among those over 65. Americans with a high school education or less are opposed, while support for gay marriage is highest among college graduates. Income levels, too, reflect differences of opinion; those with family incomes above $75,000 support gay marriage, while those who earn less are evenly split. Regionally, support for gay marriage is highest in the Northeast and the West, while opposition is highest in the South. The Midwest is more evenly divided, with those favoring gay marriage slightly outnumbering opponents (48% to 43%), according to the Pew survey.

Among religious groups, only white mainline Protestants have registered substantial changes on gay issues, the study finds. A majority in 2003 (58%) said gay marriage would go against their religious beliefs; today that figure is 44%. Evangelical Protestants remain strongly opposed to gay marriage, while the highest level of support is among those who list their religious preference as unaffiliated.

For students of polling, the Pew study offers an instructive look at the ways that the wording of survey questions can generate seemingly divergent results on the same issue.

Compared with the ABC/Post survey, the Pew poll found significantly lower support overall, even though the two polls were conducted within a few days of each other.

Nor were the differences some sampling glitch. The way that Post/ABC pollsters ask Americans about gay marriage has consistently produced a balance of opinion more favorable to legalization than Pew’s polls. Those polled by the Post and ABC News are offered a simple choice: “Do you think it should be legal or illegal for gay and lesbian couples to get married?”

Pew asks a more complicated question: “Do you strongly favor, favor, oppose, or strongly oppose allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally?” Pew’s results reflect a much closer division of opinion on the issue (a 5-percentage-point difference in favor of gay marriage, versus a 32-point pro-marriage tilt in the latest Post/ABC survey).

But, as the Pew study notes, “the two polls tell the same story: significant growth in support for same-sex marriage over the last 10 years.”

It's not every day you see an ex-president ask the Supreme Court to strike down a law he signed.

That's what Bill Clinton is doing with the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman -- and which the high court will rule on this year in a landmark moment for the gay marriage movement.

The justices must decide whether the Defense of Marriage Act ""is consistent with the principles of a nation that honors freedom, equality and justice above all, and is therefore constitutional,"" Clinton writes in The Washington Post.

He says, ""As the president who signed the act into law, I have come to believe that DOMA is contrary to those principles and, in fact, incompatible with our Constitution.""

Clinton says that when he signed the law in 1996, ""it was a very different time."" No state recognized same-sex marriage, but some were considering it -- and congressional opponents proposed ""quite draconian"" responses, the 42nd president writes.

""As a bipartisan group of former senators stated in their March 1 amicus brief to the Supreme Court, many supporters of the bill known as DOMA believed that its passage 'would defuse a movement to enact a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, which would have ended the debate for a generation or more,'"" Clinton writes.

Now nine states and the District of Columbia sanction gay marriage, but those couples are denied rights available to others, Clinton says. They ""cannot file their taxes jointly, take unpaid leave to care for a sick or injured spouse or receive equal family health and pension benefits as federal civilian employees.""

Clinton says:

""When I signed the bill, I included a statement with the admonition that 'enactment of this legislation should not, despite the fierce and at times divisive rhetoric surrounding it, be understood to provide an excuse for discrimination.' Reading those words today, I know now that, even worse than providing an excuse for discrimination, the law is itself discriminatory. It should be overturned.""

The Supreme Court decision is likely in late June."

Frum defended what was then the consensus conservative (and consensus national) position. Redefining marriage to include same-sex couples, he argued, would explicitly sever the institution’s connection to the two interrelated realities, gender difference and procreation, that it had evolved to address. In so doing, it would replace a traditional view of matrimony with a broader, thinner, more adult-centric view, which would ultimately be less likely to bind parents to children, husbands to wives.

“Proponents of gay marriage can only get what they want,” Frum wrote, “by weakening Americans’ attachment to the traditional family even more than it has already been weakened,” and speeding the “process of social dissolution” that the 1960s and 1970s began.

Sullivan countered that the “process” Frum feared was simply an established fact. Heterosexuals had already severed marriage from procreation and permanence, and so there was no more reason to deny same-sex couples marriage licenses than to deny them to the infertile and elderly. Indeed, far from being radical, gay marriage was more likely to be stabilizing, “sending a message about matrimonial responsibility and mutual caring” to gays and straights alike."

Russian opposition to American intervention in Syria has been a major factor in Obama’s decision to seek approval from Congress for military action in Syria. On Saturday, Obama blasted the UN Security Council, a veiled reference to Russia, by calling it “completely paralyzed and unwilling to hold [Syrian President Bashar] Assad accountable.”

While in Moscow, Obama plans to meet with human rights activists Lev Ponomarev and Lyudmila Alexeyeva, legal aid non-governmental-organization director Pavel Chikov, and Coming Out.

Russia and the United States have been at odds over myriad issues over the past few months, including Russia’s grant of asylum to NSA leaker Edward Snowden, Russia’s law against “gay propaganda,” and Russia’s Middle Eastern policy in support of Iran and Syria.

President Obama’s language has become markedly dismissive of Putin and Russia; in a recent press conference, Obama characterized Putin as demonstrating the body language of a “bored kid in the back of a classroom.” That language was said to have infuriated the notoriously prickly Putin. During that same press conference, Obama said, “One of the things I’m really looking forward to is maybe some gay and lesbian athletes bringing home the gold or silver or bronze, which I think would go a long way in rejecting the kind of attitudes that we’re seeing there.”

The White House website brags about Obama’s stellar relationship with Russian leadership: “In one of his earliest new foreign policy initiatives, President Obama sought to reset relations with Russia and reverse what he called a ‘dangerous drift’ in this important bilateral relationship.”

In an interview with the Des Moines Register, the politician said that embracing gay marriage would be ""suicidal"" for the party. The former senator also noted that some Republicans, like Sen.

Rob Portman of Ohio, who have openly endorsed gay marriage are no different than those politicians who parted ideological ways from the party over the abortion issue in the 1960s and 1970s.

""I'm sure you could go back and read stories, oh, you know, 'The Republican party's going to change. This is the future.' Obviously that didn't happen,"" Santorum told the outlet. ""I think you're going to see the same stories written now and it's not going to happen. The Republican party's not going to change on this issue. In my opinion it would be suicidal if it did.""

Santorum went on to note that speaking about how best to communicate messages is fine, but that transforming ""foundational principles"" is another story -- one that could prove problematic for the GOP.

""Just because some of those things happen to be popular right now doesn't mean the Republican party should follow suit,"" he noted.

As far as the Supreme Court goes on the marriage front, Santorum believes that the nation's highest court won't follow the same pattern it embraced in deciding Roe v. Wade, the contentious abortion case that legalized the procedure back in 1973.

Story continues

""I think you'll see, hopefully, a chastened Supreme Court is not going to make the same mistake in the (current) cases as they did in Roe v. Wade,"" he said. ""I'm hopeful the Supreme Court learned its lesson about trying to predict where the American public is going on issues and trying to find rights in the Constitution that sit with the fancy of the day.""

The politician also said that the door for a presidential run in 2016 could be open, but that much consideration and contemplation still remains to be made.

(CNN) —

Republicans portray themselves as the party of family values. Yet, in Wyoming, one prominent group of right wing kinfolk will spend the holidays embroiled in a family feud.

You don’t get to choose your family. Still, family members might choose a destructive lifestyle that puts them at odds with loved ones. They make others uncomfortable, and hurt those who love them. These people are often thinking only of themselves, and they haven’t considered the consequences of their behavior.

Liz Cheney is one of these people. And the destructive lifestyle she has chosen is that of a politician.

The Republican Senate candidate from Wyoming is running to the right of Republican incumbent Sen. Mike Enzi. And because that might not be so easy to do, whenever the challenger offers an opinion on a topic, it’s difficult to know if she’s speaking from the heart – or pandering to the lowest common denominator.

Courtesy San Diego Union Tribune Ruben Navarrette Jr.

An independent political group calling itself the American Principles Fund, which is defending Enzi, recently launched an ad attacking Cheney for opposing a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage and supporting the decision of the State Department to give benefits to same-sex partners of employees.

Cheney sisters spar over same-sex marriage, parents weigh in

This week, while calling on Enzi to denounce the ad and labeling it “gutter politics,” Cheney stood by those earlier positions. During an interview on “Fox News Sunday,” she said:

“I don’t believe we ought to discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation. If people are in a same-sex relationship and they want their partner to be able to have health benefits or be designated as a beneficiary on their life insurance, there’s no reason we shouldn’t do that.”

Nonetheless, that ad puts Cheney in a tight spot, and given that Wyoming is a very conservative state and given that she’s trying to position herself on the far right of the spectrum, she can’t be seen as soft on same-sex marriage.

Thus, in the same interview, she made clear that she doesn’t favor allowing same-sex couples to wed and that she supports “the traditional definition of marriage.”

It’s a position that Cheney has long held. That is part of the problem. In a country where, as public opinion polls make clear, the opinion of so many Americans on same-sex marriage is rapidly evolving due in large part to the fact that young Americans consider this a nonissue, it would have been good to see some personal growth from Cheney.

Besides, she should tread lightly on this subject. Why? Because blood is thicker than votes. And because Michael Corleone was right, and – even in the rough and tumble of politics – you “don’t ever take sides with anyone against the family.”

And, for the Cheney family, this issue is personal. Liz’s sister, Mary, is in a same-sex marriage and has two children with her wife and longtime companion, Heather Poe.

“I love Mary very much. I love her family very much. This is just an issue in which we disagree,” Cheney said on “Fox News Sunday.”

Mary Cheney wasn’t having any of it. Not long after the interview, she posted this rebuttal on Facebook:

“Liz – this isn’t just an issue on which we disagree – you’re just wrong – and on the wrong side of history.”

Mary also shared a post by Poe, who was likewise bothered by Liz’s comments. It read:

“I was watching my sister-in-law on Fox News Sunday (yes Liz, in fifteen states and the District of Columbia you are my sister-in-law) and was very disappointed to hear her say ‘I do believe in the traditional definition of marriage….

“Liz has been a guest in our home, has spent time and shared holidays with our children, and when Mary and I got married in 2012 – she didn’t hesitate to tell us how happy she was for us.

“To have her now say she doesn’t support our right to marry is offensive to say the least.”

Here is what Liz Cheney missed: To many proponents of marriage equality, the very idea of “traditional marriage” is offensive. You see, tradition is the antithesis of progress. It was once tradition that women didn’t have the right to vote, and African-Americans used separate restrooms, and U.S.-born Mexican-Americans were swept up in immigration sweeps. Those things had to change, and they did. In those instances, Americans decided that tradition should take a back seat to things like fairness, justice and equality.

This year, Christmas dinner at the Cheney house is bound to be awkward. The kids are fighting, and that sort of thing always hurts the parents most of all.

“This is an issue we have dealt with privately for many years, and we are pained to see it become public,” Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife, Lynne, said Monday in a statement.

They insisted that Liz Cheney has “always treated her sister and her sister’s family with love and respect, exactly as she should have done.” And, they said, “Compassion is called for, even when there is disagreement about such a fundamental matter.”

The Cheneys know something about compassion. Over the years, they have been remarkably graceful and supportive toward Mary Cheney and her family. Dick Cheney has challenged conservatives in his own party by saying that gays and lesbians should be allowed to marry and that – despite calls for a federal ban on same-sex marriage – the issue should be handled at the state level.

I know something about what Liz Cheney is going through. As recently as 14 years ago, I was opposed to same-sex marriage and supported the watered-down alternative: civil unions. I thought this was a battle that wasn’t worth fighting and that gay activists should focus their attention elsewhere.

However, my younger brother, who is gay, wouldn’t let me get away with it. He challenged me. He told me I was wrong. He forced me to be a better person. I changed my view, and came to understand that Americans can’t have a two-tiered system, where some of us enjoy the right to marry the people we love while our brothers and sisters and cousins are denied that right, based on nothing more than sexual orientation. It’s discrimination with all its ugliness.

In the end, this is where we should arrive. Not just because you love your brother, or your sister, but because, just as importantly, you love your country. And you understand what America stands for above all else: freedom.

For all of us. Or none of us.

http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/12/07/waitress-in-anti-gay-receipt-flap-reportedly-issuing-refunds-to-donors/,2013-12-07 00:00:00,[],Waitress in anti-gay receipt flap reportedly issuing refunds to donors,"A New Jersey waitress who received thousands of dollars in gratuities after claiming she received an anti-gay note in lieu of a tip is reportedly issuing refunds to those who gave donations.

Dayna Morales, a 22-year-old former Marine, claimed last month that a family of four who racked up a $93.55 bill at the Gallop Asian Bistro in Branchburg, N.J., left her no tip, only a note saying they couldn’t leave any extra cash for her service because they “do not agree with your lifestyle.”

Morales quickly emailed the story to a gay advocacy website and later posted a photograph of the purported check on her Facebook page. The alleged incident made national headlines and resulted in thousands of dollars being donated to Morales, who said she would send all proceeds to the Wounded Warrior Project.

NBCNewYork.com reported Friday that three people who sent money to a PayPal account set up in her name say their donations were refunded. One of her supporters, Brittney Stilgenbauer of Tuscon, Ariz., said she felt bad about the situation.

""I felt awful for her, and I thought it would be great if people could come together and donate a dollar each and make up for her tip that she lost,"" said Stilgenbauer, who encouraged Morales to set up a PayPal account to accept donations.

At least one man who sent cash to Morales at the restaurant told NBCNewYork.com he has not gotten the money back. Morales did not respond to requests for comment from the station.

Meanwhile, a representative of the Florida-based Wounded Warrior Project could not confirm Morales had made any donations as of Wednesday, Bridgewater Patch reported.

A representative for the nonprofit group that caters to veterans returning from overseas checked for donations by Morales’ name and within the ZIP codes for Bridgewater, N.J., where she worked, and Bedminster, where Morales said she lives, and was unable to locate any correlating donations. The donations may have been made from a different ZIP code or by a third-party, the representative told the website.

Morales, who served in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve from July 2009 through May 2013 in Newburgh, N.Y., as an administrative specialist, could not be reached for comment. Restaurant manager Byron Lapola told NJ.com earlier this week that she remains off the schedule, at least temporarily.

“We’re still waiting for the owners to finish their investigation,” Lapola told the website. “It’s pretty complex, so until then we’re restraining comment.”

The couple accused of leaving the note for Morales has since denied doing so, telling NBC 4 New York they did in fact leave an $18 tip on the $93 bill. The unidentified couple also provided the station a credit card statement that indicated the tip, according to the report.

NBC News has also reported that a Pentagon source said Morales was dismissed from the Marine Reserve Corps in May because she was not attending drills and that she was discharged under “less than honorable” conditions.

Several of Morales’ acquaintances also since questioned her credibility. Kristina Calamusa, who described herself as a former friend of Morales, told The Daily Caller late last month that the waitress claimed to her that she was “blown up by a land mine overseas.”

But, according to Calamusa, that story was false; Morales was never on active duty. The Journal News of White Plains, N.Y., has also quoted acquaintances of Morales who say she lied about her military service.

Julie Howat and Karolee Larkin, both 23, related to the newspaper a story Morales supposedly told them about her serving in Afghanistan and surviving an explosion that killed everyone in her platoon, leaving her as the unit’s sole survivor. But Maj. Shawn Haney, a spokesman for the Marines, said in an email to The Journal News that while Morales did serve in the Marines Corps reserve from July 2009 to May 2013, there’s no indication in her record of combat service in Afghanistan or Iraq.

“While (Morales) did not fulfill her reserve obligation, per the Privacy Act, administrative actions are not releasable,” Haney said. “The same applies to character of service and type of discharge.”

Accomplishment: When your father Dick Cheney has to go on record saying you're a bigger jerk than he is.

This is an issue we have dealt with privately for many years, and we are pained to see it become public. Since it has, one thing should be clear. Liz has always believed in the traditional definition of marriage. She has also treated her sister and her sister's family with love and respect, exactly as she should have done. Compassion is called for, even when there is disagreement about such a fundamental matter and Liz's many kindnesses shouldn't be used to distort her position.

Looks like there's trouble in the Cheney clan. Liz Cheney is running for something, and in the Republican party running for something means you're against gay marriage, even though her own sister is gay. Her father Dick is not running for anything anymore, which means he has been freed to have a non-scummy opinion on the subject—and really, when noted torture-of-prisoners advocate Dick Cheney is not a gigantic asshole about something, it stands out. So now we get to watch the spectacle of Dick and Lynne Cheney releasing a public statement distancing themselves from their campaigning daughter. I like how they preemptively defend Liz from the notion that she's just pretending to be an intolerant ass on the subject. Oh no, dear Republicans, we assure you Liz has always been an intolerant ass about this. For years! She just swallows her bile in front of her sister, most of the time, because family and whatnot.

Put this up as another reason you probably never want to eat dinner with the Cheney family on Thanksgiving. That is probably going to be one, er, interesting evening. (And I hope they're not going to be cooking anyone we know.)

Severe obesity, soaring healthcare costs, poverty, starving children, immigration, texting and driving to name a few. You will change your profile pic to show that you are supportive - but what are you ACTUALLY doing to help our country? I promise the supreme court doesn't care about your Facebook profile picture.

Every time I see a Facebook status or a tweet that reads like this:I know right away that the person behind the words has no tangible friendship or touchable connection with a person who is gay. I know that the person is speaking from a place devoid of the sort of empathy that comes from truly connecting with a person who is being deprived of rights.

Because let me tell you why I changed my profile picture to that small, meaningless speck of red peppered with two horizontal bars. I did it not because I think it's going to influence Justice Kennedy's legal opinion. I'm a few months shy of being a lawyer, so I'm in as good a position as anyone to know that matters like this are decided in the reaches of highly analytical and highly calculated minds that sit under black robes.

No. I change my profile picture because I have friends who are gay. I have former co-workers who've displayed to me their humanity through their professionalism and their skill. I have friends who I've sat with to discuss the ways in which real-world bigotry keeps them from enjoying a full life. These are people I respect, and they are people who deserve respect.

And they should know that in their fight, in their battle for equality, they are not alone. I can't imagine what it must have been like to have been a black person during the 1960s, fighting out of second-hand citizenship to a place of at least some equality. If I had been there, and I had been black, I I might have looked to some of the people I thought were friends, and I might have said: ""Are you out there?""

I change my profile picture because, unlike you, conservative who is only concerned about concepts like ""children starving"" and ""poverty"" when it helps you make a point about the triviality of gay marriage, I understand that the freedom of each of us is tied to the freedom of everyone. It's that unmalleable concept that says to my gay friends: your liberation is bound up with mine.

I change my profile picture not because I've forgotten that there are big problems in the world. To the contrary, it's because I remember that our problems are big, and big problems are only solved by groups of people with the conviction to stand up with one another and for one another. Because during a day when I might advocate for protections for the poor, I can take a few seconds out to show my gay brothers and sisters that they are loved, respected, and worthy of support. It's not because I'm some great ambassador for gay rights. It's them, my friends so willing to fight for their own rights, who are the heroes, and if I can do the smallest something to show them that they're not on an island, then I will do that.

My profile picture didn't change because I think such a change will change the world. It changed because I'm lucky enough to have tangible relationships with real people whose lives are dramatically affected by this movement. And I'm sorry that you don't."

As Good As You blogger Jeremy Hooper first reported, the boy -- who is not identified -- stood in front of the Winston-Salem church on Easter Sunday with a placard that read, ""Jesus Must Be Your Lord Or He Will Not Be Your Savior.""

""The Bible talks about the homosexuals -- they're worthy of death,"" the boy proclaims, as seen in video footage of the protest which was also posted on Hooper's site. ""They're worthy of death, and you people approve of them! That's why you're going to Hell without Jesus Christ. You can turn from your sin!""

He adds, ""It's time to stop sinning and follow the lord Jesus Christ!""

Last month, footage of an 11-year-old girl testifying against same-sex marriage before the Minnesota House Committee on Civil Law made the blogosphere rounds. (The bill was later passed by the committee, and now awaits a vote in the Senate and House scheduled for later this session.)

“If you change the law to say two moms and two dads can get married, it would take away something very important for children like me across the state,"" the girl read in a prepared statement.

Last month, Green Street United Methodist Church officials said in a statement that ministers at the church would be asked to refrain from performing weddings for any couple inside the sanctuary.

“We are asking our ministers not to perform sacraments of marriage, as far as the wedding vows, wedding rings, and the announcement of the marriage in the sanctuary until the United Methodist Church says it is equitable or same sex couples can get married in the church,” Tim Sturgis, a congregation member, told 88.5 WFDD.

The gay Republican was referring to GOProud’s exclusion from participation at CPAC for a second year in a row, banned as an official sponsor. LaSalvia attended CPAC as a guest of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a sponsor of CPAC which hosted a panel Thursday on which LaSalvia appeared, “A Rainbow on the Right: Growing the Coalition, Bringing Tolerance Out of the Closet.”

At the packed panel, attended by younger CPAC members, including quite a few conservative gays and lesbians, conservative commentators and activists on the panel who support marriage equality, including CNN pundit Margaret Hoover and Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin, made the case for gay marriage as a conservative value. Earlier in the day Senator Marco Rubio, criticized those who would call him a “bigot” for not supporting same-sex marriage, underscoring the tension the issue continues to cause among conservatives. LaSalvia, for his part, however, agreed with Rubio, making a similar statement during the panel discussion and getting applause from the audience. (Scroll down to listen to the full interview)

“It’s truly about what people think conservatives think of gay people,” LaSalvia said in an interview on my SiriusXM radio program. “Kicking us out of CPAC doesn’t help. People aren’t going to vote for you if they think you hate their family and friends.”

“How do we have a winning coalition in the future, in a world that has gay people in every single family,” LaSalvia continued, a day before GOP Senator Rob Portman reversed his position and came out for marriage equality because his son had come out as gay. “It’s broader than marriage equality. It's about, 'Do you support my loved ones?' I think that a lot of the establishment leaders are out of touch with America and with their own base. There are a few folks in the establishment that don’t like gay people.”

Asked why GOProud endorsed candidates like Mitt Romney, who supported an constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, said that was old news.

“Mitt Romney is as relevant as Mike Dukakis is now,” he said. “So let’s not talk about the past. I know that it’s embarrassing to call yourself a Republican right now. I’m embarrassed to call myself a Republican right now. The question is, 'Are we going to be able to build new coalition that can win, that includes gay people, or not? Are they going to become the Dixiecrats or are they gong to go on and win elections?'”

Partners became spouses following the decision by a U.S. judge that the state’s ban was illegal.

A fresh battle over same-sex marriage in conservative Utah, the heart of Mormon country, has offered gay-rights advocates hope that their effort has reached a national tipping point.

The judge who struck down the state’s same-sex marriage ban refused to stay his own ruling Monday, beating back the third challenge in two days to his Friday ruling declaring the state’s ban unconstitutional. Utah is expected to take its appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Denver, but in the meantime hundreds of same-sex couples continued to get married at Salt Lake City’s county courthouse.

Judge Robert J. Shelby’s ruling is particularly significant because it represents the first time a federal court has ruled on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage bans since the Supreme Court struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act in June. The ruling will serve as a precedent for other states facing challenges to their bans, and it sets the stage for a Supreme Court decision that would apply to all 50 states.

“This case could decide the issue of same-sex marriage across the United States of America,” said Clifford Rosky, a University of Utah professor of law and expert on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender legal issues.

Also on Monday, in a far narrower ruling, a federal judge in Ohio declared that state’s ban on gay marriage unconstitutional, though the ruling only applied to death certificates for gay couples. Still, it is expected to be precedent-setting, leading to more lawsuits in Ohio challenging the ban.

Eighteen states and the District of Columbia now allow same-sex marriage.

Several observers believed that Shelby’s decision — clearing the way for same-sex marriages in one of the country’s most politically and religiously conservative states, one dominated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — represents a pivotal point for the country.

One of the strongest indicators of the broader cultural shift on the issue is the growing acceptance of legal recognition of gay unions among Mormons.

According to a recent poll by the Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy at Brigham Young University, 54 percent of Mormons now favor civil unions for same-sex couples, and opposition to any legal recognition has dropped from 69 percent in 2004 — when state voters approved the ban — to 38 percent now.

The church is clear about its stance. “Marriage should be between a man and a woman,” it said plainly in a three-sentence statement following Friday’s ruling. But that statement reflected a change in tone that church leaders have been trying to strike since the church faced a storm of criticism for urging members to actively push and fund California’s Proposition 8, which briefly banned same-sex marriage there.

“Certainly they’ve stepped back from the public perspective on this,” says Ryan T. Cragun, a University of Tampa professor of sociology focusing on Mormonism. “[But] they’ve still been very opposed.”

The church, he said, still contributes to protecting traditional marriage in less-public ways, such as working with partner organizations.

But while its opposition to same-sex marriage may be unchanged, the Mormon Church’s statements on homosexuality are shifting, albeit in nuanced ways. On Mormonsandgays.com, a church Web site started a year ago outlining doctrine on homosexuality, the church states that being attracted to someone of the same sex is not a sin, though acting on it is still considered sinful.

“Even though individuals do not choose to have such attractions, they do choose how to respond to them,” the Web site reads. “With love and understanding, the Church reaches out to all God’s children, including our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters.”

Thirty years ago, being homosexual was in itself grounds for excommunication, said Greg Prince, a national director of Affirmation, a support group for LGBT Mormons and their families and friends. Now, he said, there are gay Mormon missionaries who are open about their sexual orientation; so long as they remain celibate, the church does not care, he said.

Besides recognizing what a public relations disaster the church’s support of Proposition 8 was, Prince said, the attitudes of many Mormons have been shaped by scientific research showing people are born gay instead of choosing it. Many Mormons also were moved to question their attitudes by a well-publicized study of homeless Mormon teens in Salt Lake City, which showed a large number of them had been kicked out of their parents’ homes for being gay, he said.

“Though the percentage of Mormons in Utah who favor gay marriage lags behind the national percentage, it’s a moving target,” he said. “We certainly have changed the way we view homosexuality, and the way we view homosexuals in our church.”

Salt Lake County Clerk Sherrie Swensen said more than 400 same-sex marriage licenses were issued Friday and Monday.

On Monday, hundreds of gay couples had flocked to county clerk offices around Utah seeking to get marriage licenses. In Salt Lake City, gay and lesbian couples began lining up Sunday night. More than a dozen clergy from different denominations set up tables in the lobby and performed on-the-spot weddings. Every two minutes or so, another couple left the building to the sound of jubilant cheers from well-wishers.

Among them were Kody Lee Partridge and Laurie Wood, Utah natives who were both raised as Mormons and graduated from Brigham Young University. The women were among three couples who were plaintiffs in the lawsuit Shelby decided on Friday, overturning Utah’s ban.

Wood recalled how she and Partridge applied for a marriage license in March and were rejected. The clerk was apologetic, Wood said, and suggested they hold on to their application a little while longer. After the judge’s ruling Friday, Wood said, the clerk recognized them in the courthouse and told them with a smile, “I guess you didn’t have to wait as long as you thought.” Wood and Partridge were married in the courthouse by an American Baptist minister who had heard about the ruling and rushed down hoping to officiate at someone’s wedding.

Partridge, who teaches high school English, said parents of her students gave the couple flowers and champagne, and many of her former students sent e-mails congratulating them.

“What a difference 10 years makes,” said Wood, 58. “Utah’s being exposed as a pretty great state. It’s so conservative. But it’s changing. It may have to be dragged into the 21st century, but it’s going to go there.”

“It’s a different state,” said Partridge, 47, who is descended from a prominent Mormon bishop.

The Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy at Brigham Young University has been tracking views on gay marriage in Utah for a decade in opinion polls that show a dramatic shift in attitudes since then.

In 2004, the year Utah voters approved a measure defining marriage as between a man and a woman, 54 percent of all Utah residents said they disapproved of any legal recognition of a gay couple’s relationship, including civil unions. Now, that opposition has dropped to 29 percent.

“Both nationally and even in Utah, there’s a generational difference,” said Kelly Patterson, a BYU political scientist who put the results on his blog, utahdatapoints.com. “It’s the younger members of both Republicans and the LDS faith who are driving a lot of this change.”

An estimated 47,000 to 63,000 residents of Utah are gay, lesbian or bisexual, according to a 2010 analysis of census data done by the Williams Institute, a think tank at UCLA’s law school that studies gay issues and law. About 3,800 identified themselves in census surveys as unmarried partners. More than half live in or around Salt Lake City."

Roberts is a conservative appointed by President George W. Bush in 2005. Podrasky, who is more liberal, said she rooted for his nomination to be approved by the U.S. Senate. “He is family,” she said.

Podrasky lives in San Francisco and usually sees Roberts only on family occasions. His mother is her godmother, whom she adores. She said Roberts knows she is gay and introduced her along with other relatives during his Senate confirmation hearing. She hopes he will meet her partner of four years, Grace Fasano, during their Washington visit. The couple flew to Washington on Sunday.

“He is a smart man,” she said. “He is a good man. I believe he sees where the tide is going. I do trust him. I absolutely trust that he will go in a good direction.”

Podrasky obtained the highly coveted courtroom seats by emailing Roberts’ sister, Peggy Roberts, and then going through his secretary. Roberts knows she is attending, she said. She, her partner, her sister and her niece will attend Tuesday’s arguments on Proposition 8. On Wednesday, her father will take her niece’s place for the hearing on the challenge to the Defense of Marriage Act.

TIMELINE: Gay marriage across the U.S.

Although Podrasky has no personal knowledge of her cousin’s views on same-sex marriage, she expects the court will overturn the 2008 ballot initiative, leaving her free to marry Fasano.

“I am definitely ready,” she said.

In the weeks before the November 2008 election, Podrasky carried a sign that said, “Prop. 8 is hate,” at a BART station and handed out fliers on a college campus. She called the passage of the gay marriage ban “such a blow.”

The San Francisco-based National Center for Lesbian Rights, which has fought for marriage rights, invited Podrasky to do a guest column about being related to the chief justice. The column will be emailed to members Monday.

“Everyone in this country has a family member who is part of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community…,” she wrote. “As a Californian, I want nothing more than to marry my wonderful girlfriend. And as a tax-paying citizen, I seek basic fairness.”

She said she does not know whether having a lesbian family member would influence Roberts’ thinking.

“Everybody knows somebody” who is gay, she said. “It probably impacts everybody.”

USA TODAY

10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the state%27s request for an emergency stay

Utah%27s last chance to temporarily stop the marriages would be the Supreme Court

Utah has become the 18th state to allow same-sex weddings

Same-sex marriages can continue in Utah, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday.

The Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court rejected the state's request to halt the issuance of licences until the appeals process concludes.

The Utah attorney general's office said it was ""disappointed"" by the court's refusal to issue a stay and would appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday morning. Justice Sonia Sotomayor is assigned to oversee the 10th Circuit, the Salt Lake Tribunenotes.

U.S. District Judge Richard Shelby struck down the state's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage Friday, saying it violated the constitutional rights of gay and lesbian couples. Monday, he refused to stop county clerks from issuing licences.

So far, about 700 same-sex couples have received marriage licences, most around Salt Lake City, headquarters of the Mormon church.

Utah is the 18th state where same-sex couples can legally marry, something voters thought they had outlawed in 2004.

Nearly two-thirds of the state's 2.8 million residents belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which deeply opposes homosexuality and same-sex marriage.

""Until the final word has been spoken by this Court or the Supreme Court on the constitutionality of Utah's marriage laws, Utah should not be required to enforce Judge Shelby's view of a new and fundamentally different definition of marriage,"" the state said in a motion to the appeals court.

Gov. Gary Herbert's office directed state agencies Tuesday afternoon to comply with Shelby's ruling or consult the Utah attorney general if there were conflicts with local rules.

The Utah Department of Workforce Services, which administers food stamps, welfare and related benefit programs, is recognizing the marriages of gay couples when they apply, a spokesman told the Associated Press on Tuesday.

But at least one county — the state's second largest — was refusing to issue same-sex licences.

In the letter, Marquell Smith writes that it ""breaks my heart that any elected leader would use the good people in AfricanAmerican churches as justification to limit the rights of others, based on the prejudices of how we were raised.""

""Like you I'm African-American,"" Smith's letter continues. ""I learned that the struggles of our people are a symbol of hope for those being discriminated against. We cannot let an important vehicle of past struggles —African-American churches— become the gatekeepers of the rights to dignity of others. Who are we to deny someone else the right to marry because we don't agree with who they love?""

The letter was addressed to six state representatives -- Will Davis, Mary Flowers, LaShawn Ford, Eddie Jackson, Chuck Jefferson and Andre Thapedi -- who are reportedly on the fence on the state's marriage equality bill.

The Illinois House Black Caucus has been the subject of extensive lobbying from both sides of the issue in recent months and the state's African-American faith leaders have been split on the bill.

A Chicago Sun-Times survey this week also found that members of the Illinois House Black Caucus were similarly split on the legislation -- and that only four of the 20 members were definite ""yes"" votes. Five others said they were leaning toward a ""yes,"" four were opposed and seven were still undecided.

Meanwhile, marriage equality advocates said this week that they have reached the number of votes they need in order to pass the bill, but a date has not been set for a vote. Former President Bill Clinton also threw his name into the matter this week, urging the state House to approve the bill and send it to Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn to be signed into law.

The state's spring legislative session ends on May 31. If the bill is not passed by the House by that date, it will be delayed for many months more."

Their questions reflected a unanimous craven impulse: How do we get out of this? This court is plenty bold imposing bad decisions on the country, like anointing W. president or allowing unlimited money to flow covertly into campaigns. But given a chance to make a bold decision putting them on the right, and popular, side of history, they squirm.

“Same-sex couples have every other right,” Chief Justice John Roberts said, sounding inane for a big brain. “It’s just about the label in this case.” He continued, “If you tell a child that somebody has to be their friend, I suppose you can force the child to say, ‘This is my friend,’ but it changes the definition of what it means to be a friend.”

Donald Verrilli Jr., the U.S. solicitor general arguing on the side of same-sex marriage, told the justices, “There is a cost to waiting.” He recalled that the argument by opponents of interracial marriage in Loving v. Virginia in 1967 was to delay because “the social science is still uncertain about how biracial children will fare in this world.”

The wisdom of the Warren court is reflected two miles away, where a biracial child is faring pretty well in his second term in the Oval Office.

The American Academy of Pediatrics last week announced its support for same-sex marriage, citing evidence that children of gays and lesbians do better when the couples marry. It may take another case, even another court, to legitimize same-sex marriage nationally, but the country has moved on. An ABC/Washington Post poll showed that 81 percent of Americans under 30 approve of gay marriage. Every time you blink, another lawmaker comes out of the closet on supporting the issue."

Michelle Obama won't abide demonstrations during her speeches.

""One of the things that I don't do well is this,"" the first lady said as a protester began yelling during her speech Tuesday night at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser.

Leaving the lectern, Obama moved toward the shouter and told the crowd they could ""listen to me or you can take the (microphone), but I'm leaving. You all decide. You have one choice.""

The crowd made clear they wanted the first lady to stay and for the protester to go, which is what happened.

The gay and lesbian rights organization Get EQUAL identified the protester as one of its members, Ellen Sturtz. She was calling for an executive order to bar discrimination by federal contractors based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

Obama went on with her speech.

""So let me make the point that I was making before,"" she said. ""We are here for our kids. So we must recapture that passion. That same urgency and energy that we felt back in 2008, 2012. Understand this — this is what I want you all to understand. This is not about us. No one back here. It's not about you or you or your issue or your thing. This is about our children.""

A group of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans issued a statement saying, ""LGBT people in North Carolina, New Mexico, Ohio and all over the country are dehumanized in our jobs, and we are forced into the closet in order to participate in the American dream.""

The statement said, ""We value the first lady's leadership and invite her to lead the charge within the Democratic Party to end employment discrimination. President Obama has an executive order sitting on his desk that can protect a quarter of the labor force in the U.S. from workplace discrimination. We will continue engaging leaders in the administration and the Democratic Party until President Obama fulfills a promise to our community made five years ago.""

But the general trend of public opinion toward greater acceptance of same-sex couples is clear. And there’s one subset of the population that’s especially intriguing: people who say homosexuality violates their religious beliefs yet are nevertheless inclined to allow gay unions as a matter of civil law. Call them “libertarian traditionalists”: culturally conservative in their own lives, but upholding equal rights for those who don’t share their values.

How big is this group? Perhaps surprisingly, more than 1 in 4 Americans hold those seemingly conflicted opinions – at least when it comes to the general principle of equal rights for gay couples.

TIMELINE: Gay marriage chronology

In an invaluable series of recent polls, the Pew Research Center has not only tracked the sea change in public opinion on homosexuality, but has broken it down into constituent parts.

Pew polls in 2012 and 2013 found that 48% of Americans now favor allowing allowing gays and Lesbians to marry legally, compared to 43% who are opposed. (Surveys performed more recently find even higher numbers in favor. An ABC News-Washington Post poll last month, for example, found 58% supporting gay marriage.)

The value in the large-sample Pew surveys is the level of detail they offer. Pew found that majorities of both Democrats (61%) and independents (53%) favor gay marriage; self-identified Republicans (25%) are distinct outliers by comparison.

Pew found that “cross-pressured” opinion – people who oppose gay marriage in principle but support equal rights for homosexuals in practice – is more than a blip. Most respondents in the Pew polls (56%) say same-sex marriage conflicts with their religious beliefs; but half of the people in that group (28% of the public overall) also believe that same-sex couples “should have the same legal rights as heterosexual couples.”

That means more than 1 in 4 Americans are holding two seemingly contradictory ideas: that gay marriage conflicts with their religious beliefs, but same-sex couples should have the same rights as others. That pattern holds true for 29% of Republicans and 29% of evangelical Christians too.

But maybe that view isn’t as contradictory as it seems. In my column, I quoted Timothy Keller, pastor of an evangelical church in Manhattan, saying “You can believe that homosexuality is a sin and still believe that same-sex marriage can be legal.” Keller doesn’t favor gay marriage; he was merely describing what he called an increasingly common view among young Protestant conservatives.

Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Convention’s commission on ethics and religious liberty, outlined the same phenomenon in a recent interview with Politico. “Basically, they just don’t think it’s something we want to talk about,” he said of younger evangelicals. “[They say,] ‘It feels intolerant. We believe what we believe; they have a right to what they want to believe. Marriage should be a church thing, not a legal thing.’”

DeMint argued that marriage between a man and a woman is ""better for children."" Maddow objected, saying that denying same-sex couples the right to marry was ""humiliating and demeaning"" for kids raised by gay parents.

She continued: ""Gay people exist. There's nothing we can do in public policy that makes more of us exist, or less of us exist. And you guys have been arguing for a generation that public policy ought to essentially demean gay people as a way of expressing disapproval of the fact that we exist, but you don't make any less of us exist.

Reed said that Maddow's argument would mean that Obama, who first stated his support for gay marriage last May, was a ""bigot"" until fourteen months ago.

""No one's calling anybody a bigot,"" Maddow shot back. ""You're the only one who's saying 'bigot.'""

That appeared to leave the court with an all-or-nothing choice on the merits: either a ruling that would require same-sex marriage in all 50 states or one that would say that all states may do as they wish. Neither choice seemed attractive to a majority of the justices.

Five members of the court asked questions indicating that they might vote to dismiss the case on the threshold issue that supporters of Proposition 8 lacked standing to appeal a lower court’s decision. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., whose questions on the merits indicated discomfort with requiring states to allow same-sex marriage, seemed particularly interested in the standing issue.

Justice Kennedy seemed more open to the possibility that the proponents of Proposition 8 had standing, but he twice asked lawyers why the court should not dismiss the case outright. When the justices have second thoughts about agreeing to hear a case, they sometimes dismiss it as “improvidently granted.”

Questions from the justices do not always reliably forecast votes, of course, and many of the justices also indicated their views of the central issue presented in the case."

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court is wading into the fight over same-sex marriage at a time when public opinion is shifting rapidly in favor of permitting gay and lesbian couples to wed, but 40 states don't allow it.

The court's first major examination of gay rights in 10 years begins Tuesday with a hearing on California's ban on same-sex marriage. On Wednesday, the justices will consider the federal law that prevents legally married gay couples from receiving a range of benefits afforded straight married Americans.

People have been waiting in line – even through light snow – since Thursday for coveted seats for the argument over California's Proposition 8.

The two California couples challenging the voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage in the nation's largest state are in Washington for the argument and are urging the justices to strike down not just the California provision, but constitutional amendments and statutes in every state that define marriage as the union of a man and a woman.

They envision the 21st century equivalent of the court's 1967 decision in Loving v. Virginia that struck down state bans on interracial marriages.

The Obama administration has weighed in on behalf of the challengers, following President Barack Obama's declaration of support for same-sex marriage last year and his invocation of gay rights at his inauguration in January.

Supporters of Proposition 8 say the court should respect the verdict of California voters who approved the ban in 2008 and let the fast-changing politics of gay marriage evolve on their own, through ballot measures and legislative action, not judicial decrees.

Same-sex marriage is legal in nine states and the District of Columbia. The states are Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont and Washington.

Thirty states ban same-sex marriage in their state constitutions, while ten states bar them under state laws. New Mexico law is silent on the issue.

Polls have shown increasing support in the country for gay marriage. According to a Pew Research Center poll conducted in mid-March, 49 percent of Americans now favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally, with 44 percent opposed.

The California case is being argued 10 years to the day after the court took up a challenge to Texas' anti-sodomy statute. That case ended with a forceful ruling prohibiting states from criminalizing sexual relations between consenting adults.

Justice Anthony Kennedy was the author of the decision in Lawrence v. Texas in 2003, and he is being closely watched for how he might vote on the California ban. He cautioned in the Lawrence case that it had nothing to do with gay marriage, but dissenting Justice Antonin Scalia predicted the decision would lead to the invalidation of state laws against same-sex marriage.

Kennedy's decision is widely cited in the briefs in support of same-sex unions.

The court has several options for its eventual ruling, which is not expected before late June. In addition to upholding the ban and invalidating prohibitions everywhere, the justices could endorse an appeals court ruling that would make same-sex marriage legal in California but apply only to that state. They also could issue a broader ruling that would apply to California and eight other states: Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon and Rhode Island. In those states, gay couples may join in civil unions or become domestic partners and have all the benefits of marriage but cannot be married.

One other possibility is a ruling that says nothing about marriage. California's top elected officials, Gov. Jerry Brown and Attorney General Kamala Harris, are refusing to defend Proposition 8, and there is a question about whether the Proposition 8 supporters have the right, or legal standing, to defend the measure in court. If the justices decide they do not, the case would end without a high court ruling about marriage, although legal experts widely believe same-sex marriages would quickly resume in California.

The California couples, Kris Perry and Sandy Stier of Berkeley and Paul Katami and Jeff Zarrillo of Burbank, filed their federal lawsuit in May 2009 to overturn the same-sex marriage ban that voters approved the previous November. The ballot measure halted same-sex unions in California, which began in June 2008 after a ruling from the California Supreme Court.

Roughly 18,000 couples were wed in the nearly five months that same-sex marriage was legal and those marriages remain valid in California.

The high-profile case has brought together onetime Supreme Court opponents. Republican Theodore Olson and Democrat David Boies are leading the legal team representing the same-sex couples. They argued against each other in the Bush v. Gore case that settled the disputed 2000 presidential election in favor of George W. Bush.

Opposing them is Charles Cooper, Olson's onetime colleague at the Justice Department in the Reagan administration.

The case is Hollingsworth v. Perry, 12-144."

(CNN) —

Patrick Dati had reached his breaking point.

With a metal pin in his arm and Vicodin coursing through his veins, he picked up the phone to call his psychiatrist.

Dati had undergone surgery for a broken arm after his then-boyfriend allegedly threw him down the stairs when he tried to leave their home.

Now he sat on the phone with his doctor, explaining why he couldn’t carry on, as he tried to overdose on painkillers.

The attempt to end his life, which landed him in a psychiatric ward for two days, resulted in part because he felt trapped in the abusive relationship and saw no way out.

“I couldn’t let my boyfriend go because he wasn’t allowing me to,” Dati said.

Dati is one of an estimated 3.4% of adults who self-identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, referred to as LGBT, in the United States. He’s also one of a quarter of gay men in America who report having encountered intimate partner violence.

While Dati reached out to LGBT resources for help while he was ensnared in the abusive relationship, including the Center on Halsted Anti-Violence Project’s 24-Hour crisis hot line in Chicago, many in his position find that help is hard to come by.

Now, thanks to new LGBT-inclusive language in the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, signed into law this month, domestic violence victims like Dati will have access to many of the same abuse and trauma services as victims of heterosexual partner violence.

Ty Cobb, the senior legislative counsel at the Human Rights Campaign, said the new language explicitly includes the LGBT community in the largest Violence Against Women Act grant program, the STOP grant program.

Previously, there was no grant money specifically allocated to providing domestic violence services and outreach for the LGBT population.

“This provides funding to care providers who collaborate with prosecution and law enforcement officials to address domestic violence,” Cobb said.

Originally passed in 1994, the Violence Against Women Act provides support for organizations that serve domestic violence victims. President Obama signed the reauthorization into law in Washington on March 7, saying it was a “day of the advocates, a day of the survivors.”

The act’s new language highlights the reality that LGBT people also experience intimate partner and sexual violence.

After the announcement, the president of the National Domestic Violence Hotline, Katie Ray-Jones, said in statement: “This legislation that extends protections to all victims no matter their race, legal status or sexual orientation sends an important message that no victim should be excluded from receiving critical resources that will help them live a life free of abuse.”

Human rights and domestic violence activists say LGBT people are an underserved population when it comes to victim services and outreach.

According to a study by the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, 45% of LGBT victims were turned away when they sought assistance from a domestic violence shelter. Nearly 55% of those who filed for protection orders were denied them.

Lack of access to services is not exclusive to the LGBT community; heterosexual victims are also turned away from shelters, usually for lack of space or funding as opposed to intolerance. According to the Missouri Council Against Sexual and Domestic Violence Services, the state turned away 19,000 victims in 2011 from shelters because of inadequate space.

Still, not all states have laws ensuring the availability of civil orders of protection to LGBT victims, which may further contribute to victims’ isolation.

“When we don’t include LGBT in the conversation, when we have conversations that assume this is violence that only happens to women as perpetrated by men, we aren’t giving LGBT the language to talk about their own relationships,” said Sharon Stapel, the executive director of the New York City Anti-Violence Project.

“By omission, we’re saying ‘you don’t matter – you’re not a part of this.’”

The Violence Against Women Act language comes at a pivotal time, as incidences of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender violence have come under more scrutiny.

A 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey found that the prevalence of intimate partner violence was higher in some LGBT relationships than in their heterosexual counterparts: 61% of bisexual women and 44% of lesbian women reported intimate partner violence versus 35% of heterosexual women. Meanwhile, 26% of gay men and 37% of bisexual men reported being assaulted or stalked by a partner, compared with 29% of heterosexual men.

The special report of the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey was the first of its kind to present comparisons between groups by sexual orientation.

According to Stapel, the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization breaks down the barriers that LGBT people face when they recognize their relationship is unhealthy and violent – and decide to reach out for support.

“Some of those barriers are very unintentional. They are service providers who are used to dealing with violence against women and have these very gendered ways of talking about the problem,” Stapel said.

For instance, if a woman calls a domestic violence hot line, most hot lines will immediately divert to language specific to boyfriends or husbands. Stapel said there’s no intent to discriminate or be insensitive, it’s just an easy assumption because the majority of callers are females with male abusive partners. (According to the National Domestic Violence Hotline, 97% of its callers are female.)

At the same time, the assumption can be alienating.

“The first question makes them think, ‘Oh, can I say that I’m a lesbian?’ Or if a man calls, he is treated suspiciously because the presumption is that he’s an abusive partner calling around looking for his wife or girlfriend,” Stapel said. “The first response that men may have is ‘Oh no, this might not be a friendly place for me to go.’”

Because of the new LGBT provisions, the law has been decried by anti-same-sex-marriage groups, including the United States Conference for Catholic Bishops.

“All persons must be protected from violence, but codifying the classifications ‘sexual orientation’ and ‘gender identity’ as contained in S. 47 is problematic,” the bishops said. “These two classifications are unnecessary to establish the just protections due to all persons. They undermine the meaning and importance of sexual difference. They are unjustly exploited for purposes of marriage redefinition, and marriage is the only institution that unites a man and a woman with each other and with any children born from their union.”

The Human Rights Campaign sees the reauthorization as a landmark achievement.

“One of the most amazing consequences is that not only did the Democratic-led Senate, but the House led by Republicans passed language that prevents discrimination,” Cobb said.

The House passed the Senate’s version of VAWA after the House GOP’s version of the bill, which did not include protection for LGBT people, was defeated.

For domestic violence survivors like Dati, it’s a welcome starting point in acknowledging and understanding the particular challenges of LGBT intimate partner violence.

“The gay community, my friends, supported me because LGBT domestic violence is very common – at least in Chicago,” Dati said. “The people that saw what I was going through were there when I needed them, but it took me going through the abuse first.”

When a friend won’t walk away from abuse

Dati ultimately filed a restraining order when his ex-boyfriend began stalking him at his mother’s house while he recovered from his suicide attempt and other injuries.

While domestic violence in heterosexual relationships certainly isn’t limited to physical abuse, Stapel said emotional abuse is a particularly powerful tactic in LGBT relationships.

“For example, threatening to out your partner to their boss when you live in a state with no employment nondiscrimination protection for being gay, that’s a really powerful threat, no matter what size you are in proportion to your partner,” Stapel said.

Stapel finds the isolation and rejection many LGBT people feel from their families and friends who may not have accepted their lifestyle can also play a major role in how they view their relationships with their partners.

As a way to control their partner, abusers might say things like: If you leave me, who else is going to love you? Who else is going to be there for you?

“It can really put someone who is already feeling insecure about their connections to people in a space where they feel really dependent on their abusive partner,” said Stapel.

Dati, who turns 50 this month, said his experiences led him to become a public advocate against abuse and sexual violence to show that it does, indeed, get better. He has written a book about being a survivor titled “I Am Me.”

“I don’t want to see another person live the way I did,” Dati said. “I went to hell and back and what I tell people now is, I’ll never live with that kind of abuse again.”

http://news.yahoo.com/nj-governor-sign-ban-gay-conversion-therapy-104716697.html,,[],NJ governor to sign ban on gay conversion therapy,"TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — Gov. Chris Christie plans to sign a bill Monday barring licensed therapists from trying to turn gay teenagers straight, making New Jersey the second state to ban so-called conversion therapy, along with California.

The bill passed both houses of the New Jersey Legislature with bipartisan support in June. Assemblyman Tim Eustace, who sponsored the bill and is openly gay, described the therapy as ""an insidious form of child abuse.""

In a signing note accompanying the bill that will be made public Monday, Christie said he believes people are born gay and that homosexuality is not a sin. That view is inconsistent with his Catholic faith, which teaches that homosexual acts are sins.

The Republican governor also said the health risks of trying to change a child's sexual orientation, as identified by the American Psychological Association, outweigh concerns over the government setting limits on parental choice.

""Government should tread carefully into this area,"" he said in the signing note, which was obtained by The Associated Press, ""and I do so here reluctantly.""

""However, I also believe that on the issues of medical treatment for children we must look to experts in the field to determine the relative risks and rewards,"" Christie said, citing a litany of potential ill effects of trying to change sexual orientation, including depression and suicide. ""I believe that exposing children to these health risks without clear evidence of benefits that outweigh these serious risks is not appropriate.""

Gay rights activists applauded the ban but pushed for more.

""It is our truest hope that the governor will realize, as the majority of the legislature and a super-majority of the pubic have realized, that the best way to ensure lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender youth are protected from the abuse of being ostracized is to provide them with equality,"" Troy Stevenson, executive director of the state's largest gay rights group, Garden State Equality, said in a statement.

Story continues

Christie previously vetoed gay marriage legislation. He has said he supports the state's civil union law, which was enacted to give gay couples the benefits of marriage but not the title. Gay couples have since sued, claiming that the law provides unequal treatment to same-sex couples. Their lawyers say the U.S. Supreme Court ruling granting federal benefits to gay married couples strengthens their case in state court, while Christie administration lawyers say the federal government should recognize the state's civil union law as the equivalent to marriage. A trial court decision is expected next month.

Gay rights groups say the practice of conversion therapy is damaging to young people because it tells them that it's not acceptable to be whoever they are.

Some social conservatives framed the debate as a parental rights issue, saying a ban on the counseling would limit the ability of parents to do what they think is best for their children.

The idea of conversion therapy is an old one that has increasingly drawn criticism for its methods. Last year, four gay men sued a Jersey City group for fraud, saying its program included making them strip naked and attack effigies of their mothers with baseball bats.

Lawmakers heard horror stories from some during hearings on the ban, including Brielle Goldani of Toms River, who testified she underwent electric shocks and was given drugs to induce vomiting after being sent to an Ohio camp at age 14 to become straight.

But, they also heard from Tara King, a Brick-based counselor, who said she should be allowed to ""fix"" what patients, even under-aged clients, want fixed."

A simple pink equal sign on top of a red background - a variation of the Human Rights Campaign’s traditionally blue and yellow logo - has dominated social media. In total, according to Fred Saiz, vice president of communication for the gay-rights organization, the image has been seen by 10 million people on Facebook alone.

The image was first posted at 1 p.m. ET on Monday and since then Saiz said it has ""snowballed"" into a bigger deal than the HRC expected. While one post by the campaign that used the image was shared 43,000 times, a number of people have saved the image as their own at the HRC's urging and have replaced their profile picture with the pink equal sign.

""It has caught us off guard, to be honest with you,"" Saiz said. ""It has taken off like wild fire.""

For an hour Tuesday morning, the Human Rights Campaign website crashed, according to Saiz, because of the traffic they were getting off the image.

As nine justices pondered the future of same-sex marriage in the United States, millions have taken to Facebook and Twitter to litigate the issue. The top ten terms trending on Facebook all related to same-sex marriage, while terms like ""SCOTUS"" and ""Prop8"" were trending nationally on Twitter.

One of the top trending terms on Facebook on Tuesday was ""equality,"" according to data from the social networking website. On the day that the Supreme Court heard arguments over Proposition 8, a law that prohibited same-sex marriage in California, use of the term spiked more than 5,000 percent.

This is high, considering the fact that ""equality"" is a term used every day.

According to Facebook, celebrities like Ricky Martin, Felicity Huffman and George Takei, as well as politicians like Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn and Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, changed their Facebook profile pictures to the red and pink image.

Takei, the famed Star Trek actor and prominent gay rights activist, has a massive Facebook following and changed his Facebook profile image to the red logo.

A post from him this morning asking people to adopt the logo has over 64,000 likes and more than 31,000 shares.

Another post overlaying the internet meme ""Grumpy Cat"" on top of the red logo has quickly gone viral with more than 60,000 likes and 17,000 shares within the first half an hour of posting.

Saiz, from the Human Rights Campaign, called the reaction ""unprecedented.""

""You always hope that these things will capture the imagination of those that see it,"" he said. ""I think what you can't predict and plan for how individuals with a bigger reach than your own are going to make your reach exponential in nature.""

Although an image in favor of same-sex marriage dominated outside the courthouse, justices inside seemed reluctant to extend a sweeping constitutional right for gays and lesbian to wed in all 50 states.

In the first of two days of hearings on cases that have the potential to fundamentally alter how American law treats marriage, Justice Anthony Kennedy - considered the likely deciding vote on the divided court - questioned whether justices should even be hearing the issue.

The overriding legal question in the California case is whether the 14th Amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law prevents states from defining marriage as that state has.

The Family Research Council, an organization ""honoring God's design for marriage and celebrating all who have joined together as man and wife,"" also created their own shareable social graphic featuring a man and a woman holding hands.

Over the past few days, the image has received over 10,000 likes and shares.

Additionally, the March for Marriage, a Tuesday afternoon event aimed at advocating marriage between a man and a woman, has been posting sharable graphics on its Facebook page in the last week. The page itself has received almost 4,000 likes.

However, these campaigns have been overshadowed on Facebook by the efforts same-sex organizations like the Human Rights Campaign have undertaken.

Administrative Law Judge Robert N. Spencer ruled Friday that Jack Phillips, the owner of the Masterpiece Cakeshop in suburban Denver, will face fines if he continues to turn away gay couples who want to buy wedding cakes.

“The undisputed facts show that Respondents (Phillips) discriminated against Complainants because of their sexual orientation by refusing to sell them a wedding cake for their same-sex marriage,” Spencer wrote.

Last year, David Mullins and Charlie Craig visited the Masterpiece Cakeshop to order a cake for their upcoming wedding reception. The couple had planned to marry in Massachusetts and hold a reception in Colorado.

Phillips told the men that he could not bake their cake because of his religious beliefs opposing same-sex marriage. He offered to make them any other baked item, but not a wedding cake. The couple immediately left the shop and later filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Division.

“Being denied service by Masterpiece Cakeshop was offensive and dehumanizing especially in the midst of arranging what should be a joyful family celebration,” Mullins said in a statement. “No one should fear being turned away from a public business because of who they are.”

The American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado hailed the ruling and said it serves as a warning.

“While we all agree that religious freedom is important, no one’s religious beliefs make it acceptable to break the law by discriminating against prospective customers,” ACLU staff attorney Amanda Goad said in a statement. “No one is asking Masterpiece’s owners to change his beliefs, but treating gay people differently because of who they are is discrimination plain and simple.”

Phillips was represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a legal firm specializing in religious liberty cases. Attorney Nicolle Martin condemned the judge’s ruling.

“America was founded on the fundamental freedom of every citizen to live and work according to their beliefs,” Martin said in a prepared statement. “Forcing Americans to promote ideas against their will undermines our constitutionally protected freedom of expression and our right to live free.”

Martin said this was simply a case of a baker who declined to use his personal creative abilities to promote and endorse a same-sex ceremony.

“If the government can take aware our First Amendment freedoms, there is nothing it can’t take away,” she said.

Martin added that Phillips is a devoted Christian who has an unwavering faith. She said he is a person of such deep faith that he won’t even bake Halloween-themed treats – at all.

“He’s just trying to live within a certain set of biblical principals because he believes that he answers to God for everything that he does,” Martin told Fox News.

She said this case is an example of gay rights trumping religious rights.

“It sends a message not just to other business owners, it sends a message to Americans – that if the government can take away our First amendment freedoms and tell you what to say and when to say it, there’s nothing they can’t take away,” Martin told Fox News.

Judge Spencer said Phillips did not demonstrate that his free speech rights had been violated and he said there’s no evidence that forcing him to make a cake for a same-sex ceremony would hurt his business.

“On the contrary, to the extent that the law prohibits Respondents’ (Phillips) from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation, compliance with the law would likely increase their business by not alienating the gay community,” he wrote.

Martin said it was unclear if Phillips will appeal the judge’s ruling."

The court declined to rule on California’s Proposition 8, which defined marriage as between one man and one woman, clearing the way for the unions in that state.

A group of conservative House Republicans blasted the decisions on same-sex marriage issued Wednesday by the Supreme Court as legally inconsistent and detrimental to the future of the nation’s children. One lawmaker pledged to soon file a constitutional amendment to reinstate the Defense of Marriage Act.

“A narrow radical majority of the court has substituted their personal views for the constitutional decisions of the American voters and their elected representatives,” said Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.). “My response will be later this week to file a federal marriage amendment.”

Asked if he would have the leadership’s support, Huelskamp pointed to a statement from House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) expressing disappointment in the decisions. Boehner’s comments were less forceful than those from more conservative House Republicans, though.

Huelskamp and other tea party-backed lawmakers spoke at a monthly meeting with reporters they call “Conversations With Conservatives,” which allows the reporters to quiz some of the most ardent conservatives on issues facing Congress.

In opening remarks, Huelskamp said he was primarily concerned about how the rulings could affect American children. Decades of social-science research have “shown that every child deserves a mom and dad,” he said, adding later, “I think children will be hurt.”

Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), an outspoken tea party member, echoed Huelskamp.

“Marriage was created by the hand of God. No man, not even a Supreme Court, can undo what a holy God has instituted,” Bachmann said. “What the court has done will undermine the best interest of children and the best interests of the United States.”

Ralph Reed, a leading Christian conservative and head of the Faith & Freedom Coalition, denounced the ruling as “an Orwellian act of judicial fiat” and said he will join in the effort for new legislation to replace the Defense of Marriage Act.

“We will now seek the passage of federal legislation to remedy this situation as much as possible given the parameters of the decision,” he said.

While these conservatives spoke out, other Republican opponents of same-sex marriage were notably quieter than gay-marriage supporters after the decisions were handed down Wednesday morning.

Boehner said the debate over marriage will continue and emphasized that the court’s decision is part of the process.

“While I am obviously disappointed in the ruling, it is always critical that we protect our system of checks and balances,” Boehner said. “A robust national debate over marriage will continue in the public square, and it is my hope that states will define marriage as the union between one man and one woman.”

Not all Republicans expressed disappointment in the rulings.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who last week became the third GOP senator to endorse same-sex marriage, hailed the decision as a victory for state’s rights, noting that states will be allowed to decide the issue for themselves.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who opposes same-sex marriage, agreed with Murkowski, telling ABC News that states should decide the issue.

“As a country, we can agree to disagree,” Paul said.

Another potential candidate in the 2016 GOP presidential race, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), said he sympathizes with the states’-rights argument. “For the purposes of federal law, however, Congress had every right to adopt a uniform definition, and I regret that the Supreme Court would interfere with that determination,” Rubio said.

Even as conservatives promised legislation to ban same-sex marriage, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) introduced a bill to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, some parts of which were not challenged in the case decided Wednesday."
http://news.yahoo.com/congress-passes-bill-renewing-anti-violence-law-170141520.html,,[],Congress passes bill renewing anti-violence law,"WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans raised the white flag Thursday on extending domestic violence protections to gays, lesbians and transsexuals after months of resisting an expansion of the Violence Against Women Act.

GOP leaders, who had tried to limit the bill before last November's election, gave the go-ahead for the House to accept a more ambitious Senate version written mainly by Democrats.

Democrats, with a minority of Republicans, were key to the 286-138 House vote that sent to President Barack Obama a renewal of the 1994 law that has set the standard for how to protect women, and some men, from domestic abuse and prosecute abusers.

It was the third time this year that House Speaker John Boehner has allowed Democrats and moderates in his own party to prevail over the GOP's much larger conservative wing. As with a Jan. 1 vote to avoid the fiscal cliff and legislation to extend Superstorm Sandy aid, a majority of House Republicans voted against the final anti-violence bill.

Obama, in a statement, said that ""renewing this bill is an important step towards making sure no one in America is forced to live in fear"" and said he would sign the bill ""as soon as it hits my desk.""

The law has been renewed twice before without controversy, but it lapsed in 2011 as it was caught up in the partisan battles that now divide Congress. Last year, the House refused to go along with a Senate-passed bill that would have made clear that lesbians, gays, immigrants and Native American women should have equal access to Violence Against Women Act programs.

It appeared the scenario would be repeated this year when the House introduced a bill that didn't mention the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community and watered down a Senate provision allowing tribal courts to prosecute non-Indians who attack their Indian partners on tribal lands.

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., who has spent months working on the issue, defended the Republican plan: ""Our goal in strengthening the Violence Against Women Act is simple. We want to help all women who are faced with violent, abusive and dangerous situations. ... We want them to know that those who commit these horrendous crimes will be punished.""

Story continues

But the House proposal encountered quick and strong opposition from women's groups, the White House, Democrats and some Republicans, and on Tuesday, the GOP leadership agreed to give the House a vote on the Senate bill. It passed immediately after the House rejected Cantor's bill, 257-166, with 60 Republicans voting against it.

Vice President Joe Biden, who as a senator was instrumental in moving the 1994 act through Congress, praised Cantor for not standing in the Senate bill's way. ""He kept his word,"" Biden said.

The GOP decision to step aside and let the Senate bill pass came after the party's poor showing among women in last fall's election and Democratic success in framing the debate over the Violence Against Women Act as Republican policy hostile to women. Obama won 55 percent of the women's vote last November. Republican presidential candidates haven't won the women's vote since 1984, when Ronald Reagan held a 12-point lead over Walter Mondale among women.

The anti-violence bill should never have become partisan, said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., a sponsor of the Senate bill. ""That is why I applaud moderate Republican voices in the House who stood up to their leadership to demand a vote on the Senate bill.""

The Senate passed its bill on a 78-22 vote with every Democrat, every woman senator and 23 of 45 Republicans supporting it.

A turning point in the debate came earlier this month, when 19 Republicans, led by Rep. Jon Runyan, R-N.J., wrote a letter to their leadership urging them to accept a bipartisan plan that would reach all victims of domestic violence. The letter, Runyan said, was a catalyst in showing the leadership ""a willingness of people in the House to really compromise"" and see that the Senate ""has a pretty good bill.""

Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., a Native American, also wrote his Republican colleagues saying he was voting against the House alternative because ""it falls short of giving tribes what they need to keep their women safe.""

Indian women suffer incidents of domestic violence at rates more than double national averages, but Indian courts don't have jurisdiction over non-Indians, and federal prosecutors don't take up about half the violence cases on reservations because of lack of resources to pursue crimes on isolated Indian lands. The Senate bill would give Indian courts the ability to prosecute non-Indians for a set of crimes limited to domestic violence and violations of protecting orders. Opponents have said that raises constitutional issues.

""With this authority comes a serious responsibility, and tribal courts will administer justice with the same level of impartiality that any defendant is afforded in state and federal courts,"" said Jefferson Keel, president of the National Congress of American Indians.

The Violence Against Women Act is credited with helping reduce domestic violence incidents by two-thirds over the past two decades. The Senate bill would authorize some $659 million a year over five years to fund current programs that provide grants for transitional housing, legal assistance, law enforcement training and hotlines.

The Senate bill adds stalking to the list of crimes that make immigrants eligible for protection and authorizes programs dealing with sexual assault on college campuses and with efforts to reduce the backlog in rape kit analyses. It reauthorizes the Trafficking Victims Protection Act."

Bush, four former governors and two members of Congress — have signed a legal brief arguing that gay people have a constitutional right to marry, a position that amounts to a direct challenge to Speaker John A. Boehner and reflects the civil war in the party since the November election.

The document will be submitted this week to the Supreme Court in support of a suit seeking to strike down Proposition 8, a California ballot initiative barring same-sex marriage, and all similar bans. The court will hear back-to-back arguments next month in that case and another pivotal gay rights case that challenges the 1996 federal Defense of Marriage Act.

The Proposition 8 case already has a powerful conservative supporter: Theodore B. Olson, the former solicitor general under Mr. Bush and one of the suit’s two lead lawyers. The amicus, or friend-of-the-court, brief is being filed with Mr. Olson’s blessing. It argues, as he does, that same-sex marriage promotes family values by allowing children of gay couples to grow up in two-parent homes, and that it advances conservative values of “limited government and maximizing individual freedom.”

Legal analysts said the brief had the potential to sway conservative justices as much for the prominent names attached to it as for its legal arguments. The list of signers includes a string of Republican officials and influential thinkers — 75 as of Monday evening — who are not ordinarily associated with gay rights advocacy, including some who are speaking out for the first time and others who have changed their previous positions."

USA TODAY

Law forbids licensed therapists from using therapy to change sexual orientation of minors

Christie%27s decision seen as a victory for gay rights groups

Republican has walked line on same-sex marriage

Supporters of same-sex marriage say they have greater hope New Jersey will soon allow it after Republican Gov. Chris Christie signed legislation Monday banning the controversial practice of ""conversion"" therapy for gay youth.

New Jersey is only the second state in the nation, after California, to forbid licensed therapists from using therapy to try to change the sexual orientation of minors. But the state is the only one in the Northeast not to allow gay couples to marry: Christie vetoed same-sex marriage legislation last year.

Christie said that while he is concerned about ""government limiting parental choice on the care and treatment of their own children,'' he sided with expert opinion from the American Psychological Association that so-called conversion therapy can lead to depression, suicidal thoughts and substance abuse in teenagers.

The conversion therapy law ""sets a national precedent on not allowing this abuse to go forward,'' said Troy Stevenson, executive director of Garden State Equality, which supported the ban.

Christie has said that he believes that sexual preference is a trait people are born with and that, although his Catholic faith calls homosexuality a sin, he does not.

""He recognizes what many opponents of marriage equality do not recognize, which is that gay people are not in need of treatment,'' said state Sen. Raymond Lesniak, a Democrat who sponsored the legislation. ""That's certainly an important statement to make and he made that with his signing of the bill.'' Supporting same-sex marriage is ""a natural next step,'' Lesniak said.

Christie is cruising to re-election in November despite New Jersey's Democratic lean. But as a likely 2016 presidential candidate who will have to appeal to party conservatives in early primary contests, Christie has walked a careful line on gay issues.

When he vetoed the same-sex marriage law last year, he said the state should hold a referendum on the issue instead. In June, he criticized the Supreme Court's decision striking down a ban on federal rights for same-sex married couples. At the same time, the governor said he is ""adamant'' that same-sex couples deserve equal legal protection and vows to abide by a same-sex marriage law if the voters approve it. He also appointed the first openly gay judge to the state's Supreme Court.

""We welcome what he did today, we're glad he agrees that people don't choose their sexuality and we think that means that every person and every couple in New Jersey should be treated with full respect and that means freedom to marry,'' said Marc Solomon of Freedom to Marry, a same-sex marriage advocacy group.

Gay marriage advocates are pursuing two strategies. A court case argues that New Jersey's civil unions law does not protect equal treatment for gay couples; a decision is expected next month but may be appealed to the state Supreme Court. Gay rights groups are also intensively lobbying state legislators to overturn Christie's veto of the same-sex marriage bill. An override must occur before mid-January.

""I truly believe, if you look at this bill, if you look at the massive swell of support, there is definitely a road to getting this override accomplished.'' ' Stevenson said. The conversion therapy ban passed with a vetoproof majority. ""It definitely shows what the mindset of the legislature is.''

But Christie has forbidden Republicans who support same sex marriage to overturn his veto, gay rights advocates say. ""The governor's position is that you don't override his vetoes. And we haven't been able to,'' says Senate President Steve Sweeney, a Democrat.

Groups lobbying for same sex marriage hope Republican legislators will be more willing to vote against the governor after November, when Christie, if re-elected, would become a lame duck. ""I wouldn't expect his colleagues to vote against his wishes right before the election. That might be a little too much,'' Lesniak said.

The political climate is quickly changing in favor of gay marriage, Solomon said. ""From my experience with and understanding of New Jersey, understanding of where voters are, where their constituents are, and how far Republicans have moved on this issue, particularly Republicans from the northeast – we're not talking about Alabama here – this should not be impossible at all.''

Rick Perry (R) stood before conservatives gathered at a Faith and Family Rally in Austin on Tuesday and spoke about what he perceives as a sustained attack on their values by gay rights activists.

“This is a very unsettling time in our nation’s history,” Perry said, according to the Associated Press. “These are the days when a person is vilified when they state that they believe fundamentally that marriage is between one man and one woman.”

Perry spoke just hours after the Supreme Court heard arguments on Proposition 8, California's gay marriage ban. On Wednesday, the justices will consider a case challenging the federal Defense of Marriage Act.

Perry went on to suggest that the decision by LGBT rights advocates to fight for equal treatment was proof that they were themselves intolerant.

“The underlying problem is that there is this very vocal, very litigious minority of Americans willing to legally attack anybody who dares utter a phrase or even a name that they don’t agree with,” he said. “In a twisting of logic, they insist on silencing the religious in the cause of tolerance. Now I ask you, where is the tolerance in that?”

The Austin American-Statesman reports that a heckler in the back of the crowd disagreed with Perry's remarks, yelling that the governor was finished politically.

Perry has been a consistent opponent of gay rights throughout his tenure as governor. He's supported a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage and helped usher through a 2005 state ballot amendment that officially defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman. During his 2012 GOP presidential campaign, Perry put his fight against gay rights front and center with a campaign ad that quickly became one of the most disliked videos on YouTube.

On Tuesday, Perry told reporters that Texas was ""fairly clear about where"" it stands on gay marriage.

""The people of the state of Texas, myself included, believe marriage is between one man and one woman,” Perry said, according to the Dallas Morning News."

Officials want to await outcome of Supreme Court cases

Poll late last year shows slim majority don%27t want constitutional ban

Soonest measure could go before voters would be 2014

INDIANAPOLIS — Lawmakers will not take up a proposed constitutional ban on same-sex marriages this year, leaders of the Republican-dominated Indiana General Assembly said Thursday.

The legislature will wait on same-sex marriage amendment until 2014, state Senate President Pro Tem David Long and House Speaker Brian Bosma said.

The two said they wanted to see how the U.S. Supreme Court would rule on the issue this summer on the legality of California's similar constitutional amendment and a federal law that denies benefits to same-sex couples.

Indiana already is one of 37 states, either in state law or a constitutional amendment, that specify marriages must be between a man and a woman. Nine states and the District of Columbia permit same-sex marriage.

In 2011, the Indiana legislature passed a bill to amend the state constitution to ban gay marriages and civil unions but must vote a second time to put the measure on a ballot so voters statewide can decide.

""We could find ourselves in the very inadvisable situation of having a matter on the ballot in 2014 that has been ruled unconstitutional and there is no means of removing it from the ballot,"" said Bosma, an Indianapolis Republican.

Senate Republicans voted overwhelmingly to postpone the issue, said Long, a Republican from Fort Wayne, Ind.

A Ball State University poll of 602 Indiana adults taken in November before the Supreme Court decided to take up both the California case and federal Defense of Marriage Act found that 54% of those polled opposed changing the Indiana constitution to ban same-sex marriage; 38% supported it.

Yet residents were split on legalizing gay marriage with 45% favoring legalization and 45% opposing it. About 55% supported legalizing civil unions that would give same-sex couples the same rights as married heterosexual couples. The survey had an error margin of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.

""The marriage amendment could have easily passed this year,"" said Eric Miller, who has pushed for adoption of the Indiana ban for years as head of the conservative advocacy group Advance America. ""And there will be tremendous pressure, including financial pressure, on the 150 legislators to kill the amendment in a House or Senate committee next year and to stop it on the floor of the House and Senate.""

Advocates say they can defeat the proposal if given the time to educate the public about it.

""We are going to keep working to tell our stories and share our stories with the public so that if it does come to a vote, they will understand what an impact this will have,"" said Annette Gross, Indiana coordinator for Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays.

The language of the proposed amendment also rules out future approval of civil unions and raises questions about whether businesses would be able to offer domestic-partner benefits to same-sex couples: ""A legal status identical or substantially similar to that of marriage for unmarried individuals shall not be valid or recognized.""

The legislature's delay of a vote does not affect how soon the measure could be added to the state constitution.

Two years ago, the General Assembly overwhelmingly approved the proposed amendment but must vote on it again by next year to send it to voters in the 2014 general election. With no general election this year, 2014 is the soonest the measure could come before voters."

""If we are endowed by our Creator with rights, then why shouldn't those be attainable by gays and lesbians?"" Nelson told the Tampa Bay Times. ""Simply put, if The Lord made homosexuals as well as heterosexuals, why should I discriminate against their civil marriage? I shouldn't, and I won't.""

Nelson's support came after numerous Democratic senators backed gay marriage in advance of Supreme Court cases on the Defense of Marriage Act and California's gay marriage ban, Proposition 8. Two Democratic senators, Bob Casey (Pa.) and Tom Carper (Del.), declared their support earlier this week. Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) became the second Republican senator to back gay marriage, following Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio.

Six remaining Democratic senators do not support gay marriage. Sens. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.), Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Mary Landrieu (D-La.) and Tim Johnson (D-S.D.) all do not support gay marriage. All of the states they hail from are substantially more conservative than the perennial swing state of Florida that Nelson represents; all six states went for GOP nominee Mitt Romney in 2012.

Equality Florida launched a Twitter campaign aimed at Nelson on Tuesday, pushing him to back gay marriage. The Florida senator won a third term in 2012."

A majority of the group of 30 or so sign-holders were in their 50s and much older -- and they called themselves Catholics.

Linda Karle-Nelson, 72, and her husband Tom Nelson, 83, organized Thursday's event in response to recent remarks made by Detroit Archbishop Allen H. Vigneron asserting that those who support gay marriage and take Communion are contradicting themselves.

""This sort of behavior would result in publicly renouncing one's integrity and logically bring shame for a double-dealing that is not unlike perjury,"" Vigneron said last month. The archbishop thinks gay marriage supporters should, instead, abstain from receiving the sacrament of the Eucharist.

But Nelson and his wife couldn't reconcile Vigneron's statements with their own understanding of their faith, nor with their experience as parents of gay children.

""The trauma that exists in families today over this issue is virtually unrecognized, except by folks like us,"" Nelson said. ""When we hear rhetoric from the church that demeans our children, we just can't be silent.""

The Archdiocese of Detroit declined to comment on the protest earlier on Thursday.

Nelson and Karle-Nelson are members of the national organization Fortunate Families, a group that represents Catholics with LGBT children and sponsored Thursday's event. They were both widowed and had fully grown children from those previous marriages before they wed six years ago.

Nelson recalled ""pontificating religious doctrine"" in his household when his kids were younger. His view of the church changed when he learned that his gay son attempted suicide while he was in college.

""That was the beginning of my journey and completely changed my attitude,"" Nelson said. ""His struggles, what he was going through -- he was so closeted, he kept it so veiled. I had no clue.""

""The greatest blessing of my life was having a gay son, because of what it's taught me,"" he added.

Nelson's son continued to worship as a practicing Catholic after coming out, until the LGBTQ Catholic group he practiced with was asked to leave the church they attended. He, and four of his five siblings, have since left the church.

Karle-Nelson's son, who is also gay, had a different experience. He left the church shortly after he left home to attend college. But several years ago, he returned to services when he found a Jesuit parish that was welcoming and diverse.

""It shows you that where there is acceptance and a welcoming [environment], people flower,"" Karle-Nelson said.

Mary Ellen Lopata, who is the co-founder and on the board of directors of Fortunate Families, said it's a ""sad situation"" that many children have left the Catholic church over its lack of acceptance of gays and lesbians.

""We encourage people to speak up, because the bishops don't know our children and they need to hear our children, and understand that our children are every bit as whole and holy,"" Lopata said.

Fortunate Families is part of Equally Blessed, a coalition of groups that support full equality in the church and society for LGBT people. The organization does not have local chapters, instead representing constituents from its base in Rochester, N.Y., and supporting actions like the Nelsons' and drawing attention to injustices within the church.

""We're starting to see tiny glimmers of hope that pastors and members of the hierarchy might be willing to talk,"" Lopata said. ""We do believe that if they would just talk to us and talk to children and listen to what they would have to say, their hearts would be changed.""

Nelson and Karle-Nelson attend St. Alexanders Parish in Farmington Hills, a suburb of Detroit. ""I think ... many of the clergy [there] are sympathetic to our cause,"" Nelson said. ""But because of the leadership and the Archdiocese, they have to fly under the radar and be careful how they respond to issues like this.""

""There have been many instances in the history of the church where they have made statements [that they withdrew],"" Nelson said, rattling off a list that included child labor laws, women's suffrage and democracy. ""It took them 400 years to apologize to Galileo,"" he noted.

""But guess what? They changed,"" he said. ""They will change on this too, but it will take a long time."""

Yesterday on The O'Reilly Factor, Bill O got into a discussion with Megyn Kelly about the Prop 8 hearing. In just under two minutes they managed to alienate a large segment of their viewers by not sufficiently hating the gays and our desire to be treated just like everyone else.

Oh, and a pig just flew past my window.

MEGYN KELLY: I mean, I think the country's views on this issue are changing, they're changing dramatically.

O'REILLY: But why are they changing?

KELLY: Well, because I think the same-sex marriage advocates have done a credible job in getting out there and making their case. I mean, for years those who opposed gay marriage -- take the religion piece out of it for this, because there is no arguing that. The Christian religion teaches what it teaches. The Bible says what it says, I mean about marriage.

O'REILLY: But our policy shouldn't be made by that.

KELLY: I know, so take that out of it.

O'REILLY: Right.

KELLY: What I'm saying is that when you ask -- for example, I had an interview with Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council. What is it about calling a marriage -- calling a gay union a marriage that offends you. How does it hurt a traditional, or a heterosexual marriage? And I didn't hear anything articulated that was particularly persuasive. What people go back to --

O'REILLY: And I agree with you 100-percent. A 100-percent! … I agree with you a 100-percent. The compelling argument is on the side of homosexuals. That's where the compelling argument is. 'We're Americans, we just want to be treated like everybody else.'

That’s a compelling argument. And to deny that, you’ve got to have a very strong argument on the other side. And the other side hasn’t been able to do anything but thump the Bible.

KELLY: Their best argument, thus far, has been, 'well, marriage is an institution that for 2,000 has been about a man and a woman creating babies.'

O'REILLY: That's right.

KELLY: Procreation. But look at how society has changed. I mean, people, they talk today about would we be okay passing a law saying people over 55 can't get married because they're not likely to have babies.

O'REILLY: I support civil unions, I always have. Alright. The gay marriage thing, I don’t feel that strongly about it one way or the other. I think the states should do it. Right.

KELLY: I think the Supreme Court is going to come down on the side of letting the democratic process play out in the states.

O'REILLY: New York has it now. I live in New York, New York has it, I'm fine with it. I want all Americans to be happy, I do."

Will: DOMA infringes on states’ rights,"“[U]nder the Constitution, the regulation and control of marital and family relationships are reserved to the States.”

— U.S. Supreme Court,

Sherrer v. Sherrer (1948)

The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) is an exception to the rule that a law’s title is as uninformative about the law’s purpose as the titles of Marx Brothers movies (“Duck Soup,” “Horse Feathers,” “Animal Crackers”) are about those movies’ contents. DOMA’s purpose is precisely what its title says. Which is why many conservatives and liberals should be uneasy Wednesday when the Supreme Court hears arguments about its constitutionality.

Conservatives who supported DOMA should, after 17years’ reflection, want the act overturned because its purpose is constitutionally improper. Liberals who want the act struck down should be discomfited by the reason the court should give when doing this.

DOMA, which in 1996 passed the House 342 to 67 and the Senate 85 to 14, defines marriage for the purpose of federal law as a legal union between one man and one woman. Because approximately 1,100 federal laws pertain to marriage, DOMA’s defenders argue that Congress merely exercised its power to define a term used in many statutes. But before 1996, federal statutes functioned without this definition, which obviously was adopted for the “defense” of marriage against state policies involving a different definition. “Before DOMA,” an amicus brief submitted by a group of federalism scholars notes, “federal law took state law as it found it.”

The question now is whether DOMA is “necessary and proper” for the exercise of a constitutionally enumerated congressional power. There is no such power pertaining to marriage. This subject is a state responsibility, a tradition established and validated by what can be called constitutional silence: The 10th Amendment says, “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”

The amicus brief takes no position on same-sex marriage as social policy. Rather, it addresses a question that should obviate the need to address whether DOMA violates the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws. The threshold question is: Does the federal government have the power that DOMA’s preamble proclaims, the power “to define and protect the institution of marriage”?

DOMA’s obvious purpose is, as the scholars’ brief says, “to reject state governments’ policy judgments.” Its purpose is to endorse, and to some extent enforce, the traditional understanding of marriage. The scholars’ brief says:

“Congress may regulate in this area to the extent necessary to further its enumerated powers. But it may not simply reject the states’ policy judgments as if it had the same authority to make domestic-relations law as they do. That is the difference between a government with a general police power and a government of limited and enumerated powers.”

Ernest A. Young of the Duke Law School, the principal author of the federalism brief, says the operation of DOMA cannot help but burden states because “federal and state law are pervasively intertwined.” To understand the harm that could be done by an unlimited federal power to define the terms of domestic-relations law, Young recalls when a few states, venturing beyond the national consensus, began experimenting with no-fault divorce. Suppose, Young says, Congress passed a statute refusing recognition, for purposes of federal law, of any divorce where neither party made a showing of fault:

“The couple would continue to be treated as married for purposes of federal income tax, health care programs and veterans’ benefits. Imagine the chaos this would wreak in the administration of state programs, and the pressure it would impose on states not to experiment with divorce law.”

As the scholars’ brief says, DOMA “shatters two centuries of federal practice” by creating “a blanket federal marital status that exists independent of states’ family-status determinations.” Federalism, properly respected, enables diversity as an alternative to a congressionally imposed, continent-wide moral uniformity. Allowing Washington to impose such conformity would ratify unprecedented federal supremacy regarding domestic relations, a power without judicially administrable limits. By striking down DOMA — by refusing to defer to Congress’s usurpation of states’ powers — the court would defer to 50 state governments, including the 38 that today prohibit same-sex marriage.

Liberals praise diversity but generally urge courts to permissively construe the Constitution in order to validate federal power to impose continental uniformities. DOMA is such an imposition. Liberals may be rescued from it by jurisprudence true to conservative principles, properly understood.

USA TODAY

Hundreds of same-sex couples have married in Utah in the week since the district court ruling.

The state says it has the right to define marriage and has legislated against same-sex marriage three times

The Supreme Court addressed the issue of same-sex marriage in two cases in June.

Same-sex marriage, twice on the Supreme Court's agenda this year, will get another federal look as Utah asks the justices to halt gay marriages in the state until it can exhaust its legal appeals.

Utah's Attorney General said it would ask the U.S. Supreme Court to block a Dec. 20 ruling from a district court in Utah that found Utah's ban on same-sex marriage conflicts with the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection and due process under the 14th Amendment.

""It is the intent of the Attorney General's Office to file with the Supreme Court as soon as possible,""said a statement from the officeThursday.

Judges in previous same-sex marriage cases have put their decisions on hold until the losing party could appeal, says law professor Steve Sanders of Indiana University's Maurer School of Law.

""It preserves a little bit of respect for the state's interest,"" says Sanders, who thinks it more likely that the Supreme Court will grant the stay without revealing its thinking on the merits of the case.

In the week since the district court ruling, hundreds of gay and lesbian couples have married in the state. A stay from the Supreme Court would halt future marriages, but would not make the same-sex marriages performed this week invalid, Sanders said.

""Those marriages were done in good faith during the time when it was legal. I think you have to say those marriages are valid,"" Sanders says.

The Supreme Court addressed same-sex marriage with two decisions in June. One 5-4 ruling, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, struck down a clause in the Defense of Marriage Act that denied federal benefits to same-sex spouses in states that allow same-sex marriages. In the second decision, the court did not say whether states must allow same-sex marriage.

In this case, Utah would ask the Supreme Court to block the district court ruling while the appeals proceed, halting same-sex marriages in the state until the legal questions are settled.

The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by three gay and lesbian couples who wish to marry but are barred from doing so in Utah. Utah's constitution prohibits same-sex marriage. Utah says it has the right to define marriage.

Utah has legislated against same-sex marriage three times. The state first banned same-sex marriage in 1977. In 2004, the state legislature passed another law defining legal marriage as a union between a man and a woman. Two-thirds of Utah voters supported the law in a Nov. 2, 2004 referendum, which took effect as Amendment 3 on Jan. 1, 2005.

U.S. District Judge Robert Shelby agreed in his ruling that the state has the right to define marriage but questioned whether Utah's definition violated the couples' constitutional rights..

""The State's current laws deny its gay and lesbian citizens their fundamental right to marry and, in so doing, demean the dignity of these same-sex couples for no rational reason,"" Shelby wrote. ""Accordingly, the court finds that these laws are unconstitutional.""

With this ruling, Utah and 17 other states now permit same-sex marriage.

The state can appeal the district court's decision to the 10th Circuit court of appeals, which has indicated it would hear the case quickly. That decision could then be appealed to the Supreme Court.

""That's when the Supreme Court will be faced with a real dilemma,"" Sanders says.

In the June cases, the Supreme Court addressed a federal law that imposed on states that allowed gay marriage. In the Utah case, the Supreme Court would address a state's power to legislate.

""The thing that connects them is the very broad sympathetic language by Justice Kennedy,"" Sanders said. ""The plaintiff's are betting that Justice Kennedy will bend and join the more progressive justices,"""
http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/03/25/traditional-marriage-supreme-court-editorials-debates/2019531/,2013-03-25 00:00:00,[],Court should honor traditional marriage: Opposing view,"Eric Teetsel

This week, the Supreme Court will consider the constitutionality of two laws: Proposition 8, passed by the citizens of California in 2008; and the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), passed by the House (342-67) and Senate (85-14) and signed by President Clinton in 1996. The court has an opportunity to affirm the meaning and purpose of marriage and the American democratic process.

Marriage is the first institution of society. It brings together one man and one woman as husband and wife to be father and mother to their children. Just as it takes one man and one woman to create a child, the unique contributions of mother and father provide the ideal environment to raise a child.

Marriage is the beginning of family, and family is the foundation of society. Redefining marriage would further undermine an institution already weakened by pervasive infidelity and divorce. We need to promote a culture of marriage and family, not further dilute it.

Some say redefining marriage to include same-sex couples would strengthen marriage culture. They say marriage should be for any two people who love each other.

Love is an important part of marriage, but not a basis for public policy. What if more than two people love one another? What happens when the feelings fade? The government has no business regulating romance between adults. It has a vital interest in the institution that creates and nurtures the next generation.

This understanding requires no judgment about the morality of homosexuality. Many non-marital relationships are worthy of rights and responsibilities, including same-sex romantic couples, siblings, and friends who choose to care for one another.

Where the law is inadequate, we should pursue legislative solutions. For example, central to the DOMA case is a tax disparity. Rather than redefine marriage, why not simply eliminate the estate tax?

In a free society, the people's will prevails in the competition of ideas. Forty-one states have affirmed the meaning of marriage. The court should honor the process by allowing it to continue.

As midlife sets in, maintaining a healthy weight often becomes harder. Tricks that worked in the past, like cutting down on wine or sugar, no longer seem to work, either. Even slender Samantha Cameron, now 50, has apparently been affected. In her 30s and early 40s, staying in shape was easy, she said this weekend, “but then I hit 43, I just put on three-quarters of a stone. Suddenly you don’t quite fit any of your things and I got really bloated.” At first she tried doing the 5:2 diet – eating normally five days a week, then having just 500 calories on the other two – but “I just couldn’t do it, I literally couldn’t speak in the evening, I had to go to bed at 7pm.” She has recently found a solution: the 5:2 principles, but with 800 calories on the “fast” days, and says she’s “loving it” and “the bloating’s gone”. Alongside three weekly workouts, she says it’s helping to keep her trim: her goal is “to hit my 50s in almost as good shape as I hit my 40s.” If you’re struggling to maintain your weight and fitness post-50, here’s why – and what to do about it: Muscle mass Every decade after the age of 30, we on average lose three to eight per cent of our muscle mass. At first, this might not be noticeable, but by 50 or 60, will make a considerable difference. This is bad news if you want to lose weight, because muscle burns on average three times more calories than fat per day, even at rest. What to do: Incorporate resistance training into your weekly routine to reduce muscle loss. The NHS recommends two sessions of strength training a week, which could include activities as varied as gardening or lifting weights. Don’t underestimate the good that exercise can do: a 2018 study shows that regular exercisers over the age of 55 kept up their muscle mass considerably more than inactive people. Staying active In England, half of 16 to 24-year-olds are doing the recommended amount of weekly exercise, but only one in 10 people aged 65 to 74 are doing so. If injuries have accrued, and your work and social life is less busy than it once was, you may be leading a more sedentary lifestyle than you realise. The role of exercise in weight loss is much-debated, but it can be crucial in maintaining your weight. A famous 2016 study followed participants in American weight loss competition The Biggest Loser during and after filming, and found that most regained a lot of weight after the cameras stopped rolling due to a higher appetite and slower metabolism. However, a follow-up study in 2017 found that the contestants who kept the most weight off were those who had remained committed to a fitness regimen. This was particularly interesting given that more exercise didn’t equal more weight loss during the show, when those who lost the most focused on diet over working out. What to do: Try to stick to the NHS guidelines on exercise, which recommend 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, or a mixture of both. Make sure you are doing something appropriate for your body, too. As we get older, high-impact workouts like running may place unwanted stress on your joints, so think about lower impact options like swimming or cycling. Hormones Menopause changes where fat is stored on the body. Higher oestrogen levels in the fertile years cause fat to be stored on your legs, hips and behind, but after oestrogen drops, fat can move to your middle, even if you remain exactly the same weight. This can be an issue, as fat around your trunk is more likely to contribute to Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and heart issues than fat on your hips and legs. Men are affected by hormone changes as they age, too: after the age of 40 they lose roughly one per cent of their testosterone a year. This matters for weight, as testosterone is linked to the amount of muscle you have and where you store fat. What to do: For women, several studies suggest that HRT can help to stop the shift of fat from your bottom half to around your middle as you go through menopause. An Italian study followed two groups of equal weight post-menopausal women for a year, putting half of them on HRT, with the rest going hormone-free. At the end of the year, the HRT group stayed almost the same weight, and hadn’t put on any extra fat around their middles or arms. In the untreated group, things were different: they had put on three and a half pounds, and had increased the amount of fat around their waists and arms. HRT isn’t suitable for everyone, so make sure you consider your options and discuss with your doctor first. In men, hormones are linked to a variety of lifestyle factors, including body fat and waist size, which can increase the amount of oestrogen in your body. Keeping active is also vital for men’s hormones: a 2018 study found that regular cyclists aged 55 to 74 kept their testosterone levels up compared with inactive men. Your sleep is also a partial predictor of your testosterone levels: most of the hormone is released while we doze, so if you’re not getting enough hours in bed, your body has less chance of boosting its stores. Getting enough sleep is key for maintaining your weight for other reasons, too: not getting enough is shown to make you gravitate towards sweet foods, and muscle growth occurs largely while we’re resting at night. More stress For many, juggling looking after children and caring for parents with work can mean life post-50 requires navigating a huge amount of stress. Even if you eat exactly as you did before, stress can cause weight gain. In 2015, American researchers found that after eating a large meal, women who reported more stress in the previous day burned 104 fewer calories than women who weren’t stressed. Stressed women also had higher levels of insulin, which is linked to gaining fat. This may not sound significant, but burning 100 fewer calories a day could lead to a loss of 10lbs of fat over a year. What to do: Reducing stress is often one of the hardest lifestyle changes to make, as you may have little control over the issues at work or home. However, you can change how you react, which can reduce your stress levels even without anything changing in your external environment. Exercise is an incredibly effective way of lowering cortisol levels, as well as burning calories, which could lead to a double effect on your weight. There is also robust evidence that simply slowing your breathing can dramatically reduce stress in both the short and long term, as well as giving a range of other benefits like better sleep. “Slow” counts as anything less than 10 breaths a minute, and six breaths is even better. The NHS recommends inhaling for up to a count of five, then exhaling for the same length of time."
http://news.yahoo.com/court-hears-doma-arguments-heightened-atmosphere-161014844.html,,[],Court hears DOMA arguments in tense atmosphere,"The Supreme Court spent a second day hearing arguments about another potential ruling on same-sex marriage, as it considers the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA. Early reports indicate a tense court room and more attention on Justice Anthony Kennedy.

The DOMA case doesn’t involve a basic question about an equal right to marriage, since the couples who challenged that law are already legally married in their states.

The hearings concluded early Wednesday afternoon. Listen to the official audio from today’s oral arguments here (audio will be available Wednesday afternoon).

Early reports from The Wall Street Journal indicated that the court’s conservative justices were critical of the Obama administration’s refusal to defend DOMA in court.

In one exchange, Chief Justice John Roberts said the Obama administration should have the “courage” to defend DOMA, rather than let the Supreme Court decide who has the ability to defend the law.

But Justice Kennedy, a key swing vote on the court, also voiced concerns about the ability of the federal government to define marriages for the states.

SCOTUSblog publisher Tom Goldstein said on his Twitter account that he believed after seeing the arguments that there was an 80 percent chance the court would strike down DOMA.

The question at hand is if Congress has the constitutional power to deny married same-sex couples benefits given to opposite-sex couples under about 1,100 federal programs or services.

DOMA was passed by Congress in 1996 after fears that Hawaii’s Supreme Court was considering the constitutionality of same-sex marriages. The federal benefits denied by DOMA to married same-sex couples include the right to file a joint tax return and to obtain a Social Security death benefit.

The case is United States v. Windsor. Edith Windsor is contesting a requirement that she pay $363,000 in federal estate taxes inherited from her late same-sex married partner, which she wouldn’t have been obligated to pay if she were married to a man.

Story continues

On Tuesday, the court heard arguments about Proposition 8, a law in California barring same-sex marriages that was later overturned by two other courts.

Like Proposition 8, the justices were expected to hear arguments in the DOMA case about whether the case had legal standing and could even be considered by the high court.

The Obama administration decided not to defend DOMA in court in 2011, and instead several Republican congressional leaders pursued the defense.

Under the Constitution’s Article III, the court must have before it a live “case or controversy,” with a party on each side with a direct, not a theoretical, interest in the outcome.

In the DOMA case, Republican leaders have challenged the right of the federal government to appeal, and the federal government has challenged the GOP leaders’ right to make a defense of DOMA.

What’s unknown at this point is if the Supreme Court, when it issues rulings in late June, will take any stance on the same-sex marriage issue, aside from agreeing to hear the DOMA and Proposition 8 cases.

Some observers of the Proposition 8 hearings on Tuesday believed the court could say in June that the Prop 8 case didn’t have standing, and it would be invalidated or returned to a lower court.

But others believe the court could have a logic that is shared between the Prop 8 and DOMA cases.

Still others point back to last year’s instant analysis of the Supreme Court’s hearings on the Affordable Care Act. In March 2012, pundits were forecasting the ACA would be struck down by the justices, based on their line of questioning in the hearings. But in June 2012, most of the ACA stood intact after the court’s ruling. Two of the attorneys in court on Wednesday for the DOMA case also argued the ACA case last year: U.S. Solicitor General Don Verrilli Jr. and former Solicitor General Paul Clement.

""The same rights for each and every citizen of Puerto Rico, that's what we are asking for, and that's what we hope to achieve, the country of justice and peace we want.

One case pits backers of California%27s gay marriage ban against two couples who want to marry

The ruling on the Defense of Marriage Act could be broader

Same-sex marriage foes don%27t think court will extend gay marriage rights nationwide

WASHINGTON — Mitchell Katine came to the Supreme Court 10 years ago for the final chapter of Lawrence v. Texas, the landmark gay rights case in which the justices struck down state sodomy laws.

Not even Katine nor the other lawyers working for John Lawrence and Tyron Garner in their battle against Texas' sodomy law imagined the length and breadth of Justice Anthony Kennedy's majority decision, which struck down all remaining state sodomy laws.

In a blistering dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia warned that the 6-3 ruling ""leaves on pretty shaky grounds state laws limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples."" His warning proved prophetic within months, when Massachusetts' Supreme Judicial Court became the first to legalize same-sex marriage.

As the Supreme Court prepares to issue two historic decisions on gay marriage this month, however, the judges and lawyers who worked on both sides of those earlier cases don't expect anything quite so eloquent or all-encompassing from a cautious and conservative court.

The consensus view: The justices will limit the expansion of gay marriage rights to California, with few if any implications for the rest of the country. Only on the Defense of Marriage Act, most agree, will the court strike a broad blow against discrimination by striking down the ban on federal benefits for married same-sex couples.

""It will really move us forward without going all the way,"" Katine predicts, lamenting that Lawrence and Garner did not live to witness the moment. ""I really wish they had not died and could see the true fruits of their labor.""

Houston attorney Gary Polland was on the other side of the issue in Lawrence. As chairman of the Harris County Republican Party, he backed the anti-sodomy statute and encouraged the state to prosecute the case. And while Katine celebrated Kennedy's sweeping declaration of homosexual rights on June 26, 2003, Polland criticized what he saw as ""legislating courts.""

Still, Polland says he won't be surprised or angry if the high court does what Katine expects in the two same-sex marriage cases this month. The federal government had no business getting involved in family law in 1996 by defining which married couples could receive federal benefits, he says. And unlike 2003, he says, the Supreme Court would be right to limit its ruling on California's gay marriage ban to that state only.

""I think it's going to be an incremental move, whatever it is,"" Polland says. ""This court doesn't want to be in the position of making political decisions for the country.""

SAME-SEX MARRIAGE BAN

The guessing game on the same-sex marriage cases is a complex one, due not only to their nature but the wide array of choices facing the justices.

In Hollingsworth v. Perry, pitting backers of California's gay marriage ban against two couples who want to marry, the ruling conceivably could affect just those two couples — or the entire country. The justices could rule broadly or narrowly on the merits of the case, or they could decide it doesn't belong before them and send it back.

Several potential decisions would have the same effect, however: Gays and lesbians in California could marry, as two lower federal courts said they could. That result, veterans of past gay rights cases say, offers the court a reasonable middle ground.

""Anything that avoids giving momentum to either side in this highly debatable and intensive social debate that's going on throughout the country would be the route, I think, that would guide them,"" says John Greaney, a law professor at Suffolk University School of Law in Boston, who served on the Massachusetts court and voted with the majority in the 2003 Goodridge v. Department of Public Health case that legalized gay marriage. To get five votes on the Supreme Court, he says, ""you have to tailor it as narrowly as possible.""

Opponents of same-sex marriage who have been on the losing side of cases dating back to Romer v. Evans — the 1996 case in which the Supreme Court ruled that Colorado voters could not rescind local laws banning discrimination against gays — take solace in the likelihood that the court won't extend gay-marriage rights nationwide.

They cite several reasons for a go-slow approach: Chief Justice John Roberts' preference for narrow rulings. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's criticism of the 1973 Roe v. Wade abortion decision for going too far and setting off recriminations from abortion opponents. The continuing debate that has led a dozen states to approve gay marriage and three dozen others to ban it.

""I think there's a better chance of the people of California winning it all than there is of the country being placed under a constitutional regime requiring the creation of gay marriage,"" says Teresa Collett, a professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law in Minnesota, who filed an amicus brief in support of Texas' sodomy ban a decade ago.

One particularly popular prediction: The high court will decide that the ban's supporters lack the legal right to appeal the lower court rulings, given they do not represent the state government.

""It would be surprising if the court reaches a decision about Proposition 8's constitutionality, because long-standing case law indicates that Proposition 8's sponsors do not have standing,"" says Suzanne Goldberg, a Columbia University law professor who represented those challenging the Colorado referendum in Romer and the Texas statute in Lawrence.

Walter Dellinger, a former U.S. acting solicitor general who filed a brief against Texas in 2003, notes the justices referred often during oral argument to his Proposition 8 brief, which contends that the ban's supporters have no fiduciary duty to the state of California and could not appeal on the state's behalf.

Paul Smith, the lead attorney representing Lawrence before the Supreme Court a decade ago, says the decision may be several different opinions that add up to a plurality. ""There's going to be at least two opinions,"" he predicts. ""There may be five.""

DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT

If the Proposition 8 decision is destined to be limited, these litigators say, the ruling on the Defense of Marriage Act in United States v. Windsor is more likely to be a broad one denying its constitutionality.

Among the reasons: Even though the Obama administration isn't defending the federal law, which creates another issue of legal standing, it continues to enforce it. As a result, Edie Windsor, the lesbian widow challenging the law in New York, is out $363,000 in estate taxes.

In addition, gay marriage proponents and opponents agree, the court probably won't want to decide both cases on narrow, procedural grounds. ""I think there will be enormous pressure to decide the DOMA case on merits grounds,"" Goldberg says.

But both sides also predict that while striking down DOMA, the justices won't go so far as to grant gays and lesbians the additional legal protection accorded women and African-Americans known as ""heightened scrutiny."" That would set a precedent that could be applied in other cases.

""That might open up a plethora of additional lawsuits,"" says Greaney, the retired Massachusetts judge. ""It would give the gay rights folks tremendous leverage going forward in all areas. The court probably would not want that.""

Judging from Kennedy's questions during oral argument in March, they say, a narrow majority of justices could decide the case on grounds of federalism, or states' rights, rather than on broader grounds of due process or equal protection.

Says Polland, the former GOP county chairman: ""The federal government doesn't have any jurisdiction in the family law field.""

Rob Portman (R-Ohio) publicly reversed his stance on same-sex marriage, conservative pundits and activists have singled out the politician's gay son for his sexual identity.

On March 14, Portman told Ohio reporters that his decision came after his son, Will, a junior at Yale University, came out to him in February of 2011, The Columbus Dispatch reports.

Out of school on spring break, Will supported his father's change of heart via Twitter:

Especially proud of my dad today dispatch.com/content/storie… — Will Portman (@wdportman) March 15, 2013

But while some people were quick to applaud the young man as ""brave,"" others were less congratulatory.

On the same day Portman's change of heart made national headlines, the right wing blog ""Government Is Not God"" warned the politician that homosexuality ""may eventually kill his son from AIDS, other sexually transmitted diseases, or oral cancer.""

""Homosexual sex is ultimately just as destructive as cocaine use,"" the post continued. ""Would Portman suddenly call for the legalization of cocaine if his son had announced that he was a cocaine addict? Would that be “loving” and “compassionate”?""

In a statement posted on the Family Research Council (FRC) website, FRC president Tony Perkins wrote that Will's choices, and the choices of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people in general ""are both harmful to them and society as a whole.""

Meanwhile, Bryan Fischer, the controversial mouthpiece of the anti-gay American Family Association, compared being gay to being a bank robber, adding ""prayers for the senator, his wife, his son and their entire family are called for at this time.""

According to the Columbus Dispatch, the senator told reporters that he had consulted several people about his change in position, including former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has a gay daughter. Cheney reportedly told Portman to ""follow [his] heart"" on the issue.

While much older than Will, Mary Cheney was also criticized by members of her father's party after he spoke about her on the campaign trail.

In 2004, for example, Illinois Republican Senate candidate Alan Keyes called Mary a ""selfish hedonist,"" prompting the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay and lesbian organization, to retort that ""attacking (a) politician's children is beyond the pale.""

President%27s %27evolution%27 on same-sex marriage is now complete

Justice Department says gays%2C lesbians have equal right to wed

Court%27s historic debates scheduled for March 26-27

WASHINGTON — The Obama administration came out forcefully Thursday against California's ban on same-sex marriage and, by extension, implicated similar bans in 37 other states.

In a brief to the Supreme Court, which will hear two landmark same-sex marriage cases in late March, the Justice Department argued that gay and lesbian couples should have the same right to marry as heterosexuals.

""The government seeks to vindicate the defining constitutional ideal of equal treatment under the law,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said. ""Throughout history, we have seen the unjust consequences of decisions and policies rooted in discrimination.""

The brief marks the first time the administration has weighed in on the constitutionality of any state ban on gay marriage. Although it was aimed at the voter initiative passed in California in 2008, it put the administration squarely against other such prohibitions. It urged the court to subject the state's ban to a difficult legal standard that no state prohibition is likely to meet.

In particular, the brief implicated the other states that, like California, allow domestic partnerships or civil unions: Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon and Rhode Island.

""The designation of marriage ... confers a special validation of the relationship between two individuals and conveys a message to society that domestic partnerships or civil unions cannot match,"" the brief states. ""Proposition 8's denial of marriage to same-sex couples, particularly where California at the same time grants same-sex partners all the substantive rights of marriage, violates equal protection.""

Theodore Boutrous, a partner in the law firm Gibson Dunn, which is representing the two same-sex couples who filed the case initially, said the administration's arguments represent ""a clear path to marriage equality across the United States.""

The court filing completes President Obama's self-described evolution on gay marriage and puts his administration squarely on the side of gay rights groups and the nine states where same-sex marriage is legal.

The president opposed California's ban, Proposition 8, during his 2008 campaign but refused to endorse gay marriage. He made that endorsement during last year's campaign but said the issue should be decided by the states.

Then, in evocative language in this year's inaugural address, Obama equated gay rights to past battles on behalf of women and African Americans by mentioning Stonewall, the New York City bar that was the site of 1969's historic gay rights riots.

""Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law,"" Obama said. ""For if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.""

The action was heralded by groups that seek to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide.

""President Obama and the solicitor general have taken another historic step forward, consistent with the great civil rights battles of our nation's history,"" said Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin, co-founder of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which brought the challenge to Proposition 8.

Conservative groups criticized the decision to weigh in against the gay marriage ban, particularly since Obama once said it should be left to the states. Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, said the president was ""putting allegiance to extreme liberal social policies ahead of constitutional principle.""

The high court has reserved two days in late March to consider the California ban on gay marriage and the Defense of Marriage Act, which denies federal benefits to legally married same-sex couples. Both have been declared unconstitutional by lower courts, decisions which are being challenged by gay-marriage opponents.

Proposition 8 was approved by California voters in November 2008 to block a state Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage. Ever since, gay couples have been blocked from marrying in the nation's most populous state. A final ruling overturning the ban would open the floodgates to thousands of new same-sex marriages there.

What effect a court ruling striking down Proposition 8 would have on other states is not clear. The justices could rule narrowly, as a federal appeals court did, holding only that voters cannot take away a right previously enjoyed, however briefly, by Californians. But a more sweeping decision declaring marriage rights for gays and lesbians would endanger all state bans.

The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) was passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton in 1996 as a response to a Hawaii Supreme Court ruling that questioned the denial of a marriage license to a same-sex couple. The federal law has blocked legally married couples from receiving federal benefits in Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia.

The administration is leading the effort to overturn DOMA in the case of Edith Windsor, an 83-year-old New York widow who was forced to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in estate taxes when her lesbian spouse died in 2009. Had she been married to a man, she would have faced no inheritance tax.

The new filing is more significant, however, because the administration did not have to get involved at all. Two same-sex couples are contesting Proposition 8 along with the state of California, while organizations that promoted the 2008 voter initiative are defending it.

In the Windsor case, the Justice Department's brief argues that gays and lesbians have been subjected to a long history of discrimination, and it refers specifically to the California marriage ban as an example.

On the subject of states' rights vs. the Constitution, its brief to the Supreme Court states: ""Deference to the democratic process must give way to the fundamental constitutional command of equal treatment under law.""

Polls have been shifting toward approval of gay marriage. In a December USA TODAY survey, 53% of Americans said same-sex couples deserve the same marriage rights as heterosexual couples, up from 40% in 2009.

California's ban has attracted 37 ""friend of the court"" briefs, mostly from conservative and religious groups. Opponents of the ban have until today to file their briefs, and until Friday in the Defense of Marriage Act case. They were coming in from a variety of groups on the political left and right:"
http://news.yahoo.com/nevada-senator-comes-gay-during-debate-215504602.html,,[],Nevada senator comes out as gay during debate,"CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) — As Nevada legislators emotionally debated a move toward same-sex marriage, one lawmaker rose to his feet and declared, ""I'm gay.""

Nevada state Sen. Kelvin Atkinson says that he quickly picked up hundreds of new friends on Facebook and followers on Twitter.

""I never considered myself not out,"" said Atkinson, a North Las Vegas Democrat. ""I didn't care who knew, I just didn't ever think that I needed to make a public statement about it.""

However, he was moved to speak out late Monday night after listening to passionate, soul-searching testimony from his colleagues as they debated Senate Joint Resolution 13, which would abolish the heterosexual definition of marriage that's been in the Nevada Constitution since 2002, when voters overwhelmingly approved the Protection of Marriage Act.

""I didn't think. I just knew it was time,"" Atkinson said.

Nevada is one of 29 states with a constitutional provision prohibiting same-sex marriage, and SRJ13 seeks to repeal the law and declare that Nevada recognizes all marriages, regardless of gender. It passed the Senate and is now in the Assembly where passage is likely. If approved by legislators this year and in 2015, it would go before voters in 2016.

The debate brought revelations from lawmakers who described personal evolutions on gay marriage and personal conflicts between religious convictions and their love for gay family members and friends.

State Sen. Mark Hutchison, who is Mormon, said supporters of gay marriage should refrain from categorizing those against it as bigots and intolerant. He said he supports same sex unions, but not marriage.

""I simply cannot do that because of my own religious beliefs and convictions,"" he said.

Atkinson, on the floor, scoffed at comments that gay marriage would threaten the sanctity of marriage.

""If this hurts your marriage, then your marriage was in trouble in the first place,"" he said.

Atkinson said his statement confirmed something that he hadn't tried to hide.

""I know who I am,"" he said. ""My family knows who I am. My daughter knows who I am."""

(CNN) —

The Supreme Court will hear arguments this week in two same-sex marriage cases. Whatever the justices do, the outcome seems foreordained. When 80% of Americans under 30 agree about something, that something will happen – it’s only a matter of time.

But while straight young Americans support marriage for gays, increasingly they opt against marriage for themselves. Nearly half of American children, 48%, are now born to unmarried women. Among women without college degrees, and of all races, unwed motherhood has become the norm.

This is the crisis of the American family. Whether same-sex marriage proceeds fast or slow, whether it extends to all 50 states or stops with the current nine plus the District of Columbia, the crisis will be the same.

Marriage and the Supreme Court: Five things to watch

Chuck Kennedy David Frum

Children born to single parents face much longer odds in life than children born to married parents. (A new study by ThirdWay.org suggests that the harms are especially intense for boys, less so for girls.) “Odds” are not rules, of course. There are always exceptions.

On average, however, children born to married mothers and fathers are more likely to finish college, more likely to avoid prison and more likely to form marriages themselves than children born to single parents. And precisely because the harms of single parenthood tend to be self-replicating, the breakdown of marriage threatens to harden into a caste divide, with some families launched into cycles of downward mobility because of the unstable relationships of parents or grandparents or great-grandparents.

For 20 years, Americans have fiercely debated whether gays – who constitute maybe 3% of the population – should be allowed to marry each other. Meanwhile, Americans have given short shrift to what is happening to the 97% of the population that is allowed to marry, but increasingly opts not to do so.

One reason we’ve given the single-parenthood problem short shrift is that we lack good ideas about how to address it. The core of the problem seems to be the decline of male wages relative to female wages. The New York Times this week quoted an MIT economist, Michael Greenstone:

“I think the greatest, most astonishing fact that I am aware of in social science right now is that women have been able to hear the labor market screaming out ‘You need more education’ and have been able to respond to that, and men have not. And it’s very, very scary for economists because people should be responding to price signals. And men are not. It’s a fact in need of an explanation.”

As men (on average) finish less education, as male wages (on average) decline, men become less attractive as marital partners. As Harvard’s Christopher Jencks – a left-leaning academic, it should be stressed – said in that same New York Times piece: “Single-parent families tend to emerge in places where the men already are a mess.”

Sutter: The county where no one’s gay

But how do we make men without a college education less of a mess? This is the master problem of American society, and not only American society. Everywhere in the developed world, the decline of mass-production industries has put pressure on the roles and incomes of working-class and middle-class men. The expansion of government and service industries has opened new opportunities for women, of which working-class and middle-class men seem less able to avail themselves.

It’s important to note that men in full-time work continue to earn more than women in full-time work.

But that bottom-line number conceals a widening divergence between the family patterns of the college-educated top one-third, where family life is increasingly stable, and those of the non-college-educated bottom two-thirds, where family life is increasingly disrupted.

It’s the family life of the bottom two-thirds that is the family policy challenge of the 21st century. The debate over same-sex marriage is yesteryear’s issue. It’s settled, whether the Supreme Court knows it or not. But how to ensure that the next generation of American children enjoys the more equal chance and the wider opportunities from a more universal commitment to marriage – that debate needs to begin.

Chief Petty Officer Sabrina Russell had been accused of having an ""unduly familiar personal relationship"" with Petty Officer 1st Class Jodi Geibel that violated military rules prohibiting higher-ranking enlisted personnel from having romantic or other close relationships with lower-ranking personnel within the same command.

Navy prosecutors argued that the so-called fraternization rules applied equally to homosexual and heterosexual couples, while Russell's lawyer said the charge was discriminatory.

After testimony in a courtroom on the Navy base north of Chicago, the military judge, Cmdr. Charles Stimson, granted a request by Russell's attorney to dismiss the case after ruling that prosecutors had not proved a key element of the alleged offense — that the couple's conduct was ""prejudicial to good order and discipline.""

Prosecutors never argued that the relationship, kept largely secret until base officials learned the two had been joined in a civil union in Lake County court, affected either woman's work.

A jury of fellow sailors was assembled for the court-martial, but the judge's decision meant the defense didn't have to present a case. His ruling ends the matter and the charge cannot be brought again, defense lawyer Eric Montalvo said.

Russell, 31, dressed in a summer uniform with a short-sleeved white shirt, maintained the stoic bearing she kept through most of the trial as the judge read his ruling. In the gallery, dressed in a blue and gray camouflage uniform, Geibel, 32, visibly struggled to hold back tears before wiping them from her eyes. The pair did not hug or show any expression of relief or excitement before leaving the courtroom.

Outside court, Montalvo said Russell was ""relieved"" and ""looking forward to going back to being the good sailor that she was"" before being charged with an offense that could have led to her discharge.

Montalvo noted that while the military's ban on gays serving openly has been repealed, some service members have yet to accept homosexual colleagues. He cited jury selection, which was drawn out by questioning of prospective jurors who voiced personal objections to homosexuality or gay marriage.

""Hopefully, (the ruling) is a little signal to these people that times are changing,"" Montalvo said.

Through Montalvo, Russell and Geibel declined to comment.

The pair first connected on Facebook while Russell was deployed to Afghanistan in 2010, Montalvo said, when the women shared the same rank. But Russell was promoted before she reported to the base near North Chicago in 2012, he said. They started dating and were joined in a civil union in November. They also moved in together west of the base in Hainesville, where they are raising two daughters from Geibel's past relationship.

The case developed after a fellow sailor looked at Russell's phone without her permission in December, saw a photograph of the civil union ceremony, snapped a picture of it with his own phone and showed it to base officials, that sailor testified.

Montalvo argued that the sailor and another male serviceman had pushed the issue of the gay relationship because they were angry at the female couple for reporting unrelated alleged instances of sexual harassment.

Both women were offered the chance to avoid court-martial proceedings by opting for ""nonjudicial punishment,"" Montalvo said. Geibel accepted nonjudicial punishment and was fined $2,000 and stripped of her job specialty as a recruit division commander, Montalvo said. She is appealing the ruling, the defense lawyer said.

Russell chose the court-martial, believing she'd done nothing wrong, her lawyer said.

The court-martial resembled a civilian court hearing with a few unmistakable differences. Almost all Navy personnel wore their white short-sleeved uniforms, and a sailor's authority or occupation could often be determined by the decorations on his or her shoulders. The judge's shoulders, for instance, carried the three golden stripes of a commander.

While a civilian trial can quickly flash from staid to emotional and unruly, the court-martial was rigidly formal. The prosecutor and defendant snapped to attention when the judge or jurors — a group of three enlisted sailors and three officers — entered the courtroom.

Though the military ban on openly gay service members has been gone for two years, jury selection showed that personal opinions about homosexuality vary widely among the rank and file. Indeed, the issue contributed to a delay in the trial when the judge disqualified potential jurors based on their ideas about gay relationships.

The judge eliminated one potential juror who said he was a Lutheran chaplain and would not marry a same-sex couple.

The judge struck another potential juror who said he believed civil unions to be unconstitutional. The prospective juror also said that if his best friend of many years came out to him as gay, he would stop being his friend. After that potential juror left the courtroom, Russell could be seen clenching her jaw and wiping tears from her eyes.

The sailor's statements were ""hurtful,"" Montalvo said.

""You may have personal issues, but acceptance and tolerance are … the way ahead,"" he said.

(CNN) – Conservatives who oppose same-sex marriage must accept that they’ve “lost the issue,” radio host Rush Limbaugh argued Thursday.

“This issue is lost,” the conservative firebrand said. “I don't care what the Supreme Court does, this is now inevitable - and it's inevitable because we lost the language on this. “



Limbaugh went on to assert conservatives “lost the issue when we started allowing the word ‘marriage’ to be bastardized and redefined by simply adding words to it.”

“Marriage is one thing, and it was not established on the basis of discrimination,” he continued. “It wasn't established on the basis of denying people anything. ‘Marriage’ is not a tradition that a bunch of people concocted to be mean to other people with. But we allowed the left to have people believe that it was structured that way. “

The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the legality of same-sex marriage earlier this week.

Another notable conservative, Fox News host Bill O’Reilly, said on Tuesday that same-sex marriage advocates have a more convincing argument than opponents, who do nothing but rehash scripture to make their point.

""The compelling argument is on the side of homosexuals,"" O'Reilly said Tuesday on Fox. ""That's where the compelling argument is. 'We're Americans. We just want to be treated like everybody else.' That's a compelling argument, and to deny that, you have got to have a very strong argument on the other side. The argument on the other side hasn't been able to do anything but thump the Bible.""

O'Reilly has previously stated he takes a libertarian view on the issue, and repeated Tuesday night that it's a decision that should be left up to the states. ""I support civil unions. I always have. The gay marriage thing, I don't feel that strongly about it one way or another."""

Governmental redefinition of marriage is a power grab that attacks civil society.

How can the law teach that fathers are essential if policy redesigns marriage to make them optional%3F

We can treat citizens fairly and fix policy problems without redefining marriage.

There seems to be much confusion in the current debate over marriage. Hopefully it's not being done on purpose to cloud the issue. Let's make one thing very clear: those of us who support marriage as it has been since the dawn of time respect the liberty of others to live their lives as they choose. But governmental redefinition of marriage is a power grab that attacks civil society.

That's right. We cannot hope to limit government if we do not stand up for marriage. Marriage is the foundation of America's cultural stability and economic prosperity. As the Supreme Court considers two cases challenging marriage as the union of a man and a woman, it should resist a ruling that would usurp authority from citizens and their elected officials, which would be the biggest power grab of them all.

Without strong families grounded in marriage, we cannot hold back the ever-expanding power of government. As the marriage culture weakens, Big Government grows. Just look how the welfare state has expanded as the unwed childbearing rate has grown from single digits in the 1960s to more than 40% today.

Marriage policy exists to encourage a man and a woman to commit to each other permanently and exclusively as husband and wife and to be father and mother to any children. Sound marriage policy strengthens civil society and reduces the role of government.

The erosion of marriage costs taxpayers. And it's not just conservatives who say this. Even the left-leaning think tank, Brookings Institution, attributed $229 billion in welfare expenditures between 1970 and 1996 to the breakdown of marriage.

Marriage is our best anti-poverty program. As the Heritage Foundation's welfare expert Robert Rector has pointed out, marriage reduces the probability a child will be poor by 80%, dramatically diminishing the odds of ending up on welfare.

Even President Obama agrees that the facts about family breakdown are well-established. As he said in his 2008 fatherhood speech: ""We know the statistics -- that children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools and twenty times more likely to end up in prison. They are more likely to have behavioral problems, or run away from home, or become teenage parents themselves. And the foundations of our community are weaker because of it.""

Fathers matter, and marriage helps to connect fathers to mothers and children.

But how can the law teach that fathers are essential if policy redesigns marriage to make fathers optional? Redefining marriage would reject the ideal that a child needs a mom and a dad.

Decades of research show that children generally do best when raised by a married mother and father. If marriage policy teaches a lie about what marriage is, and delinks childbearing and rearing from marriage, it would result in liberals advocating for more state intervention to pick up the pieces of a broken marriage culture and cause welfare programs to grow even more.

Redefining marriage does not simply enlarge its scope to include more people, as some suggest. No, it rejects the twin realities at the heart of the institution: marriage is based on the biological fact that reproduction depends on a man and a woman and children need a mother and a father. It replaces it with an entirely new principle: that marriage is whatever emotional bond the government says it is.

We can treat citizens fairly and fix policy problems without redefining marriage. The lawsuit before the Supreme Court on the Defense of Marriage Act, for example, involves a woman in a lesbian relationship who was forced to pay more than $350,000 in federal estate taxes when her partner passed away because she didn't qualify for a marital exemption. This is why we have argued for eliminating the estate tax for more than 15 years.

The death tax is bad tax policy, period -- for all Americans. We can remove this burden without rushing to abolish marriage as the union of a man and a woman. Everyone is free to love whom they want but no one is entitled to redefine a foundational institution of civil society that has existed for centuries.

Whatever anyone thinks about marriage as a policy matter, unelected judges shouldn't try to settle this question for the entire country. The Supreme Court should uphold marriage and restore to the American people the authority to determine marriage policy. It's time to restore constitutional government and that means standing up for our most fundamental, pre-political institution: marriage, the union of one man and one woman.

The justices could decide that the sponsors of the ballot measure outlawing same-sex marriage had no legal right, or standing, to defend it in federal court. That would end the case in Washington, but it is not clear what it would mean for California.

If state officials declared Proposition 8 dead, relying on U.S. District Judge Vaughn R. Walker’s 2010 ruling against the measure, same-sex weddings could commence within weeks or months. Or there could be another legal fight over the reach of Walker’s ruling.

That technicality has prompted fierce arguments among prominent law professors over legal procedure. Their debate has taken place on legal blogs, with scholars staking out sharply different stands.

“It’s become a cottage industry,” said Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer for the challengers.

Depending on what the Supreme Court decides, a ruling on standing could provoke a fight over whether the San Francisco judge’s decision applies statewide or only to the two couples who sued or the counties where they live, Los Angeles and Alameda.

On one side is Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Irvine law school. He says Walker’s ruling affects all of California because it ordered state officials to stop enforcing Proposition 8. Marriage is a matter of state law, not local law, he said.

On the other is UC Davis law professor Vikram Amar, who says Walker’s order would be limited because the suit was filed on behalf of two couples, not all gay couples, and included only two of the state’s 58 counties as defendants.

Amar’s point of view was bolstered by a liberal judge on the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, who in 2011 chided the high-profile anti-Proposition 8 legal team for failing to have sued more defendants.

TIMELINE: Gay marriage across the U.S.

Gay rights lawyers are counting on Gov. Jerry Brown and Atty. Gen. Kamala D. Harris, who support same-sex marriage, to view Walker’s ruling as a statewide mandate and enforce it.

“We have definitely been communicating our views to them,” Boutrous said.

University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt said that even though he doubts Walker had the authority to issue a statewide ruling, Brown could choose to follow it.

“It would be perfectly permissible for the governor to say that this law has been held invalid, and I agree with that decision, and I will not enforce it any further,” Roosevelt said.

Such a step conceivably could lead to same-sex weddings before a court even had time to rule on the breadth of Walker’s ruling. The judiciary would still have the final say, though, and could stop the nuptials once a challenge was filed.

If the Supreme Court ruled that Proposition 8’s sponsors had no right to appeal, then the 9th Circuit’s decision, upholding Walker’s ruling, would be wiped out, leaving only Walker’s order. The high court could resolve any confusion by deciding the reach of Walker’s injunction, or it could let lower courts resolve it.

During the 9th Circuit’s hearing on the case, Judge Stephen Reinhardt grilled the Proposition 8 challengers on why they had not named more defendants to ensure a statewide impact.

“Plaintiffs could have obtained a statewide injunction had they filed an action against a broader set of defendants, a simple matter of pleading,” Reinhardt later wrote in a concurrence in a Proposition 8 order. “Why preeminent counsel and the major law firms of which they are a part failed to do that is a matter on which I will not speculate.”

Boutrous said the legal team considered filing a class action but decided it was unnecessary.

If only two counties could marry same-sex couples or only two gay couples could wed, “it would make no sense,” Boutrous said. “Los Angeles and Alameda would become the mecca for marriage, like Niagara Falls.”

To be sure, the debate may not even arise if the high court decides the dispute in another way. It could rule on the constitutional questions or even dismiss the case by saying the justices should never have taken it up, which would leave the 9th Circuit’s decision in place.

California voters passed Proposition 8 in 2008, six months after the California Supreme Court gave gays the right to wed. The state high court later upheld the initiative as a valid state constitutional amendment.

In anticipation of the state court’s ruling, a newly formed gay rights group hired renowned lawyers Theodore B. Olson and David Boies to sue in federal court in San Francisco. Their suit attacked the measure on federal constitutional grounds and named two same-sex couples as plaintiffs.

Walker held a trial and ruled that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional. The 9th Circuit, in a 2-1 ruling written by Reinhardt, agreed that the law had to be struck down but relied on different legal reasoning. The 9th Circuit has jurisdiction over several Western states but limited its ruling to California. Proposition 8’s sponsors then appealed to the Supreme Court, which is expected to rule late next month.

Procedurally, if the Supreme Court decides Proposition 8 supporters lacked the right to bring an appeal, the case would return to the 9th Circuit., That court could then lift its hold on Walker’s order, lawyers said. Any further challenges would be heard in district court in San Francisco. The Supreme Court decision would take effect in 25 days, the lawyers said.

Walker, who served as the Northern California district’s chief judge, and his successor have both retired. Judge Claudia Wilken, a Clinton appointee, now heads the district court and may inherit the dispute.

ProtectMarriage, the sponsors of Proposition 8, insist that Walker’s ruling affected only the two gay couples who sued. But the group did not appeal the scope of his injunction at the time.

If the Supreme Court determines that ProtectMarriage has no standing, the group would have to find a surrogate, possibly a county clerk opposed to gay marriage, to make its arguments in court. And that clerk would then also have to show standing.

“One would hope our opponents would say it is time to stop this fight and move on to something else,” Boutrous said.

Gay rights lawyers said they would advise couples that they could marry legally if Brown follows Walker’s ruling, even with continued litigation.

“People are just grasping at straws to think there is a problem,” said Jon W. Davidson, legal director of Lambda Legal, a gay rights group.

In his 91-page opinion in Brown v. Buhman, on Dec. 13, U.S. District Judge Clark Waddoups struck down Utah’s law making polygamy a crime. In so doing, he may have opened Pandora’s Box.

As a condition for becoming a state in 1896, Congress required Utah to outlaw polygamy, which is marriage between three or more persons. This case involved a family of fundamentalist offshoots of nineteenth-century Mormonism. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints disavowed polygamy in 1890, and again in 1904, but some splinter groups continue the practice.

Waddoups’ opinion would not only cover such groups, however, but also Muslims or anyone else who claims a right–religious or otherwise–to have multiple-person marriages. He notes that the Supreme Court ruled against polygamy in its 1878 case Reynolds v. U.S., but said he cannot simply rest upon that decision “without seriously addressing the much developed constitutional jurisprudence that now protects individuals from the criminal consequences intended by legislatures to apply to certain personal choices.”

In its 2003 Lawrence v. Texas case, the Supreme Court overruled previous sexuality precedents by declaring unconstitutional laws that made homosexual sodomy a crime, holding that although the Constitution says nothing about sex or marriage, there is nonetheless a right to consensual sexual activity between adults that government cannot regulate. This was over the vigorous dissent of conservative justices, who said that the Constitution commits such questions of marriage and morality to the states and the democratic process, and that therefore federal courts have no power to impose their own moral judgments.

The Lawrence case lays the foundation that has been cited for a decade now in court to make the case for a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. If government cannot forbid homosexual conduct, this argument goes, then neither can it deny those who define themselves by homosexual behavior to officially recognize any such relationship as a marriage. It began a political, religious, and philosophical debate in America between two different definitions of marriage and family.

For over 5,000 years of recorded human history, marriage laws worldwide were about providing a social structure for producing and raising children. These laws simply acknowledged the biological reality that only sex between a man and a woman can produce a baby, and that, correspondingly, that every child born into the world has two parents, one of which is a man, the other a woman.

Marriage laws were designed to secure parental rights for that man and woman over the child they had created, and also imposed strict duties and obligations on each of them for raising that child. As part of that, those laws also bound the man and woman to each other, imposing obligations of sexually exclusivity, mutual care, and support.

Those laws were created for the nurturing of those children, and assign the gender role of demanding the man’s protection and support of the woman during pregnancy and once the children were born. They were designed primarily for the protection of children, and secondarily for the support of women.

A man and woman would form a new family to act as a single unit in society, and care for any children resulting from their monogamous sexual relationship. Thus, marriage has been defined as the union of one man and one woman. More precisely, it is the union of (1) two consenting persons, (2) of opposite biological sex, (3) who are not close blood relatives.

The new conception of marriage, rooted in the proliferation of no-fault divorce laws in the 1970s and the sexual revolution, is that marriage is about personal happiness and fulfillment. People should be free to form whatever relationships they find personally satisfying and to follow whatever their personal sexual inclinations are to engage in whatever form of sexual behavior they find gratifying.

If, therefore, you have a right to officially recognize those homosexual relationships through redefining marriage to include same-sex couples, then there is no reason to say it cannot include more than two people, so long as everyone is a consenting adult.

This lawsuit is the brainchild of Prof. Jonathan Turley at George Washington University. He’s designed a two-step strategy, piggybacking on same-sex marriage: first, decriminalize polygamy, then assert a right to official recognition of polygamy.

As Turley explained in previous court filings, he believes there is a “right to self-determination of private relations and family matters free of government intrusion.” He noted that many oppose polygamy, and goes on to assert that polygamists “are entitled to protection from such majoritarian animus and bias vis-à-vis their private lifestyles and relations. Their status under domestic law is a civil rights issue deserving the same protections afforded to homosexuals and other minority groups.”

The exact legal arguments for same-sex marriage equally apply to multiple-person marriages. Turley acknowledges that marriage laws that do not include both are “a tool for the imposition of a uniform moral agenda or tenets on citizens.”

Turley then goes on to make clear he is not only arguing for the form of polygamy technically called polygyny, which is one man with multiple women. In other words, he also argues for a right to polyandry (one woman with multiple men) and polyamory (multiple men with multiple women).

Waddoups concluded that Reynolds has been overtaken by Lawrence and other recent legal developments. While keeping in place for now the Utah law against issuing multiple marriage certificates for polygamous marriage (the second step of the Turley strategy), he invalidated the criminal law against multiple adults cohabiting together as a family, which is the core of the laws against polygamy.

This case will likely now go to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver.

(CNN) —

Today is the 46th anniversary of Loving v. Virginia, the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that declared unconstitutional any ban on interracial marriage. More than four decades after the historic and aptly named Loving decision, the U.S. Supreme Court is once again poised to rule in a case that could put an end to discriminatory bans prohibiting marriage, this time for gay and lesbian couples.

This month, the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule in a decision in Hollingsworth v. Perry, a case brought by two California couples challenging the constitutionality of the state’s ban on same sex marriages, commonly called Prop 8. Attorneys Ted Olson and David Boies – a Republican and Democrat best known for battling each other before the Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore – have teamed up and taken the Perry case beyond California.

JUSTIN LAROSE/cnn Donna Brazile

Olson and Boies argued before the justices that the Supreme Court has the obligation under the Constitution to strike down not just Prop 8, but all state laws banning marriage equality for gay and lesbian Americans. After all, they say, this is precisely how the court ruled in Loving – and 13 other cases dating back to 1888 in which a majority of the justices stood up to protect the fundamental right of every American to marry the person he or she loves.

A broad ruling in the Perry case this month would be a historic step forward in affirming that gay Americans are entitled to the same rights and freedoms as everyone else. Although I firmly believe public opinion is irrelevant to the court’s responsibility to ensure equality under the law, our nation is clearly ready to embrace marriage equality.

When the Supreme Court struck down interracial marriage bans in 1967, a Gallup poll found that only 20% of Americans approved of such marriages. But the court fulfilled its duty to protect individual rights without regard to what was popular.

Today, we have already have evolved much further on marriage equality. A growing bipartisan majority of voters – 58% – support marriage rights for same-sex couples.

When Richard Loving told his lawyer to “tell the court I love my wife,” he could not have known that his words would still be applicable 46 years later in the very same courtroom. There is never a wrong time to stand up for justice and equality, but the time has never been more right to stand up for gay rights than in the Perry case.

As the Supreme Court weighs equality for gay and lesbian couples, the anniversary of Loving provides a timely reminder of a new legacy they could write for the history books.

Daniel recently made this impassioned public video plea to U.S. Supreme Court Justice John G. Roberts, who is himself the father of adopted children.

The 12-year-old explains that while his medical problems made it difficult for prospective parents to embrace him, his two gay fathers happily welcomed him and his infant sister into their home—effectively changing the course of their lives for the better

Transplanted out of long-term foster care and into a permanent home, Daniel has been able to thrive thanks to the love and support of his two fathers. And even at his young age, he's sensitive to the fact that his nontraditional family is worthy of the same legal protections as others. “I know you have a tough decision to make with the gay marriage issue, but my family is just as valuable and worthwhile as any other.”

USA TODAY

President Obama plans to meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights activists while he's in Russia this week for the G-20 summit.

Igor Kochetkov of LGBT Network told the Associated Press that his group is accepting an invitation to meet with Obama in St. Petersburg on Thursday. The St. Petersburg-based advocacy group Coming Out said it was invited but hasn't decided whether to go.

The White House did not have immediate comment on the meeting, which was first reported by BuzzFeed, other than to say Obama plans on meeting with civil society leaders while in St. Petersburg.

Russia has faced international criticism since it passed a law in June banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors. The Russians have also faced international scorn for another law that bans adoptions by countries allowing same-sex marriages.

Human rights groups have reported there's been an uptick of violence against the country's LGBT community since the laws passed. The legislation has led to calls for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.

Last month, Obama said he didn't support boycotting the Sochi games, because he didn't want to penalize American athletes. But Obama has been sharply critical of the Russian laws.

""Nobody is more offended than me by some of the anti-gay and lesbian legislation that you've been seeing in Russia,"" Obama said last month.

The meeting will almost certainly add tension to the already tense relationship between Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Obama canceled a scheduled meeting with Putin in Moscow before the G-20 summit. The cancellation followed a string of disputes, including Russia's decision to grant asylum to former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden and its blocking of action by the United Nations Security Council against Syria."

As thousands of demonstrators on both sides of America's long-standing gay rights divide rallied outside, the court heard a spirited, 80-minute oral argument on whether to let stand a California ban on same-sex marriage.

Despite the case being one of the most eagerly anticipated legal showdowns of the year, some of the nine justices showed an unwillingness to dive headfirst into the delicate and divisive issue.

Though polls show growing support among Americans for gay marriage, only nine states recognize it, while 30 states have constitutional amendments prohibiting it.

Justice Anthony Kennedy, a potential swing vote, gave a clear indication of where he stood when he warned of the court entering ""uncharted waters.""

It was the first of two days of arguments. On Wednesday, the court will consider the related question of whether the 1996 federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which denies federal benefits to married same-sex couples, should be struck down.

Rulings in both cases are not expected until June.

In making his antipathy to a broad ruling clear, Kennedy even raised the prospect of the court dismissing the case altogether, a relatively unusual move that would leave intact a federal appeals court ruling that had earlier struck down the California law, known as Proposition 8.

If dismissal were the outcome of the Supreme Court's consideration of Proposition 8, gay marriages in California could proceed, but the case would have no impact on other states, as gay rights activists had hoped. It would also mean that the high court could stay silent on the issue, at least in the short term.

Kennedy was not the only one with reservations. Justice Samuel Alito also urged caution, noting that gay marriage, as a concept, is ""newer than cellphones and the Internet.""

None of the justices indicated support for the Obama administration's compromise solution, which would strike down Proposition 8 and require the eight other states that already recognize civil unions or domestic partnerships to allow gays and lesbians to marry.

COMPETING RALLIES

Outside the court, demonstrators did not share the justices' reluctance to take a clear stand, with hundreds gathered representing both sides. Anti-gay marriage protesters marched past the imposing Supreme Court building accompanied by police on motorcycles, drawing jeers and shouts from a pro-gay marriage rally, but there were no physical confrontations.

""No hate - we just disagree!"" yelled one marcher, holding a sign that proclaimed children do best with a mother and father.

Jay Golon, a New York City educator who was at the pro-gay marriage rally, said he has many students with same-sex parents.

""It's a family,"" he said. ""That's all.""

Inside the hushed courtroom, filled to capacity with lawyers and spectators, some of whom had waited for days to get a seat, it quickly became apparent that the justices were more interested in legal technicalities than flowery rhetoric.

One key issue is whether California opponents of gay marriage even had a right to be heard in federal court.

If the court were to find the proponents did not have standing, then it would not reach the merits of that case. That would mean that an earlier federal district court ruling that struck down Proposition 8 would be left intact. Further litigation would ensue over whether the district court rule would apply statewide.

U.S. citizens, in general, do not have a right to sue to enforce laws they favor. Chief Justice John Roberts pressed lawyer Charles Cooper, who represents gay marriage opponents, on why his clients are any different as they seek to enforce Proposition 8.

""I don't think we've ever allowed anything like that,"" Roberts said.

DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE

On the broader question of same-sex marriage, pressed by attorney Theodore Olson on behalf of two California same-sex couples, some conservative justices seemed eager to raise objections to the court making a definitive statement, citing a lack of scientific data on same-sex couples raising children.

Justice Antonin Scalia said there is ""considerable disagreement"" about whether gays and lesbians should be able to raise children.

Kennedy agreed that there is ""substance to the point that sociological information is new.""

On the liberal wing, justices probed Cooper on his assertion that the government's interest in promoting procreation is a primary reason for limiting the definition of marriage.

Both Justice Elena Kagan and Justice Stephen Breyer questioned Cooper on how his definition of marriage squares with the fact that infertile opposite-sex couples can marry.

""There are lots of people who get married who can't have children,"" Breyer said.

The court will reconvene on Wednesday morning to weigh the DOMA statute.

Unlike Proposition 8, that case does not give the court the opportunity to issue a broad ruling for or against gay marriage because the case relates only to a federal law that limits the definition of marriage to opposite-sex couples for the purposes of federal benefits.

Especially proud of my dad today dispatch.com/content/storie… — Will Portman (@wdportman) March 15, 2013

But while some people were quick to applaud the young man as ""brave,"" others were less congratulatory.

On the same day Portman's change of heart made national headlines, the right wing blog ""Government Is Not God"" warned the politician that homosexuality ""may eventually kill his son from AIDS, other sexually transmitted diseases, or oral cancer.""

""Homosexual sex is ultimately just as destructive as cocaine use,"" the post continued. ""Would Portman suddenly call for the legalization of cocaine if his son had announced that he was a cocaine addict? Would that be “loving” and “compassionate”?""

In a statement posted on the Family Research Council (FRC) website, FRC president Tony Perkins wrote that Will's choices, and the choices of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people in general ""are both harmful to them and society as a whole.""

Meanwhile, Bryan Fischer, the controversial mouthpiece of the anti-gay American Family Association, compared being gay to being a bank robber, adding ""prayers for the senator, his wife, his son and their entire family are called for at this time.""

According to the Columbus Dispatch, the senator told reporters that he had consulted several people about his change in position, including former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has a gay daughter. Cheney reportedly told Portman to ""follow [his] heart"" on the issue.

While much older than Will, Mary Cheney was also criticized by members of her father's party after he spoke about her on the campaign trail.

In 2004, for example, Illinois Republican Senate candidate Alan Keyes called Mary a ""selfish hedonist,"" prompting the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay and lesbian organization, to retort that ""attacking (a) politician's children is beyond the pale.""

(CNN) —

Justice Anthony Kennedy was among the first of his colleagues to arrive Wednesday at the U.S. Supreme Court. His chambers lit up several hours before the last-day release of monumental rulings on same-sex marriage.

There was little doubt that later that morning, this quietly powerful justice would be having a major say in the legal, political, and social path of gay rights moving forward.

And at precisely 10 a.m., Kennedy kicked off the public session with his eloquent majority ruling striking down a key part of a federal law that blocks a range of benefits for legally married gay and lesbian couples.

The Defense of Marriage Act “humiliates tens of thousands of children now being raised by same-sex couples,” he said. “The law in question makes it even more difficult for the children to understand the integrity and closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in their community and in their daily lives.”

What’s next for gay rights movement?

It was vintage Kennedy – a mix of sweeping rhetoric mixed with practical legal and social considerations.

“If Bill Clinton was ‘the first black president,’ Anthony Kennedy has now firmly secured his place in history as ‘the first gay justice,’” said Michael Dorf, a law professor at Cornell University and a former Kennedy law clerk. “Justice Kennedy makes clear that he not only accepts, but welcomes the task of writing majestic opinions affirming the dignity of gay persons and couples.”

By the Numbers: Same-sex marriage

Kennedy, a moderate-conservative, is in many ways the “power broker” on the court. He shared the role of a “swing vote” with fellow centrist Sandra Day O’Connor before she retired seven years ago.

“The basic principle is, it’s Justice Kennedy’s world and you just live in it,” said Thomas Goldstein, a private attorney who publishes the well-read SCOTUSblog.com. “Justice O’Connor, having been the most powerful woman in the world, handed the keys to him on her way out the door and said, ‘Have fun.’ And he took up that invitation.”

The thinking goes that with four solid conservatives aligned on the right and four liberals on the left, Kennedy is the man in the middle, often able to cast the deciding vote in contentious cases, assuring his views of the law prevail.

Kennedy has crafted a powerful, if hard to define, judicial legacy – seemingly in the forefront of every major ruling during his tenure. As an unapologetic “swing” vote, he was the key behind-the-scenes architect of the 2000 Bush v. Gore drama, and a 1992 opinion upholding abortion rights. He has written majority decisions upholding rights to homosexual couples, underage killers, and foreign fighters held by the U.S. military in the war on terror.

That was true this past term in several other hot-button cases in which he played a key role by:

• Writing the majority opinion allowing for the continued but limited use of race in the college admissions process, yet making it harder for institutions to use such policies to achieve diversity.

• Siding with his fellow conservatives to strike down a key section of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, weakening federal oversight of states and counties with a past history of discrimination of minority voters at the polls.

• Concluding criminal suspects can be subjected to a police DNA test after arrest but before trial and conviction.

• Blocking a lawsuit by privacy advocates challenging the federal government’s sweeping electronic eavesdropping on suspected foreign terrorists and spies.

Kennedy was in the majority 91% of the time in the court’s 78 argued cases this term, more than any justice. In divided cases – where there was no unanimity – he was on the winning side 83%, again tops on the court.

Sometimes he sides with his more liberal colleagues, as he did in the Defense of Marriage Act case, but he is mostly a reliable conservative vote, especially on business and regulation disputes.

That unpredictability has long made liberals and conservatives equally nervous, but many on the right are more outspoken in their disappointment in the Ronald Reagan nominee, who turns 77 in July.

“Kennedy’s style as the ‘man in the middle’ is often as a ‘justice in a muddle,’” said Douglas Kmiec, a law professor at Pepperdine University and a former lawyer in the Reagan and Bush administrations. “He writes cryptically … suggesting a standard of his own making that is not fully developed.”

Despite the rhetoric, Kennedy’s moderating force has generally benefited his conservative colleagues.

Of the 23 divided 5-4 cases this term – including the two marriage cases as well as voting rights – Kennedy was in the majority 20 times, according to SCOTUSblog.com, again higher than anyone on the nine-member bench. Only on six decisions did he side with the four left-leaning justices: Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan.

But it was his majority opinion in the DOMA case that could have ripple effects for years to come.

“Although Justice Kennedy’s opinion explicitly states that it is confined to same-sex marriages that have been recognized by states, it contains reasoning and language that will certainly be used, in later cases, to argue that legal recognition of same-sex marriage by all states is constitutionally required,” said University of Notre Dame law professor Richard W. Garnett, a past clerk to former Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. “Almost certainly, and fairly soon, that argument will be presented squarely to the court.”

What about us, ask other gay couples

Within the marbled halls of the high court, Kennedy is personally respected by his colleagues, both for the power he wields and for his courtly, low-key manner.

But professionally, justices on the losing side of a big case can often be unsparing in their criticism of Kennedy and his legal reasoning.

Justice Antonin Scalia on Wednesday called Kennedy’s analysis in the DOMA case “jaw dropping” and an assertion of “judicial supremacy” that “envisions the Supreme Court standing (or rather enthroned) at the apex of government.”

And this from a close friend – Scalia and Kennedy joined the court a year apart, were born the same year, and live on the same street.

The Sacramento, California, native joined the high court in 1988, the third choice of President Reagan after more conservative nominees Robert Bork and Douglas Ginsburg flamed out.

And along with O’Connor for almost two decades, the two native Westerners carved out a jumpy place in the center. Less driven by practical concerns than O’Connor was, Kennedy has striven for a loftier sense of the law’s impact on society.

“He has brought to the bench a combination of a very scholarly, erudite, academic bent,” said Brad Berenson, a friend and former law clerk to Kennedy, “and a very practical bent he had developed while practicing law on his own.”

Kennedy himself acknowledged the unique role he played for decades on the court. “There is a loneliness” to his job, he once told CNN.

For now, Kennedy, like his eight colleagues, will retreat from the public spotlight. He has some vacation time ahead, mixed with his annual overseas teaching gig in Austria in two weeks.

Then, come the first Monday October, Kennedy is expected back in his familiar seat, just to the left of Chief Justice John Roberts on the bench. But clearly he is the man in the middle, and the man that in many ways shapes the direction of a divided court."

http://news.yahoo.com/gay-advocates-lambaste-progressive-pastor-124209997.html,,[],Gay Advocates Lambaste Progressive Pastor Jim Wallis: ‘Endorsing Hatred and…Standing With Bigots’,"Jim Wallis is well-known as a left-of-center evangelical leader. His recent support for gay marriage, an about-face reflective of President Barack Obama's own purported ""evolution"" on the issue, captivated headlines in April. But despite supporting same-sex nuptials, it seems Wallis is frustrating and infuriating gay rights advocates over comments he made on Wednesday about marriage equality and immigration.

While he supports matrimonial rights for all Americans, regardless of sexuality, Wallis said that this is not the time to tackle the issue and that the focus that evangelicals should have, at least for the moment, should be on the immigration debate. With the Senate Judiciary Committee beginning the amendment process this week on a contentious bill intended to bring both parties together on the issue, it's certainly a sensitive time on the immigration front.

""I support equal protection under the law but I think this is the wrong place in the wrong time to try and resolve this contentious issue,"" Wallis said during a press call for the Evangelical Immigration Table (EIT). ""This must be a bipartisan bill. Our focus must be on the 11 million undocumented and vulnerable people who this is their time, their chance, this is their moment.""

The EIT, as TheBlaze has reported, is a collective of pastors and preachers who are intent on seeing immigration reform enacted. Far from a left-of-center cohort, faith leaders with varying political opinions have come together under the EIT umbrella in an effort to help solve America's immigration conundrum. Recently, we interviewed the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, a conservative and the president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference (NHCLC), about his views on the matter.

The Christian Post provides more context about the issues that led Wallis to grant his controversial answer about same-sex marriage and immigration. It seems there's an amendment being touted for possible inclusion in the immigration bill that could spark a fair bit of controversy:

Story continues

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) ... has sponsored a contentious amendment that would allow U.S. citizens in long-term same-sex relationships to sponsor foreign partners for green cards. According to one report, although the authors of the bill have vowed to block ""poison pill"" amendments from derailing the legislation, Leahy's amendment is already ringing like a fire alarm. In his comments on Wednesday, however, Wallis, who was responding to a question from a reporter on whether or not the EIT would support an immigration reform bill with a gay rights amendment, could not stress enough that the marriage between the two issues was inappropriate for the time.

Wallis noted that regardless of views on gay marriage, ensuring bi-partisan support for immigration reform is, in his view, essential. Since adding an additional social debate into the mix is unpalatable and dangerous to immigration reform's passage, he's pushing for avoidance on that front, calling it the ""wrong place and wrong time for other contentious issues to come up that will be and can be resolved in other venues.""

However, as the Post notes, gay rights bloggers quickly decried Wallis stance. America Blog wrote the following:

Wallis, incredibly, organized a media conference call with renowned gay-hater and right-wing knuckle-dragger Richard Land of the Baptists (who famously claimed that women who get an abortion are psychologically impaired) in order to kill any effort to address the problems gay couples face with immigration. [...] For the record, it's not about ""gay marriage,"" Mr. Wallis. It's about gay couples being ripped apart by the US immigration system because their relationships aren't recognized as legitimate. If they were straight, their spouses could stay. But because they're gay, they can't. So spare us the Rush-Limbaugh Gary-Bauer Rick-Santorum talking points about how we're pushing for ""gay marriage"" in the immigration bill. We're fighting for the immigration rights of our loved ones.

Another blogger, John Becker, took an even more pointed tone, claiming that the progressive faith leader is throwing gays ""under the bus."" In the conclusion to his article about Wallis' views on immigration and gay marriage, Becker wrote, ""Shame on Jim Wallis -- for letting himself be duped, for tacitly endorsing hatred, and for standing with bigots instead of with the marginalized, the way a true Christian progressive would do.""

So, despite supporting gay marriage so publicly last month, it seems Wallis is going to be getting some heat for not endorsing one of the most controversial amendments in the immigration bill -- a provision that, if adopted, could derail potential bi-partisan support for the measure.

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']",Supreme Court is urged to allow gay marriage nationwide,"WASHINGTON — The lawyers challenging California’s Proposition 8 urged the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday to rule that gays and lesbians across the nation deserve an equal right to marry, ratcheting up the pressure on the Obama administration and the justices.

Rather than seek a narrow win based on the special situation in California, the legal brief argues that marriage should be available as a constitutional right to all loving and committed couples.

“We believe this is a matter of fundamental rights,” said Washington attorney Ted Olson shortly after filing his legal brief with the high court.

Next week, the Obama administration must decide whether to take part in the California case by filing a “friend of the court” brief.

“The solicitor general is still looking into this,” President Obama said Wednesday in an interview with a San Francisco TV station. “I can tell you, though, obviously my personal view, which is that same-sex couples should have the same rights and be treated like everybody else.”

Olson and co-counsel David Boies said they decided to “paint the broad picture” for the Supreme Court on how marriage for gays fits with the nation’s historic commitment to liberty and equality.

“Because of their sexual orientation — a characteristic with which they are born and which they cannot change — plaintiffs and hundreds of thousands of gay men and lesbians in California and across the nation are being excluded from one of life’s most precious relationships. They may not marry the person they love, the person with whom they wish to partner in building a family and with whom they wish to share their future,” they wrote.

Forbidding them to marry “denies gay men and lesbians their identity and their dignity; it labels their families as second-rate. That outcome cannot be squared with the principle of equality and the unalienable right to liberty and the pursuit of happiness that is the bedrock promise of America from the Declaration of Independence to the 14th Amendment and the dream of all Americans.”

Last year, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down Proposition 8 as unconstitutional, but did so for a reason unique to California: In 2008, voters adopted a state constitutional measure limiting marriage to a man and a woman in order to overturn a state Supreme Court ruling permitting gay marriage. The appeals court said it was unconstitutional for a state or its voters to take away such a fundamental right.

If the U.S. Supreme Court were to follow this approach, it would void Proposition 8 and permit gay marriage in California, but its ruling would not affect other states.

Nine states permit marriage for same-sex couples.

Olson and Boies also argue that the ban on same-sex marriages hurts children. “There are nearly 40,000 children living in California households of gays and lesbians. This is about their rights, their equality and their families,” Olson said.

If the high court wants to avoid a broad ruling, Olson offered one exit ramp. He said the proponents of Proposition 8 are not the state of California and have no standing to appeal. If the justices agree, they could let stand the judge’s original ruling in favor of the gay couples who sued.

The lawyers defending Proposition 8 argued that because there is a great national debate over gay marriage, the justices should step aside and allow voters and lawmakers to resolve the issue state by state.

Besides the California case, the Supreme Court will hear a challenge next month to the Defense of Marriage Act, the federal law that forbids federal agencies from recognizing same-sex marriages. The Obama administration is due to file its brief Friday arguing that the law’s ban on benefits for legally married gay couples violates the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection of the laws.

Olson said he would welcome support from the administration in the California case as well. “We would very much like the United States to file a brief as a friend of the court,” said Olson, who served as U.S. solicitor general under President George W. Bush.

The deadline for filing an amicus brief in the case is Feb. 28.

The move comes just days before the U.S. Supreme Court takes up the issue of same-sex marriage and follows a poll showing more than half of Americans support such marriages.

Tuesday evening, Bisbee City Council members voted to allow the next best thing to gay marriage. In a first reading of an ordinance, adding a chapter to its city charter, they cleared the way for civil unions. The vote by the seven-member council was unanimous, making it likely to pass on a final vote scheduled in two weeks.

“I think it’s time,” Mayor Adriana Zavala Badal said of the proposal. “We’ve been working on this as a country for a long time.”

The ordinance, which allows for a form of union regardless of the sexual orientation of the couple, would be effective only within Bisbee and affect certain benefits and policies within the city. Bisbee, situated along the U.S.-Mexico border, has about 5,600 residents.

Bisbee’s proposal borrowed language from a civil union bill proposed in the state Legislature, a measure unlikely to pass the two Republican-controlled chambers. Arizona has a law dating back to 1996 that defines marriage between one male and one female. Five years ago, Arizona voters approved adding the language of that law to the state’s constitution.

The state bill and Bisbee’s proposed ordinance do not mention same-sex marriage but do raise the issue of equality.

“It is in the best interest of the city of Bisbee to refuse to continue to remain silent on this issue, in the face of discriminatory practices that are inconsistent with the principles upon which our country was founded,” the ordinance states.

Advertisement

It’s unclear whether state officials will challenge Bisbee’s proposed ordinance if it passes a final vote.

Although the Arizona Constitution defines a marriage between a man and a woman, it doesn’t appear to forbid same-sex civil unions, said Jack Tweedie, director of children and families program at the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Advertisement

Still, it’s uncertain whether Bisbee officials have the authority to sanction such civil unions, Tweedie said.

“At some point we may be told that we can no longer do this,” Zavala Badal said.

Advertisement

A civil union certificate would allow a slew of city benefits for an unwed couple, such as disability or compensation for the partners of city workers and even family discounts at the local pool. Currently, partners don’t qualify.

As it stands now, there are several important life decisions that are not available to unwed partners, Zavala Badal said. For instance, partners cannot give authorization as to where their loved one should be buried in the city’s cemetery. Only family members can make that decision.

Councilman Gene Connors introduced the ordinance after the idea came up in conversation with someone else a month ago. “From her point of view, it would bring people to town and generate revenue,” Connors said.

Advertisement

He agreed about the possible economic reward, but as the vote came closer, Conners said, the potential revenue didn’t matter that much.

“It just absolutely had to happen … for the right reasons,” Connors said. He represents a neighborhood known as Old Bisbee, which has a substantial gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community.

“We [in Arizona] get a lot of bad press,” Connors said. “But Bisbee is a really a special town and it’s pretty wonderful to be here.”

A very few years ago, most Americans (including me) viewed the idea of gay marriage as both undesirable and wildly improbable. Today, most Americans (including me) believe that permitting gay and lesbian couples to marry is the right thing to do, a matter of simple justice.

Advertisement

Let us pause in wonder at the speed and moral meaning of this change. As recently as a decade ago, homosexual conduct itself was a crime in many U.S. states. That world has vanished. Gay rights of all kinds are increasingly protected. Gay marriage is legal in 12 states and counting. Gay families are a part of our social fabric. Whatever the Supreme Court decides about the two cases now before it won’t be nearly as important as what has already happened in the country.

VIDEO OP-ED: Fighting for gay marriage and immigration reform

And yet these court decisions will affect the lives of millions of Americans. At stake in the DOMA case is whether the federal government can deny benefits to legally married same-sex couples that it extends to legally married opposite-sex couples. At stake in the Proposition 8 case is whether, or in what circumstances, a state can withhold marriage rights from same-sex couples.

So if you can’t sponsor your spouse for a green card simply because you’re both gay, the court’s view of DOMA matters a lot. And if you are a gay couple living in, say, my home state of Mississippi, or in one of the other Sunbelt states in which opposition to gay rights is strong, you care very much about whether your state can prohibit same-sex marriage.

For those reasons and more, I have every hope the Supreme Court will craft decisions that will move the country in the direction it is already headed: toward marriage equality.

TIMELINE: Gay marriage chronology

Advertisement

And yet arriving at that position has for me been a difficult and painful journey. Until June 2012, I was a vocal opponent of gay marriage. I wrote a book about it and spoke against it across the country; I was an expert witness in support of Proposition 8.

I did all of that not because I condemned homosexuality or objected to gay civil unions — I didn’t. But I believed gay marriage would weaken the traditional institution of marriage, the institution that binds mothers, fathers and their children together.

Advertisement

A wealth of social science evidence about child poverty, mental and emotional distress, educational failure, crime and other problems suggests that when marriage breaks down — when fathers are absent and mothers are left alone to raise children — society breaks down too. Gay marriage and families, which by their nature involve the loosening of biological family ties, seemed to pose one more threat to an already beleaguered institution.

In the end, I didn’t change my mind on gay marriage because I stopped believing in the importance of intact biological families. Nor was it because of new studies or additional facts. (Gay marriage still strains biological family bonds, although research also points to the potential stability of gay marriage and family structures.) And I didn’t change my mind because I got tired of being criticized. I changed my opposition to gay marriage because of personal relationships.

Advertisement

In my case, it began with the writer Jonathan Rauch, who I’d been publicly debating on the gay marriage issue. But at some point we stopped debating and started talking about our lives, including about my wife, Raina, and his husband, Michael. Did Jonathan’s marriage threaten the idea of marriage? Perhaps in theory. But in real life, was I able to see it? No. In fact, quite the opposite.

It may sound trite, but for me the key was the gradual breakthrough of empathy. I found that as friendships develop, empathy becomes at least possible, no longer kept at bay by a wall of fixed belief. Put simply, becoming friends with gay people who were married or wanted to get married led me to realize that I couldn’t in good conscience continue to oppose it.

Advertisement

But another reality was also becoming clear. At the same time that gay and lesbian couples and their supporters are struggling for the right to marry, millions of straight couples are abandoning marriage entirely, with tragic consequences for them and their children. Further, this abandonment is occurring among our once heavily married middle and working class.

Upscale Americans are still enjoying marriage’s economic and social advantages. For example, only about 6% of children born to college-educated women are born outside marriage. Among women with a high school degree but not a four-year-college degree, though, it’s 44%, and among poorly educated women, it’s 54%. Many other numbers tell the same story.

Advertisement

This class-based marriage divide is not only large, it’s constantly getting larger. Scholarship shows that it’s contributing significantly to the rise of economic inequality. I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that it’s threatening the American dream.

So this is where I found myself a year ago: Fighting gay marriage was wrong because it was denying real people access to a status and an institution we all have a stake in. Moreover, that battle was doing nothing to strengthen the institution overall.

Advertisement

And this is where I find myself now: The goal of marriage equality is to make marriage available and achievable for all who seek it — gay and straight, the upscale minority and the non-upscale majority. And the strategy for achieving full marriage equality is a strategy of strange bedfellows: social conservatives and gay rights liberals, a coalition that could put an end forever to the conflict between gay rights and family values.

That coalition is waiting to be born, no matter what the Supreme Court decides.

The group has already set up shop in Minnesota, where the Legislature may vote as early as next week on a same-sex marriage bill that advocates do not yet have enough votes to pass.

But the group is also beginning a long-term push in more conservative states like West Virginia and Utah, seeking to build conservative support for nondiscrimination laws that could help pave the way for same-sex marriage in coming years. A critical part of the effort, fund strategists said, is building lists of Republican supporters of same-sex marriage around the country that could be used to pressure lawmakers in Washington and elsewhere.

That could prove critical at the state level, where Republicans now control majorities or supermajorities in more than half the state capitols.

“We want to change the complexion of which people are calling their lawmakers from these legislative districts,” said Jeff Cook-McCormac, a senior adviser to the American Unity Fund. “It’s usually gay people calling and saying, ‘We want this.’ What we want is for legislators to hear from their straight friends and neighbors, people who will say, ‘I’m a Republican, and I want this for my neighbors and my friends.’ ”

In Rhode Island, the unity fund helped Republican senators create their message in a way that would help them navigate opposition from more conservative constituents.

“They were a resource of experienced political professionals operating on the Republican side of the aisle,” said State Senator Dawson Hodgson, a Republican who co-sponsored the marriage bill. “It was important to be able to draw on some national level experience in making sure that our Republican perspective in supporting same-sex marriage was at the forefront of our dialogue with constituents.”

Mr. Singer, the fund’s founder, helped bankroll the successful same-sex marriage push in New York two years ago, persuading Republicans in Albany that some of the party’s top donors would be there to help defend them against primary challenges and attacks from same-sex marriage opponents. Despite such successes — including passage of measures in four states last fall either legalizing same-sex marriage or overturning existing bans — same sex-unions remain illegal in most of the country."

Story highlights Thirty-seven states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriage. Thirteen states have anti-marriage laws. 60% of Americans support same-sex marriage, according to a May 2015 Gallup poll.

Editor’s Note: This story was originally published in May 2012 and was updated in June 2015.

(CNN) —

The Supreme Court gave proponents of same-sex marriage two major victories in 2013 – striking down parts of the Defense of Marriage Act that denied the same benefits provided to heterosexual spouses to legally married same-sex couples, and allowing same-sex marriages to resume in California. Since then, a lot has has happened, legally, for supporters.

Here’s a look at same-sex marriage in the United States, by the numbers:

37 – U.S. states which allow same-sex marriage, plus the District of Columbia: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

13 – The number of U.S. states with “laws or constitutional amendments that deny the freedom to marry to same-sex couples.”

4 – States involved in the challenge to the U.S. Supreme Court involving state bans on same-sex marriage. At issue is a lower court opinion that upheld same-sex marriage bans in Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee.

1 – U.S. territory where same-sex partners can get married: Guam.

Almost 72% – Percentage of people in the United States who live in a state where same-sex marriage is legal.

9 million - LGBT adults in the United States.

251,695 – Same-sex married couples in the United States in 2013, according to the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey.

60% - Percentage of Americans who support same-sex marriage, according to a May 2015 Gallup Poll.

2001 – The year the Netherlands made same-sex marriage legal. It was the first country in the world to so.

2003 – The year the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it is unconstitutional to criminalize sodomy.

2004 – The year that same-sex marriage became legal in Massachusetts, the first U.S. state to do so.

19 – Countries worldwide where same-sex marriage has been approved in the entire country: Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales), and Uruguay.

2 – The number of countries where same-sex marriage is legal in some areas: Mexico and the United States.

4 – U.S. states that allow civil unions: Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois and New Jersey.

22% – Same-sex couples in the United States raising adopted or foster children, as of March 2015 research by the Williams Institute at UCLA."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/23/ohio-gay-marriage-ban-rejected-in-narrow-ruling/,2013-12-23 00:00:00,[],Ohio gay marriage ban rejected in narrow ruling,"A federal judge Monday ordered Ohio authorities to recognize gay marriages on death certificates, saying the state's ban on such unions is unconstitutional and that states cannot discriminate against same-sex couples simply because some voters don't like homosexuality.

Although Judge Timothy Black's ruling applies only to death certificates, his statements about Ohio's gay-marriage ban are sweeping, unequivocal, and are expected to incite further litigation challenging the law. Ohio's attorney general said the state will appeal.

Black cited the Supreme Court's June decision striking down part of a federal anti-gay marriage law, saying that the lower courts are now tasked with applying that ruling.

""And the question presented is whether a state can do what the federal government cannot — i.e., discriminate against same-sex couples ... simply because the majority of the voters don't like homosexuality (or at least didn't in 2004),"" Black said in reference to the year Ohio's gay marriage ban passed. ""Under the Constitution of the United States, the answer is no.""

Eighteen states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex weddings, up from six before the Supreme Court decision.

Black wrote that ""once you get married lawfully in one state, another state cannot summarily take your marriage away,"" saying the right to remain married is recognized as a fundamental liberty in the U.S. Constitution.

""When a state effectively terminates the marriage of a same-sex couple married in another jurisdiction, it intrudes into the realm of private marital, family, and intimate relations specifically protected by the Supreme Court,"" he wrote.

Black referenced Ohio's historical practice of recognizing other out-of-state marriages even though they can't legally be performed in Ohio, such as those involving cousins or minors.

Black's decision stems from a lawsuit in July by two gay Ohio men whose spouses recently died and wanted to be recognized on their death certificates as married. The two couples got married over the summer in states that allow same-sex marriage.

Black said ""there is absolutely no evidence that the state of Ohio or its citizens will be harmed"" by his ruling but that without it, the harm would be severe for two men who filed the lawsuit because it would strip them of the dignity and recognition given to opposite-sex couples.

Black ordered the state not only to recognize the marriages of the two men who filed the lawsuit on their respective spouses' death certificate but also to communicate his orders to anyone in the state involved in completing death certificates.

Attorney General Mike DeWine said the state will take its case to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, also based in Cincinnati. He called Monday's decision ""not a huge surprise,"" given earlier rulings Black made in the case.

""Our job is to defend the Ohio Constitution and state statutes ... and that's what we intend to do,"" DeWine said.

Bridget Coontz, the attorney who argued on behalf of the state, said Wednesday in court that in the Supreme Court's historic June decision, the justices also found that states have the right to decide for themselves whether to recognize gay marriage, and Ohio voters decided not to in 2004.

""Ohio doesn't want Delaware or Maryland to define who is married under Ohio law,"" she said. ""To allow that to happen would allow one state to set the marriage policy for all others.""

Civil rights attorney Al Gerhardstein argued to Black that the case was ""about love surviving death"" and said that the state had no right to recognize certain out-of-state marriages and not others.

Black sided with Gerhardstein, saying that constitutional rights trump Ohio's gay marriage ban, questioning whether it was passed for a legitimate state interest ""other than simply maintaining a 'traditional' definition of marriage.""

He quoted then-Gov. Robert Taft who said in 2004 that the law was intended ""to reaffirm existing Ohio law with respect to our most basic, rooted, and time-honored institution: marriage between a man and a woman.""

Black wrote that ""the fact that a form of discrimination has been 'traditional' is a reason to be more skeptical of its rationality.""

""No hypothetical justification can overcome the clear primary purpose and practical effect of the marriage bans ... to disparage and demean the dignity of same-sex couples in the eyes of the state and the wider community,"" Black wrote."

The majority opinion said the ruling only applied to married gay couples seeking federal benefits

The ruling has already been cited in cases in New Jersey and Michigan

Only federal courts in California have called state gay marriage bans unconstitutional

WASHINGTON (AP) — When the Supreme Court struck down part of an anti-gay marriage law, Justice Anthony Kennedy took pains in his majority opinion to say the ruling applied only to legally married same-sex couples seeking benefits from the federal government.

But judges and lawyers representing same-sex couples are already using Kennedy's language and reasoning in other cases about the right to marry.

It's a predictable next step in a long-term, incremental legal strategy that is being used at both the state and federal levels, and in state legislatures and executive mansions as well as the courts, to build public and official acceptance of gay marriage. Much the same approach was used decades ago by civil rights lawyers fighting state-sanctioned discrimination; one decision becomes a steppingstone to the next.

In the fight over gay marriage, Kennedy's words also figured in an earlier example. He insisted in June 2003 that his opinion overturning state sodomy laws had nothing to do with governments' recognition of same-sex marriage. Five months later, language from his opinion showed up in the second paragraph of a state court ruling that made Massachusetts the first state to allow gay and lesbian couples to marry.

In the June 26 decision in U.S. v. Windsor, Kennedy said the provision denying federal benefits to legally married same-sex couples relegates those marriages to second-class status, and ""it humiliates tens of thousands of children now being raised by same-sex couples.""

He framed his argument with reference to states' ""historic and essential authority to define the marital relation.""

But it doesn't take too much creativity to reframe his opinion to challenge state bans on same-sex marriage, said Jon Davidson, legal director of the gay rights group Lambda Legal.

""It's stigmatizing and it's harmful to people and particularly harmful to children when their parents' relationship is treated as inferior by the government. Those points are points we will be making in all of our marriage cases,"" Davidson said.

Davidson's group is relying on the invalidation of the Defense of Marriage Act provision in a state lawsuit to force New Jersey to allow same-sex couples to wed. In that case, the new argument is that the New Jersey Constitution does not allow the state to essentially keep same-sex couples from receiving federal benefits by prohibiting them from marrying.

Like the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, other state court rulings in favor of gay marriage have relied on provisions of their state constitutions. That has not happened by accident. The litigation plan had been to pursue marriage in liberal states, based on state constitutions, and generally avoid federal courts where judges appointed by conservative Republican presidents had, until recently, been in the majority.

Federal courts in California are so far the only ones that have said that a state same-sex marriage ban violates the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court did not decide that issue one way or the other in its gay marriage rulings, and instead relied on a technical legal argument to resolve the California case and clear the way for same-sex marriage in the state, which resumed at the end of June.

Same-sex marriage is legal, or soon will be, in 13 states and the District of Columbia, representing about 30% of the U.S. population. The states are: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.

But now federal challenges are popping up as well, in Nevada, Hawaii and Michigan, among other states.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, which struck down the California prohibition on same-sex marriage, will consider the Hawaii and Nevada bans together, but that case is in its early stages.

In Michigan, a federal judge prominently cited the Windsor decision in allowing a challenge to the state's marriage ban and its prohibition on same-sex couples jointly adopting children to go forward.

U.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, quoted Kennedy in concluding that ""plaintiffs are entitled to their day in court and they shall have it.""

A separate case in Michigan also ""might cast a large shadow over a state law limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples,"" Georgetown University law professor Marty Lederman wrote on scotusblog.com.

In that dispute, public employees are challenging a Michigan law that cuts off domestic partner benefits for unmarried couples.

U.S. District Judge David Lawson, appointed by President Bill Clinton, partly relied on the recent Supreme Court case in saying, ""It is hard to argue with a straight face that the primary purpose, indeed, perhaps the sole purpose, of the statute is other than to deny health benefits to the same-sex partners of public employees. But that can never be a legitimate governmental purpose."" Lawson blocked the law for now, pending a trial.

When civil rights lawyers began their decadeslong quest to end official discrimination against black Americans, they pursued cases in state and federal courts that typically stopped short of the ultimate goal of overturning the Supreme Court decree in Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896 that ""separate but equal"" treatment of the races was permitted by the Constitution.

In a series of cases, the court chipped away at discrimination in higher education, including its 1950 decision in Sweatt v. Painter that said the University of Texas had to admit a black student to its law school because the one it created for black students did not offer an equivalent education. But even in June 1950, the court refused to re-examine the Plessy case.

Four more years elapsed before the court issued its seminal ruling in Brown v. Board of Education outlawing discrimination in public schools.

The prominent odd-couple lawyers who brought the California case to the Supreme Court, Republican Theodore Olson and Democrat David Boies, hoped the court would in one fell swoop get rid of 30 state constitutional bans on gay marriage and a few state statutes and declare that the right to marry cannot be abridged on the basis of sexual orientation and gender.

They failed to win that big victory, although their clients got married two days after the court decision.

For a time, Olson and Boies were at odds with many gay rights advocates who feared that asking the court to rule too broadly too soon could backfire. It turned out that the California case helped focus attention on gay marriage and perhaps sped up the shift in public opinion that now shows a majority in favor of same-sex marriage in most polls.

The different approaches have sometimes coexisted uneasily. That, too, is reminiscent of the civil rights movement, said Harvard Law School professor Mark Tushnet, who has written about the legal strategy of civil rights lawyers. ""There were lawsuits that the NAACP didn't want because they were seen as sure losers, but local lawyers went ahead and brought them anyway. They weren't part of the plan,"" Tushnet said.

Ten years ago, 13 states still had laws against sodomy when the court said that states have no right to intrude on the private, personal conduct of people, regardless of sexual orientation.

Interracial marriage still was illegal in 16 states in 1967 before the high court outlawed race-based state marriage bans.

In 1954, when the court issued its landmark Brown decision, 17 states had formally segregated school systems.

No one is sure what the magic number needs to be for the court to set a nationwide rule. Tushnet predicts that when roughly 40 states allow same-sex marriage, ""it is going to seem all right to tell Mississippi that it has to recognize gay marriage.""

Justice Antonin Scalia, a dissenter in 2003 and again this year, saw the seeds of same-sex marriage in the court's 2003 decision and he saw them again in the Windsor case, despite Kennedy's insistence that the opinion was limited.

""How easy it is, indeed how inevitable, to reach the same conclusion with regard to state laws denying same-sex couples marital status,"" Scalia said."

Gays hoping to join the Boy Scouts will have to wait until at least May after the organization’s executive board put off a vote on lifting its outright ban on openly homosexual scouts and troop leaders.

The board had been expected to vote Wednesday on a proposal to let local groups set their own policies, but said instead that it needs more time to get comment on the issue from its members.

“After careful consideration and extensive dialogue within the Scouting family, along with comments from those outside the organization, the volunteer officers of the Boy Scouts of America’s National Executive Board concluded that due to the complexity of this issue, the organization needs time for a more deliberate review of its membership policy,” the board said in a written statement.

The decision will now be made at the organization’s annual meeting in May. About 1,400 members of the group’s national council will take part during that gathering, the board said.

In the meantime, the organization will “further engage representatives of Scouting’s membership and listen to their perspectives and concerns.”

Opinion: Ban on gays hurts Scouting

The decision disappointed critics who had hoped to see the organization end its ban despite a 2000 Supreme Court ruling saying it had the right to keep it.

“Every day that the Boy Scouts of America delay action is another day that discrimination prevails,” said Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin. “Now is the time for action. Young Americans, gay and straight, are hurt by the inaction associated with today’s news. The BSA leadership should end this awful policy once and for all, and open the proud tradition of Scouting to all.”

Others hope the delay will provide time to lobby the Boy Scouts to scrap the plan.

“This issue is not a gay rights issue,” said Utah scout leader Eric Montague. “It’s a gender attraction issue and it’s also a politics issue. As a local scout leader, I don’t need to worry about gay rights – that shouldn’t be my role; that shouldn’t be what I do. And to push that decision upon me is not the best way to go.”

Conservative groups and some religious organizations have argued against making any change, saying it would dilute the Boy Scout message of morality and potentially destroy the organization.

The Boy Scouts announced last month that the organization would consider changing the policy, a sharp reversal of its previous support for excluding openly gay members and scout leaders.

The new policy would allow local leaders to decide “consistent with each organization’s mission, principles or religious beliefs” whether to open troops they sponsor to openly gay people, the group said in a statement at the time.

The proposal comes more than a decade after a Supreme Court ruling that found the organization has the right to keep gays out, but also amid declining participation in the venerable American institution.

Membership in Boy Scouts has declined by about a third since 1999. About 2.7 million people now participate in scouting nationwide, with more than 70% of troops affiliated with a church or religious groups.

The organization has also endured frequent criticism from gay rights groups and other critics who say the Boy Scouts should not endorse discrimination.

Activists hail a watershed moment in gay rights movement

Among more recent controversies, the organization came under fire last year after Jennifer Tyrrell, an Ohio den leader, was dismissed by her local Boy Scout officials for being a lesbian.

On Tuesday, Tyrell delivered a petition she said was signed by 1.4 million people supporting the change.

Before Wednesday’s announcement of the delay, she said she was looking forward to the change, but added it would not go far enough.

“If this ban is lifted, it’s a great first step,” she said Wednesday on CNN’s “Starting Point.” “But it’s still going to lead to kids being rejected. Families are still going to be turned away.”

Brandy Pryde, a troop leader who participated in a prayer vigil outside the Boy Scouts headquarters Wednesday, said her church would pull support from scouting if the change goes through.

“What happens when we go camping and there’s units that allow gays and homosexuals and there’s units that don’t, how are we going to keep them separated from those units and how are we going to instill in our kids Christian values and the biblical truth if that’s allowed in our program?” she said.

A poll released Monday suggests the public is in favor of lifting the ban. The poll, conducted January 30 to February 4 by Quinnipiac University, found 55% of respondents favored lifting the ban. The school said 33% were opposed. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.3 percentage points.

President Barack Obama, who is honorary president of the national organization by virtue of his office, also supports opening troops to everyone.

On Wednesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the administration had no comment on the Boy Scouts decision.

“You know that the president believes the Boy Scouts is a valuable organization that has helped educate and build character in American boys for more than a century,” Carney said. “He also, as you know, opposes discrimination in all forms. And as such, believes – as he said just on Sunday – that gay Americans ought to be able to participate in the Boy Scouts. But in terms of the process of their evaluation of their policies, I don’t have a comment.”

Conservative politicians and religious leaders have said that changing the policy would dilute the organization’s voice and mission.

Scouting goes through a rough patch

Some, including former Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum, have argued the change could destroy scouting. Richard Land of the Southern Baptist Convention said the change could be a “catastrophe.”

“What they’ve said to us and to other religious leaders is that they are doing this under pressure, and we’re going to give people what basically amounts to a local option,” Land said. “You can’t have a local option of a core conviction.”

Changing the policy against having openly gay leaders or Scouts “would be a grave mistake,” the conservative Family Research Council and dozens of other groups said in a half-page ad in USA Today this week.

The message called on the Boy Scouts to “show courage” and “stand firm for timeless values.”

“Every American who believes in freedom of thought and religious liberty should be alarmed by the attacks upon the Boy Scouts, who have had core convictions about morality for 100 years,” the ad said. “Every Scout takes an oath to keep himself ‘morally straight.’ The Boy Scouts have every right to include sexual conduct in how they define that term.”

But others say scouting is suffering because of its policy on gays, not despite it.

Eagle Scout Zach Wahls, founder of Scouts for Equality, says the ban has backfired.

When he was 10, Wahls’ Cub Scout pack had to find a new home because the Boy Scouts of America’s policy violated the nondiscrimination rule of the school district that hosted it.

“I was confused, because my den mother, Jackie – who is my actual mother – was a lesbian, and nobody in our unit had any issue with that,” Wahls wrote. The pack managed to find another sponsor – a nearby church – but “some parents pulled their kids from the pack, uncomfortable with entrusting their sons to an organization they believed engaged in discrimination.”

The real issue at hand is not freedom of speech or same-sex marriage but Chick-fil-A's secretive funding of documented anti-gay hate groups. The national organization Campus Pride made this clear last week in releasing ""5 Simple Facts About Chick-fil-A."" Campus Pride specifically called upon our nation's student leaders to share the truth about Chick-fil-A and its funding of radical-right-wing organizations and documented hate groups.

Through its family-controlled nonprofit arm, Chick-fil-A profits have funded such groups as Eagle Forum, Exodus International, Family Research Council, and Focus on the Family. These groups proudly and aggressively work against the rights of LGBT people, advocating their criminalization, psychological abuse, and death. Chick-fil-A has not disputed any of these facts. The ""5 Simple Facts About Chick-fil-A"" are well documented, showing the funneling of Chick-fil-A profits to anti-gay causes and even a hate group, as determined by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

While Chick-fil-A's leadership has every right to its views, beliefs, and voice, students and administrators alike need to know that revenues going to Chick-fil-A drive funding for groups that are almost certainly in conflict with campus nondiscrimination policies. There is no justification for Chick-fil-A to be on a college campus where there is a responsibility by administrators for a safe learning environment for all students. The actions by Chick-fil-A in taking profits to fund hate groups that harm a population on campus impedes safety and creating a learning environment for academic success.

Thanks to the president of Chick-fil-A, Dan Cathy, the cow façade has been lifted to show what is really behind the billboards and spicy chicken sandwiches. Good people, Christian or not, don't use their corporate profits to fund hate groups or causes that work to defame, criminalize, and execute people.

Colleges and universities have a real problem on their hands in the next few weeks as students come back to campus. You can't just tell students who disagree to not eat the chicken sandwich; that message is irresponsible and harmful to LGBT students. Colleges have to take responsibility for the facts and realize that student-meal-plan money is going to fund a documented hate group that works to aggressively harm students on their campus. This will certainly affect the safety and campus climate of all students.

Read the ""5 Simple Facts About Chick-fil-A."" Campus Pride calls on student leaders and campus newspapers to share that:

Chick-fil-A profits fund documented hate groups that aggressively work against LGBT people, advocating for their criminalization, psychological abuse, or death.

Chick-fil-A profits support the radical-right-wing group Eagle Forum, which supports LGBT people being considered criminals.

Chick-fil-A profits support Exodus International, which claims to ""cure homosexuality"" through psychological coercion of LGBT people. It says LGBT people are ""perverse.""

Chick-fil-A profits support Focus on the Family (FOF) and its off-shoot group, the Family Research Council (FRC), which has been designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. FOF aggressively defames LGBT people as a threat to children, and FRC spent $25,000 to stop the U.S. Congress from condemning Uganda's anti-homosexuality bill, which calls for the execution of gay people in some cases.

Chick-fil-A profits come from you. When you choose Chick-fil-A, you help fund hate groups.

Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman announces his support of legalizing gay marriage

Only current U.S. Senator and one of just a few members of Congress to support gay marriage

Gay son encouraged Portman to switch his position

WASHINGTON — Republican Sen. Rob Portman said Thursday that he now supports gay marriage — a surprise turnabout on a hot-button social issue, sparked by a deeply personal reflection that began two years ago after Portman's son, Will, told him that he is gay.

""It's a change of heart from the position of a father,"" Portman told three Ohio reporters on Thursday during a 45-minute interview in his office. ""I think we should be allowing gay couples the joy and stability of marriage.""

Portman's endorsement of gay marriage makes him the only sitting Republican senator to hold that position. But it comes at a time when public attitudes are shifting quickly on the issue, and more and more states are sanctioning gay marriage.

Ohio's junior senator outlined his position in the interview, and in an op-ed that appears Friday in The Columbus Dispatch.

""I have come to believe that if two people are prepared to make a lifetime commitment to love and care for each other in good times and bad, the government shouldn't deny them the opportunity to get married,"" Portman writes in the op-ed. ""This isn't how I've always felt.""

Portman said his own evolution on the issue began in 2011, when Will, then a freshman at Yale University, made a stunning revelation.

""Will … came to Jane and me and announced that he was gay, that it was not a choice. It was who he is and he had been that way since he could remember,"" Portman recalled of the conversation. ""Jane and I were both surprised, very surprised, but also very supportive of him. Our reaction was not about policy or positions. It was about him as a son and letting him know we were 110% supportive of him.""

His son's homosexuality ""allowed me to think about this issue from a new perspective, and that's as a dad who loves his son a lot,"" Portman said. He said he wants Will to have the same chance at an enduring relationship, ""like Jane and I have had for over 26 years.""

Portman — who until now said marriage should only be between a man and a woman — said it took him ""a while"" to make the political shift and ""get comfortable"" supporting gay marriage.

Portman was among those who, as a member of the House in 1996, voted in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defines marriage as between a man and a woman and bars federal recognition of same-sex marriage. It also says states can't be forced to recognize a same-sex marriage performed in another state. Portman also voted in favor of a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage when he was in the House.

""Rob believes marriage is a sacred bond between one man and one woman,"" Portman's spokesman told The Cincinnati Enquirer in 2011. At the time, Portman was the target of a protest by University of Michigan Law School students. He had been invited to deliver the school's commencement address, but nearly 300 students, angry about Portman's opposition to gay rights, asked the school to revoke the invitation.

On Thursday, Portman said he would like to see Congress repeal the provision of DOMA that bans federal recognition of same-sex marriage, although he still supports the part of the law that says states should not be forced to recognize same-sex marriages.

""I'm of the view that the states ought to be deciding this issue, and frankly that's happening increasingly,"" Portman said.

Portman, who is Methodist, said he did not come to this new position easily or quickly. He talked to his pastor and other religious leaders. He talked to his family, friends, and political allies. He talked to those who support gay marriage, including former vice president Dick Cheney — as well as those who do not, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

""I have had a process and a journey,"" he said. ""I've done a lot of reading. I've done a lot of talking to folks.""

Asked whether he would support overturning Ohio's state ban on same-sex marriage if it comes up in a voter referendum, Portman said yes.

""I'm going to be supportive of Ohioans having the opportunity to marry,"" he said. ""I would not plan to take a leadership role in this, but people will know my position.""

Other Republicans have similarly embraced same-sex marriage. For example, more than 80 prominent Republicans — including ex-governors, former members of Congress and veterans of the George W. Bush administration — are planning to file a ""friend of the court"" brief asking the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down California's Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage.

The signers include former governors Jon Huntsman of Utah, Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, and William Weld of Massachusetts.

But many Republicans in Congress, including House Speaker John Boehner, remain fiercely opposed to same-sex marriage. And the issue ignites strong passions among social conservatives, a key base for Portman in Ohio.

Portman said Will, who is now 21, nudged him to change his views and wanted him to publicly declare his support for gay marriage. ""He hasn't pushed me, but he's been encouraging, and he's been very much involved,"" he said.

Portman said his previous views on marriage were rooted in his faith. But ""the overriding message of love and compassion that I take from the Bible . . . and the fact that I believe we are all created by our maker . . . that has all influenced me in terms of my change on this issue,"" he said.

Portman said he concluded that marriage as an institution would be strengthened by allowing gay couples to wed.

""When two people make a commitment to one another, it can actually enhance the institution of marriage,"" he said.

Even as he endorsed same-sex marriage, Portman said this would not suddenly become a top legislative priority for him. He has no plans, for example, to introduce legislation to repeal elements of DOMA or take on any other gay rights issues.

""I'm kind of an economic policy wonk,"" he said. ""That's how I got into this business. That's been my priority and my focus, and it will continue to be.""

Portman said he wanted to announce his position now, in part because the Supreme Court will hear arguments on DOMA later this month.

""I felt it was important to let my constituents know where I stand because these court cases are going to encourage members of the media to ask senators and House members what their position is,"" Portman said, adding that he wanted ""to do this before the politics of these court decisions . . . makes it more difficult maybe to have an honest discussion.""

Portman said he's told some of his Republican colleagues about his shift and all of them have been very ""respectful"" of his decision, even if they don't agree.

He consulted Cheney, whose daughter is gay, about the issue last weekend, when they were both attending a conference. ""His advice was 'Do the right thing. Follow your heart,' "" Portman said.

Asked how this might affect his political career, Portman, who has been touted as a possible 2016 presidential candidate, said he had no idea.

""That has nothing to do with my decision,"" he said. ""This was personally and family initiated, and then it was a process of carefully thinking through the issue."""

(CNN) – Former first lady Laura Bush, who is one of three prominent Republicans featured in a new ad supporting same-sex marriage, has asked the spot's creator to remove a clip of her espousing support for equal marriage rights.

""Mrs. Bush did not approve of her inclusion in this advertisement nor is she associated in any way with the group that made the ad,"" Anne MacDonald, a spokeswoman for the former first lady, wrote in a statement Thursday. ""When she became aware of the advertisement Tuesday night, we requested that the group remove her from it.""



The ad, from the Respect for Marriage Coalition, features Bush speaking in a 2010 CNN interview with Larry King.

""When couples are committed to each other and love each other then they ought to have the same sort of rights that everyone has,"" she is shown saying.

Those remarks came as a surprise at the time, since she appeared to be breaking ranks on the issue with her husband, former President George W. Bush. In 2011, her daughter Barbara appeared in a television spot for another pro-gay marriage group, the Human Rights Campaign.

UPDATE: Group switches ad after Laura Bush’s request

The spot also features clips of former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Secretary of State Colin Powell voicing their support for same-sex marriage rights. A spokeswoman for Powell said Thursday they weren't contacted for permission to use the clip, but that ""his remarks are in the public domain and we have not asked them to remove it.""

A spokesman for Cheney did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the ad Thursday morning. The Respect for Marriage Coalition similarly did not respond to a query on whether they would remove Bush from their spot.

The group said Wednesday they would spend $1 million to air the spot nationally, as well as run print ads in major newspapers utilizing the same quotes from the Republicans who back equal marriage rights.

""None of us would want to be told we can't marry the person we love,"" a narrator says introducing the clips. ""That's why a growing majority of Americans believe it's time to allow marriage for gay and lesbian couples.""

The ad shows Colin Powell, the former Secretary of State under George W. Bush, supporting same-sex marriage in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer from May.

""Allowing them to live together with the protection of law, it seems to me is the way we should be moving in this country,"" Powell said on CNN's ""The Situation Room.""

That interview reflected a shift for Powell, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff when the military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy was implemented.

A third Republican, former Vice President Dick Cheney, is shown in the spot saying ""Freedom means freedom for everyone."" Cheney's younger daughter Mary wed her longtime partner Heather Poe in June. They were married in Washington, D.C., which legalized same-sex marriage in 2009.

And a Democrat, President Barack Obama, is shown during his January inauguration address declaring ""Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law.""

The new ad campaign comes as the Supreme Court prepares to tackle the issue of same-sex marriage this spring. Last year the high court agreed to hear two constitutional challenges to state and federal laws dealing with the recognition of gay and lesbian couples to legally wed.

Oral arguments will be held on March 26 and 27, with a ruling by late June."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/03/28/The-Weakest-Link-Left-Targets-Justice-Roberts-Again,2013-03-28 00:00:00,['Joel B. Pollak'],The Weakest Link: Left Targets Justice Roberts–Again,"It worked last time. Last year, when oral arguments in the Obamacare case seemed to go against the administration, the left targeted Chief Justice John Roberts with a series of attacks from President Barack Obama on down. The attacks may have worked, as Roberts apparently changed his vote and upheld Obamacare by effectively rewriting the legislation itself to define the individual mandate as a tax.

The attacks on Roberts last year included President Obama’s general–and bizarre–assertion that the Supreme Court could not overturn congressional legislation, as well as a direct attack on Roberts by Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), who admonished the Chief Justice about “the proper role of the judicial branch.” The left media joined in enthusiastically, bullying the Chief Justice into deferring to Congress and the President.

This time, the charge is being led by the left media, including Ryan Grim of the Huffington Post, who penned a front-page article attacking Roberts for his past rulings on race and discrimination. Roberts’s Obamacare decision, or his support for overturning most of Arizona’s allegedly discriminatory immigration law (another 2012 debacle) apparently earned no points from Grim, who castigates Roberts for ignoring race.

“Roberts has in the past been dismissive of the need for voting rights protections or affirmative action, viewing the world as without the sort of racism that might require such remedies,” Grim writes scornfully. He seizes on Roberts’s skepticism that the Defense of Marriage Act was motivated by anti-homosexual animus, pointing to a passage in the Congressional Record about the moral disapproval of homosexuality.

Grim makes use of a familiar left-wing tactic: casting moral disapproval of homosexuality as moral disapproval of gay people. Many supporters of traditional marriage are careful to distinguish between the two. Moreover, Roberts asked: “So eighty-four Senators–it’s the same question I asked before–eighty-four Senators based their vote on moral disapproval of gay people?” He was not denying that some might have acted out of animus, but doubting that all had done so.

The point was not lost on Justice Elena Kagan, who quoted the same passage from the Congressional Record to which Grim refers. She admitted, after Roberts’s question, that most Senators who voted for the act likely did not act out of anti-gay bigotry. Grim ignores that and twists Roberts’s words to cast him as willfully blind–not just to anti-gay bigotry, but bigotry in general.

There is, Grim implies, one way for Roberts to redeem himself–for the moment, anyway–and that is to vote to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act. Then he can prove he is not blind, or bigoted himself–until the next constitutional controversy comes up, when the left will dip its pens in poison again and attack the Chief Justice, believing him to be the Court’s weakest link. Based on his recent history, they would not be wrong."

There's been a lot of focus on the Democratic senators who have switched their positions and say they are now supporting same-sex marriage. What about the ones who haven't — particularly Sens. Mark Pryor and Mary Landrieu?

Pryor of Arkansas and Landrieu of Louisiana are two of the most vulnerable Democrats up for re-election in 2014. They hail from red states that didn't vote for President Obama last year, and both have been quick to assert their independence from the White House.

Landrieu said in TV interviews last week that her personal views — like those of Democratic Sens. Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mark Warner of Virginia — have ""evolved"" on the subject. ""But my state has a very strong constitutional amendment against gay marriage and I think I have to honor that,"" Landrieu told CNN.

Pryor didn't sound like he was about to change his stance in an interview with KFSM, the CBS affiliate for Fort Smith, Bentonville and Bentonville. ""I am opposed to gay marriage,"" he told the TV station via e-mail. The senator said he has talked to gay and lesbian friends, who have stressed that their sexual orientation is not a choice.

Pryor also told KFSM that he is undecided on the topic of benefits to same-sex couples and said he would revisit the issue after the Supreme Court rules in the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) case.

The Supreme Court heard arguments in late March challenging DOMA, and justices were skeptical that the law was constitutional because it denies benefits to same-sex couples. So timing is crucial here: It's one thing to come out and say you're for gay marriage before the court rules, which is expected sometime this summer.

There's also the question of electoral politics. Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., who announced his support for marriage equality on Monday, has decided to retire and won't be facing voters again. Hagan, one of the Democrats to support gay marriage, is up for re-election in 2014 in a swing state that Obama lost in 2012 but won in 2008. What's more, North Carolina voters overwhelmingly approved a ban on gay marriage last year.

The third holdout on gay marriage is Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. In a statement to Talking Points Memo last week, Manchin indicated he is unlikely to change his views. He said he believes marriage is ""a union between one man and one woman"" and that he also supports the Defense of Marriage Act."

His recent support for gay marriage, an about-face reflective of President Barack Obama's own purported ""evolution"" on the issue, captivated headlines in April. But despite supporting same-sex nuptials, it seems Wallis is frustrating and infuriating gay rights advocates over comments he made on Wednesday about marriage equality and immigration.

While he supports matrimonial rights for all Americans, regardless of sexuality, Wallis said that this is not the time to tackle the issue and that the focus that evangelicals should have, at least for the moment, should be on the immigration debate. With the Senate Judiciary Committee beginning the amendment process this week on a contentious bill intended to bring both parties together on the issue, it's certainly a sensitive time on the immigration front.

""I support equal protection under the law but I think this is the wrong place in the wrong time to try and resolve this contentious issue,"" Wallis said during a press call for the Evangelical Immigration Table (EIT). ""This must be a bipartisan bill. Our focus must be on the 11 million undocumented and vulnerable people who this is their time, their chance, this is their moment.""

The EIT, as TheBlaze has reported, is a collective of pastors and preachers who are intent on seeing immigration reform enacted. Far from a left-of-center cohort, faith leaders with varying political opinions have come together under the EIT umbrella in an effort to help solve America's immigration conundrum. Recently, we interviewed the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, a conservative and the president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference (NHCLC), about his views on the matter.

The Christian Post provides more context about the issues that led Wallis to grant his controversial answer about same-sex marriage and immigration. It seems there's an amendment being touted for possible inclusion in the immigration bill that could spark a fair bit of controversy:

Story continues

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) ... has sponsored a contentious amendment that would allow U.S. citizens in long-term same-sex relationships to sponsor foreign partners for green cards. According to one report, although the authors of the bill have vowed to block ""poison pill"" amendments from derailing the legislation, Leahy's amendment is already ringing like a fire alarm. In his comments on Wednesday, however, Wallis, who was responding to a question from a reporter on whether or not the EIT would support an immigration reform bill with a gay rights amendment, could not stress enough that the marriage between the two issues was inappropriate for the time.

Wallis noted that regardless of views on gay marriage, ensuring bi-partisan support for immigration reform is, in his view, essential. Since adding an additional social debate into the mix is unpalatable and dangerous to immigration reform's passage, he's pushing for avoidance on that front, calling it the ""wrong place and wrong time for other contentious issues to come up that will be and can be resolved in other venues.""

However, as the Post notes, gay rights bloggers quickly decried Wallis stance. America Blog wrote the following:

Wallis, incredibly, organized a media conference call with renowned gay-hater and right-wing knuckle-dragger Richard Land of the Baptists (who famously claimed that women who get an abortion are psychologically impaired) in order to kill any effort to address the problems gay couples face with immigration. [...] For the record, it's not about ""gay marriage,"" Mr. Wallis. It's about gay couples being ripped apart by the US immigration system because their relationships aren't recognized as legitimate. If they were straight, their spouses could stay. But because they're gay, they can't. So spare us the Rush-Limbaugh Gary-Bauer Rick-Santorum talking points about how we're pushing for ""gay marriage"" in the immigration bill. We're fighting for the immigration rights of our loved ones.

Another blogger, John Becker, took an even more pointed tone, claiming that the progressive faith leader is throwing gays ""under the bus."" In the conclusion to his article about Wallis' views on immigration and gay marriage, Becker wrote, ""Shame on Jim Wallis -- for letting himself be duped, for tacitly endorsing hatred, and for standing with bigots instead of with the marginalized, the way a true Christian progressive would do.""

So, despite supporting gay marriage so publicly last month, it seems Wallis is going to be getting some heat for not endorsing one of the most controversial amendments in the immigration bill -- a provision that, if adopted, could derail potential bi-partisan support for the measure.

If justices on the Supreme Court sounded cautious and tentative as they addressed the issue of same-sex marriage Tuesday, it’s little wonder. Like everyone else in public life, they are operating in the middle of a political whirlwind.

The political and legal systems are caught between past and future. Public opinion has shifted rapidly, and a majority of Americans now back legalizing same-sex marriage. Among those younger than 40, support is overwhelming. The question is when and in what form the future arrives.

There is little doubt that every Democrat who seeks the White House in 2016 will support same-sex marriage — a reality that wasn’t so obvious 18 months ago. The question for Republicans is whether any of their 2016 candidates will take a similar position.

There is no better reminder of how rapidly things have changed than to recall that President Obama declared his support for same-sex marriage just in May — and only after Vice President Biden got there first. Obama seemed as hesitant to change his position — it took him several years — as some of the justices sounded Tuesday about making sweeping rulings about the constitutionality of such unions.

Obama’s hesitancy was perhaps understandable. California’s Proposition 8, the ban on same-sex marriage that was the subject of Tuesday’s oral argument at the high court, was approved four years ago — and in a staunchly Democratic state. If that vote were held today, odds are that California voters would go the other way.

March 27, 2013 College student Adam Sulier, brandishing a sign supporting same-sex marriage rights, rides on the shoulders of classmate Cam Tucker while waiting in front of the Supreme Court. Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post Wait 1 second to continue.

Politicians in both parties are scrambling to come to terms with the swift change in public opinion and how that fits with the views of their traditional constituencies. Today, it is considered perilous for any Democrat with national aspirations not to support same-sex marriage — which may explain why Hillary Rodham Clinton announced her support last week.

Clinton wasn’t alone. This week, a number of Democrats from purple or red states — Sens. Mark R. Warner of Virginia, Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Jon Tester of Montana, among others — announced their support. Many others are sure to follow, no matter what the Supreme Court does on Proposition 8.

Among Republicans, Sen. Rob Portman (Ohio) announced a change in position this month and now supports same-sex marriage. He was motivated because his son is gay. But Portman is in the minority among current or former elected officials in his party, in company with former vice president Dick Cheney and former Utah governor Jon Huntsman Jr.

Rank-and-file Republicans remain opposed to same-sex marriage. Overall, 59 percent of Republicans say they are against it, and nearly all feel strongly about that opposition, according to the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll. Yet Republicans are divided generationally. For the first time in a Post-ABC News poll, a majority of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents younger than 50 support legalizing same-sex marriage.

Republican leaders see the overall shifts in public opinion as clearly as do the Democrats and have responded accordingly. In 2004, Republicans used ballot initiatives barring same-sex marriage to spur turnout among their conservative voters. That strategy helped then-President George W. Bush win reelection. Many Republicans then favored a federal constitutional amendment barring same-sex marriage.

In 2012, Republican nominee Mitt Romney was mostly silent on the issue, other than to state his opposition. Democrats made it a consistent theme of their national convention, and Obama included it in his inaugural address in January.

GOP leaders know their position is no longer a winning one. They are now looking for a strategy to avoid making it a losing issue. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus told USA Today’s Susan Page this week that although the party does not need to change its official opposition to same-sex marriage, there is no reason “to act like Old Testament heretics” on the issue.

Priebus said Republicans should be welcoming to people with different views. “We’re not going to agree on every issue,” he said. “It doesn’t mean that we need to divide and subtract people from our party.” GOP strategist Karl Rove said he thinks it’s possible that one of the Republican candidates for president in 2016 will support same-sex marriage — although most of those talked about as potential candidates are opposed today.

The Supreme Court justices can see the contours of this debate — rapidly moving public opinion along with generational and geographic differences — and may choose not to deal directly with the California proposition. Absent a Supreme Court decision, the battle to legalize these unions will be waged state by state, with a patchwork that probably will divide red states from blue states.

Symbolically, however, the debate is in a different place. The rising segments of the population favor same-sex marriage — a reality that adds to pressures on the Republican Party as its leaders seek to put the GOP in a position to compete more effectively for the White House without offending the party’s conservative base.

Justice Anthony Kennedy observed Tuesday that the court was in “uncharted waters” as it weighed the constitutionality of same-sex marriage. But many politicians aren’t waiting for the court to act."

The devout Christian, Florida native was a superstar kicker for the Middle Tennessee State's Blue Raiders; he is also openly gay. As an athlete at a Southern college, Gendreau was not only a successul team member, but he also felt accepted by his teammates. Now, he has his sights set on the National Football League (NFL).

Gendreau gave an exclusive interview to OutSports' Cyd Zeigler about life as an openly gay college athlete and his NFL prospects, revealing that when he came out to his MT team in freshman year, they fully embraced him.

""Everyone just saw him as a football player,"" MT holder and team punter Josh Davis told OutSports. ""He was just one of the guys. The fact that he proved himself on the field, there was a respect for him.""

The 5-foot, 10-inch kicker, who graduated from MT last year, knows the NFL is a long-shot for him this year. Gendreau is currently a free agent, and only the New York Jets and Carolina Panthers are likely to draft a kicker this year. Still, it isn't impossible.

""It's totally legit that he can get into the league,"" Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe, who is also a gay rights advocate, told OutSports. ""Place-kicking is all about doing this one specific skill set. And if you can do that, you can make it whether you’ve been out of football for one year or 10 years.""

If he does make it into the NFL, Gendreau would not only be the first gay professional football player, but he would also be the first professional player to enter the league openly gay.

Gay players in sports have been especially controversial lately. Former Baltimore Ravens linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo revealed earlier this month that as many as four current football players are in talks to come out in the near future. Following this statement, the NFL met with gay rights groups to discuss enacting policies to end homophobia and combat discrimination.

The NFL would likely embrace a player like Gendreau, and why not? The first openly gay, male athlete will likely rake in millions in endorsement deals and garner major attention for the team.

""We have seen time and time again that diversity is a benefit,"" Hudson Taylor, founder and executive director of pro-tolerance nonprofit Athlete Ally, previously told The Huffington Post. ""It's a benefit in corporate America; it's a benefit in schools; and it's a benefit in sports. An athletic culture that welcomes and includes LGBT athletes will ultimately draw improved talent and create more unified and respectful team cultures.""

""These ideas are resonating for the sports community at all levels, from the leagues to the players to the corporate sponsors. And perhaps most importantly, they are resonating for fans,"" he continued. ""Though a player's decision to come out is intensely personal and something about which only he or she knows best, it is a promising time as the sports community welcomes those decisions and the corporate community incentivizes them."""

ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — A pivotal vote Thursday in the Minnesota House positioned that state to become the 12th in the country to allow gay marriages and the first in the Midwest to pass such a law out of its Legislature.

The 75-59 vote was seen as the critical step for the measure, which would allow same-sex weddings beginning Aug. 1. It's a startling shift in the state, where just six months earlier voters surprisingly turned back an effort to ban them in the Minnesota Constitution.

The state Senate is expected to consider the bill Monday, and leaders expect it to pass there. Gov. Mark Dayton has pledged to sign it into law.

Hundreds of people on both sides of the issue rallied Thursday at the Minnesota Capitol, which was under tighter than usual security. Pro-marriage demonstrators filled the hallways outside the House chambers, some dressed in orange T-Shirts and holding signs that read, ""I Support The Freedom to Marry."" Behind them, opponents held up bright pink signs that simply read, ""Vote No.""

Eleven other states allow gay marriages — including Rhode Island and Delaware, which approved laws in the past week. Minnesota would be the first state in the Midwest to pass the measure out of the Legislature.

Iowa allows gay marriages because of a 2009 court ruling. Leaders in Illinois — the only Midwestern state other than Minnesota with a Democratic-led statehouse — say that state is close to having the votes to approve a law too. But most other states surrounding Minnesota have constitutional bans against same-sex weddings, so the change might not spread to the nation's heartland nearly as quickly as it has on the coasts and in New England.

The Minnesota push for gay marriage grew out of last fall's successful campaign to defeat a constitutional amendment that would have banned it. Minnesota became the first state to turn back such an amendment after more than two dozen states had passed one over more than a decade.

The same election put Democrats in full control of state government for the first time in more than two decades, a perfect scenario for gay marriage supporters to swiftly pursue legalization. They tapped the cross-section of citizens, businesses, churches and others who spoke out against the amendment and staged rallies as part of a lobbying effort to build support.

The bill cleared committees in both chambers in March, and with a succession of national polls showing opposition to gay marriage falling away nationally."

The petition says the decision by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to permit weddings starting Friday afternoon was “premature.”

“When the Ninth Circuit originally put in place its stay to prevent same-sex marriage pending Supreme Court action, it stated clearly that ‘the stay shall continue until final disposition by the Supreme Court,’ ” the group said in a written statement.

“Under Supreme Court procedural rules, ‘final disposition’ comes when the Supreme Court issues a ‘mandate’ to the Ninth Circuit, at least 25 days after announcing its opinion in the case. The 25-day waiting period is provided to allow parties such as Prop. 8’s proponents to petition the Supreme Court for a re-hearing of the case.”

Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote Wednesday’s decision that gutted the anti-gay marriage Defense of Marriage Act, usually decides such petitions from California.

“People on both sides of this debate should at least agree that the courts must follow their own rules,” said Andy Pugno, chief counsel for ProtectMarriage. “This kind of lawlessness just further weakens the public’s confidence in the legitimacy of our legal system. We hope the Supreme Court will step in and restore some order here.”

On Friday, the appeals court bypassed a normal waiting period in lifting a hold on a trial judge’s order that declared Proposition 8 unconstitutional.

“It couldn’t come a moment too soon,” Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who sparked the legal effort for gay marriage in California when he was San Francisco mayor, said on Friday.

“What extraordinary timing, right before [gay] pride weekend,” he said. “All that time, all the struggle, and the moment has arrived.”

Supporters of Proposition 8 were furious that the 9th Circuit acted before the normal waiting period. ProtectMarriage, the sponsors of the ballot measure, has 25 days from the ruling to ask for reconsideration.

“It is part and parcel of the utter lawlessness in which this whole case has been prosecuted,” Chapman University constitutional law professor John Eastman said. “Normally, courts let the parties kind of pursue their legal remedies before they issue a mandate.”

He said the 25-day period for asking the Supreme Court to reconsider still applied, and a rehearing, though extremely unlikely, remained a technical possibility.

“Tonight it is chaos and lawlessness, and anyone who is concerned about the rule of law ought to be deeply troubled by what happened here,” Eastman said.

http://news.yahoo.com/senate-nears-historic-vote-gay-rights-bill-080458695--election.html,,[],Senate nears historic vote on gay rights bill,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate pushed toward a historic vote on legislation outlawing workplace discrimination against gay, bisexual and transgender Americans, demonstrating the nation's quickly evolving attitude toward gay rights nearly two decades after Congress rejected same-sex marriage.

All 55 members of the Democratic majority, including senators from the Deep South, and several Republicans were expected to unite on Thursday in backing the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. Sen. John McCain, the GOP's presidential nominee in 2008, signaled his conditional support on Wednesday.

""It is time for Congress to pass a federal law that ensures all our citizens - regardless of where they live - can go to work unafraid to be who they are,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., who urged House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to reconsider his opposition.

The enthusiasm of the bill's supporters was tempered by the reality that the Republican-led House, where conservatives have a firm grip on the agenda, is unlikely to even vote on the legislation. Boehner maintains his longstanding opposition to the measure, arguing that it is unnecessary and certain to create costly, frivolous lawsuits for businesses. Outside conservative groups have cast the bill as anti-family.

In the Senate, opponents of the legislation remained mute through three days of debate, with no lawmaker speaking out. That changed on Thursday as Republican Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana said the legislation would force employers to violate their religious beliefs, a direct counter to rights embodied in the Constitution.

""There's two types of discrimination here we're dealing with, and one of those goes to the very fundamental right granted to every American through our Constitution, a cherished value of freedom of expression and religion,"" Coats said.

The Senate rejected an amendment sponsored by Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania that would have expanded the number of groups that are covered under the religious exemption. Opponents argued that it would undermine the core bill.

Story continues

Senate passage would be a major victory for gay rights advocates in a momentous year for the issue. The Supreme Court in June affirmed gay marriage and granted federal benefits to legally married same-sex couples. In the heartland, Illinois is on the verge of becoming the 15th state to legalize gay marriage, along with the District of Columbia.

""I hope that we are on the verge of making history tomorrow by passing this bill with a strong vote,"" Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said Wednesday. ""I then hope that our colleagues on the House side will follow suit and that we can see this bill signed into law.""

If the House fails to act on the bill, gay rights advocates are likely to press President Barack Obama to act unilaterally and issue an executive order barring anti-gay workplace discrimination by federal contractors.

Through three days of Senate debate, backers of the bill repeatedly described it as an issue of fairness some 50 years after Congress passed and President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act.

""It is well past time that we, as elected representatives, ensure that our laws protect against discrimination in the workplace for all individuals, that we ensure ... some protections for those within the LGBT community,"" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who described the diversity in her state.

Murkowski's support underscored the generational shift. Seventeen years ago, when a bill dealing with discrimination based on sexual orientation failed by one vote in the Senate, the senator's father, Frank, voted against it. That was the same year that Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act.

Current federal law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, race and national origin. But it doesn't stop an employer from firing or refusing to hire workers because they are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender.

The bill would bar employers with 15 or more workers from using a person's sexual orientation or gender identity as the basis for making employment decisions, including hiring, firing, compensation or promotion. It would exempt religious institutions and the military.

By voice vote Wednesday, the Senate approved an amendment from Republican Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire that would prevent federal, state and local governments from retaliating against religious groups that are exempt from the law.

The Senate planned to vote Thursday on an amendment by Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., to expand the number of groups that are covered under the religious exemption.

Likely Senate approval of the overall bill reflects the nation's growing tolerance of gays and the GOP's political calculation as it looks for supporters beyond its core base of older voters. A Pew Research survey in June found that more Americans said homosexuality should be accepted rather than discouraged by society by a margin of 60 percent to 31 percent. Opinions were more evenly divided 10 years ago.

Deep-pocketed Republican-leaning groups such as the American Unity Fund, which counts on hedge fund billionaires and Mitt Romney donors as well as former Republican lawmakers, pushed for the legislation.

Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia have approved laws banning workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and 17 of those also prohibit employers from discriminating based on gender identity.

About 88 percent of Fortune 500 companies have adopted nondiscrimination policies that include sexual orientation, according to the Human Rights Campaign. About 57 percent of those companies include gender identity."

Pat Quinn on Wednesday put his signature on a historic measure making Illinois the 16th state to allow same-sex marriage, capping a 40-year push for gay rights that picked up major momentum during the past decade.

Playing master of ceremonies during an hourlong event, the re-election-seeking Democratic governor slowly signed the bill with 100 pens that quickly became souvenirs. He did so at a desk shipped from Springfield that the administration said President Abraham Lincoln used to write his first inaugural address in 1861 — a speech on the cusp of the Civil War that called on Americans to heed ""the better angels of our nature.""

But it was another Lincoln speech that Quinn referenced as he spoke to about 2,300 supporters gathered at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

""In the very beginning of the Gettysburg Address, President Abraham Lincoln of Illinois said that our nation was conceived in liberty. And he said it's dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal, and that's really what we're celebrating today,"" he said. ""It's a triumph of democracy.""

Signs were banned for security reasons, but attendees shared celebratory kisses and waved miniature rainbow flags featuring the outline of Illinois.

Among the first in the door were Jan Arnold and Mary Anderson, of Oak Park, who brought their 8-year-old son to witness the bill-signing. The couple have been together for 15 years but said they got tired of waiting on Illinois to pass gay marriage and were legally married in Iowa in 2011.

Their union now will be recognized in Illinois, which Anderson said will free her family from second-class status and means they no longer have to carry a ""dossier"" of legal paperwork to prove their relationship should an emergency occur.

""We're finally safe and protected in our home state,"" Anderson said. ""We'll have the same protections that our straight friends do.""

The bill-signing illustrated the rapidly changing views in Illinois and the nation on gay rights. Supporters first introduced an anti-discrimination bill in the legislature in 1974. It didn't became law until 2005. It took an additional six years for civil unions to be approved, but only about half that time for the gay marriage measure.

Still, support for same-sex marriage is far from universal in Illinois. As politicians talked up the merits of gay marriage in Chicago, down in Springfield, a crowd gathered for an exorcism by the local Catholic bishop in protest of the governor's action.

""It is not the church that must change to confirm its teachings to the views of the world, but it is each individual who is called to be configured to Christ,"" Bishop Thomas Paprocki said during a service delivered mostly in Latin.

The new law changes the definition of marriage in Illinois from an act between a man and a woman to one between two people. Civil unions could be converted to marriages within a year of the law going on the books. About 6,500 applications for civil unions have been filed since 2011, with about 4,000 originating in Cook County.

As it stands, the bill won't take effect until June 1, which is when the first marriage ceremonies could take place. That date falls on a Sunday, but officials with Cook County Clerk David Orr's office said they will be ready for what they expect to be a huge demand. That includes the possibility of providing special waivers so couples don't have to wait until the day after receiving wedding licenses before they can be married.

The start date could be moved up under a measure backed by Sen. Don Harmon, a Democrat from Oak Park. If that bill is passed, gay marriage would go into effect immediately upon Quinn's signature. The measure could be called for a vote when lawmakers return to Springfield in the new year, though they face a light legislative schedule before the March 18 primary election.

Harmon said he's weighing whether it's fair to ask his colleagues to take another tough vote so soon after voting for gay marriage, acknowledging that a later effective date was the trade-off for passing the proposal this fall because a delay in implementation meant just 60 House votes were needed to pass the bill instead of 71.

But Harmon pointed to some gay advocates who died waiting for the right to marry, saying some people who want to take advantage of the new law might not be around in seven months. ""I'd just hate to leave people poised on the precipice of equality be told they can't commit — yet,"" Harmon said.

The lag time did little to dampen spirits Wednesday, as supporters noted just how far Illinois has come in supporting gay rights in a relatively short time.

Casey Cameron, 38, who traveled from St. Elmo in southern Illinois, noted that just eight years ago gay people in Illinois were fighting for basic rights such as equal housing and employment opportunities. ""It took a long time and a very tall mountain to get to that, and to finally see this is quite an amazing bit of accomplishment for the state,"" Cameron said.

The celebratory tone was a marked departure from late May, when the legislation stalled in the House after first passing the Senate on Valentine's Day. Supporters funneled their disappointment into action, launching a summerlong lobbying blitz that was soon buoyed by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down the definition of marriage as between one man and one woman for the purpose of receiving federal benefits.

That helped sway about a dozen lawmakers who spent much of the summer undecided. Another nudge came from powerful House Speaker Michael Madigan, who personally lobbied some members to vote for the bill. Madigan, who represents a Southwest Side district, also is chairman of the state Democratic Party. That means he controls the purse strings to large chests of campaign money that could be vital should one of his members face a primary challenge over their decision to vote in favor of gay marriage."

Law bans discrimination in employment and housing

Some critics say law wasn%27t needed

Only 3 Kentucky cities have adopted similar ordinances

VICCO, Ky. -- Mayor Johnny Cummings answered his cellphone with its insistent air-horn ring tone over and over Wednesday morning, juggling his reading glasses, a takeout coffee cup and a succession of cigarettes.

Cummings' most immediate concern, as he worked out of the brick storefront City Hall, was keeping tabs on the waterworks crew as it switched on pumps to prevent overflows amid a persistent downpour.

But Cummings couldn't avoid the inquiries from the media, both in person and by phone, about how this tiny coal-mining community in Eastern Kentucky's Perry County had become the smallest municipality in America known to have approved an ordinance protecting gays and lesbians from discrimination.

City commissioners voted 3-1 on Monday to approve ordinances banning discrimination, by employers and by sellers and renters of housing, on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, as well as race, religion, age and gender.

Cummings, a fifth-generation resident of Vicco, also finds himself fielding questions about what it's like to be an openly gay mayor in a socially, religiously and politically conservative region of Appalachia.

Cummings sees the Vicco vote as part of a larger effort to revive the city of 334, which has struggled in the more than half-century since the end of its mining boom.

""Kentucky had so many small towns that were just dying and withering away, and Vicco was one of them,"" Cummings said. ""We want to change the reputation of the town. It's always been something that everyone made fun of — just a small, little town, redneck rough and tough.""

Cummings would just as soon talk about other ordinances also passed last Monday — imposing a curfew to reduce loitering and expanding zones where alcohol can be sold, in an effort to attract a restaurant.

Cummings would like to talk about how the city has sharply reduced leaks in its once-porous waterlines, balanced its budget and begun plans for a new park and community center to give young people a positive outlet in a region raked by drug abuse.

But Cummings acknowledges he was pleased that ""the gay mayor and the heterosexual commissioners"" were able to have a lengthy and respectful deliberation before Monday's vote. Part of the debate was whether other city efforts at revitalization would be eclipsed.

""It was just something that was right,"" he said. ""We never thought it would be such a hoopla.""

Was it needed?

Tim Engle, the sole commissioner to vote against the ordinance, said he felt that voting for the measure would amount to endorsing homosexuality.

""I'm a Christian, and I don't believe in that lifestyle,"" he said.

But he also said it wasn't necessary. Nobody is discriminating, he said, saying that in his own music recording and retail business — just around the corner from Cummings' hair salon — ""I'm 100 percent fair with everybody."" And he considers Cummings a friend.

""When my dad died, Johnny was the first one on my mother's doorstep,"" he said.

Truman Hurt, a retired coal miner and a Pentecostal lay preacher living on the outskirts of Vicco, said he hasn't talked to anyone in favor of the measure. Hurt said he disagrees on this issue with liberal activists with whom he has worked for years, attempting to hold coal companies accountable to health and environmental regulations.

""What they're really against is the Bible,"" he said of ordinance proponents, as he sat by his window-lit Bible, open to the book of John.

""I have no problem being fair to people, but this is well beyond fairness,"" he said, saying it supersedes ""the right of a business owner to say no to anyone. That includes me. ... That's what freedom's all about.""

Protection still rare

Until Vicco, only three Kentucky cities — Louisville, Lexington and Covington — had adopted similar ordinances banning discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Henderson repealed a short-lived one in 2001.

The Vicco vote came out of contact between Eastern Kentucky and other statewide gay-rights activists who began promoting such ordinances in nearby Berea and Richmond, said Chris Hartman, spokesman for the Fairness Coalition.

The Kentucky heartland may not seem promising territory for such measures.

Perry County voted for Republican Mitt Romney by a 4-1 margin in the 2012 presidential election, with similarly lopsided results in much of rural Kentucky. A defining issue in the campaign was Democratic President Barack Obama's support for expanded gay rights.

But Hartman said people in many smaller communities ""feel they're already practicing the values a fairness law reflects, and so it's been exciting to hear that over and over."" The ultimate goal, Hartman said, is for a statewide law.

But Martin Cothran, senior policy analyst for the Family Foundation of Kentucky, said there ""doesn't seem to be any kind of epidemic of discrimination"" requiring such laws.

While religious organizations are exempt, he cited the case of a Christian business owner in Lexington who faces a discrimination complaint for refusing to print T-shirts for a gay-advocacy group.

Providing a recourse

But Tony Vaughn, chief of Vicco's one-man police department, said it makes sense to enact such laws to give people a legal recourse if discrimination does occur.

""Until people start stepping up to the plate, there's no action,"" he said, lauding Vicco commissioners for having ""enough brass about them to be on the forefront.""

Cummings said he hopes the measure will project a progressive image to employers that might help revitalize Vicco, which is in a valley between steep cliffs about a dozen miles' drive southeast from the county seat of Hazard.

From the 1930s to 1950s, coal camps dotted the mountainsides and brought thousands to its once-thriving business district to shop, drink, dance and, often, brawl. The city even took its name from a onetime major employer, the Virginia Iron Coal and Coke Co.

But its population is about half what it was at its formal incorporation in 1964, and even then a Courier-Journal profile described many familiar challenges — a need to attract businesses and residents and improve public works.

Now Vicco has a half-dozen businesses — including a bank, music store and Cummings' hair salon — as well as three churches and no stoplights on or near its modest Main Street.

Many locals work outside of town in the coal and health care industries, Cummings said.

The 50-year-old mayor — who traces his local roots to great-great-grandparents who operated a hotel — said that when he was a teenager, ""everyone knew I was gay before I did.""

""There was always some name calling, but not that much,"" he said. ""That's probably the main reason I stayed.""

He spent some time in California and South Carolina, but ""I've always come back."" More than two decades ago, he and a business partner located the Scissors hair salon on Main Street.

Cummings has long been involved in civic activities such as helping organize holiday celebrations, serving on the city commission and getting elected mayor last year.

""I've been told I live in a dream world,"" he added. But, ""I think if you do what you think's right and treat other people fairly, people respect that.""

'I'm all for fairness'

At Your Place restaurant, a home-style diner just up the highway from central Vicco, owner Evalee Bowling said locals are more concerned about the current economic struggles of the coal industry than about the ordinances. But she had no problems with the measures.

""I'm all for fairness,"" she said, adding of gay people, ""If they come in here, I treat them like any other customer.""

Diner patron Russell Akemon of Hazard, who formerly lived near the center of Vicco, said he didn't see the ordinances as controversial.

""I don't think anybody has anything against them,"" he said. ""What they do is their business, I guess. I don't particularly agree with it. That don't make me dislike them."""

If the justices take this case, it will be a defining case on American’s freedom to speak and act according to their religious beliefs when those beliefs include that marriage is between a man and woman.

The case is Elane Photography v. Willock. Elane Huguenin is a photojournalist; she takes pictures to draw a narrative that conveys a story message. She and her husband Jonathan own and operate Elane Photography LLC.

One type of work Elane does is photographing weddings in a way that celebrates marriage. Because the Huguenins are Evangelical Christians, they believe marriage is only the union of a man and woman.

Breitbart News explained the facts and history of this case in a report on Aug. 22. Elane and Jonathan were assessed a fine by the New Mexico Human Rights Commission for declining to photograph a same-sex commitment ceremony. (It’s not a marriage or civil union ceremony, because neither of those were recognized under New Mexico law at the time.)

The New Mexico Supreme Court upheld that penalty, holding that Elane and Jonathan’s religious beliefs must be secondary to the cause of gay equality. As Breitbart News quoted one justice in the court’s opinion, “The Huguenins are free to… pray to the God of their choice… But there is a price, one that we all have to pay somewhere in our civic life.”

On Friday, the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), representing Elane Photography, filed a petition for certiorari at the Supreme Court of the United States, asking SCOTUS to reverse the New Mexico court. ADF specifically challenges the New Mexico ruling for violating the Huguenins’ First Amendment right of free speech, since it compels Elane and Jonathan to convey a message approving of gay marriage which is contrary to the Huguenins’ beliefs.

The petition begins by quoting a recent U.S. Supreme Court case where the justices wrote, “At the heart of the First Amendment lies the principle that each person should decide for himself or herself the ideas and beliefs deserving of expression.”

This means that the government cannot compel a person to say something or convey a message that the person does not actually believe. The petition continues, “The First Amendment right to freedom of speech includes both the right to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking.”

This case is vitally important in that it concerns whether people of faith–especially Christians who believe biblical teachings on marriage and sexuality–can be forced to choose between being true to their beliefs or putting food on their kitchen table by earning a paycheck in their chosen profession. As the petition explains regarding the New Mexico court’s decision:

Such disregard for the constitutional rights of these professionals threatens to drive them from the marketplace. Not only would that limit the expressive options available to the public, it would cost these individuals their livelihoods. Whether the First Amendment permits this result is a question that warrants this Court’s review.

Jordan Lorence is ADF’s lead counsel on this case. The New Mexico court found that Elane Photography is a “public accommodation,” like a restaurant or restroom that could not turn away a black or Hispanic person. Reacting to that declaration, Lorence told Breitbart News in an exclusive statement, “The First Amendment protects all Americans from government coercion forcing them to promote ideas they don’t support. Those in power should not misuse public-accommodation laws to punish those who decline to affirm the prevailing liberal orthodoxy on marriage.”

If the Supreme Court takes this case, it will mark the first time the Court draws the line between the gay-rights agenda and First Amendment rights of free speech and religious liberty–and who wins when those are in conflict.

The Court should vote in January whether to take the case.

They’re small-town people, they said, and planned an intimate, no-frills celebration of their love.

“I intended to tell people, ‘Hey, we’re getting married. Come on down and have dinner,’” Pickel said, laughing. Then, during an interview in his Oklahoma City apartment, his cellphone vibrated: yet another media request. And then came another.

Since word about their upcoming nuptials spread, Pickel and Black Bear have been thrust into the spotlight over one of the most hot-button issues in this state. Gay marriage is banned in Oklahoma, but the men will marry legally under Native American tribal jurisdiction.

Black Bear is a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, based in rural Concho. The joint tribe does not specify gender in its laws regarding marriage, referring to those involved only as “Indians.” Because the tribe is a federally recognized sovereign nation, the state’s ban does not apply.

Black Bear and Pickel, who is not a tribal member, will be eligible for federal benefits made available to married same-sex couples after the Supreme Court struck down part of the Defense of Marriage Act.

Under state law, however, “tribal same-sex weddings are treated the same way as out-of-state same-sex weddings,” Alex Weintz, a spokesman for Republican Gov. Mary Fallin, said in an email. “They are not recognized by the state of Oklahoma.”

In 2004, Oklahomans voted overwhelmingly — 75% to 25% — to approve a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman and making it a misdemeanor to issue a marriage license to a same-sex couple.

Black Bear, 45, and Pickel, 36, had originally planned to travel to Iowa this fall to get married. They have been a couple for nearly nine years and have “been through all the trials” and “have always stuck together,” Black Bear said.

Planning a trip to Iowa, however, proved difficult with their busy schedules. Black Bear works as a floral supervisor in Oklahoma City, and Pickel is working on an undergraduate degree in mortuary science while doing a funeral home apprenticeship.

Pickel decided to call his tribe about a marriage license, even though he expected to be turned down.

A clerk told them all they needed was $20 and a few forms of identification. They got their license in Concho on Oct. 18, said Pickel, who will change his last name to Black Bear.

They hadn’t planned to publicize their engagement. They mentioned it on Facebook, and word spread further when tribal and mainstream newspapers wrote about the couple.

Last week they were still unpacking boxes in their new Oklahoma City apartment a few weeks after their old apartment building burned in a fire. Pickel said their new neighbors are probably wondering why news trucks have been parked outside.

The upcoming marriage has focused attention on the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribe, which has about 12,000 members. The tribe has quietly married two other gay couples since December, said Lisa Liebl, a spokeswoman.

Not all tribes allow gay marriage. Some, such as the Osage Nation and the Cherokee Nation, have laws banning same-sex marriage.

On Friday, about three dozen tribal members attended a hastily called meeting in the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribal Administration Center in Concho.

Ida Hoffman, the tribe’s chief of staff, called the meeting to make a personal statement against the marriages. Pickel sat in the front row, wearing a small rainbow-colored ribbon on his chest.

“These men are receiving their 15 minutes of fame to the detriment of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes as a sovereign nation,” Hoffman said.

The tribe should get the chance to vote on the issue, Hoffman said, adding, “My plan is to make sure it is prohibited in the future.”

In an impassioned and sometimes tearful response to Hoffman’s statements, Frances Wise, 28, said she was a proud member of the gay community. Native people have long accepted gay people, who were called “two-spirited people,” she said. That respect shouldn’t change because they wanted their relationships validated by marriage, Wise said.

“Hating someone because they have a different sexual preference is like hating someone because they have brown eyes or because they have brown skin,” she said. “That’s something they can’t help.”

Pickel said he and Black Bear did not intend to “bring any negative light to the tribe” and that they had received love and support from tribal members.

Ramona Tall Bear, a legislative clerk for the tribe, said she thought the issue of marriage should go to a vote by tribal members because it dealt with a legal code. But the tribe has always been accepting of gay people, she said.

“My mother always said to treat them with more respect because their lives are so hard,” Tall Bear said.

Hiram Prairie Chief and his husband, Fritz Prairie Chief, sat quietly in the back of the room during the meeting. They were the first gay couple to be issued a marriage license by the tribe and were married in a small ceremony in December.

Hiram Prairie Chief says they are involved with the tribe and serve on powwow committees. They have never received negative comments about their marriage, he said.

“We don’t hide it,” he said.

Pickel and Black Bear plan to get married Thursday on tribal land. They will wear khaki pants and black shirts, and they are writing their own vows. Black Bear’s father, the Rev. Floyd Black Bear, a former tribal council member, will officiate.

They ended up sending more than 100 invitations, including one to Fallin. The governor, they said, politely declined.

The brief comes as the White House is considering whether to weigh in on the same-sex marriage case; at this point, the Republicans who signed the document are taking a more expansive stance than President Obama, who favors same-sex marriage but has said he would leave it to the states, as opposed to making it a constitutional right.

The list of Republicans on the brief now tallies more than 100, organizers say. It now includes Beth Myers, who ran Mr. Romney’s 2008 campaign and was a senior adviser to him in 2012; Charles Bass, a former member of Congress from New Hampshire; and Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist who advised Senator John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign. Also on the list is B. J. Nikkel, who made national news last year when she became the only Republican on the Colorado House Judiciary Committee to vote in favor of same-sex civil unions. She previously worked as district director for Representative Marilyn Musgrave, a former congresswoman whose signature issue in Washington was banning same-sex marriage.

The brief, organized by Ken Mehlman, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee who is gay, will be filed on Thursday as a friend-of-the-court, or amicus, brief to a lawsuit that seeks to overturn Proposition 8, a California ballot initiative that forbids same-sex marriage, and all similar bans. The landmark case will be heard alongside a request that the court overturn the 1996 federal Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage for the purposes of federal law as the union between a man and a woman."

The proposal, which would continue to bar homosexual men from serving as Scout leaders, will be voted on at a May meeting of the organization’s national council, Scouting officials said.

“We believe the BSA can no longer sacrifice its mission, or the youth served by the movement, by allowing the organization to be consumed by a single, controversial, and unresolved societal issue,” national president Wayne Perry said in a statement announcing the proposal.

The proposed resolution states, “No youth may be denied membership in the Boy Scouts of America on the basis of sexual orientation or preference alone.”

The proposal comes after months of intense pressure from both within and outside the organization, which has shown signs of confusion and division within its leadership.

Supporters of lifting the ban include several prominent Scouting board members, corporate funders, President Obama and his Republican challenger in last year’s election Mitt Romney, several U.S. senators, New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and others. Petitions purportedly bearing 1.4 million signatures were presented at Scouting headquarters in Texas.

But the ban retained strong backing among important Scouting constituencies, including the Southern Baptist Convention and conservative groups like the Family Research Council.

Last July, Scouting officials announced that after a two-year confidential review the organization had decided to keep the no-gays policy, which is essentially “don’t ask, don’t tell.”

Experts at the time said the decision reflected the conservative values of many members, as well as the influence of the Roman Catholic and Mormon churches.

But in late January, word leaked out that the organization might retreat from that position and allow local groups to decide.

“The policy change under discussion would allow the religious, civic or educational organizations that oversee and deliver Scouting to determine how to address this issue,” spokesman Deron Smith said at the time.

A week later, however, the Scouts’ national board, buffeted by the furor that had erupted around the proposal, postponed a vote until its meeting in May.

In the months since, Scouting has conducted what it calls “the most comprehensive listening exercise in its history,” holding more than 250 town-hall meetings across the country and polling more than 1 million members, Friday’s statement said.

Scouting’s members remain deeply divided on the issue, and the proposed policy is an effort to find a middle ground by allowing gay youths to participate while upholding the ban on gay adults.

“America needs Scouting, and our policies must be based on what is in the best interest of our kids,” said Perry. “We believe good people can disagree and still work together to accomplish great things for youth.”

The House had been considered the measure’s toughest hurdle. The bill passed 75 to 59 and heads to the state’s Democratic-majority Senate, which is expected to consider it Monday.

Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, has said he will sign the measure.

Eleven states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriage -- including Delaware, which acted Tuesday. Minnesota would be the first Midwestern state to legalize it with legislation. Gay marriage is legal in Iowa because of a 2009 state Supreme Court decision.

TIMELINE: Gay marriage through the years

Minnesota, like Iowa, harbors a Midwestern progressive streak. (The state’s Democratic Party is formally known as the Democratic Farmer Labor Party.) But Thursday’s vote marked a stark reversal from 2011, when -- after a wrenching and emotional debate -- state legislators voted to put a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage on last November’s ballot.

Voters rejected that amendment last year, and same-sex marriage supporters saw an opportunity.

State law bars Minnesota’s government from recognizing same-sex marriages performed in other states. The current bill eliminates that provision and allows civil marriages between same-sex couples. In a nod to conservatives, churches could not be sued if they refused to perform such marriages.

“This isn’t about bigotry, as several people have mentioned,” the bill’s Democratic sponsor, Rep. Karen Clark, said during debate. “This is about honoring difference.… I hope I’ve done a good job of really honoring and respecting the need for people who have a religious objection to marriage between people [of the same sex],” said Clark, who is gay.

Four of the House’s 61 Republicans bucked the party line to vote for the bill, and some of the measure’s foes were circumspect about their opposition.

FULL COVERAGE: Battle over gay marriage

“I do believe that marriage should be between one man and one woman,” said Republican Rep. Jim Abeler, who voted against the bill. “Not all of us in this room or in this capital or this state agree. That’s OK.”

Republican Rep. Tony Cornish was more blunt. “I am not a homophobe or a Neanderthal or a hater -- none of those definitions,” Cornish said. “The reasons ... that I’m voting no -- the basic one is my constituents back home. The majority of them wanted me to vote that way.”

Democratic Rep. Tim Faust gave a short homily on liberty and the separation of church and state on his way to a “yes” vote.

“Ninety-nine-point-nine percent of the time, the people that are opposed to gay marriage, at some point in their discussion, they always say, ‘My Bible says,’” Faust said, adding, “The question that keeps going through my mind over and over again is, do we as a society have the right to impose our religious beliefs on somebody else?”

Democratic Rep. Joe Mullery said of the measure, “If you support equality today, I think you’ll be proud of it for the rest of your life.”

Then he voted yes.

That Depends,"By most measures, it's never been a better time to be gay. But all the encouraging steps toward a more accepting America may not mean much when you're called ""faggot"", and slammed into a locker.

Polling shows that America has never been on better terms with sexual diversity -- from equal economic rights to gay marriage to the belief that gay issues will one day be non-issues. In younger demographics, we're already there. A recent Gallup-USA Today poll showed that among those 18 to 29, 73 percent are fine with same-sex marriage.

The same poll showed that people who identify as gay, lesbian or transgender, are more optimistic than ever. Three out of four said they were generally out with others, and nine in ten said their communities have become more accepting.

The media's LGBT portrayal has gone from invisible to mainstream. Gay couple Cam and Mitchell are the affectionately hilarious heart of TV's Modern Family. Neil Patrick Harris is an openly gay man, who plays a ladies' man, for an audience that doesn't care. How I Met Your Mother was just renewed for a ninth season.

The last election deepened the twilight of the day when gay marriage (or gay anything) could bring out the conservative electorate. On gay issues, the religious right finds itself a drum line in search of a lost parade.

But does tolerance trickle down? What does statistical and prime-time acceptance mean in the unforgiving halls of an average junior high?

Journalist and activist Dan Savage -- whose It Gets Better LGBT suicide prevention project has literally saved lives -- calls these days of dawning sexual enlightenment ""the best of times and the worst of times.""

For those with accepting families, progressive communities, and determined school support, LGBT life -- indeed -- has never been better. For others, it can actually be tougher than the days of closeted anonymity. Seeing validation and acceptance in the media, while experiencing rejection and bullying in life can be especially isolating. If the world is OK with being gay; why isn't it OK with me?

Both straight and gay students say being called ""gay"" is the single worst form of harassment. Gay students hear anti-gay slurs as often as 26 times a day. LGBT students are three times as likely as non-LGBT students to say they don't feel safe at school. Some 90 percent of them report being harassed or assaulted in the past year.

School days can be harrowing for anyone who is different: too short, too heavy, too skinny, too shy, too anything that puts them in the sights of the predators inevitably drawn to the social stragglers. Multiply that by the pain experienced by a child whose difference - real or perceived -- crosses into the perilous territory of sexual identity, and different can take on life-altering dimensions.

There is a clear connection between childhood bullying and self-esteem. The consequences are measured in depression, self-loathing (maybe they're right about me), anger, hopelessness and -- tragically -- suicide. Although factors other than sexuality are certainly involved, LGBT students are four times more likely than hetero students to take their own lives.

True, the worst of the harassment tends to be a point in time. A seven year study of U.K. teens, by educational psychology professor Joseph Robinson, University of Illinois, Urbana- Champagne, published in the current issue of Pediatrics, reports that LGBT bullying goes down with age. More than 50 percent of gay and bisexual boys were bullied at ages 13-14, versus only 6 percent at ages 18-20. That implies that bullies grow out of it, or that older youth can simply avoid them. Probably both.

The vulnerable years may be few. But in those years: What cues are delivered? What life lessons are taught? What beliefs are shaped about personal value and place in the world?

Yes, things are getting better. But the emotional wilds of an average middle, junior and even high school are never going to be as welcoming as polls and sitcom plot lines would have us believe. It's a mistake to confuse progress with solution. Bullying is real, it leaves scars, and we still have a long way to go.

Just ask a ""faggot"" -- as he picks his books up off the floor."

USA TODAY

The Duck Dynasty family issued a statement Thursday evening supporting patriarch Phil Robertson and throwing the future of their successful hit reality show into jeopardy.

The A&E cable channel has put patriarch Phil Robertson, 67, on ""indefinite"" hiatus from filming after anti-gay remarks he made in the January issue of GQ erupted into debate about free speech.

Now the clan is thanking fans for their support, but isn't happy about the cable channel's decision.

""The family has spent much time in prayer since learning of A&E's decision. We want you to know that first and foremost we are a family rooted in our faith in God and our belief that the Bible is His word. While some of Phil's unfiltered comments to the reporter were coarse, his beliefs are grounded in the teachings of the Bible,"" the statement says.

""Phil is a Godly man who follows what the Bible says are the greatest commandments: 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart' and 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' Phil would never incite or encourage hate. We are disappointed that Phil has been placed on hiatus for expressing his faith, which is his constitutionally protected right.""

And finally, the family says, ""We have had a successful working relationship with A&E but, as a family, we cannot imagine the show going forward without our patriarch at the helm. We are in discussions with A&E to see what that means for the future of Duck Dynasty. Again, thank you for your continued support of our family.""

Season 5 of the series is set to debut Jan. 15. Filming has finished and Robertson is featured in the 10 episodes. The Season 4 debut, which pulled in 11.8 million viewers in August, set a record for the cable channel."

Utah has Upset the Supreme Court's Applecart,"First, we have Professor Michael Dorf from Cornell Law School:

“If the court thought it was going to get a few years, I think they were naïve.”

Professor Dorf said there are probably not five votes on the Supreme Court to block Judge Shelby’s ruling. “On the strictly legal argument,” he said, “it’s hard to justify granting a stay.” But he added that the lower courts should have done so, partly because of the potential cruelty of voiding the new marriages and partly because the Supreme Court is hard to predict. “It’s pretty clear that even the five justices who are sympathetic to same-sex marriage would rather take a few years before getting there,” Professor Dorf wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. “If their hand is forced, as it now will be, it’s impossible to say with certainty what they’ll do.”

Dorf, of course, thinks that the lower court and the 10th Circuit should have issued a stay. Now that several hundred couples have been married in Utah, that seems more moot than the several hundred couples San Francisco married in 2004.""Would rather."" What a pity they're being rushed. Liptak doesn't see this as an issue for this term, but sees it for the session that begins in October 2015 (which is what I've been saying) by which time that will be several thousand couples in Utah, not several hundred, and several hundred, no doubt, in Idaho and Colorado and Wyoming because Utah is closer than, say, New Mexico or Iowa.

And, yes, Liptak points out that the Utah decision was based on a sentence in Scalia's dissent on the Windsor case

“The view that this court will take of state prohibition of same-sex marriage is indicated beyond mistaking by today’s opinion”

did not impress Jason Mazzone, a law professor at the University of Illinois. “His opinion would have appeared considerably more judicial had he resisted the urge to give Justice Scalia the finger,” Professor Mazzone wrote in a blog post last Friday.

as GrafZeppelin127 and Kalil pointed out here when the decision was published, a gesture, that, as Liptak reports,Well, okay!

But Michael Klarman, a historian at Harvard Law School, now thinks two to six years, even with the current composition of the court. He doesn't think it's open-ended any more.

So, Utah has set the wheels in motion for the endgame. Illinois, Oregon and New Jersey are in the pipeline now. Historically, this is a QUICK process, as we remember that Prop 8 was only five years ago. Of course, the Supreme Court COULD have done this sooner by accepting the Ninth Circuit's decision on Prop 8, a decision that is now lost to them, but I think I can wait a couple of years.

Now, our task is to change the composition of the House so we can get ENDA passed and signed."

WASHINGTON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Some U.S. business interests intend to signal support for gay marriage by signing on to two briefs due to be filed this week with the U.S. Supreme Court, according to lawyers involved in the process who argue that gay rights are good for business.

Various companies are set to join separate friend-of-the-court briefs, one expected on Wednesday in a case challenging the federal Defense of Marriage Act and one due on Thursday in a case that questions a California law that banned gay marriage.

Major companies are to urge the court to invalidate Proposition 8, the California law in question, and strike down Section 3 of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as between one man and one woman.

The brief to be filed in the Proposition 8 case, a draft of which was obtained by Reuters, has been joined by such companies as Apple Inc, Nike Inc, Facebook Inc, Morgan Stanley, Intel Corp, Xerox Corp, AIG Inc and Cisco Systems Inc.

The two cases are to be argued on March 26 and 27.

In briefs already filed in support of marriage being restricted to heterosexual unions, business interests have not been represented. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has not taken a position on the issue.

Lawyers at the Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe law firm, which is handling the Proposition 8 brief, said more names could be added to the list before it is filed on Thursday.

In the DOMA case, a source close to the case said a similar brief with more than 250 signatories is due to be filed with the Supreme Court on Wednesday.

In the Proposition 8 brief, attorney Joshua Rosenkranz wrote that companies believe that the ban and other laws like it ""inflict real and wholly unnecessary injury on business.""

""By marginalizing same-sex couples and foreclosing gay men and lesbians from forming 'married' families, these bans on equal access to marriage stigmatize gay men and lesbians and deprive them of the benefits intrinsic to marriage,"" he added.

Even if a corporation welcomes gay and lesbian unions, ""it cannot overcome the societal stigma institutionalized by Proposition 8 and similar laws,"" Rosenkranz wrote.

He also made the argument that there is ""a strong business case"" for recognizing same-sex marriage. Gay marriage bans ""can impede business efforts to recruit, hire and retain the best workers,"" he added."

When it was announced four days later after a long holiday weekend, the gay legal establishment responded with open dismay, fearing the risk from a case that could lead to an unfavorable ruling in the U.S. Supreme Court.

With the Supreme Court poised to render a ruling this week that is widely expected to strike a blow against Proposition 8 and perhaps overturn it outright, Chad Griffin, the onetime Los Angeles political consultant and public relations man who dared to bring the lawsuit, has become a major player in Washington, regarded with grudging respect by his former adversaries and hailed as a visionary by his friends.

“No matter what happens in the decision, Chad will be known as a historic figure in the fight for equality because he pushed the envelope,” said Dan Pfeiffer, senior advisor to President Obama and a former Georgetown University roommate of Griffin’s.

“The legal and political people thought Chad was moving too fast, but actually he saw where the country was going and what was possible before anyone else.”

With same-sex marriage legal in 12 states and public opinion solidly in favor, it is easy to forget the pessimism that prevailed among many supporters after Proposition 8 passed in California in November 2008.

Advertisement

At the time the suit was filed, three states allowed same-sex marriage; 44 banned it. Public opinion was hard against it. Influential religious groups, including the Mormon and Roman Catholic churches, had helped lead the opposition. Even President Obama was not in favor.

Prominent people from gay legal groups called Griffin’s suit “risky and premature,” “an attempt to short-circuit the process,” and an effort that would “likely set us all back.”

Advertisement

“There were a number of legal advocates who thought it was too soon to go to the Supreme Court,” said Jon Davidson, legal director at Lambda Legal, the largest gay legal group, which opposed filing the suit. “Most people watching the court thought it was going to be an uphill battle to strike down marriage laws of more than 30 states.”

Griffin was hardly a figure to inspire confidence in the halls of justice. Then 35, he had not worked primarily on gay issues. He had come out as a gay man only eight years earlier. He was not a lawyer, but a consultant in his own firm who specialized in high-profile Hollywood clients. He was an unknown to much of the gay and civil liberties legal establishment.

But Griffin had learned his way around political campaigns at the highest levels. Born in Hope, Ark., the hometown of Bill Clinton, he was barely old enough to vote when he walked into Clinton’s 1992 campaign headquarters in Little Rock and volunteered in the press office.

“He was the kind of intern who would not only do what you asked, he would do something else,” recalled Dee Dee Myers, who became Clinton’s White House press secretary. “As sometimes happens in campaigns, we piled more and more responsibility on him.”

Advertisement

When Clinton moved to the White House, Myers took Griffin with her, with the understanding that in a couple of years he would quit and start college. The 19-year-old became what officials referred to as the youngest presidential aide in history.

At the White House he met Rob Reiner, and after Georgetown, Reiner brought Griffin to Los Angeles to run his charitable foundation and manage a series of political campaigns, including successful ballot initiatives for children’s healthcare and stem cell research. He bought a house in Los Feliz. He was brought in at the last minute to help oppose Proposition 8, but it was too late.

Advertisement

The idea to file the lawsuit was the product of an accidental meeting at the Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Griffin was having lunch with Reiner, Reiner’s wife and Griffin’s business partner when a former journalist and friend of the Reiners’, Kate Moulene, stopped by and suggested they hire her former brother-in-law, Theodore Olson, to challenge Proposition 8 in court.

Hiring Olson seemed like a radical idea. He had been President George W. Bush’s solicitor general and had represented President Reagan both in the Justice Department and personally. He was a committed member of the conservative movement involved in the legal effort to impeach Clinton. He had argued and won Bush vs. Gore, which resolved the 2000 election, in the Supreme Court.

Advertisement

But as Moulene knew, Olson was committed to individual liberties. From a public relations standpoint, his involvement would be a coup. From a legal standpoint, few people had argued more cases at the high court.

In the months after filing the suit, Griffin was under what one colleague called “a white-hot spotlight.” Some liberals mistrusted Olson’s motives. Not trusting Olson and Griffin to handle the suit by themselves, three groups attempted to intervene, which would have given them a measure of control.

Advertisement

Griffin was outraged. He wrote a letter denouncing the would-be interveners, accusing them of trying to undermine the case, and released it publicly. They expressed shock.

Griffin defended his decision and the letter with an eye to history.

“If you just look through the history of time, there’s always reason to wait,” he said in his Washington office.

“There’s always someone who wants to slow down. At the same time there are real live people who provide that sense of urgency about why we can’t wait. And we had the best lawyers, the right strategy and the right plaintiffs.”

Advertisement

Part of that strategy was to combine Olson with his Democratic opponent in Bush vs. Gore, David Boies. That combination attracted major donors to support the lawsuit.

“Chad had essentially found a way to take two of the most powerful legal minds in the country — who had often been at odds — together, and that was such a seismically different way of approaching this issue,” said producer and director J.J. Abrams, one of the key backers of the lawsuit. “I just thought it spoke to his boldness and his willingness to think out of the box to get what needs to be done done.”

Mr. Obama’s campaign apparatus has transformed itself into a nonprofit political group, though it said it would disclose the names of its donors (and it is not getting involved in the Hagel fight).

After Mr. Obama won re-election in November and Democrats kept their majority in the Senate and made inroads in the House, Republican Party officials and senior strategists with conservative outside groups predicted that some of the big financiers of the larger outside efforts would pull back and reassess their involvement and whether their millions were wasted. But while the donors have said they will insist that the groups they finance find lessons in last year’s losses, their interest and stakes in what happens in Washington have certainly not waned.

For instance, the biggest individual financier of the so-called super PACs that sought to defeat Mr. Obama, Sheldon Adelson, is so invested in the fight over Mr. Hagel that he has reached out directly to Republican Senators to urge them to hold the line against his confirmation, which would be almost impossible to stop against six Republican “yes” votes and a unified Democratic caucus.

Given the more than $100 million he donated to the anti-Obama effort last year, no lawmakers need to be reminded of his importance to their future endeavors. People briefed on his involvement said Mr. Adelson, chairman of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation and a longtime supporter of Israel, was calling in conjunction with the Republican Jewish Coalition, a group he has financed for several years.

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal in December, Mr. Adelson said he was prepared to “double” his investment in politics in the coming year.

But it is unclear whether he is directly financing any of the anti-Hagel advertising. An associate of his, speaking about Mr. Adelson’s thinking on condition of anonymity, said he did not believe that expensive television campaigns are the answer to every political push given that Mr. Obama’s re-election team accomplished so much of its success through online and volunteer efforts.

Image The last major cabinet skirmish, over President George W. Bush's nomination of John R. Bolton as the United States ambassador to the United Nations, had no comparable outside media campaign.

Citing similar reasons, another major Republican donor, Foster Friess, said in an interview that he had developed his own skepticism over “the whole idea of these multimedia ads from 45,000 feet.” After last year’s losses he said he was devoting most of his resources to an effort he called “Left-Right, Left-Right Forward March,” which finds projects liberals and conservatives can support together, like water purification in developing countries."

Dayna Morales, a 22-year-old former Marine, claimed last month that a family of four who racked up a $93.55 bill at the Gallop Asian Bistro in Branchburg, N.J., left her no tip, only a note saying they couldn’t leave any extra cash for her service because they “do not agree with your lifestyle.”

Morales quickly emailed the story to a gay advocacy website and later posted a photograph of the purported check on her Facebook page. The alleged incident made national headlines and resulted in thousands of dollars being donated to Morales, who said she would send all proceeds to the Wounded Warrior Project.

NBCNewYork.com reported Friday that three people who sent money to a PayPal account set up in her name say their donations were refunded. One of her supporters, Brittney Stilgenbauer of Tuscon, Ariz., said she felt bad about the situation.

""I felt awful for her, and I thought it would be great if people could come together and donate a dollar each and make up for her tip that she lost,"" said Stilgenbauer, who encouraged Morales to set up a PayPal account to accept donations.

At least one man who sent cash to Morales at the restaurant told NBCNewYork.com he has not gotten the money back. Morales did not respond to requests for comment from the station.

Meanwhile, a representative of the Florida-based Wounded Warrior Project could not confirm Morales had made any donations as of Wednesday, Bridgewater Patch reported.

A representative for the nonprofit group that caters to veterans returning from overseas checked for donations by Morales’ name and within the ZIP codes for Bridgewater, N.J., where she worked, and Bedminster, where Morales said she lives, and was unable to locate any correlating donations. The donations may have been made from a different ZIP code or by a third-party, the representative told the website.

Morales, who served in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve from July 2009 through May 2013 in Newburgh, N.Y., as an administrative specialist, could not be reached for comment. Restaurant manager Byron Lapola told NJ.com earlier this week that she remains off the schedule, at least temporarily.

“We’re still waiting for the owners to finish their investigation,” Lapola told the website. “It’s pretty complex, so until then we’re restraining comment.”

The couple accused of leaving the note for Morales has since denied doing so, telling NBC 4 New York they did in fact leave an $18 tip on the $93 bill. The unidentified couple also provided the station a credit card statement that indicated the tip, according to the report.

NBC News has also reported that a Pentagon source said Morales was dismissed from the Marine Reserve Corps in May because she was not attending drills and that she was discharged under “less than honorable” conditions.

Several of Morales’ acquaintances also since questioned her credibility. Kristina Calamusa, who described herself as a former friend of Morales, told The Daily Caller late last month that the waitress claimed to her that she was “blown up by a land mine overseas.”

But, according to Calamusa, that story was false; Morales was never on active duty. The Journal News of White Plains, N.Y., has also quoted acquaintances of Morales who say she lied about her military service.

Julie Howat and Karolee Larkin, both 23, related to the newspaper a story Morales supposedly told them about her serving in Afghanistan and surviving an explosion that killed everyone in her platoon, leaving her as the unit’s sole survivor. But Maj. Shawn Haney, a spokesman for the Marines, said in an email to The Journal News that while Morales did serve in the Marines Corps reserve from July 2009 to May 2013, there’s no indication in her record of combat service in Afghanistan or Iraq.

“While (Morales) did not fulfill her reserve obligation, per the Privacy Act, administrative actions are not releasable,” Haney said. “The same applies to character of service and type of discharge.”

http://news.yahoo.com/couples-seek-ruling-illinois-gay-marriage-case-181308092.html,,[],Couples seek ruling in Illinois gay marriage case,"CHICAGO (AP) — Twenty-five couples who filed a lawsuit challenging Illinois' ban on gay marriage asked a judge on Wednesday to rule quickly in their favor, saying a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision striking down part of a law denying federal benefits to married gay couples creates a new urgency in the state.

Illinois legalized civil unions two years ago, but the recent Supreme Court decision applies only to married gay couples.

Lambda Legal and the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois filed a motion for summary judgment in Cook County Circuit Court. They said Judge Sophia Hall could rule on the motion as soon as Aug. 6, when oral arguments are scheduled on a defense motion to dismiss the lawsuit.

""We will say that we should win as a matter of law"" under the state constitution, said Camilla Taylor, Lambda Legal's marriage project director. ""Illinois now is the only thing standing between these families and numerous federal rights.""

A lawyer representing five downstate county clerks — who are defending the ban after the state attorney general and Cook County prosecutor refused to do so — said the request is premature because all the evidence has not yet been presented. He also complained that the plaintiffs took nine months to respond to the motion to dismiss the case.

""For them to come in (now) ... has me wondering if they're particularly confident of their legal position as a matter of law,"" said Peter Breen, executive director of the Thomas More Society, a public interest law firm that opposes gay marriage.

Wednesday's motion comes a day after civil rights lawyers in Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to overturn that state's 17-year-old ban on same-sex marriage and to force the state to recognize the marriages of same-sex couples who wed in other jurisdictions.

Same-sex marriage is legal, or soon will be, in 13 states. Federal courts in California are so far the only ones that have said a state same-sex marriage ban violates the U.S. Constitution. Meanwhile, federal court challenges are emerging in other states, including Nevada, Hawaii and Michigan. In the coming days and weeks, the ACLU plans to lodge same-sex marriage challenges in North Carolina and Virginia.

Story continues

It also is pursuing same-sex marriage legislation in several other states and referenda in Oregon and Nevada in the coming years, ACLU lawyers said.

Illinois' lawsuit was filed last year against Cook County Clerk David Orr, a supporter of gay marriage whose office is responsible for issuing marriage licenses in Chicago and the rest of the county. All plaintiffs had applied for and been denied marriage licenses in Cook County.

But in an unusual move, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan and Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez declined to defend the state's 17-year-old ban, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman, saying it violates the state constitution's equal protection clause. The downstate clerks later were granted permission to intervene.

Alvarez said it was her job to represent Orr, and they both agreed with the plaintiffs. Madigan said she would file arguments in support of the plaintiffs.

John Knight, director of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Project of the ACLU of Illinois, said only marriage will ensure that gay couples in Illinois get protections that other married couples enjoy, including family medical leave and veterans and tax benefits.

James Darby, an 81-year-old Korean War veteran, said he wants to be buried in Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery in Illinois, along with his partner of 50 years, Patrick Bova, 75. But as of now, that's impossible.

""I gave up four years of my life during the Korean War, I served my country ... and I came back home and expected to have the same rights as everyone else,"" said Darby. ""But I'm considered a second-class citizen in my own state.""

Bova said he's ""looking forward to the time when our marriage and its practical and emotional aspects will be realized. I think 50 years is a long time to wait.""

The Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office sting was revealed on Saturday by the Baton Rouge Advocate, which investigated the arrests of at least a dozen Louisiana gay men since 2011 who agreed to consensual gay sex with undercover officers. In all of the cases, the men were arrested under the state's anti-sodomy law, which was struck down as unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2003 ruling in Lawrence v. Texas.

Technically invalid yet still on the books, the state's ""Crime Against Nature"" law prohibits “unnatural carnal copulation by a human being with another of the same-sex or opposite-sex or with an animal” along with “solicitation by a human being of another with the intent to engage in any unnatural carnal copulation for compensation,” according to Louisiana legislature.

“This is a law that is currently on the Louisiana books, and the sheriff is charged with enforcing the laws passed by our Louisiana Legislature,” Casey Rayborn Hicks, a Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman, told the Baton Rouge Advocate. “Whether the law is valid is something for the courts to determine, but the sheriff will enforce the laws that are enacted.”

However, the Advocate also revealed that none of these cases had been prosecuted by District Attorney Hillar Moore III, whose office could find no evidence of any crime being committed by any of the arrested men.

While Hicks argued that the fact that the men agreed to sex in a public park made their actions illegal, Equality Louisiana’s Bruce Parker told MSNBC.com that this claim carried little legitimacy as no sex ever actually happened in the park and most of the men intended to have sex at a private residence.

“They started a conversation and the officer invited him back,"" Parker said. ""That’s a conversation that could happen anywhere. It’s the equivalent of me asking you out in a Post Office.”

As outrage from advocates for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community grew over the weekend, the East Baton Rouge Sheriff’s Office posted two statement on its Facebook page. The first was a defense of the policy, which claimed that department was not trying to target or embarrass any particular community.

""When we receive calls from the public about lewd activity near our children, we have to respond,"" the statement reads. ""Our park operations, conducted at the specific request of the BREC Park’s Ranger, were an attempt to deter or stop lewd activity occurring in the park near children... The deputies used a statute that they felt fit the situation in order to remedy the concerns of the parents and park officials.""

However, one hour and several Facebook comments later the department posted a second, more conciliatory status:

The goal of our statement was to express our intent to the public, which was to keep the parks safe. We admit, however, the approach needs to change. We are not making excuses, simply stating we will learn from this, make changes and move forward. We will be working with all branches of government to find a better solution for keeping our parks safe. Thanks to all for their input.

While it appears that law enforcement in Louisiana may be rethinking any further application of the anti-sodomy statutes, ThinkProgress notes that similar laws remain on the books in over a dozen other states. In fact, two years ago a Michigan sheriff’s office was revealed to be executing similar stings against gay men in the area.

UPDATE on July 29 at 2:45pm ET: The East Baton Rouge Parish sheriff’s office has released a statement with an apology which note, ""While sections of La. R.S. 14:89, Crimes Against Nature, have not been removed from the Louisianalaw code, they have been deemed unenforceable and unconstitutional. The Sheriff’s Office will not use these unconstitutional sections of the law in future cases."" Read more at The New Civil Rights Movement."

Sandy Rios, American Family Association talk show host and Fox News contributor, broached the topic of same-sex marriage while speaking with Chicago anti-gay pastor Erwin Lutzer last week, Right Wing Watch notes. Lutzer said one opposition against same-sex marriage is that the city's crime is bad enough and they don't need the ""destruction of marriage"" as well.

The two also agreed that love shouldn't be reason enough to allow same-sex couples to marry.

""A pedophile I'm sure says that he loves children -- as a matter of fact, he does -- but you can see how destructive that love is,"" Lutzer said. ""Once love is undefined as kind of this 'I want to do this and so I'm loving' then, of course, we end up where we are ending up today with a great slide in morality, the destruction of the family, the confusion that children grow up with. All of these implications...""

""You know, the gentleman that was just sentenced yesterday for holding those women hostage in Ohio, and molesting them for years, and doing terrible things to them,"" Rios continued, ""His defense was that he ‘loved’ his family, he ‘loved’ his child that was born out of one of the rapes that he did of the woman. He ‘loved’ and he couldn’t understand. He said, ‘I’m not a monster.’”



Rios was referring to Castro, a kidnapper and rapist who kept victims Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus captive in his Cleveland home for a decade. Castro pleaded guilty to 937 counts last week, including murder and kidnapping, and was sentenced to life plus 1,000 years in prison. During the Aug. 1 hearing, he claimed “most of the sex that went on in that house, probably all of it, was consensual.” He also denied being a monster, saying he ""simply kept them [in his house] without them being able to leave.”

David Badash of the New Civil Rights Movement called Rios' comments both ""offensive and ludicrous.""

""If you feel respectfully that you can get a higher return [than] the 38% you got last year, it's a free country,"" said Schultz, during the annual shareholders meeting on March 21. ""You could sell your shares at Starbucks and buy shares in other companies.""

In January 2012, Starbucks joined Microsoft (MSFT) and Nike (NKE) in announcing support of a Washington state bill to legalize same-sex marriage, which ultimately passed.

In March 2012, the National Organization for Marriage instituted a ""Dump Starbucks"" boycott because of the company's support of gay marriage. Investor-analyst Tom Stauber attributed his disappointment in Starbucks (SBUX) stock to this boycott, according to the shareholders' meeting transcript.

""It's my understanding, something like tens of thousands of people signed on this particular boycott,"" said Stauber. ""And then the [first quarter] after this boycott was announced, our sales and our earnings ... were [a] bit disappointing.""

Starbucks stock and dividends rose 7.6% from March 2012 to March 2013. (The 38% to which Schultz referred was for fiscal year 2012: From October 2011 to September 2012.)

Stauber complained that Starbucks' stock price had underperformed the S&P 500 over the last year.

""Until January a year ago, we existed without making gay marriage a core value of our company,"" said Stauber. ""Hence we did quite well.""

The National Organization for Marriage did not return a call from CNNMoney, but its website says more than 56,000 people have joined its boycott.

Starbucks has long been a supporter of same-sex marriage. In 2011, the company was among a group of 70 businesses and organizations that filed a brief in federal court opposing the Defense of Marriage Act, which restricts the definition of marriage to that between a man and a woman. The Supreme Court will hear arguments as to the legality of DOMA on Wednesday.

During the shareholders' meeting, Schultz emphasized that Starbucks employs more than 200,000 people and ""we want to embrace diversity of all kinds.""

Asbury Park (N.J.) Press

N.J. Supreme Court refuses to allow stay in same-sex marriage case

Court will rule later whether the state should allow gay marriages permanently

Thirteen states%2C many in the Northeast%2C now recognize gay marriage.

TRENTON -- Gay couples in New Jersey will be able to marry starting Monday.

The state Supreme Court Friday turned down Republican Gov. Chris Christie's administration request to delay same-sex marriages, clearing the way for the weddings to begin Oct. 21.

A lower-court judge had earlier ruled that same-sex weddings must be allowed starting Monday, and the administration requested a stay.

The Christie administration has also appealed a lower court decision that the state should allow same-sex marriages, and the high court is expected to hear arguments and render a decision on the broader issue over the next three months.

The ruling by the justices against the motion was unanimous, a sign that the administration's prospects for the full appeal are bleak.

""The State has advanced a number of arguments, but none of them overcome this reality: same-sex couples who cannot marry are not treated equally under the law today. The harm to them is real, not abstract or speculative,"" wrote Chief Justice Stuart Rabner in the decision.

""We applied settled legal standards and determined that the state has not shown a reasonable probability it will succeed on the merits,'' Rabner wrote.

Steven Goldstein, the former head of Garden State Equality, which filed the original lawsuit with other parties, said the court's decision on the stay allows the same-sex couples to ""begin to tear down its Berlin Wall separating straight people who have had total freedom and LGBT who have not.""

""Imagine the happiness you'd feel if you won the Super Bowl, the Nobel Prize and an Academy Award all in a single moment, and multiply it by a million. That's how we LGBT New Jerseyans feel right now,"" Goldstein said.

Assemblyman Reed Gusciora, a Mercer County Democrat who is openly gay, said he hoped the Christie administration would move quickly to provide guidance to municipalities dealing with an influx of same-sex couples seeking to get married.

""Equality has won out once again and I thank the Supreme Court for ruling on the side of justice,"" Gusciora said.

Thirteen states, many in the Northeast, now recognize gay marriage."

Kennedy will approach the two same-sex marriage cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. But I haven’t heard anyone wondering which side Antonin Scalia will be on. He has made his views on gay relationships painfully clear.

In December, Scalia spoke at Princeton University, where I am a freshman, and I asked him about language he used in past decisions involving gay rights — language that I, as a gay man, found extraordinarily offensive.

Advertisement

In my question, I quoted from two of Scalia’s opinions (both of them dissents). One passage came from the case of Romer vs. Evans, which involved a Colorado statute banning laws that recognized gay people as a protected class. Scalia wrote: “I had thought that one could consider certain conduct reprehensible — murder, for example, or polygamy, or cruelty to animals — and could exhibit even ‘animus’ toward such conduct. Surely that is the only sort of ‘animus’ at issue here: moral disapproval of homosexual conduct.”

PHOTOS: Battle of the gay marriage signs

I asked if he had come to regret that language. He hadn’t. In response to my question, he posed two questions of his own: “If we cannot have moral feelings against homosexuality, can we have it against murder? Can we have it against these other things?”

I hadn’t really expected Scalia to apologize for his language. He has been remarkably consistent over his judicial career. Still, I had hoped, and continue to hope, that my question might lead Scalia to think about the language he uses in the soon-to-be-decided cases of U.S. vs. Windsor and Hollingsworth vs. Perry, which will determine the fates, respectively, of the federal Defense of Marriage Act and California’s Proposition 8. I know from personal experience that poisonous language like Scalia’s can be devastatingly hurtful.

Growing up in Northern California, I struggled to accept the fact that I was gay. I was labeled a “faggot” in middle school too many times to count. I listened to my neighbor explain how California needed Proposition 8 to “protect the children.” I heard my grandfather declare that San Francisco’s gay community was “just different from the rest of us.” Those words hurt, and honestly, they still do. Although I am very close to my parents, I only felt comfortable coming out to them a month before putting my question to Scalia.

TIMELINE: Gay marriage chronology

More than half of LGBT youth report having been verbally assaulted or attacked with anti-gay slurs. For some, it leaves a permanent scar. For others, it proves too much to handle, which is why an appallingly high number of gay teens commit suicide.

I tell myself that verbal assaults are rooted in ignorance. But I still haven’t figured out how to reassure myself when the ignorance is emanating from the nation’s highest court. In the 2003 case of Lawrence vs. Texas, the Supreme Court overturned a Texas law banning sodomy. Scalia’s dissent in the case, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas and then-Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, embraced the idea that citizens should be able to pass laws banning sexual behavior they find “immoral and unacceptable,” including such things as “adult incest, bestiality and obscenity.”

I have every confidence that history will judge Scalia harshly, and that one day it will be unacceptable to equate laws against consensual gay sex with laws against incest and bestiality. But I still worry about the impact of his language in the here and now.

OPINION L.A.: For Scalia, no gay people, just gay sex?

In the next couple of months, the court will issue its rulings on Proposition 8 and the Defense of Marriage Act, and we’re likely to hear more of his views on the morality of gay relationships. Still, I can’t help but hope that this time he will consider how words have the potential to lead people to desperation and self-destruction. Wouldn’t it be great if Scalia surprised us this time?

In the letter, Marquell Smith writes that it ""breaks my heart that any elected leader would use the good people in AfricanAmerican churches as justification to limit the rights of others, based on the prejudices of how we were raised.""

""Like you I'm African-American,"" Smith's letter continues. ""I learned that the struggles of our people are a symbol of hope for those being discriminated against. We cannot let an important vehicle of past struggles —African-American churches— become the gatekeepers of the rights to dignity of others. Who are we to deny someone else the right to marry because we don't agree with who they love?""

The letter was addressed to six state representatives -- Will Davis, Mary Flowers, LaShawn Ford, Eddie Jackson, Chuck Jefferson and Andre Thapedi -- who are reportedly on the fence on the state's marriage equality bill.

The Illinois House Black Caucus has been the subject of extensive lobbying from both sides of the issue in recent months and the state's African-American faith leaders have been split on the bill.

A Chicago Sun-Times survey this week also found that members of the Illinois House Black Caucus were similarly split on the legislation -- and that only four of the 20 members were definite ""yes"" votes. Five others said they were leaning toward a ""yes,"" four were opposed and seven were still undecided.

Meanwhile, marriage equality advocates said this week that they have reached the number of votes they need in order to pass the bill, but a date has not been set for a vote. Former President Bill Clinton also threw his name into the matter this week, urging the state House to approve the bill and send it to Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn to be signed into law.

The state's spring legislative session ends on May 31. If the bill is not passed by the House by that date, it will be delayed for many months more."

In a 25-34 vote, the House rejected the domestic partnership legislation, the first time Wyoming lawmakers formally voted on legislation related to marriage equality. The legislation's defeat comes after the House Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee passed the domestic partnership bill on Monday, while defeating a measure that would have allowed gay marriage.

""Just a sad day for the Equality State,"" state Rep. Dan Zwonitzer (R-Cheyenne) told The Huffington Post. Zwonitzer has been a leading supporter of gay rights in the legislature, including several efforts to kill gay marriage bans since his election in 2004.

The debate that predeeded Wednesday night's debate was tamer then Monday's committee hearing, where opponents of the gay marriage bill had contended that gay marriage harms moral and public health. State Rep. Mark Baker (R-Rock Springs) again raised the public health argument in the debate on the House floor, claiming that ""only 1 percent of homosexuals die of old age"" and that domestic partnership would cause higher health care costs for the state, according to a tweet by Trevor Brown, the state government reporter for the Wyoming Tribune Eagle.

Brown also tweeted that Baker had said that domestic partnerships were not ""rooted"" in the Wyoming constitution or in the state's tradition.

Supporters of the legislation focused on civil rights and equality issues raised by state Rep. Cathy Connolly (D-Laramie), the bill's sponsor, in Monday's committee meeting. Connolly, the state's only openly gay elected official, could not immediately be reached for comment. Baker tweeted that Connolly was ""stoic"" during the vote.

The domestic partnership measure had been viewed by supporters as having a better chance of passing than the gay marriage bill, but several legislators may have changed their minds at the last minute. Gov. Matt Mead (R) had indicated that he would sign a domestic partnership bill.

The domestic partnership bill had included the ability for heterosexual couples and platonic couples to enter into partnerships. State Sen. Bruce Burns (R-Sheridan), a co-sponsor, told the Corporations Committee on Monday that his aunt has shared a house with another woman for over three decades in a ""platonic relationship"" and the bill would allow them to have domestic partner benefits. He also said it would allow siblings who live together to become domestic partners.

State Rep. Lynn Hutchings (R-Cheyenne), an African American, told the committee that gay marriage was not comparable to the civil rights movement because she said people choose to be gay. She told committee members that her ex-fiance had been gay before dating her. Hutchings also said she opposed the bill due to AIDS."

“Within five years, we will bring marriage equality to all 50 states,” Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, pledged to supporters massed on the sidewalk outside the Supreme Court shortly after the court’s decisions Wednesday.

The rulings will bring to 13 the number of states, along with the District of Columbia, allowing gay marriage; together they account for about a third of the country’s population. But among the remaining states are many deeply conservative ones that probably will resist the nationwide shift toward acceptance of same-sex relationships.

Over the next 18 months, gay rights groups plan legislative or ballot campaigns in at least five states -- Illinois, New Jersey, Nevada, Oregon and Hawaii -- aimed at lengthening the list on their side. Same-sex marriage is also before the courts in New Mexico, where the state law is unclear.

Ultimately, however, advocates of same-sex marriage believe that they will have to argue the issue once again before the high court.

“The strategy has always been to secure a critical mass of states and a critical mass of public opinion in favor of marriage equality, and with that climate engage the Supreme Court,” said Evan Wolfson, president of Freedom to Marry and one of the leading strategists for the same-sex marriage movement.

Gay right groups also have begun to lobby the Obama administration to quickly clarify the rules for federal programs to ensure that the maximum number of same-sex couples qualify for federal benefits.

Opponents of same-sex marriage, who had backed national laws such as the Defense of Marriage Act, hope to slow the movement by insisting that the issue now be decided on a state-by-state basis.

“In the U.S., marriage has traditionally been defined by state law, and I believe each state, acting through their elected representatives or the ballot, should decide their own definition of marriage,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who is widely seen as a potential GOP presidential nominee in the next election, said in a statement.

“These types of disagreements should be settled through the democratic process, as the founders intended, not through litigation and court pronouncements.”

For gay rights advocates, the key to success is establishing equal marriage rights for same-sex couples as the norm in the eyes of the American public. Wednesday’s rulings indicate that a majority of the justices sympathize with the legal arguments in favor of same-sex marriage. The more widely public opinion and the law come to accept same-sex unions, the more willing a future Supreme Court will be to adopt those arguments and sweep away the remaining barriers, they believe.

Opponents largely share that assessment. As a result, the two sides probably will battle on a number of fronts.

One early set of skirmishes will center on the hundreds of federal programs that Wednesday’s rulings have opened to same-sex couples married in states where gay marriage is recognized.

As gay rights groups push the administration to ensure that those benefits are available to the greatest extent possible, opponents of same-sex marriage, including some Republican leaders in Congress, already have pushed back. They portray the effort as an attempt to federalize same-sex marriage rights.

Currently, some federal programs recognize marriages based on the law in the state in which a couple lives. Others look to the law in the state in which the marriage was celebrated. As a result, a gay couple who marry legally in California, then retire in Arizona, for example, might keep some federal benefits but lose others.

Leaders of gay rights organizations talked with Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. and other administration officials Wednesday to press their case that all programs should base their decisions on the law of the state in which the marriage was licensed, thereby eliminating the risk that a couple might lose benefits by moving.

Administration officials say they are studying that issue, hoping to avoid what one referred to as “unforced errors” that might prompt further lawsuits over benefits.

Some programs, such as the immigration system, already use the standard that gay rights groups prefer. As a result, gay rights groups say they believe the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will now be able to award lawful permanent residency to same-sex spouses of American citizens regardless of what state the American partner lives in.

“This decision is literally life changing for more than 36,000 families in the U.S. and many more living in exile abroad,” said Rachel B. Tiven, executive director of Immigration Equality, a legal aid and advocacy organization based in New York that pushes for federal immigration benefits for married same-sex couples.

Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said her department planned to issue guidance to immigration officials soon.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel also announced that the Pentagon would move quickly to extend benefits to same-sex couples.

Pat Quinn on Wednesday put his signature on a historic measure making Illinois the 16th state to allow same-sex marriage, capping a 40-year push for gay rights that picked up major momentum during the past decade.

Playing master of ceremonies during an hourlong event, the re-election-seeking Democratic governor slowly signed the bill with 100 pens that quickly became souvenirs. He did so at a desk shipped from Springfield that the administration said President Abraham Lincoln used to write his first inaugural address in 1861 — a speech on the cusp of the Civil War that called on Americans to heed ""the better angels of our nature.""

But it was another Lincoln speech that Quinn referenced as he spoke to about 2,300 supporters gathered at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

""In the very beginning of the Gettysburg Address, President Abraham Lincoln of Illinois said that our nation was conceived in liberty. And he said it's dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal, and that's really what we're celebrating today,"" he said. ""It's a triumph of democracy.""

Signs were banned for security reasons, but attendees shared celebratory kisses and waved miniature rainbow flags featuring the outline of Illinois.

Among the first in the door were Jan Arnold and Mary Anderson, of Oak Park, who brought their 8-year-old son to witness the bill-signing. The couple have been together for 15 years but said they got tired of waiting on Illinois to pass gay marriage and were legally married in Iowa in 2011.

Their union now will be recognized in Illinois, which Anderson said will free her family from second-class status and means they no longer have to carry a ""dossier"" of legal paperwork to prove their relationship should an emergency occur.

""We're finally safe and protected in our home state,"" Anderson said. ""We'll have the same protections that our straight friends do.""

The bill-signing illustrated the rapidly changing views in Illinois and the nation on gay rights. Supporters first introduced an anti-discrimination bill in the legislature in 1974. It didn't became law until 2005. It took an additional six years for civil unions to be approved, but only about half that time for the gay marriage measure.

Still, support for same-sex marriage is far from universal in Illinois. As politicians talked up the merits of gay marriage in Chicago, down in Springfield, a crowd gathered for an exorcism by the local Catholic bishop in protest of the governor's action.

""It is not the church that must change to confirm its teachings to the views of the world, but it is each individual who is called to be configured to Christ,"" Bishop Thomas Paprocki said during a service delivered mostly in Latin.

The new law changes the definition of marriage in Illinois from an act between a man and a woman to one between two people. Civil unions could be converted to marriages within a year of the law going on the books. About 6,500 applications for civil unions have been filed since 2011, with about 4,000 originating in Cook County.

As it stands, the bill won't take effect until June 1, which is when the first marriage ceremonies could take place. That date falls on a Sunday, but officials with Cook County Clerk David Orr's office said they will be ready for what they expect to be a huge demand. That includes the possibility of providing special waivers so couples don't have to wait until the day after receiving wedding licenses before they can be married.

The start date could be moved up under a measure backed by Sen. Don Harmon, a Democrat from Oak Park. If that bill is passed, gay marriage would go into effect immediately upon Quinn's signature. The measure could be called for a vote when lawmakers return to Springfield in the new year, though they face a light legislative schedule before the March 18 primary election.

Harmon said he's weighing whether it's fair to ask his colleagues to take another tough vote so soon after voting for gay marriage, acknowledging that a later effective date was the trade-off for passing the proposal this fall because a delay in implementation meant just 60 House votes were needed to pass the bill instead of 71.

But Harmon pointed to some gay advocates who died waiting for the right to marry, saying some people who want to take advantage of the new law might not be around in seven months. ""I'd just hate to leave people poised on the precipice of equality be told they can't commit — yet,"" Harmon said.

The lag time did little to dampen spirits Wednesday, as supporters noted just how far Illinois has come in supporting gay rights in a relatively short time.

Casey Cameron, 38, who traveled from St. Elmo in southern Illinois, noted that just eight years ago gay people in Illinois were fighting for basic rights such as equal housing and employment opportunities. ""It took a long time and a very tall mountain to get to that, and to finally see this is quite an amazing bit of accomplishment for the state,"" Cameron said.

The celebratory tone was a marked departure from late May, when the legislation stalled in the House after first passing the Senate on Valentine's Day. Supporters funneled their disappointment into action, launching a summerlong lobbying blitz that was soon buoyed by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down the definition of marriage as between one man and one woman for the purpose of receiving federal benefits.

That helped sway about a dozen lawmakers who spent much of the summer undecided. Another nudge came from powerful House Speaker Michael Madigan, who personally lobbied some members to vote for the bill. Madigan, who represents a Southwest Side district, also is chairman of the state Democratic Party. That means he controls the purse strings to large chests of campaign money that could be vital should one of his members face a primary challenge over their decision to vote in favor of gay marriage."

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court is wading into the fight over same-sex marriage at a time when public opinion is shifting rapidly in favor of permitting gay and lesbian couples to wed, but 40 states don't allow it.

The court's first major examination of gay rights in 10 years begins Tuesday with a hearing on California's ban on same-sex marriage. On Wednesday, the justices will consider the federal law that prevents legally married gay couples from receiving a range of benefits afforded straight married Americans.

People have been waiting in line – even through light snow – since Thursday for coveted seats for the argument over California's Proposition 8.

The two California couples challenging the voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage in the nation's largest state are in Washington for the argument and are urging the justices to strike down not just the California provision, but constitutional amendments and statutes in every state that define marriage as the union of a man and a woman.

They envision the 21st century equivalent of the court's 1967 decision in Loving v. Virginia that struck down state bans on interracial marriages.

The Obama administration has weighed in on behalf of the challengers, following President Barack Obama's declaration of support for same-sex marriage last year and his invocation of gay rights at his inauguration in January.

Supporters of Proposition 8 say the court should respect the verdict of California voters who approved the ban in 2008 and let the fast-changing politics of gay marriage evolve on their own, through ballot measures and legislative action, not judicial decrees.

Same-sex marriage is legal in nine states and the District of Columbia. The states are Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont and Washington.

Thirty states ban same-sex marriage in their state constitutions, while ten states bar them under state laws. New Mexico law is silent on the issue.

Polls have shown increasing support in the country for gay marriage. According to a Pew Research Center poll conducted in mid-March, 49 percent of Americans now favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally, with 44 percent opposed.

The California case is being argued 10 years to the day after the court took up a challenge to Texas' anti-sodomy statute. That case ended with a forceful ruling prohibiting states from criminalizing sexual relations between consenting adults.

Justice Anthony Kennedy was the author of the decision in Lawrence v. Texas in 2003, and he is being closely watched for how he might vote on the California ban. He cautioned in the Lawrence case that it had nothing to do with gay marriage, but dissenting Justice Antonin Scalia predicted the decision would lead to the invalidation of state laws against same-sex marriage.

Kennedy's decision is widely cited in the briefs in support of same-sex unions.

The court has several options for its eventual ruling, which is not expected before late June. In addition to upholding the ban and invalidating prohibitions everywhere, the justices could endorse an appeals court ruling that would make same-sex marriage legal in California but apply only to that state. They also could issue a broader ruling that would apply to California and eight other states: Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon and Rhode Island. In those states, gay couples may join in civil unions or become domestic partners and have all the benefits of marriage but cannot be married.

One other possibility is a ruling that says nothing about marriage. California's top elected officials, Gov. Jerry Brown and Attorney General Kamala Harris, are refusing to defend Proposition 8, and there is a question about whether the Proposition 8 supporters have the right, or legal standing, to defend the measure in court. If the justices decide they do not, the case would end without a high court ruling about marriage, although legal experts widely believe same-sex marriages would quickly resume in California.

The California couples, Kris Perry and Sandy Stier of Berkeley and Paul Katami and Jeff Zarrillo of Burbank, filed their federal lawsuit in May 2009 to overturn the same-sex marriage ban that voters approved the previous November. The ballot measure halted same-sex unions in California, which began in June 2008 after a ruling from the California Supreme Court.

Roughly 18,000 couples were wed in the nearly five months that same-sex marriage was legal and those marriages remain valid in California.

The high-profile case has brought together onetime Supreme Court opponents. Republican Theodore Olson and Democrat David Boies are leading the legal team representing the same-sex couples. They argued against each other in the Bush v. Gore case that settled the disputed 2000 presidential election in favor of George W. Bush.

Opposing them is Charles Cooper, Olson's onetime colleague at the Justice Department in the Reagan administration.

The case is Hollingsworth v. Perry, 12-144."

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']","In gay marriage cases, court must balance strong traditions","WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court heard two powerful arguments last week about marriage for gay and lesbian couples, and the path the justices choose could determine not only whether gay marriage will become the law nationwide, but how soon.

One argument spoke to the principle of equal rights. Denying federal benefits to legally married gay couples “cannot be reconciled with our fundamental commitment to equal treatment under law,” the Obama administration’s top courtroom lawyer told the justices, as he urged the court to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act.

The other argument spoke to the traditions of states’ rights and letting people, rather than the courts, decide the great social issues of the day. Debate over same-sex marriage is “roiling throughout this country,” said a lawyer defending the California ballot measure that barred gays from marrying. This process of “democratic debate” should continue, he said, rather than end with a sweeping court ruling that decides the law for the entire nation.

How the court reconciles those two traditions could shape the future of the “marriage equality” debate.

If the justices were to strike down the marriage act in June, when they announce a decision, and declare that married gay couples deserve equal rights, it would set a ringing legal precedent that would almost surely lead to same-sex marriage in much of the nation. If it is a question of equal rights, how could states refuse to permit committed gay couples from marrying?

However, if the court were to decide the case by stressing that states decide who is married, the ruling would bolster those who favor a go-slow approach. If marriage is indeed a matter for the states, then conservative states can argue they are entitled to preserve laws limiting marriage to a man and a woman.

The arguments on Wednesday revealed the dilemma. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who probably holds the deciding vote, repeatedly said he was troubled by the federal law because it interferes with the “traditional authority of the states to regulate marriage.”

Nine states, concentrated in the Northeast, now allow gays and lesbians to marry, but the federal government refuses to recognize them as married. If the Supreme Court were to strike down this provision on the grounds that the states’ decision on marriage should prevail, it would be a victory for 130,000 legally married gay couples. It could also prove an obstacle for gay rights lawyers who say the state laws forbidding gay marriage are unconstitutional.

That’s why U.S. Solicitor Gen. Donald Verrilli Jr. and the liberal wing of the court insisted the issue was one of equal rights, not “federalism.”

The tenor of the two-day argument suggested that Kennedy and the most liberal justices wanted to move cautiously in favor of same-sex marriage. They seemed determined to put off for now a constitutional decision on whether gays have the right to marry across the nation.

“That would not be a surprise. It would be consistent with the court’s incremental approach to recognizing civil rights,” said Columbia University law professor Suzanne Goldberg, who watched the two days of arguments.

The court’s most famous civil rights ruling, the Brown vs. Board of Education decision of 1954, was a sweeping declaration that racial segregation is unconstitutional. But less known are the decisions that came before and after.

The court had handed down rulings from 1938 to 1950 that gave black students the right to enroll in previously all-white Southern universities. Those precedents paved the way for the Brown decision. Then, after insisting on desegregation of the schools, the justices waited until 1967 to strike down the remaining state laws that barred interracial marriages in the aptly named case of Loving vs. Virginia.

Gay rights advocates do not expect it will be decades before same-sex marriage is the law throughout the nation. And some had high hopes the court would declare a constitutional right to marry this year.

“There was some disappointment that the court was not further along,” Kate Kendell, a lawyer for the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said after the argument. But she also heard much that was encouraging. “Not one justice made statements in any way vilifying of LGBT people,” she said.

She took special note of a comment from Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., a conservative who said he favored a cautious approach. In questioning the lawyers, he asked about a same-sex couple who are “just as loving and committed” as a heterosexual couple. Despite a disagreement on the law, Alito “talked about us in very human terms imbued with dignity,” Kendell said.

Last year’s struggle over the healthcare law showed the difficulty of reading too much into the oral argument. In March 2012, the justices debated whether the law’s requirement that everyone obtain health insurance could be upheld as regulation of interstate commerce. Most of the conservatives sounded skeptical. But by June, Chief Justice John G. Roberts had decided the requirement could be upheld and enforced as a tax penalty. The four liberal justices agreed.

In Wednesday’s argument, five justices sounded ready to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act. They have until June to agree on a majority opinion.

Once they have decided that issue, the justices could turn their attention to the more tricky question of what to do with California’s Proposition 8, the voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage. A federal judge in San Francisco and the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled this state measure unconstitutional.

The oral argument on Tuesday made clear it was the court’s four most conservative justices who had voted to hear the Proposition 8 case. That decision is made behind closed doors, and the votes are not disclosed. But Kennedy and several of the liberal justices said it was a mistake for the court to have agreed to hear the appeal.

Advertisement

That suggested they would seek to dispose of the Proposition 8 case without ruling directly on whether gays have a constitutional right to marry. They could say the sponsors of the ballot measure do not have legal standing to appeal to the high court. They could dismiss the appeal as “improvidently granted.” Or they could hold the case until late June and send it back to California in light of the ruling in the Defense of Marriage case. All three options would lead to the restoring of gay marriage in California, but without a legal precedent that would affect the other states. It’s also possible but unlikely that Kennedy could join with the conservatives to uphold Proposition 8 on states’ rights grounds.

“Allow the democratic process to continue,” Paul D. Clement, the former solicitor general, told the justices in his closing comments. He was defending the marriage act on behalf of the House Republicans, and it appeared a five-vote majority would vote against him. But even if they do, the fight over gay marriage will likely continue.

When our federal district is measured against other cities with large gay populations, a comparison that experts say is better than comparing to states, it still ranks at the top of the list. Gary J. Gates, who studies census data for the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, reports that Washington has 18.1 same-sex couples per 1,000 households. That places it eighth among cities with populations larger than 250,000.

Sorry, New York, but you have only 8.75 same-sex couples per 1,000 households. In Manhattan alone, it’s higher, at 16.7, but still not higher than D.C. The top three are San Francisco (30.3 per 1,000), Seattle (23) and Oakland (21). The numbers capture only those who acknowledge being in a same-sex relationship.

Every gay man or lesbian I spoke to for this article had a horror story about what it was like working in the closet, fearing they would be found out. It was only during the Clinton years that the White House finally ended the decades-long practice of denying security clearance to people known to be gay or lesbian. That meant in order to be considered for many high-level jobs involving access to classified information, gays and lesbians had to concoct a web of lies about their personal lives.

Steve Elmendorf, a Democratic lobbyist who worked on Capitol Hill for years, described how he and his gay friends had to make sure they all gave the same references to government agents investigating their backgrounds, an insurance policy so that if the question of their sexual orientation came up, they could be certain no one unpredictable would spill the truth."

And it’s not because there’s an anti-homosexual mood, and nobody’s homophobic that I know of, but many of us, and I consider myself included, base our standards not on the latest Washington Post poll, but on an objective standard, not a subjective standard.

I have great sympathy and extraordinary admiration for Sen. Portman. I consider him a friend and I value his work in the Senate and think he’s a great person. The mistake is that we sometimes base our public policy decisions on how we feel, how we think, maybe even some personal experiences, and we don’t regard a lot of these issues from the standpoint of an objective standard.

Last week, Reince Priebus said that he believed Mike Huckabee was a model for how Republicans should talk about social issues like marriage equality. Yesterday, Huckabee demonstrated what Priebus was talking about, answering a question about the possibility of the Republican Party endorsing marriage equality by saying But don't worry, it's not because evangelicals are bigots or anything like that:And he has the utmost respect for Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH) who recently became the only Republican senator to support marriage equality, joining 45 of his Democratic colleagues:So there you have it. Reince Priebus's model for talking about social issues doesn't hate Rob Portman—he just thinks he's a poll-driven weakling making decisions based on emotion instead of the objective truth that gay and lesbian couples should not be allowed to marry. It's not that Huckabee wants to be anti-homosexual or anything, it's just that objectively speaking, heterosexual couples should have more freedom than everyone else. And if Republicans make the mistake of giving into the temptation of not being homophobic bigots, a big chunk of their political base will quit the party, and maybe vote for Ray Moore or something like that. But they'll do it with a big old affable smile, just like Mike Huckabee."

Asbury Park (N.J.) Press

Gay marriage became legal Monday in New Jersey

New Jersey is 14th state to permit gay marriage

Several took vows immediately after midnight

ASBURY PARK, N.J. — Hours after same-sex couples lined up Monday across the state to marry, Gov. Chris Christie dropped his administration's efforts to end gay marriage.

Christie and his Acting Attorney General John Hoffman had filed an appeal to the State Supreme Court after a lower court ruled that same-sex couples could begin to get married in New Jersey at midnight Monday, but Christie withdrew the appeal Monday morning.

A statement from Christie's office noted that when the State Supreme Court denied the governor's efforts to delay same-sex marriages, Chief Justice Stuart Rabner wrote in the denial that ""same-sex couples who cannot marry are not treated equally under the law today.""

""Although the governor strongly disagrees with the court substituting its judgment for the constitutional process of the elected branches or a vote of the people, the court has now spoken clearly as to their view of the New Jersey Constitution and, therefore, same-sex marriage is the law,"" the governor's statement said. ""The governor will do his constitutional duty and ensure his administration enforces the law as dictated by the New Jersey Supreme Court.""

Meanwhile, across the state, same-sex couples began marrying shortly after midnight Monday.

Karen and Marcye Nicholson-McFadden have spent the past decade fighting for their right to wed.

Some guests, about 50 in all, were brought to tears as they watched the Nicholson-McFaddens and two other couples wed under a full moon in the cold wind outside the Paramount Theater here.

""It's utterly pure and complete relief to finally be here because it's been a crazy long road,"" said Karen Nicholson-McFadden after marrying Marcye Nicholson-McFadden, her partner of 24 years. They spent a weekend of uncertainty after their town clerk refused to issue them a marriage license but opened up at 8 p.m. Sunday when she got additional direction from the state on issuing the licenses.

The Aberdeen, N.J., women were plaintiffs in the lawsuit that brought same-sex marriage to the state. The couple immediately picked up their license and drove to Newark, N.J., to get a judge to waiver the 72-hour waiting period.

""We were all over the state of New Jersey in the last six hours,"" Karen Nicholson-McFadden said.

Asbury Park Councilwoman Amy Quinn and her partner, Heather Jensen, together 10 years, had a joint ceremony with couple Steven Brunner and Daniel Baum.

The Rev. Thomas Pivinski, a former Catholic priest who now is an Episcopal minister, officiated each wedding and said the state's recognition of gay marriage was long overdue.

""I think it's wonderful,"" Pivinski said. ""I am just very grateful that the state has recognized the equality of all people."" He planned to marry his civil-union partner of 20 years Monday night.

In Lambertville, N.J., Mayor David DelVecchio pronounced Beth Asaro and Joanne Schailey as spouses in the minute after midnight.

""We're floating on air,"" Asaro, a city councilwoman, said after the ceremony. ""We're not an exception anymore."" The women, partners for 27 years, were having their second ""first."" In 2007, they became the first couple in New Jersey to be joined in a civil union in another midnight ceremony also performed by DelVecchio.

Assemblyman Reed Gusciora, D-Trenton, the state's first openly gay legislator and the first sponsor of same-sex marriage legislation, presented the couple with a bottle of Egalite, a New York sparkling wine created in support of lesbian and gay equality. Back in January 2012, Christie had called Gusciora ""numb nuts"" over a comment from the assemblyman that likened the struggle for gay rights to the civil-rights movement.

Lambertville's City Clerk Cindy Ege said she has received 13 same-sex marriage license applications and, before the ceremony announced she would be present until 1 a.m to accept more applications.

In Red Bank, N.J., Ed Zipprich and John Paul Nicolaides, partners of 17 years, were the first couple to be married there. The men took their vows at 12:05 a.m. before 40 friends and family members.

""We wanted to be first,"" Nicolaides said moments after saying ""I do.""

Zipprich and Nicolaides filed their application for a marriage license in the borough at 12:01 a.m. Friday so their midnight marriage would be possible.

Borough Clerk and Registrar Pam Borgi said she received the new template for same sex marriages licenses at 6:30 p.m. Friday.

""We had that window of opportunity, and we knew when we went to get our license that we might be getting our $28 dollars back,"" Zipprich said.

The same-sex license asks for the names of the spouses instead of bride and groom. Another difference: Gender identities such as male and female are replaced by Partner A and Partner B.

Red Bank Mayor Pasquale ""Pat"" Menna threw open the doors of Borough Hall for the ceremony to take place.

""It's an historic moment,"" Menna said. ""People want to be a part of history. This is so great that after midnight so many people showed up.""

Zipprich, 53, and Nicolaides, 49, were married by Colleen Mahr, the mayor of Fanwood, N.J., and also a close friend of the couple.

""I thought a lot about this moment. These marriages were not possible the day before, and it was special to bear witness to it,"" Mahr said.

The proposal, which would continue to bar homosexual men from serving as Scout leaders, will be voted on at a May meeting of the organization’s national council, Scouting officials said.

“We believe the BSA can no longer sacrifice its mission, or the youth served by the movement, by allowing the organization to be consumed by a single, controversial, and unresolved societal issue,” national president Wayne Perry said in a statement announcing the proposal.

The proposed resolution states, “No youth may be denied membership in the Boy Scouts of America on the basis of sexual orientation or preference alone.”

The proposal comes after months of intense pressure from both within and outside the organization, which has shown signs of confusion and division within its leadership.

Supporters of lifting the ban include several prominent Scouting board members, corporate funders, President Obama and his Republican challenger in last year’s election Mitt Romney, several U.S. senators, New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and others. Petitions purportedly bearing 1.4 million signatures were presented at Scouting headquarters in Texas.

But the ban retained strong backing among important Scouting constituencies, including the Southern Baptist Convention and conservative groups like the Family Research Council.

Last July, Scouting officials announced that after a two-year confidential review the organization had decided to keep the no-gays policy, which is essentially “don’t ask, don’t tell.”

Experts at the time said the decision reflected the conservative values of many members, as well as the influence of the Roman Catholic and Mormon churches.

But in late January, word leaked out that the organization might retreat from that position and allow local groups to decide.

“The policy change under discussion would allow the religious, civic or educational organizations that oversee and deliver Scouting to determine how to address this issue,” spokesman Deron Smith said at the time.

A week later, however, the Scouts’ national board, buffeted by the furor that had erupted around the proposal, postponed a vote until its meeting in May.

In the months since, Scouting has conducted what it calls “the most comprehensive listening exercise in its history,” holding more than 250 town-hall meetings across the country and polling more than 1 million members, Friday’s statement said.

Scouting’s members remain deeply divided on the issue, and the proposed policy is an effort to find a middle ground by allowing gay youths to participate while upholding the ban on gay adults.

“America needs Scouting, and our policies must be based on what is in the best interest of our kids,” said Perry. “We believe good people can disagree and still work together to accomplish great things for youth.”

If the justices take this case, it will be a defining case on American’s freedom to speak and act according to their religious beliefs when those beliefs include that marriage is between a man and woman.

The case is Elane Photography v. Willock. Elane Huguenin is a photojournalist; she takes pictures to draw a narrative that conveys a story message. She and her husband Jonathan own and operate Elane Photography LLC.

One type of work Elane does is photographing weddings in a way that celebrates marriage. Because the Huguenins are Evangelical Christians, they believe marriage is only the union of a man and woman.

Breitbart News explained the facts and history of this case in a report on Aug. 22. Elane and Jonathan were assessed a fine by the New Mexico Human Rights Commission for declining to photograph a same-sex commitment ceremony. (It’s not a marriage or civil union ceremony, because neither of those were recognized under New Mexico law at the time.)

The New Mexico Supreme Court upheld that penalty, holding that Elane and Jonathan’s religious beliefs must be secondary to the cause of gay equality. As Breitbart News quoted one justice in the court’s opinion, “The Huguenins are free to… pray to the God of their choice… But there is a price, one that we all have to pay somewhere in our civic life.”

On Friday, the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), representing Elane Photography, filed a petition for certiorari at the Supreme Court of the United States, asking SCOTUS to reverse the New Mexico court. ADF specifically challenges the New Mexico ruling for violating the Huguenins’ First Amendment right of free speech, since it compels Elane and Jonathan to convey a message approving of gay marriage which is contrary to the Huguenins’ beliefs.

The petition begins by quoting a recent U.S. Supreme Court case where the justices wrote, “At the heart of the First Amendment lies the principle that each person should decide for himself or herself the ideas and beliefs deserving of expression.”

This means that the government cannot compel a person to say something or convey a message that the person does not actually believe. The petition continues, “The First Amendment right to freedom of speech includes both the right to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking.”

This case is vitally important in that it concerns whether people of faith–especially Christians who believe biblical teachings on marriage and sexuality–can be forced to choose between being true to their beliefs or putting food on their kitchen table by earning a paycheck in their chosen profession. As the petition explains regarding the New Mexico court’s decision:

Such disregard for the constitutional rights of these professionals threatens to drive them from the marketplace. Not only would that limit the expressive options available to the public, it would cost these individuals their livelihoods. Whether the First Amendment permits this result is a question that warrants this Court’s review.

Jordan Lorence is ADF’s lead counsel on this case. The New Mexico court found that Elane Photography is a “public accommodation,” like a restaurant or restroom that could not turn away a black or Hispanic person. Reacting to that declaration, Lorence told Breitbart News in an exclusive statement, “The First Amendment protects all Americans from government coercion forcing them to promote ideas they don’t support. Those in power should not misuse public-accommodation laws to punish those who decline to affirm the prevailing liberal orthodoxy on marriage.”

If the Supreme Court takes this case, it will mark the first time the Court draws the line between the gay-rights agenda and First Amendment rights of free speech and religious liberty–and who wins when those are in conflict.

The Court should vote in January whether to take the case.

http://news.yahoo.com/north-dakota-says-man-same-sex-marriage-may-233235900.html,,[],North Dakota says man in same-sex marriage may wed woman too,"By Eric M. Johnson (Reuters) - A man already married to another man in a state that permits same-sex marriage could wed a woman in North Dakota without breaking state laws, the state's top attorney has found. The finding raises potentially complex issues about Social Security and death benefits, tax exemptions and even possible prosecutions for bigamy or polygamy, said a constitutional law expert. Those issues are likely to arise more often with 16 states plus the District of Columbia now recognizing same-sex marriage while a majority of states still ban it, said Jeffrey Shaman, a professor at DePaul University's College of Law. The issue came up when a man giving only his first name called Burleigh County Recorder Debbie Kroshus in September to ask if he could marry a woman in North Dakota if he were already married to a man in another state, she said. ""I didn't ask where this caller was calling from or where he planned on getting a marriage license,"" Kroshus said in a telephone interview, adding that it was not possible to determine if the man had applied for a marriage license. The man could not get a divorce in North Dakota because of the state ban on same-sex marriage and he said the man he is married to also lives in a state that does not recognize gay marriage, Kroshus said. Kroshus asked the state's attorney from Burleigh County to seek the opinion from the attorney general. North Dakota is among the states that ban same-sex marriage by state law and state constitutional amendment. Since it would not recognize the man's same-sex marriage, he could also marry a woman in North Dakota without breaking state laws, Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem said in an opinion dated December 12. Stenehjem also found the man would not be committing a crime in North Dakota if he filled out the application as ""single/never married"" and declined to discuss whether he could be prosecuted for bigamy in another state if he later moved to a state that recognized same-sex marriage. Shaman said more and more people will enter into same-sex marriages and move to other states as the recognition of same-sex marriage increases. And same-sex couples, like opposite-sex couples, will part ways. ""I think there are going to be more and more of these questions,"" Shaman said in a telephone interview. The Supreme Court has found that federal law must recognize same-sex marriage in states where it is legal, but the ruling in June that struck down part of the Defense of Marriage Act stopped short of requiring states to recognize same-sex marriages from other states, Shaman said. ""Although this is pretty extreme in its complexity, situations like these do arise because of the nature of our country,"" Shaman said. ""We are a federation and states have authority to enact laws as they see fit."" Stenehjem referenced a part of the Defense of Marriage Act that says states need not recognize a same-sex marriage formed in another state in finding that a marriage license could be issued even if the same-sex marriage was not dissolved. The state attorney general's opinion came a day before a U.S. federal judge struck down a portion of Utah's bigamy law governing cohabitation as unconstitutional, saying it bars consenting adults from living together and criminalizes their intimate sexual relationships.

USA TODAY

Hundreds of same-sex couples have married in Utah in the week since the district court ruling.

The state says it has the right to define marriage and has legislated against same-sex marriage three times

The Supreme Court addressed the issue of same-sex marriage in two cases in June.

Same-sex marriage, twice on the Supreme Court's agenda this year, will get another federal look as Utah asks the justices to halt gay marriages in the state until it can exhaust its legal appeals.

Utah's Attorney General said it would ask the U.S. Supreme Court to block a Dec. 20 ruling from a district court in Utah that found Utah's ban on same-sex marriage conflicts with the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection and due process under the 14th Amendment.

""It is the intent of the Attorney General's Office to file with the Supreme Court as soon as possible,""said a statement from the officeThursday.

Judges in previous same-sex marriage cases have put their decisions on hold until the losing party could appeal, says law professor Steve Sanders of Indiana University's Maurer School of Law.

""It preserves a little bit of respect for the state's interest,"" says Sanders, who thinks it more likely that the Supreme Court will grant the stay without revealing its thinking on the merits of the case.

In the week since the district court ruling, hundreds of gay and lesbian couples have married in the state. A stay from the Supreme Court would halt future marriages, but would not make the same-sex marriages performed this week invalid, Sanders said.

""Those marriages were done in good faith during the time when it was legal. I think you have to say those marriages are valid,"" Sanders says.

The Supreme Court addressed same-sex marriage with two decisions in June. One 5-4 ruling, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, struck down a clause in the Defense of Marriage Act that denied federal benefits to same-sex spouses in states that allow same-sex marriages. In the second decision, the court did not say whether states must allow same-sex marriage.

In this case, Utah would ask the Supreme Court to block the district court ruling while the appeals proceed, halting same-sex marriages in the state until the legal questions are settled.

The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by three gay and lesbian couples who wish to marry but are barred from doing so in Utah. Utah's constitution prohibits same-sex marriage. Utah says it has the right to define marriage.

Utah has legislated against same-sex marriage three times. The state first banned same-sex marriage in 1977. In 2004, the state legislature passed another law defining legal marriage as a union between a man and a woman. Two-thirds of Utah voters supported the law in a Nov. 2, 2004 referendum, which took effect as Amendment 3 on Jan. 1, 2005.

U.S. District Judge Robert Shelby agreed in his ruling that the state has the right to define marriage but questioned whether Utah's definition violated the couples' constitutional rights..

""The State's current laws deny its gay and lesbian citizens their fundamental right to marry and, in so doing, demean the dignity of these same-sex couples for no rational reason,"" Shelby wrote. ""Accordingly, the court finds that these laws are unconstitutional.""

With this ruling, Utah and 17 other states now permit same-sex marriage.

The state can appeal the district court's decision to the 10th Circuit court of appeals, which has indicated it would hear the case quickly. That decision could then be appealed to the Supreme Court.

""That's when the Supreme Court will be faced with a real dilemma,"" Sanders says.

In the June cases, the Supreme Court addressed a federal law that imposed on states that allowed gay marriage. In the Utah case, the Supreme Court would address a state's power to legislate.

""The thing that connects them is the very broad sympathetic language by Justice Kennedy,"" Sanders said. ""The plaintiff's are betting that Justice Kennedy will bend and join the more progressive justices,"""
"http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-san-diego-clerk-gay-marriage-20130719,0,2883541.story",2013-07-20 00:22:00,['Tony Perry Is The Former San Diego Bureau Chief For The Los Angeles Times.'],San Diego County clerk files petition to halt same-sex marriages,"SAN DIEGO -- The clerk of San Diego County filed a legal action Friday with the California Supreme Court seeking to block the issuance of marriage licenses for same-sex couples.

The filing on behalf of Ernest Dronenburg Jr., a Republican and elected official, was immediately criticized by state Atty. Gen. Kamala D. Harris as containing “no new arguments that could deny same-sex couples their constitutionally protected civil rights. The federal injunction is still in effect, and it requires all 58 counties to perform same-sex marriages.”

The county Board of Supervisors sought to distance themselves from Dronenburg’s action, which was filed for him by Charles S. LiMandri, a Rancho Santa Fe attorney and leader of the bid to restrict marriage between men and women.

“The county clerk has acted independently on this matter,’' said board chairman Supervisor Greg Cox. “No one else from the county was consulted or had any part of this court action, including the Board of Supervisors. The county’s position is and always has been that we, the county, will follow applicable law with regards to same-sex marriage.”

The weddings resumed June 28, two days after the U.S. Supreme Court effectively allowed a lower-ruling against Proposition 8, the measure that banned gay marriage, to become law.

The petition argues that the state does not have the right to order counties to perform same-sex marriages because the question of Proposition 8’s legality is still before the courts.

Supervisor David Roberts said that as soon as he heard what Dronenburg had done, he immediately demanded a meeting to find out his motives.

“I was livid, to say the least,” Roberts said. “As the first LGBT supervisor, with a married partner, I felt this was a slap in the face. But he says that’s not what this is about. We’ll see.”

Roberts said that Dronenburg told him that he merely wants legal clarification and has no intention of refusing to issue licenses to same-sex couples. If that occurs, Roberts said, the county supervisors will immediately move to prevent it.

“We aren’t going to let that happen,” Roberts said. “We believe in the law.”

Dronenburg, 69, was elected in 2010 as the county’s recorder/assessor/clerk. A Republican, he is a former member of the state Board of Equalization for 20 years.

[Updated at 5:50 p.m.: Randy Thomasson, president of SaveCalifornia.com, commended Dronenburg for “keeping his oath to ‘support and defend’ … the California Constitution.”

In a statement, Thomasson called same-sex marriages “completely illegal and unconstitutional, despite what tyrannical statewide officials or judges have opined.”]

[Updated at 5:30 p.m.: Gov. Jerry Brown is traveling out of the country, but his spokesman issued a statement supporting same-sex marriage.

“We remain confident that the federal injunction applies to all 58 counties and same-sex marriage remains legal in California,’’ said the governor’s spokesman, Evan Westrup.]

Tuesday night, during an appearance on Fox News Channel’s “Hannity,” Sean Hannity asked Dr. Carson about his thoughts on same-sex marriage. Here is Carson’s response in full: [emphasis added]

DR. BEN CARSON

Marriage is between a man and a woman. It is a well-established fundamental pillar of society, and no group — be they gays, be they NAMBLA [North American Man/Boy Love Association], be they people who believe in bestiality — no matter what they are, they don’t get to change the definition. So it’s not something that’s against gays; it’s against anybody who wants to come along and change the fundamental definition of pillars of society. It has significant ramifications.

It took a few days for Media Matters and the rest of the organized-left to gin up the outrage needed to grab hold of the mainstream media’s attention. But by Friday afternoon, Dr. Carson found himself under direct fire. NBC News’ Andrea Mitchell brought Carson on her MSNBC show for a grilling, as did CNN’s Wolf Blitzer.

Mitchell and Blitzer were equally horrified over what they characterized as Carson’s comparing of gay relationships to relationships that are considered immoral and illegal. Carson did apologize, but he also explained (in so many words) that he was not engaging in an argument of comparison, but rather a slippery-slope argument of where changing the definition of marriage could eventually lead.

Obviously that is what Carson was doing. And as shown below, it is a commonplace thing to do and an important consideration when lawyers, judges, and adults discuss significant and fundamental legal changes of the sort raised by the question of same-sex marriage before the Supreme Court.

But that didn’t matter to a CNN and NBC desperate to publicly destroy a man who “doesn’t know his place.” We’ve seen this media playbook before with Clarence Thomas, and most recently with Herman Cain. (In CNN’s defense, they did not stoop as low as NBC News.)

If you want proof that what NBC News and CNN engaged in yesterday was nothing more than an ideological witch hunt against a racial apostate, where was the outrage from this very same media on Tuesday after Justice Sotomayor raised the exact same kind of slippery-slope argument Carson did, herself citing illegal and immoral examples?

Below is from the official Supreme Court transcript of Tuesday’s oral arguments on the constitutionality of Prop 8, which bans same-sex marriage in the state of California. According to page 46 of the transcript, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor (a liberal Obama appointee) compared same-sex relationships to polygamy and the horrors of incest:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Olson, the bottom line that you’re being asked — and — and it is one that I’m interested in the answer: If you say that marriage is a fundamental right, what State restrictions could ever exist? Meaning, what State restrictions with respect to the number of people, with respect to — that could get married — the incest laws, the mother and the child, assuming they are of age — I can — I can accept that the State has probably an overbearing interest on — on protecting the a child until they’re of age to marry, but what’s left?

To be clear, I do not believe Sotomayor compared homosexuality to anything. What she did is what Dr. Carson did: she played devil’s advocate about the slippery-slope of what might come next if we open the Pandora’s box of changing the definition of marriage. And to make that argument, like Dr. Carson, she used illegal and immoral relationships (not homosexuality) as slippery slope concerns should the definition of marriage be held to include gay marriage.

But no one on the left or in the media cared that Sotomayor used the horror of incest to make a point about same-sex marriage — because Sotomayor is a leftist and they know which way she is going to rule. Moreover, the point she was making was obvious.

The point Carson was making was just as obvious. But because the right-leaning Carson is both black and conservative, which makes him a threat to the left-leaning mainstream media’s attempted stranglehold on the Narrative, doesn’t “know his place,” Wolf Blitzer and Andrea Mitchell and NBC News and CNN played “gotcha” with him to “put him back in his place.”

Mitchell and Blitzer are not racists, but they do need to take a step back and realize that, in their zeal to aid and abet the left, they are wielding the same kind of double standards and show-trials of humiliation we saw in the segregated South. Back then it was all about the use of character assassination to keep blacks from obtaining the kind of political power that comes with public prestige. Today the media and left use similar tactics against those the media sees as “apostates” — especially black conservative men.

And the goal is to send a message that says, “Shut up or this will happen to you.”

But this would have been unthinkable five years ago.

It was just three months ago that the White House and media piled on a reverend for preaching the Bible’s teachings on homosexuality. The result was his invitation to speak at Obama’s inauguration being rescinded.

This would have been unthinkable five years ago.

With the election of Pope Francis, we have news anchors openly clamoring that the Church is out of step on same-sex marriage.

This would have been unthinkable five years ago.

Fifteen years ago, the same leftists and media assuring us today that same-sex marriage won’t be imposed on the Church were telling us that civil unions (which I’ve always supported) would never lead to gay marriage.

With all that in mind, am I really supposed to buy that, within five years (maybe five days), the left and the media won’t be incessantly asking this question: “If the Church cannot legally refuse to marry an interracial couple, how can it legally refuse same-sex couples?”

There are many good and well-intentioned people who believe same-sex couples should be allowed to marry. Much of the support from the right comes from our “live and let live” philosophy, which I share. But another liberty is on the line, and that is religious liberty. This push from the media has never been about allowing gay couples to marry; it’s about the left’s lifelong crusade to destroy the Church.

The endgame is to declare the Bible and Christian beliefs de facto bigotry:

I have a right to defend myself. And to point out the hypocrisy of people who justify anti-gay bigotry by pointing to the Bible, and insisting we must live by the code of Leviticus on this one issue and no other.

That is not some crackpot talking. That is Dan Savage, who has worked with no less than President Obama. And Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi… And the media loves him.

Once this idea turns into anything close to mainstream with the left, the left’s legal harassment and outright harassment against the Church will be unceasing. (Muslims, of course, will never be bothered.)

Offering committed same-sex couples the same legal rights (and headaches) married couples enjoy is something I have supported for about twenty years.

Civil unions are something I feel strongly enough about that, here in North Carolina, I did not vote in favor of making same-sex marriage unconstitutional last year. My concern was that the wording of the referendum would give lawmakers the power to ban civil unions.

But I oppose same-sex marriage because marriage is a sacrament, and there is a big difference between asking one to be tolerant, and demanding one condone.

Being gay is no more a sin than being straight. But just as straight people can engage in sinful behavior, so can gays. Asking me to condone anyone’s sinful behavior is asking too much. That is the complete opposite of bigotry, by the way — you know, applying the exact same standard to everyone.

But when the State and its media attempt to force the Church to condone such a thing (and they will), what is unthinkable to many of the well-intentioned today will become a terrible reality.

UPDATE: Erick Erickson at RedState:

Within a year or two we will see Christian schools attacked for refusing to admit students whose parents are gay. We will see churches suffer the loss of their tax exempt status for refusing to hold gay weddings. We will see private businesses shut down because they refuse to treat as legitimate that which perverts God’s own established plan. In some places this is already happening. … The left cannot allow Christians to continue to preach the full gospel. We already see this in, of all places, Canada. Gay marriage is incompatible with a religion that preaches that the unrepentant are condemned, even of a sin the world has decided is not one. The religious freedom will eventually be ended through the judiciary. We should work to extend that freedom as long as we can. Now many of you have read through this and you are shaking your head in denial. “No way this is possible,” you say. But then just a decade ago no one seriously considered gay marriage as possible. And we are already seeing signs we’re headed in this direction. It’s coming. Get ready.

But Oliveira now faces deportation because current immigration laws do not allow spouses in same-sex marriages to obtain visas. (Gretchen Ertl/For The Washington Post)

In his final legislative act as a senator, Secretary of State John F. Kerry sought to resolve an international dilemma. He filed Senate Bill 48, seeking “permanent resident status for Genesio Januario Oliveira,” a gay Brazilian national facing deportation because he does not qualify for a spousal visa.

Now, President Obama is aiming to grant same-sex couples such as Oliveira and his American husband, Tim Coco, equal immigration rights as their heterosexual counterparts. The proposal could allow up to 40,000 foreign nationals in same-sex relationships to apply for legal residency and, potentially, U.S. citizenship.

But the measure has inspired fierce pushback from congressional Republicans and some religious groups, who say it could sink hopes for a comprehensive agreement aimed at providing a path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants.

The standoff may force Obama to choose between two key interest groups — Hispanics and gays — that helped power his reelection in the fall. The president must weigh how forcefully to push the bill, known as the Uniting American Families Act, while not endangering a long-sought deal to resolve the status of undocumented immigrants, most of whom are Latino.

The same-sex measure was not included in the immigration proposals issued last week by a bipartisan Senate working group, whose overall framework Obama largely embraced. Several key Christian groups that have supported the White House’s immigration push have objected to the measure on the grounds that it would erode traditional marriage.

The issue has prompted an intense lobbying effort on both sides, including a letter to the White House from a coalition of influential church organizations and a series of urgent conference calls between advocates, administration officials and lawmakers.

For Obama, the political sensitivity was evident in the public rollout of his immigration plans last Tuesday. Although the same-sex provision was included in documents distributed by the White House, the president did not mention it in his immigration speech in Las Vegas.

“The president in his plan said that you should treat same-sex families the same way we treat heterosexual families,” White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer said Friday on “Political Capital With Al Hunt.” “It’s wrong to discriminate. It’s a natural extension of the president’s view about same-sex marriage, the view about providing equal rights, no matter who you love.”

But congressional Republicans immediately condemned the idea and warned that the measure imperils broader immigration reform. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), one of the senators on the eight-member bipartisan working group on immigration, said at a Politico breakfast last week that injecting social issues into the debate over immigration legislation “is the best way to derail it.”

“Which is more important: LGBT or border security?” McCain said, using an abbreviation for people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. “I’ll tell you what my priorities are.”

Behind the scenes, the lobbying efforts began before the president’s speech. A coalition of religious groups — including Roman Catholics, evangelicals and Southern Baptists — delivered a letter to the White House last week opposing the same-sex measure.

“It’s an overreach,” said Kevin Appleby, director of migration policy and public affairs at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which signed the letter. “Immigration is hard enough as it is and adding another controversial issue to the mix makes it even harder. I’m surprised the administration would risk sacrificing 11 million people over this issue. It’s very combustible.”

‘We’re always worried’

On a White House conference call with interest groups after Obama’s appearance in Las Vegas, the first question was from an evangelical activist who objected to the provision. Religious groups pushed back again Wednesday on another White House call, according to a person who participated in the conversation.

On the other side, several Senate Democrats, including Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), Richard J. Durbin (Ill.) and Robert Menendez (N.J.), had a conference call with gay organizations blaming Republicans for not including the same-sex provision in the bipartisan immigration proposal.

The advocates were told that Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-

Vt.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, would offer an amendment to include the provision in any comprehensive legislation that is formally introduced, according to a person involved in the call.

Meanwhile, tens of thousands of same-sex couples wait in limbo. Although the Obama administration has been using its prosecutorial discretion to avoid deporting partners who are illegally in the country, many couples say uncertainty makes it impossible to plan for the long term.

“It’s on our mind every day,” said Coco, who has been married to Oliveira since 2005 and lives in Haverhill, Mass. “We’re always worried about our future.”

Obama — who endorsed same-sex marriage in the spring — received broad support and significant campaign funds from the LGBT community. On the campaign trail, Obama often touted as a major achievement his administration’s ending of the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy toward gays.

“He’s proven that especially on lesbian [and] gay issues, when he stands up and works for change, that the American public and Congress comes along with him,” said Steve Ralls, a spokesman for Immigration Equality, a group pushing for same-sex immigration protections. “That will be the case here, too.”

Felipe Sousa-Rodriguez, national field director of GetEqual, a gay civil rights organization, said Obama gave a “really strong vision” for gay rights in his inauguration speech last month.

“I hope that’s more than words and will actually bring concrete actions,” Sousa-Rodriguez said. If Obama does not fight hard for the same-sex provision, he added, “I’ll be highly disappointed.”

Not all gay rights groups are united. Some activists said they would not stand in the way of an immigration deal without the same-sex couples provision if the alternative was no reform deal at all. These activists said an overall policy encouraging citizenship could help up to 700,000 illegal immigrants who are estimated to be gay.

Questions of timing

In the meantime, the Supreme Court is reviewing the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act, a federal law that mandates marriage benefits only for heterosexual couples. Some gay rights advocates said that if the court strikes down the law, perhaps as early as June, the question of a same-sex provision in immigration law could be rendered irrelevant.

That’s little solace for Coco and Oliveira, who spent three years of their marriage apart, after an immigration judge ordered Oli­veira to return to Brazil in 2007. Only after Kerry, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano made personal appeals for the couple in 2010 did immigration officials grant Oliveira a one-year visa on humanitarian grounds.

With that ruling expired, Kerry stepped in again Jan. 22 with his final Senate bill on behalf of Oliveira, who will be allowed to stay in the country as the legislation is deliberated. Coco, an ad agency owner, doesn’t expect it to be approved.

“It took a while for President Obama to evolve on gay marriage, but the nation has evolved much further if you look at the public polls,” Coco said. “I believe the president has some obligation to push the envelope. The time has come.”"

In an interview with CBS News airing during the Super Bowl show Sunday, Obama said, “My attitude is that gays and lesbians should have access and opportunity the same way everybody else does, in every institution and walk of life.” He called the Scouts “a great institution” that offers skills that benefit children throughout their lives.

The Scouts announced last week that its national board would discuss allowing local groups to decide whether to admit gays. The board’s meeting begins in Irving, Texas, on Monday.

The announcement follows a decades-old determination to bar homosexual boys and adult leaders – a ban the Scouts reaffirmed in July.

Weeks after the organization did so, the White House told the Washington Blade that Obama opposed the ban.

The president considers the Scouts “a valuable organization that has helped educate and build character,” White House spokesman Shin Inouye said in the statement, which continued: “He also opposes discrimination in all forms, and as such opposes this policy that discriminates on basis of sexual orientation.”

Obama is honorary president of the Boy Scouts of America.

“The policy change under discussion would allow the religious, civic or educational organizations that oversee and deliver scouting to determine how to address this issue,” Scouts spokesman Deron Smith said in a statement. “The Boy Scouts would not, under any circumstances, dictate a position to units, members or parents.”

The proposed change is likely to be controversial. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, an Eagle Scout, says he will defend the current policy. In addition, a majority of local chartering groups are faith-based, including the Roman Catholic and Mormon churches. Both are likely to continue to bar gay scouts and leaders, whatever the Boy Scouts’ national board decides.

WASHINGTON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Some U.S. business interests intend to signal support for gay marriage by signing on to two briefs due to be filed this week with the U.S. Supreme Court, according to lawyers involved in the process who argue that gay rights are good for business.

Various companies are set to join separate friend-of-the-court briefs, one expected on Wednesday in a case challenging the federal Defense of Marriage Act and one due on Thursday in a case that questions a California law that banned gay marriage.

Major companies are to urge the court to invalidate Proposition 8, the California law in question, and strike down Section 3 of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as between one man and one woman.

The brief to be filed in the Proposition 8 case, a draft of which was obtained by Reuters, has been joined by such companies as Apple Inc, Nike Inc, Facebook Inc, Morgan Stanley, Intel Corp, Xerox Corp, AIG Inc and Cisco Systems Inc.

The two cases are to be argued on March 26 and 27.

In briefs already filed in support of marriage being restricted to heterosexual unions, business interests have not been represented. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has not taken a position on the issue.

Lawyers at the Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe law firm, which is handling the Proposition 8 brief, said more names could be added to the list before it is filed on Thursday.

In the DOMA case, a source close to the case said a similar brief with more than 250 signatories is due to be filed with the Supreme Court on Wednesday.

In the Proposition 8 brief, attorney Joshua Rosenkranz wrote that companies believe that the ban and other laws like it ""inflict real and wholly unnecessary injury on business.""

""By marginalizing same-sex couples and foreclosing gay men and lesbians from forming 'married' families, these bans on equal access to marriage stigmatize gay men and lesbians and deprive them of the benefits intrinsic to marriage,"" he added.

Even if a corporation welcomes gay and lesbian unions, ""it cannot overcome the societal stigma institutionalized by Proposition 8 and similar laws,"" Rosenkranz wrote.

He also made the argument that there is ""a strong business case"" for recognizing same-sex marriage. Gay marriage bans ""can impede business efforts to recruit, hire and retain the best workers,"" he added."
http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-08-08/news/ct-met-great-lakes-court-martial-20130808_1_russell-military-judge-north-chicago,2013-08-08 00:00:00,"['Dan Hinkel', 'Chicago Tribune Reporter']",Lesbian Great Lakes sailor cleared of fraternization at court-martial,"Ending a court-martial that brought attention to the military's treatment of gay service members following the demise of ""don't ask, don't tell,"" a judge on Wednesday dismissed a charge against a female sailor accused of an inappropriate relationship with another servicewoman at Naval Station Great Lakes.

Chief Petty Officer Sabrina Russell had been accused of having an ""unduly familiar personal relationship"" with Petty Officer 1st Class Jodi Geibel that violated military rules prohibiting higher-ranking enlisted personnel from having romantic or other close relationships with lower-ranking personnel within the same command.

Navy prosecutors argued that the so-called fraternization rules applied equally to homosexual and heterosexual couples, while Russell's lawyer said the charge was discriminatory.

After testimony in a courtroom on the Navy base north of Chicago, the military judge, Cmdr. Charles Stimson, granted a request by Russell's attorney to dismiss the case after ruling that prosecutors had not proved a key element of the alleged offense — that the couple's conduct was ""prejudicial to good order and discipline.""

Prosecutors never argued that the relationship, kept largely secret until base officials learned the two had been joined in a civil union in Lake County court, affected either woman's work.

A jury of fellow sailors was assembled for the court-martial, but the judge's decision meant the defense didn't have to present a case. His ruling ends the matter and the charge cannot be brought again, defense lawyer Eric Montalvo said.

Russell, 31, dressed in a summer uniform with a short-sleeved white shirt, maintained the stoic bearing she kept through most of the trial as the judge read his ruling. In the gallery, dressed in a blue and gray camouflage uniform, Geibel, 32, visibly struggled to hold back tears before wiping them from her eyes. The pair did not hug or show any expression of relief or excitement before leaving the courtroom.

Outside court, Montalvo said Russell was ""relieved"" and ""looking forward to going back to being the good sailor that she was"" before being charged with an offense that could have led to her discharge.

Montalvo noted that while the military's ban on gays serving openly has been repealed, some service members have yet to accept homosexual colleagues. He cited jury selection, which was drawn out by questioning of prospective jurors who voiced personal objections to homosexuality or gay marriage.

""Hopefully, (the ruling) is a little signal to these people that times are changing,"" Montalvo said.

Through Montalvo, Russell and Geibel declined to comment.

The pair first connected on Facebook while Russell was deployed to Afghanistan in 2010, Montalvo said, when the women shared the same rank. But Russell was promoted before she reported to the base near North Chicago in 2012, he said. They started dating and were joined in a civil union in November. They also moved in together west of the base in Hainesville, where they are raising two daughters from Geibel's past relationship.

The case developed after a fellow sailor looked at Russell's phone without her permission in December, saw a photograph of the civil union ceremony, snapped a picture of it with his own phone and showed it to base officials, that sailor testified.

Montalvo argued that the sailor and another male serviceman had pushed the issue of the gay relationship because they were angry at the female couple for reporting unrelated alleged instances of sexual harassment.

Both women were offered the chance to avoid court-martial proceedings by opting for ""nonjudicial punishment,"" Montalvo said. Geibel accepted nonjudicial punishment and was fined $2,000 and stripped of her job specialty as a recruit division commander, Montalvo said. She is appealing the ruling, the defense lawyer said.

Russell chose the court-martial, believing she'd done nothing wrong, her lawyer said.

The court-martial resembled a civilian court hearing with a few unmistakable differences. Almost all Navy personnel wore their white short-sleeved uniforms, and a sailor's authority or occupation could often be determined by the decorations on his or her shoulders. The judge's shoulders, for instance, carried the three golden stripes of a commander.

While a civilian trial can quickly flash from staid to emotional and unruly, the court-martial was rigidly formal. The prosecutor and defendant snapped to attention when the judge or jurors — a group of three enlisted sailors and three officers — entered the courtroom.

Though the military ban on openly gay service members has been gone for two years, jury selection showed that personal opinions about homosexuality vary widely among the rank and file. Indeed, the issue contributed to a delay in the trial when the judge disqualified potential jurors based on their ideas about gay relationships.

The judge eliminated one potential juror who said he was a Lutheran chaplain and would not marry a same-sex couple.

The judge struck another potential juror who said he believed civil unions to be unconstitutional. The prospective juror also said that if his best friend of many years came out to him as gay, he would stop being his friend. After that potential juror left the courtroom, Russell could be seen clenching her jaw and wiping tears from her eyes.

The sailor's statements were ""hurtful,"" Montalvo said.

""You may have personal issues, but acceptance and tolerance are … the way ahead,"" he said.

The military prosecutor left the courtroom shortly after the ruling and did not comment.

Sandy Rios, American Family Association talk show host and Fox News contributor, broached the topic of same-sex marriage while speaking with Chicago anti-gay pastor Erwin Lutzer last week, Right Wing Watch notes. Lutzer said one opposition against same-sex marriage is that the city's crime is bad enough and they don't need the ""destruction of marriage"" as well.

The two also agreed that love shouldn't be reason enough to allow same-sex couples to marry.

""A pedophile I'm sure says that he loves children -- as a matter of fact, he does -- but you can see how destructive that love is,"" Lutzer said. ""Once love is undefined as kind of this 'I want to do this and so I'm loving' then, of course, we end up where we are ending up today with a great slide in morality, the destruction of the family, the confusion that children grow up with. All of these implications...""

""You know, the gentleman that was just sentenced yesterday for holding those women hostage in Ohio, and molesting them for years, and doing terrible things to them,"" Rios continued, ""His defense was that he ‘loved’ his family, he ‘loved’ his child that was born out of one of the rapes that he did of the woman. He ‘loved’ and he couldn’t understand. He said, ‘I’m not a monster.’”



Rios was referring to Castro, a kidnapper and rapist who kept victims Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus captive in his Cleveland home for a decade. Castro pleaded guilty to 937 counts last week, including murder and kidnapping, and was sentenced to life plus 1,000 years in prison. During the Aug. 1 hearing, he claimed “most of the sex that went on in that house, probably all of it, was consensual.” He also denied being a monster, saying he ""simply kept them [in his house] without them being able to leave.”

David Badash of the New Civil Rights Movement called Rios' comments both ""offensive and ludicrous.""

Pendleton, an honor student and band majorette at King College Prep, had participated in inaugural festivities near Washington about a week before her death.

The White House announced today that the first lady would attend the Saturday morning services at Greater Harvest Baptist Church on the South Side. The first lady is not expected to make public remarks, and the Obamas’ daughters, Malia and Sasha, are not expected to accompany their mother.

“As a mother and Chicagoan, the first lady was heartbroken to learn of the tragic loss of Hadiya Pendleton due to senseless gun violence,” said Kristina Schake, communications director for Michelle Obama. “Too many times, we’ve seen young people struck down with so much of their lives ahead of them. The first lady is traveling to her funeral on Saturday to offer her condolences and support to Hadiya’s family and loved ones.”

Scheduled to speak at the funeral is Gov. Pat Quinn, who mentioned Pendleton during his annual State of the State speech on Wednesday as he called for tougher gun control measures. Quinn said he spoke to the teen’s family this week.



""There are no words in the English language, or any language, to relieve the pain of parents who lose a child,"" said Quinn, who has two adult sons.



A White House source said senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and Education Secretary Arne Duncan also will attend the funeral. Both are Chicagoans.

Community activists had urged the Obamas to come to Chicago to speak out about recent violence. A petition on the White House website had called on the Obamas to attend Pendleton’s funeral.

The president reached out to the family last week to offer his condolences, according to people close to the family. Early on, the family had expressed concern that the president’s attendance would overshadow the funeral and make it difficult for Pendleton’s many friends to say their goodbyes to her.

After learning today that the first lady planned to attend, Shatira Wilks, a cousin who serves as the family’s spokesperson, said they are still committed to making the funeral a celebration of the teen’s life.

“It’s a nice gesture and we appreciate it,” Wilks said. “But that is who we are.”

Those close to the family said the parents are still trying to come to grips with what has happened.

“It’s a lot to take in. It’s an overwhelming experience,” said LaKeisha Stewart, Hadiya’s godmother. “We are very thankful the people are coming to support the family. We realize that this young lady has touched a lot of people and this goes beyond us.”

Pendleton was killed at Harsh Park on Jan. 29, near the end of the deadliest January for Chicago homicides in a decade. There is a $40,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest in the teen’s death.

Visitation is scheduled for 2 to 9 p.m. Friday in Calahan Funeral Home at 7030 S. Halsted St. On Saturday, the wake continues at 9 a.m. followed by the funeral at 11 a.m. in Greater Harvest Baptist Church, 5141 S. State St.
