The Government Accountability Office estimated that the agency made the potential cash benefit overpayments to about 36,000 individuals from December 2010 to January 2013.

The numbers represent less than 1 percent of beneficiaries and less than 1 percent of disability payments made during the time frame. But GAO said the overpayments reveal weaknesses in Social Security's procedures for policing the system.

The precise number of individuals who received improper disability payments and the exact amount of improper payments made to those recipients cannot be determined without detailed case investigations, according to the report.

The report comes as Social Security's disability program faces a financial crisis. If Congress doesn't act, the trust fund that supports the disability program will run out of money in 2016, according to projections by Social Security's trustees. At that point, the system will collect only enough money in payroll taxes to pay 80 percent of benefits, triggering an automatic 20 percent cut in benefits.

Congress could redirect money from Social Security's much bigger retirement program to shore up the disability program, as it did in 1994. But that would worsen the finances of the retirement program, which is facing its own long-term financial problems.

""This report demonstrates just how little importance the Social Security Administration places on policing its disability rolls,"" said Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, the ranking Republican on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. ""SSA has known for years that it could prevent millions of dollars in improper disability payments using quarterly wage records, but chose not to.""

Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said the report offers common-sense steps that the Social Security Administration can take in order to avoid improper payments.

""However, if we're serious about preventing waste and fraud and ensuring that these critical benefits get to the people who need and deserve them, Congress must also do its part and provide needed resources and access to basic anti-fraud data to the Social Security Administration,"" Carper said.

The Social Security Administration said its accuracy rate for disability payments is more than 99 percent. But the agency noted that even small errors translate into big numbers.

""We are planning to do an investigation, and we will recoup any improper payments from beneficiaries,"" Social Security spokesman Mark Hinkle said. ""It is too soon to tell what caused these overpayments, but if we determine that fraud is involved, we will refer these cases to our office of the inspector general for investigation.""

More than 8.2 million disabled workers received disability payments in December 2010, a figure that has grown to nearly 9 million. Last year, the agency paid out $137 billion in disability payments.

Before people can receive disability benefits, there is a 5-month waiting period in which they can, in general, earn no more than about $1,000 a month. The waiting period is to ensure that beneficiaries have long-term disabilities.

Using a federal wage database, investigators checked whether a sample of disability beneficiaries had worked and earned significant wages during the waiting period, the report said. They found that most of the improper payments went to people who worked during the five months they waited for payments to begin.

Once people start receiving benefits, they can return to work and still get benefits during a trial work period, in an attempt to re-enter the workforce. Using the same wage database, investigators checked whether another sample of disability beneficiaries earned significant wages after their trial work period had ended, the report said.

Based on their findings, the GAO estimated the amount of improper payments and the number of people receiving them.

Citing a potential weakness, the report said Social Security might not detect a person who worked during the waiting period if the period started in one year and ended in another. For example, if Social Security starts paying benefits in February, the agency might not detect significant wages earned the previous November because they weren't earned in the same year that benefits were awarded, the report said.

In a written response to the report, the Social Security Administration agency questioned whether GAO overestimated the amount of overpayments. The agency said investigators did not determine whether the work activity qualified as an unsuccessful attempt to return to work, or whether there were any other special circumstances.

The president won%27t negotiate in bipartisan way on Obamacare%2C government funding%2C or the debt limit.

Senate Democrats%2C acting in concert with President Obama%2C have rejected four different proposals.

The president says that in divided government%2C no one gets 100%25 of what they want.

The president isn't telling the whole story when it comes to the government shutdown. The fact is that Washington Democrats have slammed the door on reopening the government by refusing to engage in bipartisan talks. And, as stories across the country highlight the devastating impact of Obamacare on families and small businesses, they continue to reject our calls for fairness for all Americans.

This is part of a larger pattern: the president's scorched-Earth policy of refusing to negotiate in bipartisan way on his health care law, current government funding, or the debt limit.

As of this morning, Senate Democrats, acting in concert with President Obama, have rejected four different proposals from the House of Representatives to keep the government running and fund basic services.

On Friday, September 20, 2013, the House of Representatives passed legislation to keep the government running – funding Medicare, Social Security, veterans benefits, and more – while removing funding for the president's health care law, which is driving up costs and hurting our economy.

The Democratic-controlled Senate rejected this measure.

On Saturday, September 28, 2013, the House passed another measure to keep the government running, delay the president's health care law for one year, and permanently repeal Obamacare's tax on pacemakers and children's hearing aids.

Senate Democrats rejected the measure on a party-line vote.

(The House also passed the Pay Our Military Act, which ensures our troops are paid during a government shutdown. Thankfully, that measure was adopted by the Senate and signed by President Obama.)

On Monday, September 30, 2013, the House passed yet another measure to keep the government running and ensure fairness for all Americans under the president's health care law. President Obama delayed the law's mandates on big businesses and insurance companies; this bill would delay the law for everyone.

The Senate rejected this measure too.

The House then passed another bill late on Monday requesting a formal conference committee with the Senate to come to an agreement on legislation that provides funding for the federal government and delays the president's health care law for all Americans. That is the system the Founding Fathers gave us to resolve differences between the House and Senate.

The Senate then opposed that measure as well, so Senate Democrats and President Obama got their government shutdown.

In the meantime, in just a few weeks, Congress must act to raise the debt limit to pay the tab for President Obama and Washington's out-of-control spending. There is no way Congress can or should pass such a bill without spending cuts and reforms to deal with the debt and deficit and help get our economy moving again. But President Obama refuses to even talk about negotiating such a bipartisan agreement.

For years, the president has said that in a divided government, no one gets 100% of what they want. But when will his words match his actions?

As for House Republicans, we will continue our efforts to keep the government running and deal honestly with the problems we face. We hope that Senate Democrats – and President Obama – change course and start working with us on behalf of the American people.

Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, is speaker of the House."

http://news.yahoo.com/scary-message-everybody-obamas-budget-165520713.html,,[],The Scary Message for Everybody in Obama's Budget,"Most Americans will ignore the dickering over the federal budget that President Barack Obama wants Congress to pass this year. But there's an important message for just about everybody in that budget: The pain is going to get worse.

[READ: Ryan's Budget Is About One Thing: Medicare]

It would be easy to conclude that Washington has imposed enough austerity on the U.S. economy already, given the tax hikes and spending cuts that have already gone into effect this year. Those measures, if they stick, will reduce the national debt by perhaps $2.5 trillion during the next decade.

But that's not enough. Budget experts say Congress needs to cut the debt by at least $4 trillion, plus figure out ways to rein in the mushrooming cost of the biggest budget-busting programs: Social Security, Medicaid and especially Medicare. Budget measures up till now have done nothing about those so-called entitlement programs, but Obama is finally seeking some reforms.

The changes Obama is calling for are less drastic than those advocated by Republicans such as Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Budget Committee. Among other things, Ryan's plan would transfer a major portion of Medicare costs to individuals, as a way of making the whole program more affordable. But Obama would still change entitlements in ways that would have a direct impact on people enrolled in them, in many cases reducing benefits and requiring enrollees to spend more of their own money.

[ENJOY: Political Cartoons on the Deficit and Budget]

Obama, for instance, wants to reformulate the way cost-of-living increases for Social Security payments get calculated. Many experts say switching to a so-called ""chained"" consumer price index would be a more accurate way to measure inflation. But in general it would mean lower cost of living increases for Social Security recipients. For a typical retiree, a 1 percentage point reduction in the cost-of-living increase would cut Social Security payments by about $150 per year.

Story continues

Relatively minor adjustments might be enough to make Social security more stable, but Medicare is a bigger problem. Obama wants to make some administrative changes in the program that might lower payments to healthcare providers, while also reducing benefits or raising premiums for wealthier Medicare patients. But on its current course Medicare is headed for insolvency, and Obama's moves probably wouldn't be enough to change that. At some point, bigger cuts will be needed, with most seniors likely to pay more.

The next several months in Washington will be dominated by news coverage of political posturing on the budget. Democrats and Republicans will accuse each other of selling out seniors and pandering to favored interest groups. We all know the drill, which is why so many people will tune out the overwrought rhetoric.

[READ: Both Parties Bemoan Obama's Budget Proposal]

But it's important to notice the broader message, which is that the government is going to do less for people in the future, and ask more of them. Obama, for example, has said he'd only agree to cutbacks in Medicare and Social Security if Republicans agree to further tax increases on the wealthy. Many economists think tax hikes will have to be more widespread than that at some point, with no way around middle-class tax increases if problems with the federal budget become acute.

Liberal groups are outraged that Obama would propose any change at all in entitlement programs, while conservatives insist they won't agree to any more tax increases, no matter what. That's predictable posturing at either end of the political spectrum. Just about everybody in between knows that eventually there will be more spending cuts and higher taxes. Smart Americans will plan for it.

A Nevada Native', 'He Joined The Times In After Graduating The University Of Nevada', 'Reno. He Has Previously Worked As A Reporter For Newspapers In Minnesota', 'Virginia']","California adds jobs, but unemployment rate rises to 8.9%","California’s employers created 29,100 net jobs in August, but the unemployment rate edged up for the second month in a row, climbing to 8.9% from 8.7% the month before, the state’s Employment Development Department reported Friday.

The jobless rate has climbed nearly half a percentage point since June even as employers have added nearly 57,000 jobs to their payrolls during that time.

Friday’s data painted a tepid picture of the Golden State’s economy, which has hit a soft patch during the summer months, economists said. The labor force has declined by 65,000 people since June.

“The labor market appears to be going sideways,” said Robert Kleinhenz, chief economist at Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. “We see a month of improvement and maybe a month of retrenchment, and that’s a discouraging story to report.”

Earlier this year, California was outpacing the nation’s rate of job creation, with payroll growth hovering around 2%. But since August 2012, the state has added 223,900 jobs for a growth rate of 1.5%.

“Here we are in the middle of the year ... and the economy has shifted down to second gear,” Kleinhenz said.

Still, the payroll numbers show California has continued adding jobs. Those numbers are derived from a separate survey than the unemployment rate and are considered more reliable because the payroll survey takes in a larger sample of businesses and fluctuates less from month to month.

California’s net increase of 29,100 jobs in August was spread across nine of 11 sectors.

The most jobs were added in the construction industry, which expanded by 7,700 positions last month. The sector is still thousands of jobs below its pre-recession peak, when contractors were throwing up new homes at a breakneck pace.

The housing recovery has lent a huge assist as demand for multi-unit housing continues propelling economic growth. That has led to construction posting the fastest growth rate — 5% — of all sectors. It has added 29,100 jobs since August 2012.

The professional and business services sector, which includes occupations such as lawyers, accountants and engineers, added 6,300 jobs last month. Educational and health services added 4,300 jobs; leisure and hospitality grew by 3,000 jobs.

Reflecting muted expectations by retailers for the holiday shopping season, retail and wholesale trade declined by a combined 5,000 jobs in August.

In its latest monthly review, the National Retail Federation said consumer spending has grown only modestly through the recovery.

“It is impossible to generate stronger economic growth in a consumer-based economy if personal income gains remain weak,” according to the federation’s September report written by its chief economist, Jack Kleinhenz.

The sluggishness of the labor market has frustrated 42-year-old Melvina White, a former medical assistant who has been out of work since 2009.

In recent months, she has broadened her job search outside the medical field to include jobs in retail and fast food. But with such a large gap in her work history, employers haven’t given her applications more than a cursory glance, she said.

“At this point, I’m looking for anything,” White said.

These days, she’s living with an aunt in Los Angeles and relies on public transit to get around the city. Going back to school to beef up her skills is tough without a job to cover costs, she said.

“From my perspective, it’s getting worse,” White said. “At this point, I’m getting ready to leave California.”

Friday’s jobs report comes on the heels of the surprise decision this week by the Federal Reserve to keep its monetary policy in place. Despite an improvement in the U.S. unemployment rate, Fed policymakers said Wednesday that the economy is still not strong enough to handle a reduction in a key stimulus program.

The Fed also downgraded its forecast for economic growth. Policymakers now expect 2013 growth to be between 2% and 2.3% — down from the June forecast of 2.3% to 2.6%.

The U.S. economy faces the threat of a federal government shutdown as well: House Republicans approved a spending bill Friday that would defund President Obama’s healthcare law, setting up a showdown with the Democratic-controlled Senate. If the impasse isn’t resolved in the next few weeks, it risks causing the first government shutdown in two decades. That could throw a wrench into job growth later this year, economists said.

Barring a government shutdown and any unexpected calamity, California’s job growth is expected to pick up later this year as government tax revenue recovers and Europe’s economy improves. Those factors should offset the decline in government jobs and boost manufacturing and trade, said Esmael Adibi, director of Chapman University’s A. Gary Anderson Center for Economic Research.

Southern California counties all notched job gains last month, helping push down local unemployment rates in most counties.

Los Angeles County payrolls added 6,500 jobs, but the county’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 10.1% from 9.9% the month before, partly because its labor force grew by 12,000.

Orange County added 2,400 jobs last month, pushing down its unemployment rate to 6.2% from 6.5% the month before. San Diego County added nearly 3,000 jobs, and its unemployment rate declined to 7.4% last month from 7.8% in July.

The Inland Empire, which includes Riverside and San Bernardino counties, added 14,100 jobs. Its unemployment rate dropped to 10.4% last month from 11% in July.

Civil War,"Late last week, as the G.O.P. descended ever-deeper into civil war, Matt Yglesias and Jonathan Chait both had pieces up marveling at the absence of any actual policy disagreement between the populists driving the shutdown and the establishment/leadership/Senate Republicans trying to find a way out. “Intra-party schisms … are usually rooted in policy,” Chait wrote, but “mainstream Republicans and the tea party have fallen out almost entirely over political tactics.” Yglesias agreed, contrasting the party’s split on foreign policy, where there’s a big substantive gap between the Rand Paul/Justin Amash/Mike Lee libertarian wing and the more hawkish old guard, with the purely tactical split on economic policy:

… Republicans all agree that taxes should be lower, and that it’s especially important to fight for lower tax rates on high earners who productivity and business investments drive the economy forward. Republicans also all agree that this tax cutting agenda requires less spending on domestic programs. And they agree that programs that bolster the incomes of low-income families (as opposed to, say, farm subsidies or war memorials) are especially pernicious because they subsidize indolence.

The entire disagreement is about how and when to push this agenda of more money for the rich and less for the struggling. The question of whether this is the right agenda isn’t really on the table.

I actually almost wish this were true, because it would simplify matters for those of us doomed to have some rooting interest in these kind of intra-Republican battles. But there is an inchoate policy struggle going on here, beneath the surface of the (admittedly much more important) tactical debate and culture war sound and fury, and it relates directly to the question of where the Republican Party should stand in its relationship to big business on the one hand, and the middle class on the other.

Yglesias writes, for instance, that the G.O.P. is united in prioritizing farm subsidies over programs for the poor. But who pushed hardest against the party’s agribusiness handouts, angering even some Tea Party Republicans in the process? Heritage Action, the same group pushing the defund campaign that gave us the shutdown. Or again, Yglesias writes that the G.O.P. is united in its focus on top marginal rate reductions as the be-all and and end-all of conservative economic policy and right-of-center tax reform. But which Republican Senator recently broke with that consensus to propose a a tax reform pitched to middle class families? That would be Mike Lee, the same senator who’s been standing shoulder to shoulder with Ted Cruz these last two weeks.

Or look at the “defund Obamacare” debate itself. If you follow the ins-and-outs of the strategic debate on the right, one of the core issues has been whether to hold firm in demanding at least a one-year delay of the individual mandate, or whether to fall back to something like the medical device tax delay or repeal (which is, as of this writing, being wrapped into the bill that House leadership is trying to push through their body today). The former is the populist position, roughly speaking; the latter is the more moderate/establishment goal. And you will note that the populist goal has a direct connection to middle class economic interests — since for at least some middle-income Americans, the mandate will turn out to be a fine for not purchasing a product that’s suddenly become more expensive — whereas the more moderate ambition mostly sets hearts aflutter in the medical device industry and on K Street. (You can argue that the medical device tax is ultimately passed on to the middle class, of course, but the connection is much more indirect than the mandate.)

Now I’m not arguing that the Lee tax plan, the Heritage Foundation’s opposition to farm subsidies and a focus on the mandate rather than the medical device tax add up to a coherent agenda that’s actually shared by most of the House Intransigents. Many if not most of the members in question fit the Yglesias-Chait description pretty well: They have deeply conventional right-wing views, and they’re just more, well, intransigent about them. (As I noted above, many of the Intransigents broke with Heritage when it held firm on the farm bill, and I doubt many of them have even heard of the Lee tax plan.) And even if there were a coherent populist agenda, it wouldn’t change the fact that the shutdown strategy has proven a comprehensively, transparently hapless means for furthering it.

Yet at the same time, to the extent that policy differences are driving the current intra-G.O.P. fight, the populists tend to have 1) decent ideas and 2) a better sense than their establishment rivals of how to brand the party as something other than just a tool of rich people and business interests. Their strategy is disastrous, but their substance has something to recommend it. Which is part of the reason why it isn’t enough, for the Republicans to escape their current cul-de-sac, for the party leadership to “win” and the populist base to “lose” — let alone for the leadership to somehow jettison the base. Instead, somebody, somehow, has to both integrate and purge — leaving the Tea Party’s baggage by the roadside while continuing to speak to populist impulses and taking up populist ideas, and folding both into a strategic vision that’s more connected to political reality than what we’ve seen these last few weeks.

Somehow."

(CNN) —

How bad of a year was 2013 for President Barack Obama? The economy is strengthening as he starts to wind down America’s longest war, but his poll numbers are the lowest since he took office almost five years ago.

Usually, a growing economy and bringing the troops home mean public love for the commander in chief, but not this time.

The flush of success from Obama’s re-election last year faded quickly as his administration faced a series of controversies – some unavoidable and some self-inflicted – that eroded Obama’s credibility along with the belief that he can bring about the kind of change he called for in running for president.

“People don’t think he’s as competent as they used to think,” said CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger. “They don’t think he’s as trustworthy as they used to think.”

Here are six reasons for the President’s difficult year, starting with his greatest achievement toward the promised change of his first term that became perhaps his biggest liability: the health care reforms known as Obamacare.

1) Obamacare blues

If one day in 2013 exemplified Obama’s change in fortune from his first term, it was October 1.

That was the launch of the long-awaited HealthCare.gov website that would, in Obama’s words, make getting health insurance required under the Affordable Care Act as easy as shopping on Amazon.com.

Obamacare site down… and back up

On the same day, a highly unpopular government shutdown started because of Republican demands to dismantle Obamacare as part of a needed spending measure to keep federal agencies running.

It should have been a decisive double play for Democrats, with public anger at Republicans over the eventual 16-day shutdown rising as Americans finally got to experience the full benefits of the health care reforms they had been promised since the law was passed in 2010.

But the website malfunctioned badly from the start, with repeated stalling and error messages that made successful navigation impossible for most users.

Once the shutdown ended on October 16, media focus shifted to the full extent of the Obamacare website problems.

CNN poll: Democrats lose 2014 advantage in Obamacare uproar

That gave Republicans fiercely opposed to the health care reforms a new opening to attack both the overall law and the big government approach of Democrats.

On top of all this came reports that insurers were sending cancellation notices to individual policy holders that undermined Obama’s repeated pledge of previous years that “if you like your health care plan, you can keep it.”

While less than 5% of the population, the individual health insurance market comprised several million people whose stories of canceled policies took over the media narrative. PolitiFact declared Obama’s false promise its “lie of the year.”

Now Republicans trying to dismantle the reforms warn of more hidden impacts including higher premiums and canceled coverage in the first full year of Obamacare in 2014.

“This really represents the single … biggest instance of consumer fraud in the nation’s history,” GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas told reporters this week. “And the American people are increasingly led to the conclusion they cannot trust this administration to say what it means or mean what it says.”

Obama brought in outside tech experts to get the website working better, and enrollment figures increased in November and December. However, it remained unclear if the administration can regain control of the narrative.

On Friday, the website was down again for a few hours, but Obama boasted to reporters at his year-end news conference that more than 1 million people had enrolled so far.

2) How low can you go?

Polls show Obama’s support at the lowest levels of his presidency.

A new CNN/ORC International survey released Friday showed a drop of 14 percentage points since January in the President’s approval rating, down to 41%.

Meanwhile, an ABC News/Washington Post poll this week showed 45% of Americans trusted Republicans to do a better job handling the economy compared to 41% for Obama.

It was a different story last December, when the President had a 54%-36% advantage on the same question just after his re-election.

Poll: Obama loses large lead over GOP on key issues

“It’s crazy how this has switched, even given the fact that the Republicans blew the government shutdown like they did in October,” Borger said.

Obama shrugged off the low poll numbers on Friday, telling reporters at his year-end news conference that “if I was interested in polling, I wouldn’t have run for president.”

Instead, he cited continuing economic growth after the recession he inherited when he took office in January 2009 and other progress such as the growing Obamacare enrollment.

“That is a big deal. That’s why I ran for this office,” Obama said.

His approval ratings started declining in most national surveys in June as he dealt with controversies such as IRS targeting of tea party groups seeking tax-exempt status and classified leaks that revealed National Security Agency surveillance of phone records.

“Many people assume that Obama’s low approval ratings today are due to the flawed health care website that debuted in October,” CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said Thursday. “But the biggest drop in Obama’s numbers came in the late spring and early summer. In mid-May, Obama’s approval rating was at 53%; by mid-June, after revelations about the IRS and the NSA, it had dropped to 45% and stayed there for several months.”

Holland concluded: “It’s been a bad year for Obama, but his troubles didn’t start in October – they date back to May and June.”

3) Snowden leaks

The Patriot Act passed after the 9/11 attacks led to a huge NSA surveillance network that operated under review by secret courts, with little public knowledge.

Then former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked a trove of classified documents about it in June.

Suddenly, a program Obama inherited became a major problem, as Snowden’s revelations showed the government routinely collected phone records – but not the content of calls – for possible use in tracking terrorism suspects.

Suspicions that the government spied on its own people ensued, fueled by incomplete or misleading administration responses such as when Director of National Intelligence James Clapper denied to a congressional committee that such surveillance occurred.

Snowden’s leaks also made public embarrassing revelations of U.S. spying on allies such as Brazil, France, Mexico and Germany.

While Obama never personally bore the brunt of direct responsibility for the extent of the NSA surveillance, the Snowden leaks enhanced a public perception of an administration steeped in secret activities that it denied or tried to continue hiding.

Surveillance program now Obama’s to own

The issue caused rifts in Obama’s Democratic base, with liberals opposed to the surveillance that the President defended as important for national security.

He also has angered the liberal wing by continuing the policy of his immediate predecessor, Republican President George W. Bush, to use drone strikes against terrorism targets abroad.

4) IRS targeting

An inspector general’s report in May that showed the IRS targeted conservative groups in determining extra scrutiny of applications for tax-exempt status was the scandal du jour in Washington before being relegated to back-burner status by the Snowden leaks.

Republicans called the targeting a conspiracy of Nixonian dimensions, while Democrats condemned it as bureaucratic rather than political malfeasance.

IRS proposes new rules for tax-exempt organizations

An internal investigation found no evidence of anti-conservative conspiracy, and officials eventually determined that IRS employees also used terms referring to liberal or progressive groups in their screening.

Regardless of the outcome, the IRS controversy bolstered Republican efforts to portray the administration as willing to push a partisan agenda to the edge of legal limits and perhaps beyond.

5) Stalled agenda

CNN Chief National Correspondent John King called Obama “0 for-2013” in terms of what he proposed in his State of the Union Address in February with what got passed by Congress.

No immigration reform. No jobs program. No tax reform. No increase in the minimum wage. No expanded background checks on gun purchases in the wake of the Newtown school massacre despite a major push by the President.

Obama and Democrats blame Republicans for obstructing possible progress in a divided government with different parties controlling the House and Senate.

“This last year has been totally obstructed. Everything we’ve tried to do, we have been stopped,” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid complained on Thursday.

Republicans contend it was Obama who prevented progress by refusing to seriously consider their positions or concerns, accusing him of a “my way or the highway” approach.

The partisan impasse was most evident in the repeated showdowns over federal spending that culminated in the October shutdown.

Conservative Republicans got the most blame for the shutdown because of their failed effort to tie the budget negotiations to dismantling Obamacare.

But polls showed public anger at everyone over the brinkmanship that economists said hindered the nation’s slow but steady economic growth.

A budget compromise worked out after the shutdown amounted to rare bipartisan cooperation on spending issues.

The House and Senate easily passed the two-year spending framework that puts off further shutdowns over the budget until after next year’s congressional elections, and Obama has signaled he will sign it.

“It’s probably too early to declare an outbreak of bipartisanship, but it’s also fair to say that we’re not condemned to endless gridlock” that led to the government shutdown in October, Obama said on Friday.

The question is whether election year politics will bring the usual hardening of partisan positions, or if legislators believe further compromise will boost their standing with voters.

Obama called for Congress to make 2014 a “year of action” on issues such as immigration reform, job creation and expanding background checks on gun buyers.

However, he refused to budge in his rejection of Republican calls for concessions in return for their agreement to increase the federal borrowing limit – known as the debt ceiling – when required as soon as early March.

6) Reality versus perception

What do you remember about Obama’s speech at Nelson Mandela’s funeral?

For most people, the answer will be the interpreter accused of making up sign language, or Obama huddling with the Danish and British prime ministers for an apparent “selfie” photo, rather than anything the President said.

He isn’t the first President to be trivialized by the media and joked about on late-night talk shows, but coupled with the endless Republican attacks and low poll numbers, the perception of Obama has changed dramatically from the freshly re-elected leader praised for a dynamic inauguration speech last January.

Critics enjoyed skewering him over a series of diplomatic jabs scored by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who ignored a U.S. request to return classified leaker Snowden to face prosecution and intervened diplomatically in Syria after Obama failed to muster an international force to punish the Syrian regime for crossing his “red line” on using chemical weapons.

In the end, though, Obama appeared to get what he wanted without putting any U.S. troops at risk, as Syria – under pressure from ally Russia – handed over control of its known chemical weapons arsenal to the international community.

A bad year for sure, but not the death knell of his presidency.

“Can he turn it around? Sure he can,” CNN Political Commentator Ryan Lizza said. “I think his fortunes will be about the improving economy, and there’s a lot of good economic news coming out right now and 2014-2015. If the economy turns around, those (poll) numbers that we saw will turn around.”

http://news.yahoo.com/promises-promises-obama-curbs-ambition-time-075112535--politics.html,,[],"PROMISES, PROMISES: Obama curbs ambition this time","WASHINGTON (AP) — Despite a relentless workload ahead, President Barack Obama is lighter on his feet in one sense as he opens his second term. Gone are the hundreds of promises of the past. He's toting carry-ons instead of heavy cargo this time.

Obama's first presidential campaign and the years that followed were distinguished by an overflowing ambition, converted into a checklist of things he swore to do. The list was striking not only for its length but its breadth, ranging from tidbits in forgotten corners of public policy to grand — even grandiose — pronouncements worthy of Moses.

He made a sweeping vow to calm the rise of the seas. And a literally down-in-the-weeds pledge to aid the sage grouse and its grassy habitat.

Obama worked his way through that stockpile, breaking dozens of his promises along the way and keeping many more of them.

Thanks to the messy business of governing, the president's record on promises is not cut and dried. Some of his most notable flops, for example, contained seeds of future success.

Failing to achieve a promised first-term overhaul of immigration law, Obama took stopgap executive action to help as many as 1.7 million younger illegal immigrants stay in the country for up to two years. Now, after an election marked by Hispanic clout, he finds the political landscape more amenable to trying again.

Climate change legislation was another prominent broken pledge, but he came at the issue piecemeal, imposing the first regulations on heat-trapping gases blamed for global warming, setting tough controls on coal-fired power plants and greatly increasing fuel efficiency for cars and trucks.

Likewise, not all of his successes are all they were cracked up to be.

Yes, he achieved the transformational health care law, putting the U.S. on a path to universal coverage. But it remains in question whether costs will come under control as he said they would — and as the name of the Affordable Care Act implies. Obama swore a typical family's premium would drop by up to $2,500 a year by the end of his first term, but they've continued to rise. That's a broken promise tucked inside a kept one.

Story continues

Yes, Obama is extricating the U.S. from wars as he promised before and after he became president, but what instabilities does he leave behind? And how many troops? His vow that, in 2014, ""our longest war will be over"" is on track to be true in the main, yet thousands of troops might stay indefinitely in Afghanistan as a residual force once the bulk of the 66,000 now there are gone.

His promise to raise taxes on the rich finally came to be at the bitter end of the last Congress, during the debate to avoid going off the ""fiscal cliff"" of severe spending cuts and steep tax increases that would have started automatically absent an agreement. He also made good on his vow to hold rates steady for everyone else. (The fine print: Households making $250,000 to $400,000 are off the hook from the higher rates. Obama had said he'd tax them more, too.)

As for falling sensationally short, the bitterness in Congress on display in that debate, and so many others, was to be swept away as part of the change Obama promised to bring to Washington's ways and manners. Candidate Obama vowed to turn the page from ""ugly partisanship,"" only to concede that such a transformation was beyond his reach because ""you can't change Washington from the inside. You can only change it from the outside.""

If Obama can't be held responsible for cantankerous lawmakers, though, it's worth remembering that not all of the change he promised to bring to governance was centered on Congress. He also vowed to restrain the power of Washington's special interests by barring lobbyists from serving in his administration, only to backtrack by issuing waivers and other exceptions to those new rules. That was strictly an ""inside"" job.

On another key promise, deficits have shot up, not dropped by half as he pledged in his 2008 campaign and again as president when the recession was raging. That inherited recession, the halting recovery and his heavy spending to spur growth yielded four straight years of trillion-dollar deficits.

Ahead? A far leaner list, but still a tough one to achieve.

In the 2012 campaign, Obama counted ""comprehensive immigration reform"" as the first thing he would do this year after the fiscal-cliff deal. Dormant for years, gun control is back as an issue because of the deadly rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary and took top priority outside fiscal matters. But a push on immigration is coming.

Among other promises from the campaign:

—Make higher education affordable for everyone. Obama said he'll ensure by the end of the decade that the U.S. has more people with college degrees than any other country, recruit 100,000 math and science teachers in 10 years, help 2 million workers attend community college and seek to restrain the growth in college tuition by half over 10 years.

—Put government on a path to cutting deficits by $4 trillion over 10 years. That's off to a rocky start. The fiscal-cliff deal represented a failure to settle on a plan to reduce the national debt, instead increasing both spending and taxes while putting off decisions on the big budget cuts that will be essential to bringing down trillion-dollar deficits.

—Cut imports of foreign oil by half by 2020. Once a pipe dream of a succession of presidents, a path toward energy self-sufficiency has become more conceivable thanks to a boom in domestic production.

—End subsidies to the oil industry. A failed promise from the first term, it's given low odds of succeeding this time.

—Prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Obama has left open the possibility of military action if that's what it takes to stop Iranian nuclear development. Meantime, he's imposed stiff economic penalties on Iran to persuade it to cease uranium enrichment activity, so far without apparent success.

—""Continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet — because climate change is not a hoax."" When Obama secured the primary victories needed for the 2008 Democratic nomination, he pledged that future generations would look back on that very night as ""the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal."" At the heart of that was a pledge for strong action on climate change in his first term.

But legislation to cap emissions failed, without Obama leading a charge to pass it, and he all but stopped talking about the issue afterward.

Still, his administration began treating carbon dioxide as a pollutant under the law and steered billions of dollars into cleaner energy. The initiative could be revived in his new term, as an ""obligation to ourselves and to future generations,"" as he now puts it.

—Help factories double their exports, creating 1 million manufacturing jobs. It's a tall order because manufacturing jobs have been declining steadily for nearly two decades.

—Consolidate a ""whole bunch"" of federal agencies dealing with business issues into one new department led by a secretary of business.

Altogether, it's a more restrained to-do list than Obama produced for his first four years, when PolitiFact.com counted more than 500 Obama promises and found that 47 percent were kept, 23 percent broken and 25 percent ended in a compromise, with a smattering still in the works or stalled.

The sage grouse lucked out, gaining a Sage Grouse Initiative to give the species more grass cover for nesting. As promised.

He was lauded by some as fighting for jobs and opportunity, and even for launching a “war on inequality” equivalent to President Lyndon B. Johnson’s 1960s War on Poverty. He was assailed by others for showing his true colors as a man of big government and wealth redistribution.

Yet the initiatives Obama proposed are striking not for their sweep but for their limited scope. That reflects both pragmatism and realism: Not only is the age of big government really over, so is the age of government as the transformative force in American society. And that is all for the best.

Wait a minute, you might reasonably object: What about healthcare? What about the proposals for minimum -wage increases, for expanded preschool, for innovation centers, for $50 billion in spending on roads and infrastructure? Surely those are big government and aim, effectively or not, for transformation?

Healthcare and the changes under the Affordable Care Act are significant, and for now they have expanded the scope and cost of government However, those costs appear to be growing more slowly than expected, at least according to the Congressional Budget Office. While healthcare costs are increasingly untenable, the issue is one of healthcare costs for society as a whole. Recent legislation means government bears more of them, but someone will bear them no matter what.

So while healthcare is billed as an expansion of government, it is more a continuing issue of cost and delivery of something that has to be paid for by someone and at some cost.

On almost every other front, government is receding ‑ not just from the financial crisis high tide of 2008-2009 but from decades before. Each of Obama’s proposals hones and potentially reduces current spending, whether on education or on infrastructure. That $50 billion for roads appears large. In mid-2012, though, Congress authorized $120 billion in highway expenses through 2014, and much of what Obama proposes could be encompassed by focusing current spending.

Even if there is new spending there, it is a pittance compared to the interstate highway bills of the 1950s or the space program of the 1960s, let alone the many programs that encompassed the War on Poverty and led to a vast expansion of federal programs in healthcare, housing and education.

Take the minimum wage, the issue that received perhaps the most attention among the president’s proposals, save gun control. But increasing the minimum wage isn’t a government program. It’s a bill that potentially mandates higher costs for some employers. Whether you love it or hate it, it is not an expansion of government ‑ and certainly not of government spending.

All these proposals, in fact, are small-bore for the post-New Deal era. They are small-bore compared to the massive 2009 stimulus bill of almost $800 billion. They are small-bore because there is no political ill for them to be larger-bore, and because it is unclear just how much government can use the bazooka of big spending to effect significant changes in society.

Take jobs. Aside from hiring the unemployed in a New Deal-style program, the government can do only so much to create jobs and alter the trajectory of unemployment. While hiring those unemployed might not cost much more than the tens of billions spent annually on unemployment benefits, there would still need to be jobs once those programs ran their course.

Yes, government can create incentives for businesses. But those incentives are almost always state and local tax incentives to lure companies to build factories. That is good for temporary boosts to construction. As we know, with robotics and just-in-time inventories, factories do not generate the number of jobs they once did.

What does appear to create jobs are people and their needs and wants. There is some evidence that self-employment has been on an upsurge, but the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that self-employment as it measures the category has been largely static over the past decades .

Still, somewhere between 10 percent and 15 percent of the labor force is self-employed ‑ whether by intent (starting a small business) or involuntarily (couldn’t find any other work). The world of social media may be tiny in the greater scheme of things, but social media appears to be ever more central in the way companies find employees (the LinkedIn phenomenon) and how consumers find products.

In fact, the suite of tools encompassed by information technologies on the Web may be adding more to income and affluence than we think or than official statistics show. According to Eric Brynjolfsson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, “free goods” of the Internet, like Google[r1] , could be adding as much as $300 billion to our gross domestic product each year. That has nothing to do with government and is clearly boosting quality of life.

One day, we will look back on this era as a period of transition. The problem is that we don’t know what we are shifting to, or whether it is something we will perceive as better or worse.

Government will be one aspect of that transition. But it would be a mistake to see it as the axis of that transition. The current Washington debates ‑ about whether there will be a “sequester” or not, a drastic cut in spending or only a small one ‑ demonstrate that government is shrinking and the horizons of its ambitions narrowing. Given the limitations of what government can and cannot do, that is hardly something to mourn or decry.

Protecting the commons is something government must do and is. Singlehandedly managing the transition to the next economy is something is cannot do ‑ and should not.

He gave Bill O’Reilly an intellectual smack down. Bill O’Reilly in his “Talking Points Memo” said:

Bill O’Reilly: Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, now Cypress, all broke. And other European nations are close. Why? Because they are nanny states. And there are not enough workers to support all the entitlements these progressive paradises are handing out.

The economics professor’s rebuttal on Democracy Now was epic.

Economic Professor Richard Wolff: You know he gets away with saying things which no undergraduate in the United States with a responsible economic professor could ever get away with. If you want to refer to things as nanny states, then the place you go to in Europe is not the southern tier, Portugal, Spain, and Italy. The places you go are Germany and Scandinavia, because they provide more social services to their people than anybody else. And guess what, not only are they not in trouble economically, they are the winners of the current situation. The unemployment rate in Germany is now below five percent. Ours is pushing between seven and eight percent. So, ah, please get your facts right Mr. O’Reilly. The nanny state you call it; the program of countries like Germany and Scandinavia who tax their people heavily by all means, but who provide them with social services that would be the envy of the United States, a national health program that takes care of you whether you are employed or not and gives you proper healthcare. In France for example the law says when you go to work you get five weeks paid vacation. That’s not an option, that’s the law. You get support when you are a new parent, childcare and so forth. They provide services and they are successful in Germany and Scandinavia, much more than we are in the United States; and much more than those countries in the south. So they are not broke in the south because they are nanny states, since the nanny states par excellence are doing better than everyone. The actual truth of Mr. O’Reilly is the opposite of what he says. The more you do nanny state, the better off you are during a crisis, and to minimize the cost of the crisis. That’s what the European economic situation actually teaches. He is just making it up as he goes along to conform to an ideological position that is harder and harder for folks like him to sustain so he has to reach further and further into fantasy.

Fox News can afford to have economists to give its opinion masters factual information. It is obvious they have no interest in that. O’Reilly could not possibly believe what he is saying. Not only is there evidence from Europe as was stated by Professor Wolff, but it was true here in America.

When we raised taxes to balance our budget the economy was much more robust. Other than empirical evidence is the tenet in Economics 101 known as the marginal propensity to consume. It can be paraphrased to state that giving 1000 middle class persons $100 creates a more robust economy than given a millionaire $100,000 because those 1000 middle class persons will spend most of it while the millionaire will probably save it (hoard it). Saved money that is not immediately reinvested into an economy by buying more goods is not stimulative.

The reality is to get the economy rolling the wealthy must pay a much higher percentage in taxes since it is evident they have no desire to invest in America inasmuch as it is the middle class that purchased their goods and services to make them wealthy. It is also the middle class that fight the wars and die to keep the sea lanes open for the commerce that generates their wealth.

What O’Reilly sees as a nanny state is a humane state. While many Americans, the teacher, the engineer, the lawyer, the doctor, and many others do real work, Bill O’Reilly gets millions to simple blow hot air.

Even though business has been slow at Mr. Epperson’s sword and knife shop since tourists stopped visiting the historic Chickamauga battlefield, which closed on Tuesday because of the furlough of federal workers in the shutdown, he said the only thing that would weaken his support for Mr. Graves would be if the congressman caved in now. In that case, he might vote for a more conservative choice in the next Republican primary.

“If he backs off, then I would say absolutely I’d be inclined to look for someone else,” said Mr. Epperson, whose store flew a Don’t Tread on Me flag.

The Republican insistence in the House on tying financing of the federal government to dismantling the Affordable Care Act is being driven by a deeply conservative caucus from places like Mr. Graves’s 14th Congressional District, newly created by Georgia’s Republican-controlled Legislature."

Here’s the key part:

PK: John Boehner and [Eric] Cantor aren’t worried about losing the majority at this point, and that’s why they are constantly tending to their base inside the Republican Study Committee. They don’t believe the majority is at stake, so they worry more about their internal standing in HC5. That’s where you see the impact of gerrymandering, in the way leadership caters to its fringe elements.

Both Charlie and Stu – Cook and Rothenberg, respectively – have fewer than 30 House Republican seats as even in play, total, for 2014. Most of those are not even toss-ups, they’re just those remotely in play. That’s a fundamentally different orbit than what the Gingrich-Hastert-DeLay conference floated in from 1995-2007. Back then, when they regularly had about 230 seats, they pushed hard to the right but always feared losing their swing district seats and, therefore, their majority.

Even if redistricting only creates a buffer of 15 to 20 fewer seats in play for R’s, that’s a buffer that, for now, leaves GOP leaders not in fear of losing the majority. The result of that lack of political fear is, leaders suffer from what I call “HC5 Syndrome” – decisions are increasingly based on how they will play out inside the basement room where Republicans regularly meet, not on how they play out on the national political landscape.

AB: Fair points, again. I agree that Boehner likely isn’t as concerned about losing the House as he would have been two years ago. But I don’t think it’s as big a difference as people think.

Fair Vote did a good study on this. They showed that, before this round of redistricting, the GOP had 189 safe seats and there were 89 “balanced” seats. So Republicans needed to win 29 of 89 balanced seats (32.5 percent) to hold the majority. Today, after redistricting, there are 195 safe GOP seats and 74 balanced seats. So the GOP needs to win 23 of the 74 balanced seats (31.1 percent). The fact is that 31.1 percent and 32.5 percent aren’t that far apart.

I think the fact that the GOP majority is safer than it was before has as much or more to do with the fact that they were finally able to pick off all those conservative Democratic districts that should have been theirs to begin with. Even under the old map, GOP would have been heavily favored to keep the majority going forward. All they have to do is win one-third of the competitive seats."

Divided government requires bipartisan negotiation

By Eric Cantor,

The writer, a Republican, represents Virginia’s 7th Congressional District in the House, where he is the majority leader.

For three years, Congress and the White House have been building to this moment. Not the debt limit or Obamacare specifically, but this clarifying moment of Washington dysfunction. President Obama has led us here by continually thwarting the will of Congress and dismissing its role in our constitutional republic. This must end.

The president not only has refused to negotiate on issues of debt and spending but also has mocked the very idea of engaging with Congress. President Obama has repeatedly made clear that he feels it is beneath the office of the presidency to work in a bipartisan way with the legislative branch.

The Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse and the power to borrow. The president was given the power to veto measures, including those related to spending and borrowing. These separate powers created checks and balances but also forced the executive and legislative branches to work together.

As James Madison wrote in Federalist No. 48, “It is equally evident, that none of [the branches of the federal government] ought to possess, directly or indirectly, an overruling influence over the others, in the administration of their respective powers.”

In the 224 years of our nation’s history, one party has controlled the House, Senate and White House for 130 years. President Obama enjoyed two of those years, and it’s no surprise he wishes that were still the case. Yet every president has found a way to lead whenever there has been a divided government — except this one.

In 2006, then-Sen. Obama said: “Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better. I therefore intend to oppose the effort to increase America’s debt limit.”

Seven years later, and after the nation’s debt had doubled , President Obama refuses to even sit at the same table as Republicans and work to solve the “debt problem” he correctly identified as a senator. That is a much larger failure of leadership.

This has, unfortunately, been the case since 2011. President Obama has often chosen to unilaterally circumvent the law under the guise of executive authority. Most recently, that was demonstrated in July with his delay of Obamacare mandates for corporations, but it has been a hallmark of this presidency.

Courts have held that President Obama violated the Constitution with certain “recess” appointments, ignoring the required consent of Congress. He has abused executive-branch “rule making” rather than working with Congress to pass laws. He has ignored the letter of the law when it comes to religious liberty and work requirements for welfare.

President Obama has used executive orders to unilaterally change U.S. immigration laws. His administration has used waivers to change laws such as No Child Left Behind to compel states to adopt new policies.

In some of these instances, the president attempted to garner statutory authority, failed to do so and then acted in defiance of that. In other instances, he never bothered to find consensus and ignored Congress from the outset, usually contending that he simply had no choice. This is no way to govern, and it cripples the system of checks and balances that our Founding Fathers envisioned.

Working in divided government is not new. As recently as 1995, President Bill Clinton worked overtime with House Speaker Newt Gingrich to reach bipartisan compromise over the debt ceiling and to end a government shutdown.

Neither Clinton nor congressional Republicans got everything they wanted from those negotiations. They found consensus, and that consensus moved the country forward; they managed to balance the budget because they worked together.

Just two years ago, President Obama and House Republicans came to an agreement to raise the debt ceiling and implement much-needed reductions in spending. It wasn’t a perfect agreement, but it, too, moved the nation forward. For the first time since the Korean War, the United States will have two consecutive years of reduced nominal spending.

After that agreement, the American people reelected a divided government. They expect us to work together just as just as it was done in 2011, 1996, 1995 and years before — and they will not accept one party simply refusing to negotiate.

Mr. President, let’s sit down and talk. Let’s reach consensus and end the “my way or the highway” attitude once and for all.

Fox News Nation strikes again.

Sean Hannity has been following the Ted Cruz ""Obamacare is ruining all our lives"" on his Fox show, reinforcing the baseless belief in most Fox viewers that the law is somehow going to throw them to the health insurance wolves. That's despite the fact that the Fox demographic is pretty much all on Medicare. But Fox exists to reinforce Republican lies, so that's what they've been doing. Salon's Eric Stern happened to catch Hannity in the act, featuring four couples who swore they had been hurt by Obamacare, and decided to do a little fact checking . Debunking Hannity turned out to be ""appallingly easy"" for Stern when he conducted follow up interviews Hannity's guests.

First up was Paul Cox of Leicester, North Carolina, and his wife Michelle. They told Hannity that they have had to cut the hours of their employees in their construction business because they couldn't afford to insure them.



Obamacare has no effect on businesses with 49 employees or less. But in our brief conversation on the phone, Paul revealed that he has only four employees. Why the cutback on his workforce? “Well,” he said, “I haven’t been forced to do so, it’s just that I’ve chosen to do so. I have to deal with increased costs.” What costs? And how, I asked him, is any of it due to Obamacare? There was a long pause, after which he said he’d call me back. He never did.

Actually, Cox could be getting a tax credit under Obamacare to help provide insurance to his four employees. I think he probably doesn't care as much about his employees' well-being as he wanted the Fox audience to believe. The only requirement for Cox under the law is that he informs his employees of the existence of the new health insurance exchange.

Then there's Allison Denijs who told Hannity that she pays over $13,000 a year in premiums and just got a letter from Blue Cross saying that her current policy wasn't in compliance with the law, so it was being discontinued and replaced. She also has a daughter with a pre-existing condition who hasn't been covered. She's angry because Obama promised that we could keep our existing policies. Stern asked if she'd actually checked out the exchange. She hadn't. Stern found ""that they would be able to get a plan for around $7,600, which would include coverage for their uninsured daughter. This would be about a 60 percent reduction from what they would have to pay on the pre-Obamacare market.""

Not a bad deal. Likewise, Stern found a pretty good deal on the exchange for the final couple, Robbie and Tina Robison from Franklin, Tennessee. They're mad because their kids are grown, but they have to have a policy that covers things they don't want like maternity care, pediatric care, prenatal care and so forth. Welcome to health insurance, Robbie and Tina. They're also mad because their insurance agent told them they would have to pay 50-75 percent more for a plan compliant with the law.



Had they shopped on the exchange yet, I asked? No, Tina said, nor would they. They oppose Obamacare and want nothing to do with it. Fair enough, but they should know that I found a plan for them for, at most, $3,700 a year, a 63 percent less than their current bill.

Robbie and Tina need a new insurance agent. The thing for these people who are so mad that their current insurance policies are being discontinued is that they're being replaced with insurance plans that actually cover stuff. That's going to mean bigger premiums for some people, but what Hannity and all right-wing pundits and politicians leave out is that the majority of these people won't have to pay the full bill for those premiums. What Hannity-types are also not admitting is that this is a pretty tiny group of Americans, those who buy their insurance in the individual market and who were already insured. So is Obamacare hurting all Americans? Of course not, just the teeny-tiny bunch of die-hard conservatives who will refuse to be helped."

Obama first brought up the issue with Lindsay Graham in the context of the Collins proposal. Obama and Reid were of the same mind on the crappy Paul Ryan House GOP proposal that it was an insulting non-starter. Regarding the Senate GOP proposal, Obama was willing to entertain some concessions in order to replace the sequester but Reid prevailed to push Obama to remain philosophically consistent and convinced the President that the Collins proposal was a bit of a Trojan horse. Reid now has a few days to run the show to play bad cop to Obama's good cop. Neither cop wants to do business with the House GOP. Boehner is only too happy to sit on the sidelines and watch football this weekend. The Senate GOP feels embattled but doesn't think it can trust the House to do anything.

Mitch McConnell has willingly accepted the role of GOP negotiator and has openly stated that he intends to reach a compromise with Democrats. This is potentially significant because McConnell is more likely to bend to the Democrats because he faces a credible Democratic opponent in the 2014 Senate elections (Grimes) and Democratic Governor Steve Beshear is almost single-handedly validating Obamacare through the Kynect program. He also doesn't seem to be too threatened by his tea party opponent (Bevin)in the GOP Senate primary (a harbinger of things to come in red states in 2014?)

In addition, Chuck Todd reported that when McConnell recently tried to sell the sequester as GOP success to base GOP voters, it did not move them very much. Therefore, McConnell may be more willing to jettison the sequester than we realize, particularly since it was hurting the GOP long before the shutdown and because most of the year 2 sequester cuts will fall on the military.

So Harry Reid has a shot to get an agreement that extends the debt ceiling for a longer period (6 months to 1 year), ends the shutdown with a shorter CR and/or replaces the sequester. If Reid fails, he may be able to push the Overton window far enough to the left where the GOP might feel that simply passing a clean CR and debt ceiling increase at current levels might be the best solution.

The problem, of course, is the House of Representatives and particularly Paul Ryan. The good news is that Obama's firm rejection of the House GOP offer forced the dark lord out of his crypt and into the open, and everyone in DC saw him for what he is: a maniacal power hungry nihilist who values leverage above all and would rather see the country default than to hand a victory of any kind to Democrats. This man is a sociopath and must be stopped.

Ryan seems, in my view, concerned that Boehner might bring up a Senate passed bill and let it pass in the House with Democratic votes. That's why he was so angry and boisterous in the House meeting. He wants to whip the GOP House to unite behind him, which is a road to nowhere. Ryan has made it clear that he will deny Boehner a majority of GOP votes. The tea party will be aligned with Ryan on this particular vote. Boehner controls at most only 20-25 votes. Ultimately this is all about Boehner. If he does undercut Ryan, he can say that he is acting for the good of the country and the survival of his party. That will open him up to recriminations within the GOP and their media and perhaps a leadership challenge.

The Democrats will be on solid political ground to pass the bill they want in the Senate and then force the House to deal with the issue and absorb most of the blame should they fail to act to avoid a default. This requires Democrats to be unafraid of the GOP taking the country into default if Ryan has his way. Democrats cannot save the GOP from itself, even if not stepping in results in a default because of the GOP's inability to govern.

For his part, President Obama will need to resist the temptation to offer anything of substance to the GOP. Boehner will come calling again, but he cannot deliver anything approaching a majority of the GOP caucus so he should be ignored. Boehner simply has to be told to let whatever bill comes out of the Senate have a floor vote.

The risk of default remains high mainly because of Paul Ryan's unwillingness to let go of hostages and the tactic of hostage taking. However, with many GOPers seeing the writing on the wall, the Democrats have an equally reasonable chance to impose their will and obtain the right result. Stay tuned."

Editor’s Note: Gordon Stewart is former deputy chief speechwriter to President Jimmy Carter and the moderator of TheNextDeal.org, an online project to revise the U.S. social contract for the 21st century.

It’s a good bet that millions of Americans on Monday greeted President Barack Obama’s magnificent second inaugural address not just with applause and cheers of approval but with loud sighs of relief.

Gone were his first inaugural speech’s bizarre equal division of blame for the wreckage of real lives between the “greed of some” and the so-called “collective failure” of the rest of us. Instead, Obama rang out his commitment to equality for all, not the “shrinking few and lucky” who call the rest of us simply “takers.”

Nor did our president chide us to put away ”childish things” by seeming to describe deep differences over “perpetual war,” climate change, immigration, equal rights, voting rights, rights to decent wages for honest labor and rights to “basic measures of security and dignity” as “petty grievances.”

This time around, Obama offered us not song and dance morals from an old Depression musical comedy to “pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off and start all over again,” but solid, specific support for the serious New Deal pillars of Social Security and Medicare.

Almost for the first time as president, he dared to utter the word “poverty” in a major address, and declared ”we must be a source of hope to the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the victims of prejudice.”

These moments and more earned his speech the warm response and respect it deserves. Now it will receive the careful analysis it cannot escape. This will reveal even more profound differences between Obama’s second inaugural speech and his historic appearance on the steps of the U.S. Capitol as the president of color few believed they would see elected in their lifetimes.

1. His first inaugural address was a puzzling disappointment after the passionate convictions he expressed so powerfully in both his primary and general election campaigns. Some suggested that his finest moment was Election Night in Chicago’s Grant Park. No one who followed his campaign, including his opponents, could have been surprised by his second inaugural speech.

2. Monday’s words were those of a leader who has chosen to fight for the change he believes in over flailing attempts to placate that only produced astounding charges that he was unwilling to compromise when in fact he had given so much in doomed efforts to do just that.

3. His repeated calls for “We the People” to work together were not-so-subtle warnings of who would be responsible if the U.S. government is unable to do so. No blame-splitting this time.

4. Even Obama’s delivery and demeanor conveyed conviction, not the sense that a press aide might soon emerge from Caesar’s tent beside the Rubicon to explain that his thinking is still “evolving.”

Opinion: How Obama made opportunity real in America

In this second inaugural address, Obama the Candidate became Obama the President without a trace of the bait and switch to which too many citizens have become so accustomed that in their cynicism they cease to vote at all. He spoke as a leader who has stopped splitting differences and is prepared to make choices and fight for them – together as We the People if possible, alone as Obama the President if not.

Opinion: Obama’s America, better than what Founders imagined

In fact, Monday’s speech felt as if after four frustrating years of trying to appease his opponents, Barack Obama had finally met Machiavelli one night in the Lincoln Bedroom and learned that when faced with two equally powerful opposing forces, a president must choose, or both will attack him. He sounded like a leader who knows now that the difference between making a choice and making love is that decisions don’t feel better the longer you can draw them out.

As Obama goes from celebration to celebration, his supporters and his opponents have a much clearer idea of what he will do tomorrow, and for the next 1,000-plus days he is president.

This time when he tells banks and insurance companies that “a free market only thrives when there are rules to ensure competition and fair play,” they will do well to believe him. Because even with all the cash he collected to fill the coffers of his campaign, Monday’s speech makes it clear he will not let it line the coffin of his presidency.

It betrays no security measures to mention that the Secret Service chooses oddly accurate code words for the presidents it protects.

After Obama’s first inauguration, that could have been “dancer.” After Monday’s address, it could legitimately consider ”leader.” If the president is able to act in accordance with his second inaugural address, it’s not impossible now to imagine “Lincoln.” He wasn’t afraid to fight when the nation would not stay together.

House Republican leaders are struggling to avoid a U.S. government shutdown at month's end after delaying a vote on a spending plan opposed by dozens of their caucus members.

WASHINGTON -- If Congress fails to pass a spending bill and shuts down the government, federal workers shouldn't expect to be made whole for their furlough days the way they were after the shutdowns of 1995 and 1996, according to the president of a union for federal employees.

Colleen Kelley, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 workers, said she wouldn't be surprised if this particular Congress declined to grant back pay to workers.

""It's a different time and a different Congress,"" Kelley told HuffPost. ""There are too many people who remember [1995 and 1996] or were told about it by someone and I want them to know that is not a guarantee.""

""I'm telling employees not to assume they would be paid,"" Kelley continued, ""and that adds to the frustration and the anger. They're tired of being caught in the middle of this.""

Last week, the GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill that ties government funding to the defunding of the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. Of course, the White House and Senate Democrats have refused to neuter the president's landmark health care reform law at the behest of Republicans. Barring a resolution, funding for government services will expire next week.

Many workers employed in national security roles, like Border Patrol agents and Transportation Security Administration officers, would be exempted from furloughs and keep working even if the government goes into shutdown mode. In that case, they would get paid retroactively for their service, but not until Congress passes the new spending legislation.

For other workers, the shutdown would lead to an unknown number of furlough days. Congress could later choose to pay workers for the furlough period -- or not. After the mid-'90s shutdowns, Congress passed legislation compensating workers for the wages they lost.

According to J. David Cox, head of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union, the looming government shutdown would amount to ""involuntary servitude"" for federal workers who continue clocking in even if government operations go unfunded by Congress.

Cox, whose union represents 670,000 workers across federal agencies, told HuffPost that union members were ""unnerved"" by the possibility of a shutdown, especially after many have already taken unpaid furlough days this year due to sequestration.

""They've lost a whole week's pay,"" Cox said of many federal employees. ""Now you're talking about a government shutdown. In many instances employees will be required to go to work but won't get paid on payday.""

""This is no way to run a country,"" Cox added.

The threat of a government shutdown has become more common amid Congress' ongoing budget battles. In addition to facing furlough days, many federal employees have also been under a three-year pay freeze as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have called for belt-tightening. (Although many workers have still received merit raises, they have not been eligible for their traditional cost-of-living increases each year.)

Cox said the union has been in close contact with the offices of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) on the possibility of a shutdown. Kelley said her union has asked all its members to pressure their representatives to strike a deal.

""I don't think anyone is willing to accept it as the new normal, because it's no way to run any operation, much less the federal government,"" Kelley said."

In one of the August emails, HealthCare.gov project manager Henry Chao responded to a proposal to delay the launch by writing: ""Can we sign this with blood?""

The details were included in a handful of emails released Friday by Republican lawmakers probing the troubled launch. The lawmakers charged that the communications offer more evidence that the administration kept quiet for months about urgent problems with the website.

""As the paper trail broadens, we see more and more evidence that the administration was fully aware its signature health care law was not ready for prime time,"" House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, R-Mich., said. ""The documents we are now reviewing tell a much, much different story than what officials testified to Congress.""

The emails pertained to the online SHOP Marketplace, which is meant for small businesses and has suffered a series of setbacks. The administration announced in late September that it was pushing off the launch until mid-November. But then one day before the Thanksgiving holiday, the Department of Health and Human Services announced it would push off online enrollment by another year.

A statement from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services claimed the email excerpts released Friday ""are between a small group of individuals involved in a broader decision-making process, and they reflect one piece of many conversations about managing deliverables and communicating expectations.""

The statement said the emails ""do not reflect final decisions made by more senior CMS officials.""

CMS claimed the final decision to delay enrollment was not made until mid-September.

Chao, a top official at CMS, testified last month before the House Energy and Commerce Committee that he tends to ""err on the side of caution"" and can get ""a little passionate in my emails.""

Chao, in the emails, made the ""blood"" comment after an exchange among officials with his department and contractor CGI Federal.

Initially, a CMS official said he is ""not recommending a delay.""

But on Aug. 6, Monique Outerbridge, director of the CMS Office of Information Services, wrote:

""Guys, this is absolutely urgent and I need an answer on this today. If this is late we have to public announce we are late with a deliverable which means [CMS Administrator] Marilyn Tavenner and the Secretary will have to announce.""

CGI official Mark Calem then pitched a tentative schedule that would push off the full launch until Nov. 15.

That's when Chao apparently asked if they could ""sign this with blood"" -- according to committee Republicans, CGI agreed to the dates.

Republicans indicated they plan to grill Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius about this and other issues when she testifies next week.

On Friday, CMS officials began to provide details about another problematic issue for the rollout -- flawed data being sent from HealthCare.gov to insurance companies through what's known as 834 forms.

Officials said as many as one in four of the forms may have had problems in October and November, but the error rate is now down to roughly one in 10.

Officials said CMS is working with insurance companies to resolve the issue, and suggested people who think they have enrolled contact the insurer and pay the first month's premium to make sure.

Mick Mulvaney offered the Senate Democrat budget proposal for a vote in the House. The budget plan was defeated, with 35 Democrats crossing the aisle to oppose it. Thursday night, Dem Sen. Patty Murray responded by offering Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget for a vote in the Senate. The measure failed, 40-59, with 5 GOP Senators joining in opposition. Interestingly, among these 5 were Sens. Paul, Cruz and Lee.

Sens. Paul, Cruz and Lee are providing the nucleus of an emerging conservative opposition in the Senate. While there are other conservatives in the GOP caucus, these three are establishing themselves as reliable voices to articulate the conservative opposition to an ever encroaching government.

They are becoming skilled at identifying issues to make a stand on principle. I have no doubt that if their votes could have pushed the Ryan budget into passing, they would have voted for it, as it is likely the best option on the table. Frankly, however, the Ryan budget doesn’t go as far as conservatives would prefer. A vote against an amendment that was already going to be defeated was a good moment to stand on that principle.

The Ryan budget doesn’t cut real spending, but instead lowers the growth rate of spending. That is good, but unless you pull out by the roots wasteful spending and programs, they can always be expanded by a future Congress. Cutting real spending requires choices and priorities. Merely slowing the rate of spending growth keeps much of government in place.

The most important, and meaningful, proposal in Ryan’s budget is to transition Medicare into a premium support program. Seniors would be free to select the health insurance that best meets their needs and the federal Medicare program would underwrite some portion of the premiums. It curbs unsustainable entitlement spending, but, best, it gives Seniors greater choice over their health care.

Late Thursday, MI Sen. Debbie Stabenow introduced an amendment that would prevent Medicare being turned into a “voucher” program, the Democrats’ label to describe the Ryan plan. The Stabenow amendment passed 96-3.

Who were the three Senators to vote against Stabenow? Sens. Paul, Cruz and Lee. Hopefully, their principled, conservative opposition will catch on with their colleagues.

http://news.yahoo.com/house-gop-unveils-bill-counter-senate-debt-plan-142903804--finance.html,,[],House GOP unveils bill to counter Senate debt plan,"WASHINGTON (AP) — House GOP leaders Tuesday pitched a plan to fellow Republicans to counter an emerging Senate deal to reopen the government and forestall an economy-rattling default on U.S. obligations. But they stopped short of promising a vote later in the day after the plan got mixed reviews from the rank and file.

Top Republicans unveiled a plan that would suspend a new tax on medical devices for two years and take away the federal government's contributions to lawmakers' health care and top administration officials, in addition to funding the government through Jan. 15 and giving Treasury the ability to borrow normally through Feb. 7.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said he's ""trying to find a path forward"" but that ""there have been no decisions about exactly what we will do."" He told a news conference ""there are a lot of opinions about what direction to go.""

The move came as a partial shutdown entered its third week and less than two days before the Treasury Department says it will be unable to borrow and will rely on a this cash cushion to pay the country's bills.

The House GOP plan wouldn't win nearly as many concessions from President Barack Obama as Republicans had sought but it would set up another battle with the White House early next year.

""The jury is still out,"" said Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas.

Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., said he was not sure he could vote for the plan because it did not address the debt. ""I have to know a lot more than I know now,"" he said.

The House move comes after conservative lawmakers rebelled at the outlines of an emerging Senate plan by Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Those two hoped to seal an agreement on Tuesday, just two days before the Treasury Department says it will run out of borrowing capacity.

The White House and Democrats quickly came out against the Republican plan. Obama planned to meet with House Democratic leaders Tuesday afternoon as negotiations continue.

Story continues

""The latest proposal from House Republicans does just that in a partisan attempt to appease a small group of tea party Republicans who forced the government shutdown in the first place,"" said White House spokeswoman Amy Brundage. ""Democrats and Republicans in the Senate have been working in a bipartisan, good-faith effort .... With only a couple days remaining until the United States exhausts its borrowing authority, it's time for the House to do the same.""

""GOP's latest plan is designed to torpedo the bipartisan Sen solution,"" tweeted Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md. ""Plan is not only reckless, it's tantamount to default.""

Political pressure is building on Republicans to reopen the government and GOP leaders are clearly fearful of failing to act to avert a default on U.S. obligations.

Republicans are in a difficult spot, relinquishing many of their core demands as they take a beating in the polls. Rep. Steve Southerland, R-Fla., led GOP lawmakers in several verses of ""Amazing Grace.""

""We have to stick together now,"" said Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas.

Like the House GOP bill, the emerging Senate measure — though not finalized — would reopen the government through Jan. 15 and permit the Treasury to borrow normally until early to mid-February, easing dual crises that have sapped confidence in the economy and taken a sledgehammer to the GOP's poll numbers.

""There are productive negotiations going on with the Republican leader,"" Reid said as he opened the Senate Tuesday. ""I'm confident we'll be able to reach a comprehensive agreement this week in time to avert a catastrophic default.""

On Wall Street, stocks were mixed early Tuesday, with investors somewhat optimistic over a potential deal.

""We're willing to get the government open. We want to get the government open,"" Scalise said. ""Hopefully they get something done that addresses the spending issue.""

The competing House and Senate plans are a far cry from the assault on ""Obamacare"" that tea party Republicans originally demanded as a condition for a short-term funding bill to keep the government fully operational. It lacks the budget cuts demanded by Republicans in exchange for increasing the government's $16.7 trillion borrowing cap.

Nor do either the House or Senate frameworks contain any of a secondary set of House GOP demands, like a one-year delay in the health law's mandate that individuals buy insurance.

Another difference between the Democrats and Republicans involves a Democratic move to repeal a $63 fee that companies must pay for each person they cover under the big health care overhaul beginning in 2014. Unions oppose the fee and Senate Democrats are pressing to repeal it, but House Republicans are positioning to block them and Senate Republicans are adamantly opposed as well.

Democrats were standing against a GOP-backed proposal to suspend a medical device tax that was enacted as part of the health care law, but might not be able to win a floor vote since many Democrats oppose the tax too.

Democratic and Republican aides described the outlines of the potential agreement on condition of anonymity because the discussions were ongoing.

But with GOP poll numbers plummeting and the country growing weary of a shutdown entering its third week, Senate Republicans in particular were eager to end the shutdown — and avoid an even greater crisis if the government were to default later this month.

Any legislation backed by both Reid and McConnell can be expected to sail through the Senate, though any individual senators could delay it.

But it's another story in the House. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, signaled that conservative members of the House were deeply skeptical. He said any bill had to have serious spending cuts for him to vote to raise the debt ceiling and said he thought Obama and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew had more flexibility than they had said publicly.

""No deal is better than a bad deal,"" Barton said.

Asked whether the emerging package contained any victories for Republicans, Rep. James Lankford, R-Okla., a member of the House GOP leadership, said, ""Not that I've seen so far, no.""

In addition to approving legislation to fund the government until late this year and avert a possible debt crisis later this week or month, the potential pact would set up broader budget negotiations between the GOP-controlled House and Democratic-led Senate. One goal of those talks would be to ease automatic spending cuts that began in March and could deepen in January, when about $20 billion in further cuts are set to slam the Pentagon.

Democrats also were seeking to preserve the Treasury Department's ability to use extraordinary accounting measures to buy additional time after the government reaches any extended debt ceiling. Such measures have permitted Treasury to avert a default for almost five months since the government officially hit the debt limit in mid-May, but wouldn't buy anywhere near that kind of time next year, experts said.

The House GOP plan would repeal the extraordinary measures, which would make the Feb 7 date a hard deadline to revisit the fight.

(CNN) - Critics have long poked fun at House Speaker John Boehner's teary-eyed tendency. But now Democrats are comparing the speaker to a baby throwing an all-out temper tantrum.

During the commercial breaks of Sunday's game between the Cincinnati Bengals and the New England Patriots, viewers in Boehner's district will catch a 30-second ad with a close up of a wailing baby.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

""Speaker John Boehner didn't get his way on shutting down health care reform,"" the ad's narrator says. ""So, he's shut down the government and hurt the economy.""

House Majority PAC, a group that backs Democratic candidates, released the ad on Friday.

""Speaker Boehner didn't get his way and so, like a child, he threw a Tea Party-inspired temper tantrum and shut down the federal government,"" Andy Stone, the group's communications director, said in a statement.

The new ad is one of many campaigns launched by groups on both sides of the aisle in recent days to fault Democrats or Republicans for the government shutdown.

House Republicans have been trying to attach anti-Obamacare provisions to a spending bill that funds the government, but Senate Democrats refuse to take up anything except a bill with no strings attached. The White House has also threatened to veto any bill that tries to change Obamacare.

Boehner grew agitated Friday morning over a Wall Street Journal article that quoted a senior administration official as saying, ""we are winning"" and ""it doesn't really matter to us"" how long the shutdown lasts ""because what matters is the end result.""

Throwing down the newspaper on the podium at a press conference, Boehner said: ""This isn't some damn game!""

""The American people don't want their government shut down and neither do I,"" he continued. ""All we are asking for is to sit down and to have a discussion and to bring fairness – re-open the government and bring fairness to the American people under Obamacare. It is as simple as that, and it all has to begin with a simple discussion.""

White House spokesman Jay Carney disavowed the comment in the Wall Street Journal.

The House is scheduled to vote on measures Saturday that will start funding certain parts of the government, but Senate Democrats demand a bill that funds the government all at once."

(CNN) – The head of the House Republican campaign arm, Rep. Greg Walden, is getting pushback from both his own party and the White House for bucking the party line and saying the president was wrong to include entitlement changes in his budget proposal.

""I've made it clear that I disagree with what Chairman Walden said,"" Boehner said in his weekly press conference on Thursday, referring to the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.



""I've talked to chairman Walden, and we had a conversation,"" Boehner added. ""We'll leave it at that.""

In an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Walden said Wednesday that Obama's budget ""lays out kind of a shocking attack on seniors.""

""And we haven't seen all the detail yet, and we'll look at it, but I'll tell you, when you're going after seniors the way he's already done on ObamaCare, taking $700 billion out of Medicare to put into Obamacare, and now coming back at seniors again, I think you're crossing that line very quickly here in terms of denying access to seniors for health care in districts like mine, certainly, and around the country,"" the congressman from Oregon said.

In the budget, Obama backed a popular measure among Republicans called ""Chained CPI."" The provision measures inflation in a way that would reduce projected federal spending by slowing the growth in federal benefits that are annually adjusted for cost of living. Those include Social Security benefits.

Chained CPI is hotly opposed by liberal Democrats, many of whom are blasting Obama for supporting the measure. Obama's budget also includes $400 billion in cuts from Medicare and other federal health programs.

""I think he's going to have a lot of pushback from some of the major senior organizations on this and Republicans, as well,"" Walden said.

While he's getting scorned from the right, he's also seeing criticism from the left. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney faulted Walden for trying to dismiss a plan advocated by his own party. He argued Walden's comments were simply an example of division within the GOP.

""This is a Republican proposal,"" Carney said Thursday in the daily press briefing. ""And cynical attempts to make it otherwise by some represent, I think, dissonance within the Republican Party, and we've seen plenty of condemnation from conservatives and Republicans of that sort of flagrantly ridiculous and cynical attempt to disown a proposal that emanated from Republican leaders.""

The National Republican Congressional Committee, which Walden chairs, released a statement Thursday stating “Chairman Walden supports the budget passed by House Republicans that preserves and protects Medicare and Social Security while also balancing the budget in 10 years. He disagrees with President Obama’s political plan that hurts current seniors just so he can pay for more wasteful spending.”

I wrote about Buffett in 1996, when Ted Turner upbraided fellow billionaires like Buffett and Bill Gates as “ol’ skinflints” for not loosening up “their wads” because they were afraid to fall off the Forbes 400 List. Back then, Buffett said he would wait until after he and his wife died, when he planned to give the bulk of his $15 billion to population control (even though, of course, every moment counts on that cause).

But then, about five years ago, Buffett said at Georgetown, he and Gates began plotting about philanthropy and now they have enrolled 115 plutocrats pledging a majority of their net worth.

“I’ve been dialing for dollars,” he said, adding that when billionaires resist, he gives them a warning: “If I’m talking to some 70-year-old, I say, ‘Do you really think your decision-making ability is going to be better when you’re 95 with some blonde on your lap, or now?’ ”

He calls the Fed “the greatest hedge fund in history,” and observed of the moment America nearly went off the cliff: “I give enormous credit to Ben Bernanke and Hank Paulson and Tim Geithner and frankly, even though I didn’t vote for him, President Bush.”

W.’s “great insight,” one worthy of Adam Smith, he said, was expressed in 10 words in September 2008: “He went out there from the White House and he said, ‘If money doesn’t loosen up this sucker could go down.’ ”

The populist voice of the 1 percent stressed that “inequality is getting wider” and that we must figure out how to “share the bounty.”"
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/29/ted-cruz-house-republicans_n_4014071.html,2013-09-29 00:00:00,"['Politics Reporter', 'The Huffington Post']",House Republicans Credit Ted Cruz As Government Shutdown Looms,"WASHINGTON -- House Republicans give one person the most credit for bringing Congress to its current standoff over funding for the federal government: Ted Cruz.

With the clock ticking toward the first government shutdown in 17 years, many lawmakers said they never would have been here had it not been for the junior senator from Texas.

""I think he's played a lot of role in where we are right now,"" Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said as he left a closed-door meeting of the House Republican conference on Saturday afternoon.

During the meeting, GOP leaders announced plans to advance a bill that would keep the government funded beyond Sept. 30 in exchange for a one-year delay of Obamacare and repeal of its medical device tax. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) declared the proposal dead on arrival a couple hours later.

But conservatives were jubilant as they left the meeting, and they identified Cruz as the force that pushed a reluctant GOP leadership to the brink.

""I think Ted Cruz did a huge service to the nation and to the cause of Republicanism,"" Rep. John Culberson (R-Texas) told The Huffington Post.

""[He played] an excellent role,"" said Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.). ""I think what he's done is strengthened our hand. He's made the case that we need to act and act decisively, and so I think we have a lot to credit him for.""

Rep. John Fleming (R-La.) called Cruz's role ""huge.""

""He's been the rallying flag that has pulled Republicans around conservatives,"" Fleming said. ""Just the mere fact that he's out there talking, that he's had petitions going, that he did a 21-hour [speech] that was highlighted in the media … all of these things are building energy among Republicans and conservatives who are unified in the fact that we oppose Obamacare.""

Cruz, along with his main ally Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), spent much of the summer mounting a full-fledged campaign to include a provision defunding Obamacare in a bill to fund the government. He starred in robocalls and television and radio ads, and raised millions for a possible White House bid in 2016, all while ramping up pressure on the House to yield to his demands.

At first, House Republicans seemed content to pass a continuing resolution that defunded Obamacare and leave it to Cruz to filibuster any attempts by Reid to amend it. The Texas senator failed to gather enough support from his colleagues to mount a filibuster and embarked on a 21-hour floor speech anyway.

As the Cruz show ran its course, House GOP leaders looked unlikely to tamper with Obamacare once again in their next government funding offer. They instead shifted focus to the pending debt ceiling fight, unveiling plans to seek a one-year delay in the implementation of Obamacare in exchange for raising the nation's borrowing limit.

But once again, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) found himself up against Cruz.

National Review reported that Cruz told House conservatives in a Thursday conference call to oppose leadership's fiscal strategy. Two days after the call, GOP leaders once again hinged funding for the government on Obamacare and dramatically raised the odds of a shutdown.

Some Republicans denied that Cruz was responsible.

""That's a different body over there,"" said Rep. Lynn Westmoreland (R-Ga.). ""I think our leadership has been onto this the whole time. I think they listened to the American people. That's what we're supposed to do.""

""I think we motivated him. We stood firm first and he did what he did,"" said Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.).

Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) said it was a team effort, but conceded the senator from Texas had been at the forefront of it all.

""I think we're motivated by the dangers of Obamacare, not by Ted Cruz,"" he said. ""Although it is good to see Ted Cruz take a leadership role.""

Democrats have pounced on Cruz's influence among the House GOP's right flank and played up the idea of the Texas Republican becoming the next speaker of the House.

But Cole, the House GOP's deputy whip, laughed at the suggestion that Cruz had dictated the House's strategy over funding the government and said the conference was in ""total support"" of Boehner.

""It's not as if any of us have ever been for Obamacare, so we've had multiple proposals to change, delay, what have you,"" he said, before taking a jab at Cruz's lengthy talkathon last week.

""He's dragged the clock out a little bit, so it's made it a little tougher, but we'll see what he does once we move [our bill] back over there,"" Cole said.

Republicans wanted to fund national parks%2C Veterans Affairs

Senate Democrats said they wouldn%27t support piecemeal measures

Politics of 2014 may favor Republicans more than %2795-96 shutdowns%2C analyst says

WASHINGTON — Congressional Republicans failed to move forward Tuesday with a piecemeal approach to fund popular parts of the federal government to lessen the impact of the first government shutdown in 17 years.

House and Senate Republicans had offered short-term funding plans to keep open national parks, the Department of Veterans Affairs and other government services in the nation's capital. House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Ky. said the piecemeal approach would ""continue to move the ball down the field"" towards finding an agreement to resume full government funding.

However, the GOP efforts failed to win the necessary support in the House of Representatives to advance to the Senate. The votes fell well short of the two-thirds threshold needed to suspend House rules.

The Senate had already warned that the plan would meet fate there as every previous attempt by the House to amend the stopgap funding bill. In that chamber, Democrats maintain the only way to end the shutdown is for the House to allow a vote on a stopgap measure to fund the government through mid-November that does not include legislation affecting President Obama's health care law.

Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., said she did not support funding the government in ""bits and pieces.""

""We're the entire United States of America. You keep the whole government going, that's what you're supposed to do,"" she said. ""All they have to do in the House is let the House vote on the Senate (bill) and let the House work it's will.""

The White House agreed. ""These piecemeal efforts are not serious, and they are no way to run a government. If House Republicans are legitimately concerned about the impacts of a shutdown — which extend across government from our small businesses to women, children and seniors — they should do their job and pass a clean CR to reopen the government,"" said Amy Brundage, a White House spokeswoman.

Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said Democrats were not against debating some of the proposals that Republicans offered in the weeks leading up to the shutdown on the Affordable Care Act. He cited as an example a proposal to repeal a 2.3% tax on medical devices enacted to help pay for the law. However, Durbin said Democrats would not negotiate on the stopgap spending bill, or on a pending vote to increase the debt ceiling, the nation's borrowing limit.

""After the CR and the debt ceiling, I have been open to that,"" Durbin said, ""Doing this with a gun to your head, as we've said over and over again, is not the appropriate way to bargain.""

House Republicans huddled in private earlier Tuesday, and lawmakers showed no signs of losing cohesion on the first day of the shutdown. Republicans are bullish about the politics of a shutdown and they have reason to be, said David Wasserman, an analyst for the non-partisan Cook Political Report.

""Democrats have always believed a shutdown would finally make voters pay attention to how 'extreme' House Republicans are. So far there's not a ton of evidence that the game has changed,"" Wasserman said.

The 2014 national landscape still tilts in favor of House Republicans, where only one lawmaker, Rep. Gary Miller, R-Calif., sits in a district currently rated as a ""toss-up"" by Cook. Following a remapping of congressional districts in 2012, House Republicans represent fewer swing seats and are beholden to more conservative constituencies. There is also little institutional memory from the shutdown fights of nearly two decades ago.

Just 37 Republicans currently serving in Congress were present for the shutdowns during the Clinton administration, while 111 Republicans have been elected since President George W. Bush left office, Wasserman said.

In the last shutdown, there was also bipartisan interest in resolving the impasses. At the time, 79 Republicans represented districts President Clinton won. Today, just 17 Republicans represent districts carried by President Obama. ""If anything, Obama has negative leverage with House Republicans,"" Wasserman said.

The polling today is in Democrats favor. A Quinnipiac national poll released Tuesday show American voters oppose 72%-22% Congress shutting down the government in their effort to block implementation of the law. Voters also choose a Democratic candidate over a Republican candidate 43%-34% in a generic ballot, the widest Democratic margin measured so far for the 2014 elections.

""Americans are certainly not in love with Obamacare, but they reject decisively the claim by congressional Republicans that it is so bad that it's worth closing down the government to stop it,"" said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute."

According to a survey I stumbled across just weeks ago, 21 percent believe that a U.F.O. landed in Roswell, N.M., nearly seven decades ago and that the federal government hushed it up, while 14 percent believe in Bigfoot.

According to another survey, taken last year, about 65 percent of us can’t name a single Supreme Court justice. Not the chief one, John Roberts. Not the mute one, Clarence Thomas. Not even the mean one, Antonin Scalia. Though when it comes to Scalia, perhaps the body politic suffers less from ignorance than from repressed memory.

That we Americans are out to lunch isn’t news. But every once in a while a fresh factoid like the Obamacare ignorance comes along to remind us that we’re out to breakfast and dinner as well. And it adds an important, infrequently acknowledged bit of perspective to all the commentary, from us journalists and from political strategists alike, about how voters behave and whom they reward. We purport to interpret an informed, rational universe, because we’d undercut our own insights if we purported anything else.

But only limited sense can be made of what is often nonsensical, and the truth is that a great big chunk of the electorate is tuned out, zonked out or combing Roswell for alien remains. Polls over the last few years have variously shown that about 30 percent of us couldn’t name the vice president, about 35 percent couldn’t assign the proper century to the American Revolution and 6 percent couldn’t circle Independence Day on a calendar. I’m supposing that the 6 percent weren’t also given the holiday’s synonym, the Fourth of July. I’m an optimist through and through."

USA TODAY

Former president says national health care law will help many get insurance coverage

Clinton urges opponents and supporters to work together to implement law

Republicans have criticized law as %27Obamacare%2C%27 say it%27s costly government intrusion

Bill Clinton wore his ""Secretary of Explaining Stuff"" hat Wednesday to defend President Obama's health care law, arguing that it's time to drop opposition to what Republicans slam as ""Obamacare.""

""We need all hands on deck here. The health of our people, the security and stability of our families and the strength of our economy are all riding on getting health care reform right and doing it well,"" Clinton said in remarks at his presidential library in Little Rock. ""That means we have to do it together.""

The speech by the 42nd president is the first in a series of events planned this fall by the Obama White House aimed at improving public awareness of the law as key provisions take effect. On Oct. 1, open enrollment and health insurance exchanges in states will begin. Those exchanges will help people find and buy insurance coverage.

Clinton outlined why he says the law will help health care costs go down and give more people greater access to insurance coverage. He took a step-by-step approach, going through everything in the law from who gets covered to how exchanges work and what needs to be improved.

""This does give us the best chance we have to achieve nearly universal coverage, provide higher quality health care and lower the rate of cost increases, which we have got to do in a competitive global economy,"" he said.

Republicans generally view the law as a costly government intrusion into people's lives. The Tea Party movement and congressional allies, such as Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and Ted Cruz of Texas, have spent the summer drumming up support to withhold funding to implement the Affordable Care Act.

These lawmakers say they are prepared to vote against any bill to fund the government that doesn't bar spending for the health care law – even if it prompts a government shutdown.

""If this was the best defense of the increasingly unpopular law that the administration could muster, it doesn't bode well for Democrats running in 2014,"" RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement. ""And it certainly isn't fair to all of the people who trusted the president to keep his promise that this would make health care more affordable. Instead, Americans across the country are feeling the real effects of this law all across the country — hours cut, jobs lost, premiums rising.""

It's not the first time Obama has turned to Clinton, with whom he once had a frosty relationship, to help him explain policies and garner public support.

Clinton campaigned often for Obama in the 2012 election and delivered a forceful speech at the Democratic National Convention arguing why Obama was worthy of a second term. Obama joked afterward that he should appoint his predecessor the ""Secretary of Explaining Stuff,"" and the moniker stuck.

http://news.yahoo.com/scary-message-everybody-obamas-budget-165520713.html,,[],The Scary Message for Everybody in Obama's Budget,"Most Americans will ignore the dickering over the federal budget that President Barack Obama wants Congress to pass this year. But there's an important message for just about everybody in that budget: The pain is going to get worse.

[READ: Ryan's Budget Is About One Thing: Medicare]

It would be easy to conclude that Washington has imposed enough austerity on the U.S. economy already, given the tax hikes and spending cuts that have already gone into effect this year. Those measures, if they stick, will reduce the national debt by perhaps $2.5 trillion during the next decade.

But that's not enough. Budget experts say Congress needs to cut the debt by at least $4 trillion, plus figure out ways to rein in the mushrooming cost of the biggest budget-busting programs: Social Security, Medicaid and especially Medicare. Budget measures up till now have done nothing about those so-called entitlement programs, but Obama is finally seeking some reforms.

The changes Obama is calling for are less drastic than those advocated by Republicans such as Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Budget Committee. Among other things, Ryan's plan would transfer a major portion of Medicare costs to individuals, as a way of making the whole program more affordable. But Obama would still change entitlements in ways that would have a direct impact on people enrolled in them, in many cases reducing benefits and requiring enrollees to spend more of their own money.

[ENJOY: Political Cartoons on the Deficit and Budget]

Obama, for instance, wants to reformulate the way cost-of-living increases for Social Security payments get calculated. Many experts say switching to a so-called ""chained"" consumer price index would be a more accurate way to measure inflation. But in general it would mean lower cost of living increases for Social Security recipients. For a typical retiree, a 1 percentage point reduction in the cost-of-living increase would cut Social Security payments by about $150 per year.

Story continues

Relatively minor adjustments might be enough to make Social security more stable, but Medicare is a bigger problem. Obama wants to make some administrative changes in the program that might lower payments to healthcare providers, while also reducing benefits or raising premiums for wealthier Medicare patients. But on its current course Medicare is headed for insolvency, and Obama's moves probably wouldn't be enough to change that. At some point, bigger cuts will be needed, with most seniors likely to pay more.

The next several months in Washington will be dominated by news coverage of political posturing on the budget. Democrats and Republicans will accuse each other of selling out seniors and pandering to favored interest groups. We all know the drill, which is why so many people will tune out the overwrought rhetoric.

[READ: Both Parties Bemoan Obama's Budget Proposal]

But it's important to notice the broader message, which is that the government is going to do less for people in the future, and ask more of them. Obama, for example, has said he'd only agree to cutbacks in Medicare and Social Security if Republicans agree to further tax increases on the wealthy. Many economists think tax hikes will have to be more widespread than that at some point, with no way around middle-class tax increases if problems with the federal budget become acute.

Liberal groups are outraged that Obama would propose any change at all in entitlement programs, while conservatives insist they won't agree to any more tax increases, no matter what. That's predictable posturing at either end of the political spectrum. Just about everybody in between knows that eventually there will be more spending cuts and higher taxes. Smart Americans will plan for it.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/30/defense-budget-cuts_n_2584099.html,2013-01-30 00:00:00,['Senior Military Correspondent'],Defense Budget Faces Cuts To Personnel After Decade Of War,"WASHINGTON -- For more than a decade, Congress and the Pentagon have spent money on the nation's 1.3 million active-duty troops and their families. Salaries and benefits soared far above civilian compensation, military bases and housing were refurbished, support services like day care, family counseling and on-base college courses were expanded.

Now comes the reckoning. These personnel costs, necessary and warranted for those bearing the burden of war, are threatening to wreck the military, squeezing the accounts meant to fix or replace gear worn from a decade of war, for research and development, and for new missions in, say, Africa.

So stubbornly are personnel costs rising that at the current rate of increase, they would consume the entire defense budget by the year 2039, leaving well-paid troops standing around with their tanks, ships and airplanes rusting and out of gas.

The problem has been evident for years -- the past two defense secretaries have called personnel costs ""unsustainable."" But neither the Obama White House nor Congress has signalled its willingness to tackle the issue by proposing bold reductions in pay and benefits -- or by deep cuts in the active-duty force.

In his confirmation hearing Thursday, former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) will get a chance to weigh in on the issue as the nominee for defense secretary. He has said nothing in public on the issue, and his background gives little clue: as a successful businessman he's cognizant of the bottom line; as a former combat infantryman, his heart may make him to reluctant to touch the grunts' pay stubs.

But with deep cuts in defense spending barrelling down toward the Pentagon, some defense officials and outside experts fear that the opportunity for thoughtful reforms may be passing. Personnel costs are likely to be cut -- but perhaps not wisely. A freeze on hiring of new civilian personnel, for instance, could demolish plans to hire more mental health care providers for returning troops suffering from post-traumatic stress, even though Ash Carter, deputy defense secretary, has vowed to protect such programs ""to the extent feasible.""

Military pay and benefits ""are the third rail of budget planning in the Defense Department,"" said Gordon Adams, a defense economist who oversaw the post-Cold War defense drawdown during the Clinton administration. With no long-term budget deal in sight and no long-term planning in the works, the shrinking of the Defense Department ""will happen year by year -- more ankle-biting than systematic planning,"" Adams said.

Pentagon spending plans are getting slammed by the automatic cuts under sequestration, scheduled to take place on March 1; by the likelihood that Congress will pass no new defense spending bill, leaving the Pentagon confined, under a continuing resolution to last year's defense budget plan; and by long-term spending cuts which have yet to be made.

But the impact is real. The Pentagon has been spending money it expected from the 2013 budget proposed last year by the White House. Cranking back to conform to last year's budget levels will be painful, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno said recently, requiring the Army to squeeze $6 billion out of its operations and maintenance accounts by Oct. 1. These are funds that pay for fuel, training, some family support programs and vehicle maintenance.

And while Pentagon officials have vowed not to cut family programs, a continuing resolution, rather than a new 2013 budget, will not allow the Army to move money from one operations account to another -- it all gets cut, Odierno said.

""People have been in denial about this ongoing trend, and now the accumulated impact of it is coming home,"" said Clark Murdock, a former senior planner at the Pentagon and a senior analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.

But the data is clear. Since 2001, total military compensation, including pay and benefits, grew by 20.5 percent, while comparable private-sector civilian pay did not increase at all, according to a broad Pentagon review of pay and compensation released last year. The cost of military compensation rose steeply even though the size of the active-duty force grew by only 3 percent during that period.

Part of the reason was that Congress mandated that military personnel should get an annual pay raise 1 to 1.5 percent higher than the Employment Cost Index, which measures civilian earnings.

Thus, a sergeant's base pay and housing allowance rose 20.5 percent between 2001 and 2009, when the average enlisted military member was earning $50,747 in base pay and housing -- not including other allowances and bonuses. Officer pay rose 9.1 percent, to an average of $94,700.

Congress also demanded that the Pentagon absorb a larger share of the housing costs of military families. Their housing allowance was bumped up by 5.7 percent in 2007, another 4.7 percent in 2008 and 5 percent in 2009. Currently, the Pentagon pays all housing costs for families who live off base. Other benefits include shopping at on-base commissaries, which typically save military shoppers about 30 percent on groceries.

Base pay and housing allowance boosts the income of an Army master sergeant with 10 years of service, living at Fort Drum, N.Y., to $84,666.48 a year, according to the current Pentagon pay tables. This sergeant would pay a tax rate of 15 percent, a $6,417.40 tax advantage over civilians.

An Army captain with six years of service with the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum, earns $85,330.80 a year in pay and housing allowance -- not counting bonuses, tax-free danger pay for service in a war zone and other benefits. A brigadier (one-star) general at Fort Drum, with 16 years of service, is earning $131,652 a year plus a housing allowance of $2,247 per month.

""The fiscal reality facing us means that we also have to look at the growth in personnel costs which are a major driver of budget growth and are, simply put, on an unsustainable course,"" soon-to-retire Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said in October 2011. Months later, the White House included in its budget proposal a timid increase of between $31 and $128 a month in the health insurance premiums paid by military retirees, unchanged since 1985. That proposal was trashed by Congress.

But in the new era of budget austerity and tough choices, that kind of congressional protection may not last.

""Our folks are worried about whether they're going to get paid, what support services aren't going to be there to help them and their families,"" said Joyce Raezer, executive director of the National Military Family Association. She defended the increases in pay and benefits by saying, ""We've been at war. We've had to pay for people to be at war.""

The inevitable cuts in defense spending could, if not managed properly, hurt military families, she said. For instance, whittling down the size of the active duty force could put more of a burden on families if the global missions the military is expected to fill aren't reduced as well. ""We are going to be an on-call force, there is going to be trouble somewhere, and if there are fewer people, the ones left will be on call more often,"" said Raezer, a long-time military spouse.

She also worries that cuts in family support programs will drive reductions in mental health services just at a time when they are most needed.

""We're not saying all these programs will be needed forever,"" said Raezer. But in all the talk about budget cuts and dwindling resources, she said, there is no thoughtful plan to reduce spending in a rational way.

""What we see coming,"" she said, ""is budget cuts first -- and then figuring out how to do with less.""

Clarification: Language has been added to clarify the calculations of base pay and allowance increases for specific members of the military. Original language in the headline and copy referring to ""Lavish Benefits"" was inaccurate and reflected neither the views of David Wood nor The Huffington Post. We regret the mischaracterization."
http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/03/13/1193824/-I-Read-Paul-Ryan-s-Budget,2013-03-13 00:00:00,"['This Content Is Not Subject To Review Daily Kos Staff Prior To Publication.', 'Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags']",I Read Paul Ryan's Budget,"General impressions. Before I get into specifics, I want to say a few things about the overall impression the document makes

As many people have already observed, Ryan's proposal is not an attempt to reach a workable compromise with the White House or the Democratic majority in the Senate, both of which would have to agree before his plan could become law. Instead, it's an aspirational document for conservatives: This is what they fantasize about doing if and when they get complete control of the government.

There's nothing wrong with that, but there's also no reason to take it any more seriously than an aspirational budgets from the Left, like People's Budget put out by the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Both are shots across the bow, not plausible projections of what the country will do in FY2014 and beyond.

The write-up is a rallying cry for the troops of the conservative movement, not an attempt to convince or convert the non-believers. The summary (page 7) says ""It invites President Obama and Senate Democrats to commit to the same common-sense goal [of a balanced budget in ten years]"" but there is no spirit-of-invitation in Ryan's style. Any liberal who reads it will get pissed off, and I believe that's intentional. Conservatives couldn't fully enjoy their reading experience without visualizing pissed-off liberals.

Let me detail that: You've probably already heard that Ryan wants (once again) to try to repeal the Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. ObamaCare). But after the first mention, he can't just call the law by name, or even nickname. It's ""the President's onerous health care law"" (page 33) or ""the President's misguided health care law"" (page 40) and so on, as if the ACA had been imposed on the country by imperial decree and Congress had nothing to say about it -- also as if the ACA hadn't been an issue in the 2012 election that Romney/Ryan lost by nearly five million votes.

Other partisan stuff is just silly. On page 24, President Reagan is given credit both for the economic expansion of his era, and of President Clinton's era as well. Clinton is mentioned exactly once, on page 33, when Ryan re-raises the universally debunked lie from campaign 2012 that Obama wants to rescind the work requirement of Clinton's welfare reform. The reader would never know that Ryan's stated goal -- a balanced budget -- was achieved by Clinton while Reagan ran up record deficits.

You will also hear echoes of 2009's Lie of the Year: death panels. The ACA sets up an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to make annual recommendations on keeping Medicare spending within specified limits. The law specifically bans the IPAB from recommending care-rationing, but the heading of the Ryan's section on it (page 40) is ""Repeal the health-care rationing board"".

Background assumptions. In the real world, if a program is important enough, the government could conceivably raise taxes or borrow to pay for it. OK, Ryan's balanced-budget goal won't let him advocate borrowing. But a fundamental assumption that runs through his whole budget -- usually without being stated explicitly -- is that taxes cannot be raised for any purpose. Nothing is important enough to raise taxes to pay for.

Also, defense spending is untouchable. ""There is no foreseeable ‘peace dividend’ on our horizon."" (page 61)

So if the domestic demands on government are growing -- the population is getting older, the infrastructure more decrepit, healthcare more expensive, weather-related disasters more extreme and more frequent, future economic growth more dependent basic research and an educated workforce etc. -- any money you want to spend to deal with one of those challenges has to be taken from the others.

The idea that over the long term our country could decide that it wants to do more of its consumption publicly -- that it wants to take economic growth in the form of Medicare and public education, say, rather than BMWs -- that's completely off the table.

Big Picture. The numbers don't appear until the Appendix (page 80). Atlantic's Derek Thompson put the ten-year cut totals into a bar graph and a pie chart.

Social Security: $0

Defense: $0

Medicare: $129 billion

Discretionary: $249 billion

Interest: $700 billion

Medicaid/other health: $756 billion

Mandatory spending: $962 billion

Obamacare: $1.837 trillion

Medicare and Social Security are usually considered ""mandatory spending"" (because benefits are defined by law rather than by appropriation), but I believe the additional $962 billion of 10-year savings is Food Stamps, Pell grants, and a variety of other people-helping programs.

So the cuts are almost entirely in healthcare, education, or anti-poverty spending.

Meanwhile, rich people get a big bonanza: The top tax rate drops from the current 39.6% to 25%. If you make $10 million some year (some CEOs do), that could save you nearly $1.5 million.

It's also worthwhile to consider what isn't in the budget document.



Any specifics about discretionary spending cuts. The cuts are just numbers on a spreadsheet. All the ""tough choices"" necessary to achieve those numbers are left to your imagination, so Ryan can deny any intention to cut anything in particular, as Mitt Romney did in his first debate with President Obama.

Any specifics about closing tax loopholes. Ryan claims his rich-guys-bonanza 25% tax rate wouldn't cut federal revenue, because it would be balanced by eliminating tax loopholes. As in the 2012 campaign, Ryan says nothing about what those loopholes might be. Again, he can deny wanting to cut any specific item, like the mortgage interest deduction. But he's got to raise that revenue somehow, and I seriously doubt it's all going to come from the super-rich who benefit most from the lower rate.

Page 37 charges: ""In Social Security, government’s refusal to deal with demographic realities has endangered the solvency of this critical program."" But rather than ""deal with demographic realities"" here and now, Ryan only ""requires the President and Congress to work together to forge a solution.""

The background rob-Peter-to-pay-Paul assumption allows Ryan to construct some truly Orwellian statements. This is particularly true in the ""Opportunity Extended"" section, which is all about shrinking opportunity for poor and working-class young people.

For example, on page 20 Ryan identifies ""tuition inflation"" as a problem that ""plung[es] students and their families into unaffordable levels of debt"". And then he says:

Many economists, including Ohio University’s Richard Vedder*, argue that the structure of the federal government’s aid programs don’t simply chase higher tuition costs, but are in fact a key driver of those costs.

What could that possibly mean? Well, that federal aid is allowing too many people to go to college, creating a high-demand environment in which colleges can raise tuition. So the ""solution"" is to lower the maximum Pell grant (thereby ""saving"" the Pell grant program from spending at an ""unsustainable"" level, since we couldn't possibly raise taxes to pay for it). Also to ""target aid to the truly needy"" by making families report more of their income on financial aid forms. Also ""reforming"" student loans and ""re-examining the data made available to students to make certain they are armed with information that will assist them in making their postsecondary decisions"".

Presumably, when the facts of this harsher you're-on-your-own world are spelled out to students, fewer of them will decide to go to college, thereby saving both their money and the government's. So don't worry about student debt -- just don't go to college at all if you're not rich, and if you do go we'll ""help"" you avoid massive debts by refusing to loan you money.

Oh, and we'll also ""encourage innovation"" through ""nontraditional models like online coursework"". Never mind that's where the big scams are. Corporations profit from those scams, so that's not ""waste"".

Ditto for job training: Ryan promises to ""extend opportunity"" by spending less on it.

Ditto for the safety net. Since taxes can't possibly be raised, every person who is helped by the safety net is taking those dollars away from somebody else who might be helped. So Ryan's ""A Safety Net Strengthened"" section is all about spending less on the safety net. Mostly this is accomplished by block-granting programs like Medicaid to give ""states more flexibility to tailor programs to their people’s needs.""

So if, say, low-income Texans need to toughen up and stop seeing a doctor at all, Texas can tailor its program that way. That's what it's doing already with the ""flexibility"" the Supreme Court gave it last summer.

Energy. Climate change just isn't happening. Ryan doesn't say that in so many words, but there's a big empty spot where that idea would be.

He clumps energy together with a grab-bag of other issues in the ""Fairness Restored"" section. The ""unfairness"" in this case is the way that the Obama administration favors clean energy over dirty energy. Ryan will ""end kickbacks to favored industries"" like wind and solar in favor of ""reliable, low-cost energy"" like coal, oil, and gas. With climate change out of the picture, only corruption can explain Obama's favoritism. In his Introduction -- signed ""Paul"" -- Ryan says his budget ""restores fair play to the marketplace by ending cronyism.""

In current energy policy, fossil fuels and green energy are subsidized in different ways: Green energy gets grants and loans while established-and-profitable fossil energy gets tax breaks. Tax breaks are invisible to Ryan, so he can say on page 50:

on a dollar-per-unit-of-production basis, the level of subsidies received by the wind and solar industries were almost 100 times greater than those for conventional energy

So what's the purpose of all this? A better world for our children. ""By living beyond our means, we're stealing from the next generation."" (page 5)

Of course you know how that works, because all that debt America ran up during World War II was ""stolen"" from us, right?

Or maybe you didn't notice, because in the real America, the big deficits of World War II kicked off half a century of prosperity, during which the country achieved a level of equality that it hasn't equalled before or since. So no, deficits are not ""stolen"" from the future. We're not building landing crafts and putting them in time machines to send them back to D-Day.

But in order to save our children from the horrible maybe-sorta-problem of the national debt, we need to under-educate them; not do basic research that might create the next Internet; leave them crumbling roads, bridges, and electrical grids; not care for them when they get sick; move in with them when we get old; and leave them with a torched planet, where Iowa is a desert and Miami is underwater.

I'm sure they'll thank us for our foresight.

http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/sequester-hits-cancer-patients-doctors-lawmakers-seek-fix-092336101.html,,[],"Sequester hits cancer patients — doctors, lawmakers seek fix","You may have heard that White House tours were cut due to across-the-board federal spending cuts known as the sequester. Or that Congress made sure to minimize disruptions to air travel. Or perhaps you know someone being furloughed as a result of the cuts.

But did you know a major fight is being waged over sequester cuts to some cancer drugs?

After Congress failed to pass a budget this spring, a 2 percent cut to Medicare chemotherapy drug reimbursements went into effect April 1 as part of the across-the-board federal spending cuts designed to save $85.4 billion this year.

[Read sequester stories from Yahoo News readers here.]

Many doctors and patients are infuriated, and the issue has made its way into Congress, with a bill introduced in the House to help alleviate the burden being put on those in the cancer community.

Dr. John Cox, a community oncologist at Texas Oncology Methodist Cancer Centers in Dallas and a member of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), told Yahoo News that the idea of treating Medicare patients differently from other patients goes against everything for which doctors stand.

""It makes all of us uneasy when we realize we are treating different populations in our practice differently,"" Cox said.

The pressure put on doctors is significant. Oncologists are typically reimbursed the average sales price for chemotherapy drugs plus 6 percent to cover the cost of storing and administering these drugs. Because purchasing those drugs costs the same as it did before the sequester, many cancer doctors, especially community oncologists who operate in smaller, nonhospital settings—are now unable to keep up with the costs associated with treating Medicare cancer patients who are typically elderly and on fixed incomes.

Indeed, studies from various oncology groups bear out a negative trend: Due to the sequester cut, community practices have begun to turn some people away or to close their doors entirely, shifting patients to hospitals for their chemotherapy treatments where the infrastructure is larger, costs can be better absorbed and some drugs can be purchased for less.

Story continues

A May 9 survey from the Community Oncology Alliance found 49 percent of respondents were sending Medicare patients elsewhere, with many more planning to begin doing so; 21 percent of practices were laying off staff; and 14 percent were in talks with hospitals about forming alliances.

A new survey from ASCO found that 80 percent of respondents say the sequester has affected their practice. Nearly 50 percent said they wouldn't be able to continue caring for Medicare patients who didn't have supplemental insurance, and 50 percent had begun sending patients elsewhere, primarily to hospitals.

Some doctors say that the shift to hospitals could be detrimental to Medicare patients' care due to less personalized service, personal mobility issues and the typically higher overall cost of treatment at a hospital.

""I'm sure that there's some people who say that they are enraged,"" Dr. Jeffery Ward, a community oncologist at Swedish Cancer Institute in Edmonds, Wash., told Yahoo News of the cut. ""I'm just saddened that our government system is so completely inept that they will take the most fragile and vulnerable people in our society and hang them out to dry—and that's what Congress and our government has done.""

Ward said that his practice as a result of the crush of costs—which in addition to the sequester cut includes a shrinking reimbursement system and a Washington state business and operations tax—formed a nonprofit and became part of a local hospital group on April 1. It's a fate he says will become more common under the sequester.

He added that he and his patients are among the luckier ones: Not only can his new hospital group help with costs, but the convenient location means his doctors can continue treating the same patients. But he noted that others might not be as fortunate, especially those in rural areas.

""If you're in a situation where [a] hospital is not willing to work with you or does not wish to take on cancer care, or if you're operating a long ways from a hospital, those are places where clinics may end up closing their doors and where patients will be disadvantaged or put out,"" Ward said.

Cox said some of the talk about the damaging impacts of the sequester from the oncology community might be hyperbole, but negative effects are real and contributing to an already crushing system of physician reimbursement, in his opinion.

""We have not changed any practice, at least that I’m aware of, in our group because of the 2 percent sequester,"" Cox said of his larger practice. But he said that fact belies a gradual ""belt-tightening"" and ""dramatic"" changes in outpatient medical oncology.

If the cut remains and other financial pressures continue to ramp up, he added, his group will reevaluate its ability to operate outreach centers and conduct clinical research work.

""Fiscally, I want people to be responsible, but taking a blood axe to the federal budget and doing it broadly across the board seems crazy to me,"" he added about the sequester.

Similar opinions were expressed earlier this year about the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air traffic controller furloughs under the sequester, which threatened to result in the cancellation of flights and disruption of air travel for millions, as well as the closing of some airports.

Congress asked the FAA to step in and shift money to avoid furloughs, but the government said it had no authority to do so. As a result, Congress united and passed a bill to give special permission to the FAA to transfer money within its budget and cut elsewhere to avoid furloughs to air traffic controllers.

Members of Congress have urged the government to make a similar exception to protect cancer drugs from the sequester.

Members of the Senate and House sent letters—124 House members to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) —asking if officials could exempt cancer drugs.

The 124 House members who wrote CMS received their response last Wednesday, and it wasn't encouraging.

From Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the CMS:

The Department of Health and Human Services assessed whether the law allows discretion to administer the sequestration reductions in a manner that is different from the across the board approach that has been used to implement it. We do not believe that we have the authority under the Budget Control Act of 2011 to exempt Medicare payment for Part B drugs.

That response appears to put the onus on Congress for a policy solution.

North Carolina Republican Rep. Renee Ellmers, a former registered nurse—who supports the sequester's aim to reduce federal spending, but not its indiscriminate cuts—introduced in early April a bill to exempt cancer drugs from the sequester and to force Medicare to reimburse oncologists for the reduced payments they have so far been issued under the sequester.

She told Yahoo News last week that she believes Tavenner's response, while disappointing, boosts the argument for her legislative fix.

""I feel that this will increase the number of co-sponsors quickly,"" Ellmers said of the CMS response. Indeed, supporters believe that some members were awaiting a formal response from the government before signing on to Ellmers' bill.

Ellmers said she picked up two co-sponsors the day after Tavenner's letter was released—""probably the result"" of the response from CMS. She ended the week with four additional co-sponsors, putting her total at 85 supporters from both parties as of late Friday.

Supporters of Ellmers' bill say that much like the FAA fix, this legislation has the potential of being passed due to wide bipartisan support.

""Needing those spending cuts to me was the ultimate goal, but at the same time when you realize that you've hurt vulnerable individuals, that's when you need to make the changes,"" Ellmers said. ""And that's what we should be doing here in Washington. ... If we see that we've affected someone on a personal level as an unintended consequence of something that we've done, then we need to fix that problem."""

Nearly 10,000 Rhode Islanders are set to get an automatic raise beginning Wednesday as the state raises its minimum wage to $8 an hour. The hike goes into effect New Year's Day, and will put Rhode Island on par with Massachusetts. Twelve other states will also start the new year with a higher minimum, including Connecticut, which is going from $8.25 to $8.70 an hour. New York is also set to increase its minimum wage to $8 effective Tuesday.

A CNN poll taken last week showed that many Americans are exaggerating the effect of Obamacare on their own lives. As I wrote on Tuesday, this suggests the law will get a bump in public support over the next few months, as the widely anticipated negative consequences don't materialize for most people outside the health-care insurance exchanges. The poll is interesting for another reason: It suggests that the public's divergent views on Obamacare don't reflect different opinions about the proper role of government, so much as wildly different understandings about what the law will mean for the average American. Here's the thing: They can't both be right.

Flavelle is correct. When conservatives argue that ACA will simply collapse and go away, they're wrong. All ACA does is build on the existing system. Sure, it's flawed. But it's also not going away any time soon. Why do conservatives argue that? Because they'd otherwise have to deal with the reality of 6 million more people getting insurance Jan 1, and they apparently can't. They've predicted no one will want it. And the cognitive dissonance is making them claim very stupid things.

Pollak'],Republicans Do Have a Strategy–Even If They Had to Stumble onto It,"Conservatives, and Republicans in general, have been accused of having “no strategy” in the showdown with President Barack Obama and the Democrats over Obamacare, the government shutdown, and the debt ceiling. It might be argued that the Republicans only adopted their strategy by accident, but they do have one, and it is both necessary and long overdue: win back disenchanted voters by fighting for their interests–hard.

The conventional wisdom in Washington, DC, repeated ad infinitum in the opinion pages and on the weekend news shows, is that Republicans blundered by allowing President Obama to cajole them into a government shutdown. Now, the thinking goes, Democrats have a way to shift the weight of policy failures, scandals, and the Obamacare disaster: they can blame Republicans for causing fiscal and economic chaos–and warn of more.

It is true that the public blames Republicans for causing the shutdown–and well they might. It is also true, however, that the public understands that President Obama has been inflicting as much pain on them as possible in an effort to win a political fight. His refusal to negotiate, and his willingness to use petty tactics such as closing open-air war memorials, have caused his approval ratings to drop to nearly unprecedented levels.

Had Republicans followed the conventional wisdom on Obamacare and waited until 2016 to fight the issue, none of the above would have happened. Meanwhile, millions of Americans would have faced the daunting prospect of losing their health insurance or their jobs to a new, unfamiliar, unwieldy, and ultimately more expensive policy. They would have looked to Washington, only to see no one–at all–fighting to protect them.

Amidst the many competing versions of what a new Republican strategy should look like after 2012, the one common theme was that the party needed to learn how to relate to the concerns of ordinary people. There is nothing more basic, no issue more “kitchen table,” than the cost of health insurance. Symbolic votes against Obamacare may look good on campaign literature, but voters are smart enough to see through those tactics.

Another repeated exhortation was the need to reach out to Latino voters. And yet it has gone virtually unnoticed that the man leading the revolt against Obamacare on Capitol Hill, the man who shifted the GOP out of its torpor, is a Hispanic Republican–easily now the most recognizable Hispanic leader in America. For his trouble, he has been vilified by the wiser heads in his own party, who think appealing to Latinos means amnesty.

The major strategic challenge facing Republicans prior to the shutdown fight was the fact that millions of core GOP voters stayed home in 2012 and looked likely to do so again after the party leadership became consumed by debates over immigration reform. With few swing districts at stake in 2014, and Democrats vulnerable in key Senate races, the task–though many GOP leaders ignored it–was to reach out to the base.

Yes, the shutdown exposed Republicans to possible defection by independent voters. But President Obama, who evidently believes that the shutdowns of the 1990s foretell victory today, has missed one of the key lessons of that battle. President Bill Clinton won largely because he cast himself as a savior–of health care, education, and the environment. President Obama, in contrast, has auditioned for the role of executioner.

And so, ironically, Republicans have been able to cast themselves as the protectors of popular government programs by passing “rifle-shot” bills to fund each of them alone. At the very least, the GOP has prevented the damage from being worse. They do not look mean, as Gingrich did in 1995-6; they merely look irresponsible. And in that category, the president is giving them stiff competition by taking an ill-advised hard-line position.

All year, the Republicans’ clear–if quiet–legislative strategy has been to use the Full Faith and Credit Act as a backstop against default, strengthening their position in debt ceiling talks with the president. The only immediate political effect of the shutdown was to move that fight forward a week. But the strategic effect was great, and profound: the GOP is now back on course to connect with its missing voters–just in time for 2014."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/09/29/house-leadership-says-it-still-has-options-to-avoid-government-shutdown/,2013-09-29 00:00:00,[],House leadership says it still has options to avoid government shutdown,"A House Republican leader said Sunday the chamber has several last-minute options to avoid a government shutdown should the Senate reject a temporary spending bill the House passed early Sunday morning that includes a one-year delay for ObamaCare.

House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy stuck with House leadership’s insistence that its proposal can indeed pass in the Democrat-controlled Senate, but acknowledged having an alternative plan.

“You assume they won’t vote for it. Let’s have that debate,” the California Republican told “Fox News Sunday.” But “we have other options for the Senate to look at.”

The government would technically run out of money Monday night should Congress fail to pass a temporary spending bill, resulting in a partial government shutdown that would begin with hundreds of thousands of government workers likely being sent home from work without pay.

The House proposal passed early Sunday morning includes two amendments to a spending bill passed Friday by the Senate. One delays ObamaCare for a year and the other repeals the law’s medical device tax. The lower chamber also passed a bill to pay the military on time should a government shutdown occur.

Just hours after House Republicans announced their plan Saturday afternoon, the White House vowed President Obama would veto it. And Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made clear it was unacceptable.

“To be absolutely clear, the Senate will reject both the one-year delay of the Affordable Care Act and the repeal of the medical device tax,"" Reid said. ""After weeks of futile political games from Republicans, we are still at square one.""

Earlier this month, the Senate rejected a House spending bill to defund ObamaCare, despite a filibuster-style effort by Tea Party-backed, Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz.

McCarthy declined to tell Fox News whether one of the proposals would be passing a so-called “clean” spending bill, or continuing resolution, which would keep open the government for a few days until Congress agrees on a longer-term plan. But he insisted the House will not be responsible for a shutdown and that it will offer a proposal with Democratic support.

“We are not shutting the government down,” he said. “While the president was out playing golf [Saturday], we were here until 1 a.m. We will pass a bill that reflects this House. … I think they’ll be additions that Democrats can support.”

Right now, the House bill covers government spending through Dec. 15, while the Senate bill goes through Nov. 15."

In fact, Michael Lee, attorney for the Pontiac Education Association, alleged in an Oakland County Circuit lawsuit filed this week that the reason school officials were putting the money into the general fund was to try and deceive Michigan officials as to the status of the state-approved plan to reduce the district’s deficit of $37.7 million. “They have been taking money out of our checks and they haven’t been paying MESSA (Michigan Education Special Services Association),” said Aimee McKeever, president of the PEA. As a result, the insurance carrier canceled coverage effective July 31. [...] The lawsuit names each trustee individually, including Board President Carrol Turpin, Vice President Karen Cain, Secretary Brenda Carter, Treasurer Sherman Williams II and trustees Susan Loveland, Mattie McKinney-Hatchett and S. Barbara Raby. Also named are Paul Bryant, business manager, who, according to the lawsuit, has sole authority to make payments to vendors; and former Superintendent Brian Dougherty, who was charged with running daily operations from Aug. 27, 2012 until May 17, 2013.

The district actually owes MESSA $11 million going back as far as the 2011-2012 school year.

This case will likely be used to defend taking over the Pontiac school system under the control of an emergency manager. It is currently ""under review"" by the state of Michigan. The first thing that should happen is that these corrupt school officials should be sent to jail for their crimes if the allegations are found to be true. What happens all too often is that corruption at the top is then projected on to the teachers who are the innocent victims of poor management, corruption, and malfeasance. They are then victimized again by being portrayed as greedy for wanting health insurance in the first place.

Rather than using this as an excuse to screw teachers over more, we should be using it as a motivation to (a) better fund our schools, (b) start treating teachers with the dignity and respect that they deserve, and (c) pass a single-payer, universal health care law that would solve this issue once and for all.

If one single teacher or one of their family members is harmed or, Goddess forbid, dies because they lack health insurance from this, the people responsible for this heinous act will bear the full responsibility.

It's important to note that this isn't just moving around piles of money that are in the school district's budget. They literally took money the teachers paid out of pocket and applied it to their bottom line. The outcome is that these teachers effectively had their benefits stripped and their pay cut at the same time and they never even knew it was happening. It is theft, pure and simple.

These teachers deserve better. So, so much better."

Tea party groups, along with some skeptical liberals, say the [bipartisan-developed Common Core] standards amount to a federal takeover of education in a country with a long tradition of local control over public schools. Some conservatives have seized on an optional side project that would have made it possible for states to share student records and test results with researchers, education officials and even software developers. Supporters described the voluntary data sharing, funded by private foundations, as a tool to help educators design effective classroom practices. But critics decried it as a Big Brother intrusion — and several states have indicated that they won’t participate.

Basic principles: you cannot work in the tea party on anything, and they are paranoid about everything. Their paranoia is aided and abetted by the national press (yet again) over non-scandals. Lesson learned yet, Washington?

“Now, we’re seeing the arrogance. We’re seeing the cronyism in practice in this second term,” Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin recently asserted, sounding a lot like his vice-presidential candidate self from 2012, when Republicans spent a good deal of time attacking the president as a self-satisfied autocrat who used his power to reward friends and punish enemies. Not everyone in the party, however, is so sure that they can expand their ranks in Congress or improve their standing among voters by personally attacking the president, whose likability ratings stand near 80 percent even if only half of Americans approve of his job performance. And they are cautioning their fellow party members to avoid building their campaigns around the same kinds of messages that have fallen flat before.

Japan, the largest market for U.S. wheat exports, suspended imports from the United States and canceled a major purchase of white wheat on Thursday after the recent discovery of unapproved genetically modified wheat in an 80-acre field in Oregon. How the altered crop made its way to the Oregon field remains a mystery. The strain was developed by Monsanto to make wheat resistant to the company’s own industry-leading weed killer. Monsanto tested the type of altered seed in more than a dozen states, including Oregon, between 1994 and 2005, but it was never approved for commercial use.

More politics and policy below the fold."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/opinion/krugman-the-ignorance-caucus.html,2013-02-11 00:00:00,['Paul Krugman'],The Ignorance Caucus - The New York Times,"Last week Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, gave what his office told us would be a major policy speech. And we should be grateful for the heads-up about the speech’s majorness. Otherwise, a read of the speech might have suggested that he was offering nothing more than a meager, warmed-over selection of stale ideas.

To be sure, Mr. Cantor tried to sound interested in serious policy discussion. But he didn’t succeed — and that was no accident. For these days his party dislikes the whole idea of applying critical thinking and evidence to policy questions. And no, that’s not a caricature: Last year the Texas G.O.P. explicitly condemned efforts to teach “critical thinking skills,” because, it said, such efforts “have the purpose of challenging the student’s fixed beliefs and undermining parental authority.”

And such is the influence of what we might call the ignorance caucus that even when giving a speech intended to demonstrate his openness to new ideas, Mr. Cantor felt obliged to give that caucus a shout-out, calling for a complete end to federal funding of social science research. Because it’s surely a waste of money seeking to understand the society we’re trying to change.

Want other examples of the ignorance caucus at work? Start with health care, an area in which Mr. Cantor tried not to sound anti-intellectual; he lavished praise on medical research just before attacking federal support for social science. (By the way, how much money are we talking about? Well, the entire National Science Foundation budget for social and economic sciences amounts to a whopping 0.01 percent of the budget deficit.)"

He Joined The Newspaper In', 'Reported Washington To']",Healthcare an obstacle as Republicans court Latinos,"As Republican leaders try to woo Latino voters with a new openness to legal status for the nation’s illegal immigrants, the party remains at odds with America’s fastest-growing ethnic community on another key issue: healthcare.

Latinos, who have the lowest rates of health coverage in the country, are among the strongest backers of President Obama’s healthcare law. In a recent national poll, supporters outnumbered detractors by more than 2 to 1. Latinos also overwhelmingly see guaranteeing healthcare as a core government responsibility, surveys show.



Yet congressional Republicans continue to make repeal of the 2010 Affordable Care Act a top agenda item and have renewed calls for deep cuts in health programs such as Medicaid, which are very popular with Latinos.

“Obamacare is a colossal mistake for our country,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said recently in a speech on the Senate floor. “It needs to be pulled out by its roots.”

Republican National Committee spokeswoman Alexandra Franceschi expressed confidence that Latinos would ultimately recognize that the law raises costs and burdens businesses. “We’re going to do a better job explaining why this law is negatively affecting all Americans, including the Hispanic community,” she said.

At the same time, however, attacking the law risks undermining the RNC’s planned minority outreach campaign, which party leaders said in a recent strategy blueprint must convince Latinos “we care about them.”

“This is going to hurt Republicans,” said Matt Barreto, cofounder of Latino Decisions, a nonpartisan national polling firm. “When Republicans keep saying they will repeal the health law, Latinos hear the party is going to take away their healthcare.”

Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney received just 27% of the Latino vote in November, in large measure because of his harsh rhetoric about illegal immigrants. But he also made overturning the health law a central plank of his campaign. His first Spanish-language ad after he won the 2012 nomination promised he would issue an executive order to roll back the law on his first day in office.

Obama, meanwhile, made upholding the Affordable Care Act a core part of his Latino strategy. A quarter of the president’s advertising in Spanish focused on the law, said James Aldrete, who oversaw Spanish-language media strategy for Obama in 2008 and 2012. “We knew from the start that, if Latinos knew about the benefits of the law, they were going back the president,” he said. “It was central to our messaging.”

In one widely aired television ad, Cristina Saralegui, a popular talk-show host, explained in Spanish how the law would help millions of Latinos get health insurance. In another, a campaign volunteer visiting a middle-aged man with diabetes, which is widespread among Latinos, said: “Family is important to President Obama, and he understands that families that are fighters sometimes have lost everything when someone gets sick.”

Surveys indicate that close to 30% of Latino citizens and legal permanent residents lack health insurance. By comparison, just 11% of white and 17% of black Americans are uninsured, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Starting next year, the health law will provide hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies to low-income Americans and legal residents to help pay insurance premiums. Illegal immigrants cannot receive these subsidies.

The law will also provide states with additional federal aid if they open their Medicaid programs to more of their poor residents. That, too, will likely disproportionately benefit Latinos, nearly 30% of whom rely on government health insurance, at twice the rate of white Americans.

The high numbers of Latinos who are uninsured or depend on public programs reflect their lower incomes and their concentration in industries, such as the service sector, that often don’t provide health benefits.

“Latinos realize that government will not fulfill every need, but what they admire about the United States is that the government steps in when there is a need,” said Lorena Chambers, a Latina media consultant who worked on a campaign to help pass the president’s health law.

Nearly half of Latinos in a recent Pew Research Center poll said they trusted the federal government to do the right thing “always” or “most of the time.” Just 20% of white respondents felt that way. And two-thirds of Latinos believed the federal government should ensure that everyone has access to health insurance, a 2012 Latino Decisions survey found.

Challise Brittain, an unemployed teacher of Puerto Rican descent from Mississippi, said she was looking forward to getting health insurance under Obama’s healthcare law next year. Brittain, 30, and her husband, an accountant, lost their jobs and their health coverage last year. Their two children, who are 2 and 4, qualify for Medicaid. Brittain responded to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll.

Republicans, she said, just don’t seem to understand that kind of struggle. “It seems like whatever the president is for, they are against. They don’t care about how that affects real people,” she said.

The Republican National Committee acknowledged the damage caused by that perception in outlining its strategy to win over Latinos. “They want to know that we are not just the party for those at the top of the economic ladder because our dream of a better life is for them, too,” party leaders wrote.

But Republicans show few signs of changing course on healthcare.

GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill pushed more votes last month to repeal all or part of the law, after more than 30 such votes in 2011 and 2012. And the GOP budget just passed by the House would repeal the new health law and slash billions of dollars from future Medicaid spending, leaving tens of millions of mostly low-income Americans — many of them Latino — without health coverage.

Even two of the party’s most prominent Latino politicians have taken up the repeal refrain.

Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, considered a likely presidential contender, cited the law as an example of government hurting people in his GOP response to Obama’s State of the Union speech in February. And newly elected Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a tea party favorite, used his first major speech on the Senate floor to push an amendment to defund the law.

http://news.yahoo.com/a-biden--comeback---he-never-left-223415687.html,,[],A Biden 'comeback'? He never left,"Vice President Joe Biden helped usher in the Obamacare era with a now-famous expression that, while commonly used, cannot be printed here in full. But the voluble veep has kept an uncharacteristically low profile for the past three weeks as Obama’s signature domestic achievement has labored through a thoroughly botched rollout.

Biden, so often at the heart of solutions to past fiscal standoffs, also was silent during the government shutdown and debt ceiling wars. One unconfirmed report said he was deliberately sidelined by Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. On two occasions, the White House left the vice president off the list of attendees when President Barack Obama met with congressional leaders.

When Obama pushed for immigration reform Thursday, there was Biden — standing and smiling next to Obama but not speaking.

Is this the calm before the 2016 storm? Has the VP — the guy who “rode sheriff” on the stimulus, handled major foreign policy headaches, and led the ill-fated push on gun violence — been, for lack of a better coinage, Bide-lined?

Not even close. And that Biden-shaped hole in your life is about to be a thing of the past.

“In the next couple of months, the vice president will travel an average of two days a week and will continue to be deeply engaged on foreign policy,” an aide told Yahoo News.

(Not long after this story posted, the vice president’s office announced that Biden would go to Austin, Texas, on Oct. 30 to highlight efforts to curb violence against women. In a separate statement, it also announced that he would travel to Panama in late November to have a look at the Panama Canal expansion project.)

In the runup to the Obamacare rollout, Biden sat down for interviews and placed op-eds (like this one in the key 2016 state of Iowa) and telephone calls “designed to directly reach young Americans, Latinos [and] African-Americans, and thank key stakeholders who are still working tirelessly to educate their communities” about the law, a Biden aide said.

Story continues

Biden, joined by Department of Health and Human Services officials, held a conference call with 3,000 nurses from 25 nursing organizations working to enroll patients around the United States in Obamacare.

Op-eds by Biden or HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius ran in 29 local papers, according to the vice president’s office.

As the health care marketplaces opened Oct 1, Biden did an interview on College Radio Day, reaching 400 college radio stations. That kind of outreach will be crucial to whether the law succeeds, since the exchanges need young and healthy Americans to sign up in order to offset older, sicker members who require more care.

So what about the shutdown? Where was Biden, so often the administration’s point man for negotiating last-minute deals with Republicans?

Biden and Obama aides said that the vice president was in every meeting at the White House. He “spent many hours with President Obama every day,” a Biden aide said.

So what about those two instances, on Oct. 9 and Oct 15, when the White House left him off the list of upcoming high-profile meetings? Biden and Obama aides said this was entirely unintentional, the result of thinned-out communications staff who were racing to match leaks from congressional Republicans. “It’s absurd. If we’d wanted to sideline him, we just wouldn’t have invited him,” one West Wing official said.

Did Reid really work to make sure Biden didn’t cut a deal with Republicans? “Another option: The VP wasn’t involved in negotiations because our position was ‘no negotiations,’” said a Democratic official.

But the shutdown did sideline Biden in one respect: A scheduled (and announced) Oct. 11 fundraising event for Newark Mayor Cory Booker’s successful Senate run fell by the wayside.

“The shutdown forced our office to reschedule a number of official and political events,” a Biden aide explained.

Even so, Biden was hardly low-profile. On Oct. 4, he joined Obama for a highly unusual stroll to a sandwich shop near the White House.

Biden also has stayed busy behind the scenes. On Wednesday, he met behind closed doors with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

With the shutdown now in the rearview mirror, Biden attended an Oct. 15 Medal of Honor ceremony and the Oct. 18 nomination of a new Homeland Security secretary, and traveled to Massachusetts on Oct. 23 for an event promoting mental health."
http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/03/13/1193767/-Paul-Ryan-explains-why-Republicans-can-still-win-the-2012-election,2013-03-13 00:00:00,"['Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags', 'Showtags Popular_Tags']",Paul Ryan explains why Republicans can still win the 2012 election,"Just when you thought the 2012 election was officially over...

Just when you thought the 2012 election was officially over...

Ryan is sticking to his guns. “So just because the election didn’t go our way, that means we’re supposed to change our principles? We’re supposed to just go along to get along? We reject that view,” he tells National Review Online in an interview at his Capitol Hill office. “A budget is supposed to be a display of your vision,” he adds. “Our vision is a world without Obamacare.”

“I think it’s different now that the rubber is hitting the road with respect to Obama’s policies,” Ryan says. “We ran against the Obama policies before they were implemented. Obama was able to protect them with his rhetoric, but he was never measured against his results. Now, in the second term, they’re implementing these things, they’re putting details in writing, regulations are coming out, and we’re seeing just how different these proposals are than the rhetoric that was used to sell them.” [...] “I don’t see this last election as the end of this story,” he says. “I see it as a chapter in this story. A story for the fight over the soul of America, and I believe that the chapter we’re entering is one where conservatives have a better chance of triumphing, because the president’s actual proposals don’t add up and people are going to see that.”

Move over, Karl Rove. You might not have been willing to accept the verdict of voters on election night, but Paul Ryan—who actually lost the election—is still holding out hope for victory. Actually, he's not just holding out hope: He's convinced that he will win.According to Ryan, the GOP's vision for a world without Obamacare has never been in a better position to prevail. Why? Because Obamacare is now being implemented:Yeah, that makes total sense. In fact, it's actually a good thing that Chief Justice John Roberts recognized Obamacare was constitutional, because otherwise it would have been blocked, which would have made getting rid of it much, much harder. And it's also good that President Obama himself won reelection in 2012, because otherwise Republicans could have simply repealed it, which would have made it permanent. Makes total sense, right?

And, come to think of it, it was a stroke of brilliance for Paul Ryan to include all of Obamacare's deficit-reduction measures in his budget, including hundreds of billions in Medicare savings, because what better way to undermine Obamacare than to propose keeping it in place?

In all seriousness, Ryan's argument might sound attractive to Obamacare detractors, but it is completely disingenuous. It would be one thing if Republicans were trying their hardest to make Obamacare work, but in most states and with most Republicans in Congress, the opposite is true. GOP legislators on Capitol Hill are busily trying to block essential funds for Obamacare and most Republican governors are doing everything they can to make implementing the law difficult. So despite what Ryan said, Republicans aren't sitting on the sidelines letting Obamacare succeed or fail on its own: They are actively engaged in efforts to wreck it, even after losing the 2012 election. Obamacare is still a battle—fortunately, Ryan's side is still losing."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/01/Mitch-McConnell-Time-for-GOP-establishment-to-stand-up-to-conservatives,2013-12-01 00:00:00,['Matthew Boyle'],Mitch McConnell: Time for GOP Establishment to 'Stand Up to' Tea Party,"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican up for re-election in 2014, told the Washington Examiner in an interview published Friday that he believes it is time for the GOP establishment to stop conservatives and Tea Partiers.

McConnell argued it is “utter nonsense” for groups like the Senate Conservatives Fund (SCF), which has endorsed his primary challenger businessman Matt Bevin, to argue that Republicans like him in Congress are not fighting hard enough to defeat Democrats. In the interview, McConnell focused on deriding Tea Partiers for leading the effort to defund Obamacare–something that, coupled with the Democrats’ refusal to compromise on the soon-to-fail Obamacare, resulted in a government shutdown.

“The Senate Conservatives Fund is giving conservatism a bad name,” McConnell told the Examiner for the piece titled “The Establishment Fights Back: Mitch McConnell leads GOP battle against Tea Party insurgents.”

“They’re [SCF] participating in ruining the [Republican] brand,” McConnell said. “What they do is mislead their donors into believing the reason that we can’t get as good an outcome as we’d like to get is not because of a Democratic Senate and a Democratic president, but because Republicans are insufficiently committed to the cause–which is utter nonsense.”

McConnell had not only personally opposed, during the shutdown, the effort from Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) to defund Obamacare, he actually whipped votes against them, according to a Congressional source. Cruz and Lee had staked their battle on a key cloture vote that would have, if McConnell had united the Republican Party to deliver 41 votes against the use of taxpayer money to fund Obamacare, stopped Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid from using a procedural ploy to fund Obamacare with just 51 votes.

McConnell voted with the Senate Democrats in favor of cloture and reportedly whipped the Senate GOP conference to join him. While a majority of Senate Republicans–25, including McConnell–voted to allow Reid to procedurally fund Obamacare with just 51 votes cloture, 19 stood with Cruz and Lee. Those 19 Republicans included senior GOP senators like Sens. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Jim Risch (R-ID), and Jerry Moran (R-KS).

McConnell made an argument for what he termed “electable” candidates that he deems necessary to win back the U.S. Senate for the GOP. “To have the kind of year we ought to have in 2014, we have to have electable candidates on November ballots in every state–people that don’t scare the general electorate and can actually win, because winners make policy and losers go home,” McConnell said in his interview with the Examiner. “We can’t just turn the other cheek and hope for the best. It didn’t work in 2010 and 2012 so we’re going to try something different in 2014.”

McConnell is now, according to Bloomberg News, getting financial backing from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in his reelection campaign against Bevin.

“The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is pouring money into a television advertising campaign defending Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, whose primary fight against a Tea Party-backed rival is shaping up as a test of establishment efforts to reclaim the Republican Party,” Bloomberg reported last Wednesday. “The business lobby will spend about $180,000 on a 10-day statewide blitz beginning Dec. 2 on behalf of McConnell, a five-term Republican, said a person familiar with the plans who asked not be identified because the ad buy hasn’t been announced.”

The Chamber of Commerce is leading the GOP establishment’s efforts to undercut the Tea Party movement and is the tip of the spear–along with Crossroads GPS’s Karl Rove–of the establishment’s efforts to strike back against the surging grassroots conservatism across America.

Bevin has been gaining steam lately, partly due to McConnell’s mistakes in attacking conservatives and also by wrapping up a series of key grassroots support elements like an 85 percent victory in the Boone County, KY, GOP straw poll right before Thanksgiving. In an interview last weekend with Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon on Breitbart News Sunday, Bevin described his primary challenge against McConnell as a “microcosm” of the national fight between the Tea Party movement and the GOP establishment.

Rather than embracing conservatism, McConnell’s strategy has been to attempt to isolate and excoriate SCF for backing Bevin. McConnell has been largely unsuccessful in doing so, as his actions have garnered him attention and criticism from other Tea Party-minded organizations who say attacking SCF is attacking the entire conservative movement.

Tea Party Patriots national coordinator Jenny Beth Martin and Tea Party Express chairwoman Amy Kremer both say it is unfair to attack SCF and try to separate the organization, which was founded by Heritage Foundation president former Sen. Jim DeMint (R-SC) and whose help has directly led to the elections of Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT), among many others.

McConnell’s latest slip-up, as it is being portrayed by Bevin, is a quote that appeared in the Bowling Green Daily News, in which McConnell said that he would be open to allowing Obamacare to remain the law of the land provided significant changes were made to it.

McConnell said “he is not averse to talking about changes [to Obamacare], provided they are significant ones,” the paper reported.

“I’m just not going to throw somebody a lifeline (by extending the deadline for signup) just to get someone through the election,” McConnell said.

In response to that comment, Bevin held a conference call with reporters both in national and in Kentucky media to point out the Senate Minority Leader has essentially abandoned his previous promises to repeal Obamacare “root and branch.”

“We really want to call attention to the fact that there really is nothing conservative about his approach and there is really nothing with respect to what the American people want, which is a repeal,” Bevin said on the call, according to the Courier-Journal newspaper in Louisville, Kentucky."

There was impasse after impasse, heated rhetoric on both sides and talk of an economic catastrophe. On Wednesday, things finally settled down with a bipartisan deal. Here are some basic questions and answers about what’s going on:

What’s happened?

On Wednesday, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate reached a deal to open the government and to raise the debt ceiling through early next year. The House and Senate approved the bill Wednesday night, to be followed by a promised signature from President Obama — ending a two-part crisis.

The first part started Oct. 1, when the government partially shut down, closing federal agencies and furloughing hundreds of thousands of workers.

Senate leaders announced a budget compromise Wednesday that will raise the debt ceiling and re-open the government. In Play's Chris Cillizza breaks down which political players came out of the deal on top and which ones did not. (The Washington Post)

The second part was the fight over raising the debt ceiling, a legal limit on how much the government can borrow. If the limit is not raised in a timely fashion, the government will default on its obligations, which include Social Security payments and payments to investors in government debt.

What will the deal do?

The deal has five main parts:

●Immediately reopens the government and funds it through Jan. 15.

●Raises the debt ceiling through Feb. 7 but allows federal borrowing to continue for a few weeks longer, using special accounting measures.

●Requires additional measures, favored by Republicans, to ensure that people who receive financial help to buy medical insurance under the new health-care law are being honest about their income.

●Sets up a negotiating committee to try to come up with a longer-term budget plan so we don’t go through this again early next year. The committee is expected to issue budget recommendations by Dec. 13.

●Provides back pay to furloughed federal workers.

When will federal agencies reopen?

As early as Thursday in most cases.

When will federal workers get back pay?

Uncertain, but as soon as possible.

So with Obama’s signature, is this truly over?

Yes.

Why has this taken so long?

There are two reasons.

1. Democracy.

2. A group of conservative tea party Republicans in the House wanted to halt or delay Obama’s health-care law to keep the government functioning.

But there won’t actually be major changes to the health-care law in the deal?

Right.

Who won, and who lost?

It seems pretty clear in this round of the budget wars, Obama and the Democrats outmaneuvered their Republican opponents.

House Republicans decided to shut down the government in hopes of major changes to the health-care law, but none were in the offing. Senate Republicans reluctantly went along with that strategy — at least for a while. In the meantime, the GOP brand was badly beaten up in the polls.

Prognosticators now say that Republicans could have a hard time winning the Senate in 2014, even though the electoral map is stacked against the Democrats. But the House still looks safe for the GOP.

Meanwhile, Obama and fellow Democrats stuck to their view that they would not pay a “ransom” to accomplish the basic tasks of keeping the government open and raising the debt limit.

Hold up — wasn’t Obama forced to compromise to raise the debt ceiling and open the government?

Not really. Obama gave the flimsiest of fig leaves to the Republicans: a promise to do a better job ensuring that people who report their income to get help buying health insurance are reporting their income properly. There were already some assurances in the health-care law, so all the president promised was an additional layer of scrutiny.

So is it all wonderful for Obama and Democrats?

Again, not really. For all the drama, they got little out of this deal. They won’t be rolling back the deep spending cuts known as the sequester that took effect earlier this year and are eating away at domestic priorities, including education and research and development. They won’t be getting new money to spend on jobs or an immigration bill.

They just got a political win. And they avoided an economic disaster.

What happens next?

Per the outlines of the agreement, Republicans and Democrats will assign lawmakers to a committee to hash out a broader budget plan for the coming year. These joint efforts have not had success in the recent past.

But hope dies hard. For Democrats and Republicans alike, the basic question in the committee will be whether they can find a way to roll back the sequester, which is due to launch a new round of budget cuts in January.

Democrats hate the sequester because it’s basically the opposite of their vision of domestic investment. Republicans are more ambivalent, but there are many in the GOP who don’t like how deeply it cuts Pentagon spending.

The most likely path to replacing part of the sequester is to instead make cuts to mandatory spending, such as health-care programs or farm subsidies. On a practical level, Republicans and Democrats agree that mandatory spending is better to cut, because it’s the long-term driver of debt. But it also has entrenched constituencies, such as the elderly or farmers, which makes such cuts difficult to achieve.

A bigger budget deal — the elusive “grand bargain” — could also be considered as part of the committee’s talks. But any discussion of significant changes to mandatory spending usually leads Democrats to insist on new taxes, which has been a deal-breaker for the GOP.

What happens if the committee fails to come to an agreement and we’re back in January with new deadlines?

There could be a big, new fight — like we’ve just experienced — or neither side will want another fight with the midterm elections fast approaching. So they’ll just extend everything once again, leaving sequester cuts in place, and the voters will decide what they want come November."

State Sen. Karen Carter Peterson, who is also chairwoman of the state Democratic Party, repeatedly invoked race as she railed against ObamaCare critics.

""I have talked to so many members both in the House and the Senate, and you know what? You ready? You ready? What it comes down to? It's not about how many federal dollars we can receive, it's not about that. You ready? It's about race,"" she said. ""I know nobody wants to talk about that. It's about the race of this African-American president.

She tried to argue that because former House Speaker Newt Gingrich -- who is white -- offered a ""similar"" overhaul in the past, the criticism this time ""comes down to the race of the president of the United States which causes people to disconnect and step away from the substance of the bill.""

The Republican Party of Louisiana is calling on Peterson to apologize for the comments.

""Bottom line is it's wrong to call someone a racist just because they disagree with you. There are a plethora of reasons why we disagree with ObamaCare ... and the race of the president or of anyone else has absolutely nothing to do with it,"" Ryan Cross, communications director for the state GOP, told FoxNews.com. ""It's appalling and it has no place on the floor.""

Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican, also told local affiliate WBRZ that it's ""wrong to call people racists"" simply over opposition to the health law.

Peterson released a statement Thursday afternoon clarifying her remarks while also defending them.

""I think we should judge a policy by its content, not the person proposing it,"" her statement said.

""To be clear, I didn't call any person 'racist.' Rather, I was simply relaying the truth about conversations I've had with my colleagues and the factors they considered on the expansion of Medicaid.

""While others are using this as an opportunity to take my comments out of context in order to distract from the true issue, I think it's critical that we focus on the substance of the policy because it's the right thing to do for Louisiana.""

President Obama and the Democrats have had, let’s face it, a bumpy few months. The debut of the Affordable Care Act was not quite the hair-pulling, garment-rending, world-historical disaster that some critics claim, but it was — and remains — messy enough to buff the shine on the GOP’s badly tarnished brand.

A CNN poll released Thursday found that 49 percent of those surveyed said they would prefer to be represented by a Republican in Congress, while 44 percent favored a Democrat. That’s not much of a margin, but it’s a big change from two months ago when 50 percent preferred a Democrat and just 42 percent preferred a Republican.

Such generic polls are of limited use in predicting what will happen in November. But the numbers do suggest that the GOP is back in the game. Voters appear willing to listen to what the party has to say.

If only the GOP had a message.

There is one proposition on which the party’s warring factions agree: “We don’t like Obama’s Affordable Care Act.” But there is a lack of consensus, to put it mildly, on how this visceral dislike of a president and his signature policy initiative should translate into concrete political action.

For Republicans — to invert a classic George W. Bush bon mot — Obamacare has somehow become a divider, not a uniter. In a year when the GOP may have a legitimate chance of capturing the Senate, several primary contests appear likely to devolve into bloody battles over Obama’s health-care reforms — not whether to oppose them, but how.

In Georgia, for example, one of the leading candidates to replace retiring Sen. Saxby Chambliss is Rep. Jack Kingston. He has voted repeatedly — and fruitlessly — with his House Republican colleagues to defund the Affordable Care Act. But when he suggested recently that to “just step back and let this thing fall to pieces on its own” was not “the responsible thing to do,” opponents quickly attacked Kingston as some kind of quisling who was waving a flag of surrender.

In fact, Kingston was simply acknowledging reality. Obamacare is the law. Memories of the program’s incompetent launch will fade. Republicans are going to have to decide whether to collaborate in making the Affordable Care Act work better — or risk being seen as working against the nation’s best interests.

On a range of issues, this is the party’s essential dilemma. Ideologues want to continue the practice of massive, uncompromising resistance to anything Obama tries to accomplish. Pragmatists want the GOP to demonstrate that it can be reasonable and trustworthy, on the theory that voters want their government to function well and won’t put a bunch of anti-government extremists in charge of running it.

Keep in mind that despite the findings of that CNN poll, other surveys show the GOP still has a ton of work to do. A recent Wall Street Journal poll reported that 48 percent of respondents had “negative feelings” toward the Republican Party, as opposed to 39 percent who felt negatively toward the Democratic Party.

Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), took a giant step for pragmatism by negotiating a budget deal with Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) — and the ideological wing of the party freaked out. House Speaker John Boehner, as rock-ribbed a Main Street conservative as you’ll ever meet, is routinely attacked on far-right Web sites as some kind of squishy moderate.

The question of how the GOP should proceed really should be a no-brainer. But after cynically taking advantage of the huge jolt of energy provided by tea party activists, the Republican establishment is finding that these true believers don’t necessarily listen when they’re told to go sit in a corner and shut up.

The no-compromises GOP base is fertile fundraising territory for potential presidential candidates, such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, and for pressure groups such as Heritage Action and the Club for Growth. So these provocateurs can be counted on to keep far-right anger and resentment at a rolling boil — and resist the establishment’s attempt to lower the temperature.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is expected to spend up to $50 million to ensure that the Republican Party chooses no extremist “loser candidates” for Senate races. As Scott Reed, the chamber’s chief political strategist, told the Wall Street Journal: “That will be our mantra: No fools on our ticket.”

Back in July, Five Thirty Eight’s election guru Nate Silver believed that control of the Senate was a tossup. That has all changed now that voters got their first real look at the brutal consequences of ObamaCare.

Starting with the generic ballot that simply pits Republican lawmakers against their Democrat counterparts, the movement towards the GOP has been striking. In the Real Clear Politics average of these polls, going back as far as the beginning of the year, Democrats have consistently led by 3 to 4 points. During the government shutdown, Democrats leaped to 6 and 7 point leads. Since the disastrous rollout of ObamaCare, though, Republicans are not only in the lead by 2.5 points; they have led in every poll but one since November 10.

This generic polling is reflected in the available polling of individual Senate seats.

Keep in mind that in order to win control of the Senate, Republicans need only pick up six seats, and with Democrat incumbents retiring in the redder than red states of South Dakota, West Virginia, and Montana, Republicans pretty much have three Senate pick-ups in the bag. But thanks to ObamaCare and vulnerable Democrat Senators refusing to put their own promises and the wellbeing of their constituents above slavish devotion to Obama, picking off another three should be fairly easy.

Kay Hagan (D-NC)

In North Carolina, Democrat Kay Hagan looked as though she was cruising to a second term victory. Just a few months ago, polls showed her ahead by double digits against her most likely Republican challengers.

In September, before ObamaCare started cancelling people’s policies by the millions and boosting the price of their premiums, Hagan was beating potential challenger Greg Bannon by a whopping 16 points. In the most recent poll taken just a couple weeks ago, Bannon picked up an astonishing 17 points and is now ahead by 1.

All of Hagan’s most likely Republican challengers made similar gains.

There is a YouTube video of Hagan promising that under ObamaCare you can keep your insurance if you like it. Obviously that is not true, which means she either lied or blindly voted for something without understanding the consequences for her constituents.

Mary Landrieu (D-LA)

Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu has seen her approval rating collapse by double digits in just six months. Three months ago, Landrieu looked as though she would coast to a fourth term in a state Mitt Romney won without breaking a sweat. The National Journal now lists Landrieu as the third most endangered incumbent facing re-election in 2014.

In August, Landrieu was polling over 50% in potential match ups (which would avoid a Louisiana runoff that requires the eventual winner hit at least 50%) and beating Republican Congressman Bill Cassidy, her most likely opponent, by a full 10 points. The consequences of ObamaCare have completely flipped that script.

A recent poll shows the relatively unknown Cassidy behind by only 2 points

There is YouTube video of Landrieu promising her constituents that under ObamaCare, you can keep your insurance. The facts have either proved Landrieu a liar or incompetent. Other than token legislation to keep that promise, Landrieu has been as devoted to Obama and ObamaCare as any liberal Democrat.

Mark Pryor (D-AR)

Thanks to ObamaCare, Senator Mark Pryor’s approval ratings in Arkansas have collapsed to just 33%, the lowest of his 12 years in the Senate. When Democrat Arkansas incumbent Senator Blanche Lincoln lost her seat in 2010, her approval ratings were actually higher. The National Journal ranks Pryor as the most vulnerable Senate incumbent facing reelection in 2014.

Pryor is also on record misleading his constituents about ObamaCare.

Mark Begich (D-AK)

Just before the disastrous ObamaCare rollout, Alaskan Senator Mark Begich was cruising to reelection by as much as 11 points. Post-ObamaCare polls show that Begich has been considerably weakened and is ahead by only a point or two against his likely Republican challengers. Moreover, Begich’s approval rating among Alaskans now sits at a measly 39%.

Begich is on record misleading his constituents with false assurances that under ObamaCare you can keep your insurance. The GOP is already pounding him over that.

Other than token proposals, Begich has done absolutely nothing to either keep that promise or to mitigate the damage ObamaCare is doing to Alaskans.

The National Journal lists Begich as the second most vulnerable incumbent in the Senate.

Iowa – Open Democrat Seat

With longtime Democrat Tom Harkin retiring from the Senate, Democrats thought they had made this seat safe with the recruitment of Rep. Bruce Braley. Until the American people were rattled by the consequences of ObamaCare, Democrats were probably right. In matchup after matchup, Braley was ahead by double digits.

Post-ObamaCare, that lead has shrunk to single digits.

Mark Udall (D-CO)

Prior to the ObamaCare rollout, Udall wasn’t even on the National Journal‘s list of endangered incumbents. Millions of insurance cancellations later, however, and the Democrat has a real fight on his hands. In one likely match up, Udall’s 15 point lead back in June has dropped to just 3 points.

—

Since the ObamaCare fallout, the National Journal has added Al Franken (D-MN), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) to its 2014 endangered list. Prior to the country being hit upside the head with the reality of ObamaCare, the idea that any one of these incumbents had anything to worry about was unthinkable.

Shaheen is vulnerable enough that former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown is considering a challenge. Polls show her under 50% at 48% and Brown only behind by 4%. He hasn’t even made it official and is already within the margin of error. And if he runs, it will be on the issue of ObamaCare.

Many believe that the worst of ObamaCare has yet to show itself. As the 2014 midterm elections loom closer late next year, so will the employer mandate. The Obama Administration itself has predicted that the fallout from the employer mandate could be tens of millions of cancellations.

Knowing this is coming, and unless something changes, these vulnerable Democrats are likely to be remembered only as having done nothing to avoid catastrophes mainly afflicting the working and middle class.

That is, other than hold hands with Obama to watch it all burn.

http://news.yahoo.com/bill-clinton-throws-obama-under-hillary-2016-bus-180900047.html,,[],Bill Clinton Throws Obama Under the 'Hillary 2016' Bus,"Former president Bill Clinton told an interviewer that he thought President Obama should ""honor the commitment the federal government made"" and let people keep insurance policies they have. Obama's one-time ""Secretary of Explainin' Stuff"" doesn't seem to understand the math problem that presents. Or, more likely, the time has come for Team Clinton to put 2016 ahead of its tenuous loyalty to the sitting president.

The interview, given to Ozy.com (which appears to be a news site for millenials), focused on Clinton's reaction to the rollout of Obamacare. Clinton outlined four ways in which the process could have been improved. The last is the one that's generated the most attention.

Clinton tells the story of a young person he met who'd been forced to switch his insurance plan. The new plan cost more, he told Clinton, but the co-pays and deductibles are much lower. (The relevant segment of the video starts at 3:15.)

RELATED: Which Soft-Focus People Magazine Political Photo Style Will Ted Cruz Get?

""So he said, 'In the years I use healthcare, I might actually save money.' But he said, 'You know, we're all young and we're all healthy.' So, I personally believe, even if it takes a change in the law, the president should honor the commitment the federal government made to those people and let them keep what they've got.""

President Obama's repeated claims on the campaign trail that Americans could keep their existing health insurance policies has been one of the most strident attacks from Republicans, prompting a (sort of) apology from Obama and a subtle tweak to how the administration talks about the Affordable Care Act. The problem, as the administration has known for at least three years, is that the mandates in the ACA require higher levels of coverage than most Americans choose for themselves. The person with whom Clinton spoke paid less per month because his coverage was much worse. Since one of the goals of Obamacare was to prevent people from suffering economic catastrophe in the event of a serious health problem, many policies that had very high deductibles were rendered invalid.

Story continues

But this young person with whom Clinton spoke represents another important aspect to the ACA: getting ""young"" and ""healthy"" people to contribute more to the pool. From the outset, Obama has focused on the need to get young people signed up primarily because those premiums would help keep costs down for everyone else. Insurers can keep premiums lower across the board and expand coverage if more people who are less likely to get sick are giving monthly checks. The young person that spoke with Clinton is key to making Obamacare work.

RELATED: Bill Clinton May or May Not Have Called Obama an 'Amateur'

So there are three possibilities for why Clinton said what he did.

Possibility 1: Clinton doesn't understand the economics of Obamacare.

There's no reason to think that this is the case. Clinton's star moment in the 2012 race was in his informal role as ""Explainin' Secretary"" at the Democratic convention, when he gave a stemwinder explaining how most of the American economy and, in particular, the ACA was put together. If Clinton doesn't understand the economics above, then he's forgotten a lot in the past year.

Possibility 2: Clinton is going off the reservation.

During the heated 2008 Democratic primaries, Clinton risked doing serious damage to his reputation by dismissing Obama's South Carolina win. It was a very unhelpful moment for the Hillary team, prompting accusations that Clinton was trying to race-bait voters to his wife's benefit. As a Hillary aide told the authors of Game Change, ""It would take 10 Freudians to explain what Bill Clinton did to Hillary in South Carolina.""

RELATED: The Clintons and the Obamas, Together Forever

It doesn't seem to have been that at all. Instead, it was Bill Clinton explainin' stuff, a tendency known in other contexts as ""mansplaining."" Bill Clinton is a proud advocate of mansplaining. He's a smart guy that once ran the United States. He has opinions on things, and can, at times, be indiscreet in how those opinions are shared. This Ozy.com interview could have been exactly that.

Possibility 3: Clinton was trying to distance his wife from an unpopular policy.

Clinton knows better than most how broken promises can tank political careers. In 1992, he defeated George H. W. Bush after the sitting president violated his ""read my lips; no new taxes"" pledge. Everything that happens between now and 2016 will be fodder for Hillary's opponents, so there's political value in distancing her from any perceived misrepresentations by Obama. Clinton won't be running on Obama's record, but it's safe to assume that Obamacare will come up. Clinton just offered Hillary a little cover on a possibly problematic topic.

RELATED: 'Gay Pants' Dominates Morning Joe Discussion on Obamacare

In other words: Maybe Clinton said what he did because he wants to help his wife's presidential bid. Of the three possibilities, this is obviously the most likely. Perhaps Obama should have tried harder to get Clinton to stick around for a second term as Secretary of State.

The interview video above concludes with Clinton making a joke. ""You know, politics is the only profession,"" he told the interviewer, ""where people are surprised if you know anything."" Perhaps because people expect political considerations to trump a strightforward answer.

USA TODAY

Both parties are likely to focus on health care in competitive Florida district

Long-serving GOP Rep. Bill Young died in November%3B election to replace him is in March

Health care ads have begun%2C even before GOP candidate has been chosen

WASHINGTON — A special election for a vacant House seat in Florida is shaping up as an early bellwether race that may indicate how President Obama's health care law is going to affect the 2014 elections.

The death in November of Rep. C.W. ""Bill"" Young, R-Fla., opened up his St. Petersburg-based seat in a district where he would probably have been safely re-elected. The race to replace him is drawing national interest as a test battle for the party's warring messages over the Affordable Care Act.

Obama won 50% in the swing district in 2012 and 51% in 2008, placing the seat squarely in the tossup category where either party stands a chance to win. David Wasserman, a non-partisan elections analyst for The Cook Political Report, said the seat is close to a ""dead even district"" in terms of competitiveness, but he gives a narrow edge to Democrats because they have lined up behind a well-known candidate, while Republicans face a primary of relative unknowns.

Republicans hope unease with the health care law and its troubled rollout will help them not only win the Young seat but maintain their majority in the House. Democrats defend the 2010 law as an imperfect but fixable benefit that will aid millions of Americans — and the party's uphill effort to win the majority.

Democrats cleared the field for Alex Sink, an unsuccessful 2010 candidate for governor and a former chief financial officer for Florida.

Sink supports the health care law, and Democrats say she is trusted by the district's voters — she won the district in her 2010 gubernatorial bid — to make it work. Sink is a candidate who has ""spent her entire career solving problems and demanding results,"" said Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y., who runs the House Democrats' campaign operation. ""While Republicans will continue to push a damaging agenda of showdowns, shutdowns and repeals, Alex will offer a common-sense, problem-solving approach that brings people together.""

Republicans — including Young's widow, Beverly — lined up early behind David Jolly, an attorney, lobbyist and former Young aide, but he faces a three-way primary Jan. 14 against state Rep. Kathleen Peters and retired Marine Mark Bircher. Whoever wins will make health care a key issue.

""(Sink) was an early and strong advocate for the president's health care law,"" Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., who runs the House GOP's campaign operation, said at a recent roundtable. ""She's going to be an owner of Obamacare.""

Even before the GOP candidate is chosen, the National Republican Congressional Committee kicked off its campaign against Sink last week with a Web ad criticizing her support of the law. ""Why would Alex Sink support a law that makes it harder for us in Florida to have health care?"" the ad says.

The district is heavily populated by senior citizens — more than a quarter are over 65 — so the Affordable Care Act does not affect many constituents directly because they are covered by Medicare. But seniors are particularly attuned to debates on the government's role in health care coverage. ""That adds to the prominence of health care in the race,"" Wasserman said.

The Cook Political Report warned recently that the ACA's affect on the Medicare Advantage program, which provides health insurance to millions of seniors and could face cuts in 2014 because of the new law, could add to the health care debate.

Florida also ranks as a state with one of the highest levels of uninsured Americans in the nation, so more people stand to benefit from the new law as well.

The timing of the election — three weeks before the March 31 deadline to sign up for coverage — further ensures that health care is going to be a central issue, and the outcome will be an indicator of the health care law's influence on the 2014 midterms.

After seven months of steady decline, public approval of Obama’s job performance has ticked upward, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. The poll finds 45% of Americans approve of Obama’s work and 49% disapprove.

That’s the highest approval and closest margin since mid-summer, when the president’s ratings first turned negative. Obama’s low point came last month as the administration struggled to fix the HealthCare.gov website and placate Americans who had discovered, contrary to his promise, that their insurance policies were being canceled.

The problems of the last year – including the stalemate or defeat of major legislation on gun control and immigration, the standoff over the budget and the bungled rollout of the Affordable Care Act – have all taken a toll on how the public sees Obama. The percentage of those who say he is “not able to get things done” has risen steadily from a little more than one-third in the spring to just over half in the latest survey, which was conducted Tuesday through Sunday for USA Today.

But several factors continue to buoy the president, most notably the deep unpopularity of his opponents.

Only 21% of those surveyed said they approve of the job Republican leaders in Congress are doing, with 72% disapproving. Those numbers are essentially unchanged from the low point the GOP hit during the government shutdown in October.

Feelings about the Republican Party as a whole are also negative, with 35% having a favorable view and 59% an unfavorable one.

By contrast, the public divides almost evenly on the Democratic Party, 47% to 48%. Their view of congressional Democratic leaders is better than their view of the GOP, but still worse than their feelings about the president – 34% approve and 58% disapprove.

Americans divide sharply when asked if they have confidence in Obama on healthcare policy, with 50% saying they have a “great deal” or “some” confidence and 48% saying they have “little” or none. But their view of the GOP on that issue is much more one-sided, with only 32% expressing even “some” confidence and 66% having little or none.

Obama also can continue to draw on positive feelings the public has about him. His ratings on several key attributes, although lower than they have been during much of his presidency, remain positive. For example, just over half of Americans view Obama as “trustworthy,” down from roughly 6 in 10 during most of his presidency. That’s the lowest rating of Obama’s presidency, but still positive.

Similarly, 58% say Obama “cares about people like me” – a number that is down just slightly from the level he has seen during most of his tenure.

More than 3 out of 4 say he “stands up for what he believes in.”

In addition to doubting his ability to get things done, however, the public divides evenly on Obama’s leadership skills. Half of Americans see him as a strong leader, compared with 48% who do not.

As has consistently been true since the healthcare law passed, a majority of Americans disapprove of it, with just over half in the current survey disapproving of Obamacare. But those numbers are no worse than they were in September, before the law’s problem-plagued introduction.

And the percentage who say that elected officials who oppose the law should do what they can to make it fail, rather than try to fix it, has gone down. Just 1 in 5 Americans takes that view. Among self-identified Republicans, however, 40% say elected officials should try to make the law fail. And among Republicans who identify with the tea party, 60% want lawmakers to do what they can to make the law fail.

Among self-identified Democrats and independents, majorities either approve of the law or want lawmakers to find ways to make it work as well as possible.

Asked to assess several reasons that might have played a role in the healthcare law’s problems, a majority of Americans said each one had played a major role: poor management by the administration, flaws in the law, the complexity of the health insurance system and opposition from politicians who tried to undermine it.

Democrats and Republicans both cited the complexity of the health insurance system as a reason for the law’s problems. But a predictable partisan divide surfaced on the three other reasons, with nearly three-quarters of self-identified Democrats citing sabotage by opposition lawmakers as a major reason, while 8 in 10 Republicans cited mismanagement and flaws in the law.

The percentage of people who say the law has had a negative effect on the country has gone up, but the percentage who expect it to continue to be a negative in the future has declined. Americans are now closely divided on their expectations of the law’s future impact, with 39% saying they expect it will be mostly positive and 45% expecting mostly negative.

The slow but steady improvement of the economy may have helped Obama. The percentage of Americans rating their personal financial situation as “poor” -- 19% -- is the lowest since before the economic crash in 2008. One in 4 says his or her personal conditions are “fair” or “good.”

Just under half of Americans say they have a “great deal” or a “fair amount” of confidence that Obama will “do the right thing” on the economy. By contrast, just over one-third feel that way about Republican leaders in Congress.

Americans divide almost evenly on the question of whether Obama’s presidency so far has been a success (46%) or a failure (48%). That number closely mirrors the ratings that President George W. Bush received at roughly this point in his presidency. In Bush’s case, the public’s view of his presidency continued to sour throughout his second term. Whether Obama can steady his presidency at its current level or rebound remains to be seen.

The survey was based on telephone interviews with 2,001 American adults. The margin of error for the full sample is plus or minus 2.6 percentage points.

Then with a single speech delivered as President Obama looked stonily on, he was lofted into the conservative firmament as its newest star: a renowned neurosurgeon who is black and has the credibility to attack the president on health care.

In his speech at the National Prayer Breakfast last month, Dr. Carson criticized the health care overhaul and higher taxes on the rich, while warning that “the P.C. police are out in force at all times.”

Overnight, he was embraced by conservatives including those at The Wall Street Journal editorial page, which proclaimed, “Ben Carson for President” — a suggestion Dr. Carson helped feed at a high-profile gathering last weekend, the Conservative Political Action Conference. He was interrupted by sustained cheers when he coyly said, “Let’s just say if you magically put me in the White House...”

In an interview in his office at Johns Hopkins University, he said he had been told for years that he could have a political career. It would be built on his compelling personal story that began in poverty in Detroit, leading to fame through pioneering work separating conjoined twins and his own self-help and inspirational books, including “America the Beautiful: Rediscovering What Made This Nation Great.”"
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/08/31/gop-activists-cheered-by-state-successes/,2013-08-31 00:00:00,[],GOP activists cheered by state successes,"Republican activists are taking solace in success stories by governors and legislatures in GOP-leaning states as their party tries to regroup after the disappointments of a bruising presidential contest and a stalled agenda in Washington.

Here's what fired up Washington-weary GOP stalwarts at a weekend conference of conservatives in this perennial swing state: pension overhauls in Wisconsin, tax cuts in Indiana and labor losses in Michigan.

Some of the biggest applause was reserved for governors who did not attend the event. The mere mention of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a tea-party favorite who won national attention for his battles with organized labor, prompted thunderous cheers. That was despite a speaking card full of potential presidential hopefuls, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.

Several GOP contenders, including Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, used their appearances at the Americans for Prosperity summit to position themselves as Washington outsiders. While that strategy is hardly new, the appeals play to a Republican base starved for the kind of victories that gridlocked Washington has been unable to deliver.

""All roads lead back to the states,"" Perry said, as more than 1,000 activists roared their approval Friday. ""I don't think the American people want to look to Washington, D.C. to solve the problems of the day. Washington D.C. is creating the problems of the day.""

That set up an interesting dynamic, as Rubio was heckled for his support of immigration reform, his signature legislative issue. Attendees repeatedly interrupted him with cries of ""No amnesty!""

The anti-Washington mood is likely to harden this fall as Congress faces deadlines to pass a budget or face a government shutdown. This week, Republicans negotiating with the White House said there was ""no common ground"" with the Obama administration, which wants to couple spending cuts with tax increases.

Both sides are bracing for a confrontation.

Immigration overhaul legislation is also in limbo after the Democratic-led Senate passed a far-reaching bill that includes a path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants already in the country illegally. A majority of House Republicans remain opposed to such a provision, creating a potentially unbridgeable divide.

""It's not working from the top down, obviously,"" said Andre Adamski, a 47-year-old engineer from Lawrenceville, Ga.

On Friday, he was headed to a workshop on local tax overhauls while his wife, Mary, was primed for a social media boot camp. Self-described tea party activists who volunteered for Mitt Romney's campaign, both said they were refocusing their efforts on state politics.

The conference hall was filled with patriotic garb and anti-Obama memorabilia, including a book entitled ""The Ultimate Obama Survival Guide."" Some attendees said they were slowly returning to politics after the sting of last year's presidential loss.

""I didn't turn a TV on for months,"" said Greg Gormley, a 49-year-old sales director from Charleston, S.C. ""This is my way to man up and see what I can do, whatever that is.""

The weekend conference, sponsored by Americans for Prosperity, was aimed in part at motivating the advocacy group's foot soldiers at a growing number of state affiliates, which have played prominent roles in tax, education and gun-control debates across the country. Backed by the billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, the group spent $190 million on conservative causes in the past election cycle.

""I know things are difficult in D.C.,"" Tim Phillips, the group's president, told activists. ""It can get frustrating, you can get down and depressed sometimes. But I tell you, do what we do -- get the heck out of Washington and get out to states.""

Indeed, much of the summit's panels focused on grassroots organizing and local action.

At a session on President Barack Obama's health care law, panelists dismissed Washington-led efforts by Rubio and others to defund ""Obamacare,"" and instead urged activists to fight at the state level to oppose one of the law's key provisions: expanding Medicaid, the federal and state program for poor people.

""The Medicaid fight is where we can make a difference,"" said Avik Roy, of the conservative Manhattan Institute.

Nearly half the states have opted out of the expansion, and organizers urged activists to keep pressure on GOP leaders, including Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who was elected in 2010 with tea party support but now favors expanding Medicaid.

When speakers addressed Washington they used it as symbol of government run amok. Rubio won a standing ovation for his pledge to vote against a budget that includes funding for the federal health care law. ""Big government is doing what it has always done: It is failing,"" he said to cheers.

Jindal said he was ""angry this government is using its power -- the IRS, the NSA, the Department of Justice -- to go after innocent, law abiding Americans."" He brought the crowd to its feet with the declaration that ""there is a rebellion brewing in these states.""

The rout was complete, the retreat disorderly. President Obama got his tax hikes -- naked of spending cuts -- passed by the ostensibly Republican House of Representatives. After which, you might expect him to pivot to his self-proclaimed ""principle"" of fiscal ""balance"" by taking the lead on reducing spending. ""Why,"" asked The Washington Post on the eve of the final ""fiscal-cliff"" agreement, ""is the nation's leader not embracing and then explaining the balanced reforms the nation needs?""

Because he has no interest in them. He's a visionary, not an accountant. Sure, he'll pretend to care about deficits, especially while running for re-election. But now that he's past the post, he's free to be himself -- a committed big-government social-democrat.

As he showed in his two speeches this week. After perfunctory nods to debt and spending reduction, he waxed enthusiastic about continued ""investments"" -- i.e. spending -- on education, research, roads and bridges, green energy, etc.

[pullquote]

Having promised more government, he then promised more taxes -- on ""millionaires"" and ""companies with a lot of lobbyists,"" of course. It was a bold affirmation of pre-Clintonian tax-and-spend liberalism.

Why not? He had just won Round 1: raising rates. Round 2 is to raise yet more tax revenues by eliminating deductions. After all, didn't John Boehner offer him $800 billion of such loophole-closing revenues just a few weeks ago?

To paraphrase Churchill on the British Empire, Barack Obama did not become president of the United States to preside over the liquidation of the welfare state. On the contrary, he is dedicated to its expansion. He's already created the largest new entitlement in half a century (ObamaCare).

And he has increased federal spending to an astronomical 24.4 percent of GDP (the postwar norm is about 20 percent), a level not seen since World War II.

But this level of spending requires a significantly higher level of taxation. Hence his hardball fiscal-cliff strategy of issuing an ultimatum to Republicans to raise tax rates -- or be blamed for a massive across-the-board tax increase and a subsequent recession.

I'll get you the money by eliminating deductions, offered Boehner. No, sir, replied the president. Rates it must be.

Why the insistence?

(1) Partisan Advantage

As I wrote last month, the ultimatum was designed to exploit and exacerbate internal Republican divisions. It worked perfectly. Boehner's attempted finesse (Plan B), which would have raised rates but only for those making more than $1 million, collapsed amid an open rebellion from a good quarter of the Republican caucus.

At which point, power passed from the House to the Senate, where a deal was brokered. By the time the Senate bill reached the House, there was no time or room for maneuver. Checkmate. Obama neutralized the one body that had stymied him during the last two years.

(2) Ideological Breakthrough

Obama's ultimate ambition is to break the nation's 30-year thrall of low taxes -- so powerful that those who defied the Reaganite norm paid heavily for it. Walter Mondale's acceptance speech at the 1984 convention promising to raise taxes ended his campaign before it began. President George H.W. Bush's no-new-taxes reversal cost him a second term.

On this, too, Obama is succeeding. He not only got his tax increase passed. He did it with public opinion behind him.

Why are higher taxes so important to him?

First, as a means: A high-tax economy is liberalism's only hope for sustaining and enlarging the entitlement state. It provides the funds for enlightened adventures in everything from algae to Obamacare.

Second, as an end in itself. Fundamentally, Obama is a leveler. The community organizer seeks, above all, to reverse the growing inequality that he dates and attributes to ruthless Reaganism. Now, however, clothed in the immense powers of the presidency, he can actually engage in unadorned redistributionism. As in Tuesday night's $620 billion wealth transfer.

Upon losing the House in 2010, the leveler took cover for the next two years. He wasn't going to advance his real agenda through the Republican House anyway, and he needed to win re-election.

Now he's won. The old Obama is back. He must not be underestimated. He has deftly leveraged his class-war-themed election victory (a) to secure a source of funding (albeit still small) for the bloated welfare state, (b) to carry out an admirably candid bit of income redistribution and (c) to fracture the one remaining institutional obstacle to the rest of his ideological agenda.

Not bad for two months' work."

The President has hit record disapproval rating (56% among RVs, 55% among adults) and his Affordable Care Act is tanking in the public’s opinion.

Not only does the public disapprove of Obama’s job performance, more than half do not like him. Fifty-two percent say they have an unfavorable image of the President. To drive that home, the three metrics used to measure Obama’s “leadership and empathy” are all in the red.

Half or more now say he is not a strong leader, does not understand the problems of “people like you,” and is not honest and trustworthy. Perceptions of the president as a strong leader have dropped 15 points since January, and over the past year the percentage of registered voters who say he is not honest and trustworthy has increased 12 points.

These ratings carry over to opinions on Obamacare. Fifty-six percent say Obama is not a good manager and this is evident when looking at opinions about his health care program specifically. Almost two-thirds (63%) disapprove of of the program’s roll out and 57% straight up oppose the Affordable Healthcare Act, a 10% jump up from last month. The lynchpin of Obama’s program, the mandate to purchase insurance also performs quite poorly with two thirds (65%) opposing it.

Polls are considered a snapshot in time, so there is no telling if America’s sour outlook on Obama and Obamacare will stick. Obama has promised to “re-brand” his health care program and it remains to be seen if the country will give him a second chance. Certainly the unintended consequences or rather, the particulars of the law which were concealed from the public, are not popular and indicate that if the public had “read the law before they passed it” it might not have ever been approved."

Several tea party-powered senators have laid down a gauntlet of late, saying the GOP should refuse to pass a bill to fund the government in September unless all funding for the implementation of the health care reform law is cut.

It's a message -- championed by Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah), Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) -- that appeals to the enthusiasms of a population that united against Obamacare under the banner of Taxed Enough Already in 2009, a year in which federal taxes actually hit historic lows.

Cruz has argued that united Republicans could force President Barack Obama and the Democratic-controlled Senate to accept a government-funding measure that essentially ends Obama's marquee achievement, the Affordable Care Act.

""I believe that if Republicans stand together, this is a fight we can win,"" Cruz told reporters last week. ""It represents our best opportunity to actually defund Obamacare, and potentially our last good opportunity to do so,"" he said, arguing that although his side doesn't have the votes now, that can change over the August break.

But more senior members of the GOP caucus -- most prominently Sens. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.) -- have said they see the idea as ill-conceived and unreasonable. In an unexpected twist, the veteran lawmakers who are not exactly known for being voices of moderation are appealing for a more deliberate approach. They worry that most of the nation simply is not ready to shutter the government just to hamstring Obamacare. And in interviews as Congress was getting ready to ready to adjourn until September, McCain, Coburn and other Republican leaders said that while they believe the health care law will be the train wreck the GOP is forecasting, following the path of Cruz, Lee and Rubio could produce a more immediate derailment -- of the GOP's electoral chances in 2014.

""I'm not sure why we should advocate for something that's absolutely impossible. The only way Obamacare is going to be repealed is with a 60-vote Republican Senate, and then, in order to override a presidential veto, I think it's 67 votes,"" McCain said. ""I haven't seen an attempt to override a veto in a long time. It's a non-starter.""

And a political land mine, he added.

""Those of us who have been around for a while know what happens when there's the threat of a shutdown of the government: It's the Congress that gets blamed,"" McCain said. ""If the minority uses its strength, its 41 votes [to filibuster government funding], then clearly the American people will blame the Congress. And they do -- that's the history. And those who say that's not the case ignore the lessons of history and the realities of American politics.""

One of those who remembers the history is Coburn, who was first elected as a member of the House in the Republican revolution of 1994 -- before the last time the GOP shut down the government under then-Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) in 1995 and 1996.

Coburn suggested that even then, when Republicans were more unified around the idea of a shutdown, they were not really all that committed to it -- making their efforts doomed to fail.

""Here's what I know. I saw the lack of us holding what we said was our strategy, and ultimately losing 9 seats in the House when we should have won 22, and being less effective in the long-run because we didn't hold onto our strategy,"" Coburn told The Huffington Post.

""The difference is you had the vast majority of Republicans wanting to do that. You don't have the vast majority of Republicans wanting to do that now. So if you could do it, you'd hold for even less time. So what you'd do is say, 'Yes, the government's shut down.' And the first time the pressure gets up with people not really sold on the strategy, they'll bail on you,"" he said.

""The only way that strategy works is if you're going to take the hostage and shoot it. Which means you're never going to open the government back up until Obama says uncle,"" Coburn said, arguing that there's no way a filibuster-strong 40 members of the GOP caucus would be willing to halt Social Security checks, mail delivery, passport services, construction work and the myriad other things constituents expect from the government in hopes of making Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) blink. ""What is the likelihood of that? And what is the probability that members of the Senate will hold on that? It's about zero.""

GOP strategists who lived through the Gingrich debacle are also keenly aware of the downsides.

""Shutting down the government never works at the end of the day,"" said longtime GOP consultant Ed Rollins, who rose to prominence under Ronald Reagan and most recently served a brief stint running Rep. Michele Bachmann's (R-Minn.) 2012 presidential campaign. ""Even though we shut it down last time, it helped the president [Bill Clinton] win reelection.""

Another strategist, former National Republican Senatorial Committee communications director Brian Walsh, said he found the tea party senators' push especially ill-timed because the GOP, he feels, is already scoring significant points by spotlighting and magnifying every new problem with the rollout of the health care law.

Having the tea party heroes launch a holy war against fellow Republicans over their alleged insufficient purity on Obamacare is just about as welcome as a bruising primary challenge, Walsh said.

""The frustrating part is politically we are on offense,"" Walsh said. ""You're seeing stories in a lot places about companies pulling out of the [Obamacare] markets, and small businesses cutting workers' hours. You're seeing all these stories about problems with the Obamacare implementation … So it's a little frustrating that instead of that being the focus, instead of keeping the Democrats on defense, there's a section of the party that would rather engage in fratricide.""

Walsh is an especially acute observer in this case because it was during his stint at the NRSC that Republicans failed to retake the Senate, largely thanks to stumbles from tea party candidates such as Christine O'Donnell in Delaware in 2010 and Nevada's Sharron Angle that same year. Last year featured failures by Richard Mourdoch in Indiana and Todd Akin in Missouri. They all triumphed over more mainstream candidates in primaries, but alienated too many voters in the general elections, even in red states.

""Conservatively, the party gave away five seats in those years,"" Walsh said.

Coburn probably would not agree that anyone lost by being too conservative. He's proud of his own right-wing philosophy, and suggests that some of today's younger firebrands might not do as well holding on to core conservative values amid the compromises and temptations of Washington.

""We'll see after 10 years if they still have a 99 [American Conservative Union] rating,"" Coburn said.

What Coburn worries about is his newer colleagues making dumb promises.

""If your strategy is to hold government funding hostage to defund Obamacare, the [Congressional Research Service] says as you do that, guess what's going to happen? Funding for Obamacare is going to continue,"" Coburn said, referring to a report by the nonpartisan CRS that explained most of the funding for the health care law is mandatory and not subject to Congress' annual appropriations battles. ""So it tells you the problem with the strategy.""

And of course, there are the electoral consequences.

""The other thing that's dangerous in it, is that you create the expectation in our base that you can do something that is absolutely not achievable. It may be achievable for two weeks or three weeks, but if your ultimate goal is to defund it, and you have a president and a Senate controlled by Democrats, and a thin majority in the House, the strategy doesn't work,"" Coburn said.

""If you pump the base up and say here's something we can do when in fact you can't, but they believe you could have done it, and then you don't do it -- I think it keeps a lot of people at home, because they say, 'Gosh, the Republicans wouldn't stand again,'"" he said.

Nevertheless, Cruz and Co. have embarked on a drive -- including an online petition that's racked up more than 250,000 signers -- to promote their shutdown showdown all through August, hoping to galvanize the same sort of 2009 outpouring that handed the GOP control of the House of Representatives the next year, and to pressure their colleagues into standing with them.

""I for one, and I know my colleagues as well, are not prepared to go home and tell people, ‘Well, we tried, but we couldn’t,’"" Rubio said in announcing the push last week. ""We have to go home and say, 'We did everything we could. We took every step available to us.' And that's why this is such an important issue.""

But McCain noted that a letter they circulated before the break was actually losing support. Indeed, one of the senators listed as uncommitted in the online petition, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, echoed her more conservative colleagues in slamming the shutdown threat.

""Let's be realistic. Obamacare, a law that I strongly oppose, is not going to be repealed. So the effect of trying to repeal the funding of government inevitably leads to a government shutdown, which I do not believe is good policy or good politics,"" Collins said. ""The American people want common-sense solutions. They don't want us to pursue policies that are pointless, that are going to end in government shutting down, more partisanship, more gridlock. They want us to actually get things done.""

Walsh argued that the dissidents should take a page from the conservative playbook of four years ago. ""When you look at 2009, the tea party ire was focused appropriately on Obamacare, and now you see some of that focused on the Republican Party,"" Walsh said, adding that the government shutdown threat is taking the GOP ""off message.""

Particularly confounding to him was the fundamental irrationality in a push that casts some of the opponents of the Cruz-Lee-Rubio effort -- who also include Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) -- as not real conservatives.

""When you're suggesting that anyone like Tom Coburn is less than conservative, you better look in the mirror,"" Walsh said.

The older Republicans did not disparage the motives of their younger brethren, but at least three of them -- Cruz, Rubio, and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) -- have openly flirted with a 2016 GOP presidential bid, which could benefit from tea party support. And the inboxes of just about anyone paying attention to the conservative movement has seen the steady stream lately of praise for the effort from groups like the Tea Party Express, as well as fundraising appeals.

Still, political veterans thought the hotshots would be wise to cool it, at least a little.

""Ted Cruz hasn't even been here two years, and he's got a bright, long future in the party,"" said Rollins. ""But he should be a little patient. You need make sure that whatever your goal is, it's something you can achieve. And you can't achieve this.""

There’s always a chance. Because, you know, it’s new. Also, the bar is low, since some people believe the departing 112th Congress was the worst in history, because of its stupendous lack of productivity and a favorability rating that once polled lower than the idea of a Communist takeover of America.

On the very last day the Republican-led House of Representatives was in session, the Republican governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, announced it was “why the American people hate Congress.” This was after Speaker John Boehner failed to bring up a bill providing aid to the victims of the megastorm Sandy. Disaster relief joined a long list of bills that the 112th Congress could not get its act together to approve, along with reforming the farm subsidies and rescuing the Postal Service. Those particular pieces of legislation were all written and passed by the Senate, a group that’s generally less proactive than a mummy.

Ah, the House. To be fair, it takes a lot of effort to vote to repeal Obamacare 33 times.

Our outgoing lawmakers did retrieve us from that “fiscal cliff.” Although they were the ones who pushed us off in the first place. And they left the new Congress facing a debt chasm, a sequestration void and a government-stoppage bottomless pit."
http://news.yahoo.com/cruz-senate-wont-same-mistake-next-fight-191408114--politics.html,,[],Cruz: Senate won't make same mistake in next fight,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz said Saturday that the GOP lost the government shutdown budget battle because some congressional Republicans turned on others, but that he doesn't think they will make the same mistake during the next political impasse.

""I am hopeful that in the future the Senate will listen,"" Cruz, the tea party favorite and freshman senator from Texas, told a convention in Austin of the Texas Medical Association.

Cruz staged a more than 21-hour quasi-filibuster in the Senate late last month, helping spark a budget fight in the Republican-led House that partially shuttered the government in an attempt to sever funding for the nation's new health care law.

Then, with the country facing a debt default, leaders in the Democratic-led Senate brokered a deal to end the standoff — which Cruz dismissed as ""selling the American people down the river.""

""You don't win a fight when your own team is firing cannons at the people who are standing up and leading, which are the House Republicans,"" he said.

The deal sets up the potential for another budget showdown in January. Senate GOP leaders, however, have suggested that there won't be a repeat of the shutdown or a potential default crisis like in recent weeks.

But addressing reporters after his speech, Cruz would not say that another fight won't be coming.

""There will be plenty of time to consider the particular practical or strategic decisions,"" he said.

Asked if he was worried about retaliation from more-senior Republican leaders in the Senate, Cruz said, ""I try very hard not to worry about the politics and the internal back-and-forth in Washington.""

Many attendees gave Cruz a standing ovation at the end of his speech.

Some political observers now see Cruz as Texas' most popular Republican. But his approval ratings across the country may be slipping.

National polls have shown that while Americans in general don't love the health care law, they oppose defunding it — especially if it means shutting down the government. And many of Cruz's Senate colleagues have bemoaned the shutdown for tarnishing the GOP's image.

Cruz also took questions from the audience and was asked if ideology driving Washington could outweigh political pragmatism.

""The arguments I have laid out today have not been ideological,"" Cruz said. ""These were the essence of practical."""

Early voting is underway in Albuquerque for an election Tuesday, which will decide whether to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy.

Although similar bans have been passed by state legislatures, New Mexico’s largest city is believed to be the first municipality in the country to place such an initiative on a ballot.

The “Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Ordinance,” which needs a majority to pass, would have statewide impact because the only late-term abortion providers in the largely rural state are in Albuquerque.

Women living out of state also fly to Albuquerque for this type of care, said Micaela Cadena, policy director at Young Women United. The New Mexico-based group is part of the Respect ABQ Women campaign, which is fighting the local measure.

“Albuquerque voters are voting for the whole state of New Mexico and also for the rest of the country,” Cadena said.

The Supreme Court’s ruling in Roe vs. Wade has been interpreted by lower courts as making abortion legal through 24 weeks of pregnancy, but antiabortion activists are pushing to ban the procedure after 20 weeks — a step in chipping away at the 1973 landmark ruling.

Tara and Bud Shaver, who call themselves pro-life missionaries, moved to New Mexico three years ago from Kansas, a center of antiabortion activism, with the intent of mobilizing a campaign to shut down Southwestern Women’s Options — one of a handful of clinics in the country that provide late-term abortions.

There doesn’t seem to be a consensus on when a pregnancy is considered late-term, with definitions ranging from the 20th week of gestation to the 27th.

Tara Shaver said that although terminations after 20 weeks account for about 1.3% of all abortion procedures, banning them would be one step toward outlawing the practice entirely.

In Albuquerque, it’s hard to get away from any mention of the measure.

Campaign ads have taken over radio and television. Commuters drive down boulevards flanked with signs that read “Vote for Late Term Abortion Ban” or “Respect ABQ Women. Vote no Nov. 19.”

On a recent weekday morning at University of New Mexico, Shaver and her contingent of volunteers handed out leaflets to backpack-toting students hurrying to class.

At about the same time a “truth truck” — as the antiabortion group contingent calls it — maneuvered along a road cutting through campus. The truck carried its a billboard-sized picture of what looked to be a dismembered fetus.

“We’re going to show them the truth — what abortion really does,” Shaver said.

The night before, a group of abortion rights advocates gathered downtown. Bineshi Albert and her 17-year-old daughter, Dezbah Evans, munched on pizza before they took to the streets with their best pitch in opposition to the ban.

“As a Native American, I have some experience with the government telling us what to do with our land, our hair, our body, our language, our culture,” Albert said. “I can relate that experience to me as a woman, and I just don’t think the city government should have a say to regulate what happens to my body.”

To get the measure on the ballot, Operation Rescue and other antiabortion groups gathered 27,000 signatures — more than twice the number the city requires. If successful, the ordinance could be implemented days after city officials certify the election.

Councilman Dan Lewis, who describes himself as pro-life, said that if the measure passes and is challenged in court, the city will be obligated to defend it.

Councilwoman Trudy Jones, who has questioned the constitutionality of the measure, said abortion should not be a municipal issue. The special election will cost the city at least $500,000, and legal bills to defend it could triple that amount — a strain for a poor city, she said.

“We could feed a lot of babies for million and a half dollars,” she said.

Opponents of the measure, including state Atty. Gen. Gary King, have said they’re prepared to sue if the measure passes.

Dave Sidhu, a constitutional scholar at the University of New Mexico, pointed to recent court rulings throughout the nation that have struck down similar bans at the state level.

Just the next state over, Arizona officials have appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court after a 20-week limit on abortions was struck down by a federal court. Eleven other states have also adopted 20-week limits. Several of these bans have been blocked by courts while litigation is pending.

In addition to the advertising blitzes, the fight over the measure is playing out at front doors, in parking lots and on college campuses — anywhere proponents and opponents can make their pitch.

At the university, Shaver approached Rachel and Garrett Wolff and asked whether they had heard about the measure. Rachel Wolff, who is 18 weeks pregnant, said she had.

At first, it appeared Shaver had persuaded both to vote for the measure. But Rachel Wolff’s eyebrows rose when she discovered the initiative does not make exceptions for women who are victims of incest or rape.

The only exception is for women whose lives would be in danger if they were to carry the fetus to term. Wolff found that provision too limited.

Her husband agreed.

“I think they should make concessions for rape, incest and deformities,” he said.

At this point, he said, he’d likely just not vote.

About an hour later, opponents and supporters of the measure rallied outside the university’s bookstore.

Two women from Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust, a group based in Riverside, Calif., held a sign that read “Keep this legal” above a picture of what looked like a baby’s severed head.

A few passersby tried not to look. Others shook their heads. Some accepted the leaflets the women handed out.

At the other end of the plaza, other women tried to warn pedestrians about the Riverside protesters, carrying signs that read “Trigger warning: deceptive images ahead.” Other women shouted, “Our bodies, our choice.”

At one point the two groups converged and began a shouting match that had to be broken up by police.

http://news.yahoo.com/health-care-tactics-split-republican-senate-rivals-084729655--election.html,,[],Health care tactics split Republican Senate rivals,"ATLANTA (AP) — Republicans who want to regain control of the Senate will first have to do battle among themselves in 2014 primary elections, due largely to differences over how to proceed against the law they deride as ""Obamacare.""

In a number of Senate primary campaigns, conservatives are arguing over the best way to oppose President Barack Obama's health care law. The outcome of those campaigns could affect the battle over which party controls the Senate.

In intraparty skirmishes from Georgia to Nebraska, the GOP's most strident candidates and activists are insisting on a no-holds-barred approach. They accuse fellow Republicans — including several incumbent senators — of being too soft in their opposition to the Affordable Care Act and to the president in general.

The struggle will help determine just how conservative the Senate Republican caucus will be during Obama's final two years. And it could influence which party controls the chamber, with Democrats hoping that the most uncompromising Republican standard-bearers will emerge from the primaries and fare as poorly in general elections as their counterparts did in several 2012 Senate races. Republicans need to gain six seats to retake the majority in the Senate.

Republican Rep. Jack Kingston of Georgia, who wants to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss, stepped into the dispute recently when he seemed to scold much of his party during an interview on a conservative talk radio show.

""A lot of conservatives say, 'Nah, just step back and let this thing fall to pieces on its own,"" Kingston said. ""Well, I don't think that's always the responsible thing to do.""

Rep. Paul Broun, one of Kingston's rivals in a crowded primary field, pounced immediately, declaring in an Internet ad, ""I don't want to fix Obamacare, I want to get rid of it."" Conservative commentators hammered Kingston with headlines like ""Kingston has surrendered on Obamacare.""

Story continues

In Tennessee, state Rep. Joe Carr blasted Sen. Lamar Alexander for serving as a key GOP negotiator in the deal to end the partial government shutdown that resulted from House Republicans' efforts to deny funding for the health care law. Alexander subsequently described himself as a ""conservative problem solver,"" a characterization that Carr says ""typifies how out of touch he is.""

Kentucky businessman Matt Bevin is using a similar line of attack in trying to unseat Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, as is Mississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel in his primary challenge to Sen. Thad Cochran. Carr, Bevin and McDaniel all say they'd be more like freshmen Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Ted Cruz of Texas, tea party favorites who pushed the defunding strategy and vexed their longer-serving colleagues.

In Nebraska and Louisiana, Republican candidates who say they oppose the health care law have had to defend their past positions on health care.

National Republicans settled on Rep. Bill Cassidy as their best shot to beat Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La. But retired Air Force Colonel Rob Maness notes that Cassidy, as a state senator and a physician in the state's public hospital system, pushed health care policies similar to those in the Affordable Care Act.

""He has to defend his entire record, regardless of how he's voted in Washington,"" said Maness, a GOP candidate who hopes to unseat Landrieu with tea party support.

Midland University President Ben Sasse, one of several Republicans running in Nebraska for retiring Sen. Mike Johanns' seat, says he opposes the health care law but has had to explain previous speeches and writings in which he was less absolute, at one point calling the act ""an important first step"" in overhauling American health care.

""This goes right to the bigger fight between the ideologues and the pragmatists,"" said Republican strategist Todd Rehm of Georgia, who isn't affiliated with any of the eight GOP candidates for Chambliss' seat. Candidates who want to capture the divided Republican electorate, he said, ""see that you can't compromise on any of it. ... The moment you start to sound like you're open to any compromise, you've sold out the ideologues.""

Indeed, Alexander, McConnell, Kingston and Cassidy all voted against the Affordable Care Act in 2010 and for symbolic repeal proposals since then. Some in the GOP leadership say the intraparty struggle is only about tactics, not the bottom line. Carr insists that's exactly the point.

""Their presumption is that tactics don't matter because the outcome would be the same,"" he said. ""But it wouldn't. There wasn't a single Republican vote that passed the Affordable Care Act, whether we're talking establishment, tea party, moderate, conservative, whatever. ... So if it's so bad — and it is — the question is why did establishment Republicans not fight to defund it?""

Leaders of national conservative groups, which have been key players in recent Senate elections, say the distinction is an important consideration as they decide endorsements.

""I would say that any candidate who is a vocal opponent of that (defunding) strategy would certainly cause us hesitation,"" said Easton Randall of FreedomWorks political action committee. ""The burden is on them to explain what they would do differently to achieve a goal we all claim to share.""

So far, FreedomWorks has endorsed McDaniel over Cochran in Mississippi and Nebraska state Treasurer Shane Osborn over Sasse. The group is watching several other races.

The Senate Conservatives Fund, founded by former Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina, split with FreedomWorks in Nebraska, siding with Sasse. But the fund endorsed Maness in Louisiana, Bevin in Kentucky and McDaniel in Mississippi, among others. DeMint now runs the Heritage Foundation, whose political arm also is monitoring several other races.

Those groups' recent record is mixed. Democrats are hoping for a repeat of 2010 and 2012 races where the far right groups backed less-viable candidates who lost general elections in Colorado, Nevada, Delaware and Indiana. But the same groups also helped elect Lee, Cruz and Marco Rubio in the presidential swing state of Florida.

At FreedomWorks, PAC treasurer and policy chief Dean Clancy dismissed any notion that his efforts would hurt the party.

""Republicans make a mistake when they try to waffle on these issues or sound like Democrat-lite,"" he said.

Four years ago, the movement and its potent mix of anger and populism persuaded thousands of costumed and sign-waving conservatives to protest the ballooning deficit and President Obama's health care law. It swept a crop of no-compromise lawmakers into Congress and governor's offices and transformed political up-and-comers, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, into household names.

But as many Tea Party stars seek re-election next year and Rubio considers a 2016 presidential run, conservative activists are finding themselves at a crossroads. Many of their standard-bearers have embraced more moderate positions on bedrock issues such as immigration and health care, broadening their appeal in swing states but dampening grass-roots passion.

""They keep sticking their finger in the eyes of the guys who got them elected,"" said Ralph King, a co-founder of the Cleveland Tea Party Patriots. ""A lot of people are feeling betrayed.""

The Tea Party is a loosely knit web of activists, and some are hoping to rekindle the fire with 2014 primary challenges to wayward Republicans. But many more say they plan to sit out high-profile races in some important swing states next year, a move that GOP leaders fear could imperil the re-election prospects of former tea party luminaries, including the governors of Florida and Ohio.'

""It changes the playing field for us,"" said Tom Gaitens, former Florida director of FreedomWorks, a political action committee that has spent millions of dollars to help tea party candidates. ""The most powerful thing we have as a movement is our feet and our vote.""

In the summer of 2009, tea party supporters stormed congressional town hall meetings, shouting down lawmakers who had voted for the bank bailout and the stimulus package. The movement's voice grew louder after Democrats passed the health care overhaul, and voters took their outrage to the polls in 2010. The Tea Party wave stunned Democrats and many moderate Republicans, sweeping the GOP into control of the House and changing the balance of power in many statehouses.

But not long after some tea party stars took office, political analysts said, they were forced to adapt to a changing landscape, particularly in states Obama won in 2012, and to the realities of governing.

The Tea Party also fell out of favor with many people. At its height after the 2010 elections, a CBS News poll found that 31 percent of those surveyed considered themselves tea party supporters. A May survey found just 24 percent identified with the movement.

Facing sagging approval ratings, tea party Republicans, some of whom were elected by slim margins, shifted tactics.

Fla. Gov. Rick Scott, a former health care company executive who won office by attacking the health law and calling for deep cuts to state spending, has embraced the health law and signed one of the largest budgets in state history, complete with pay raises for teachers. Similarly, Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, and Rick Snyder, R-Mich., are battling their GOP-dominated legislatures to expand Medicaid, a big part of the health law.

Tea Party supporters were most struck by Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants. His personal story and unlikely rise to power made him perhaps the most prominent figure in the movement.

As a Senate candidate in 2010, he denounced as ""amnesty"" any plan that would offer a path to citizenship for those who were in the country illegally. Yet in recent months, he has emerged as a leader of a bipartisan Senate group that developed a plan that includes such a provision. The plan has been panned by conservatives but ultimately could bolster Rubio's standing with Hispanics, a growing demographic group that has voted overwhelmingly Democratic in recent years.

One sweltering July day, a half-dozen tea party protesters gathered under a tree in front of Rubio's Miami office, seeking shade as they denounced his support for an immigration overhaul. But the protest soon turned into more of a support group, with the four men and two women grousing to each other about how Rubio had turned into a ""back-stabber,"" a ""liar"" and a ""flip-flopper.""

Juan Fiol, a real estate broker who organized the protest, kept looking at his phone, waiting for calls from fellow tea party supporters that never came.

""It was supposed to be a big event,"" he said as he waved a large ""Don't Tread on Me"" flag.

The movement's top strategists acknowledge the Tea Party is quieter today, by design. It has matured, they said, from a protest movement to a political movement. Large-scale rallies have given way to strategic letter-writing and phone-banking campaigns to push or oppose legislative agendas in Washington and state capitals. In Michigan and Ohio, for example, leaders have battled the implementation of the president's health law and the adoption of ""Common Core"" state school standards.

Local activists say they have focused largely on their own communities since Obama's re-election and the ideological drift of some Tea Party-backed politicians. Many are running for school boards, county commissions and city councils, focusing on issues such as unfunded pension liabilities and sewer system repairs.

""The positions that people are filling at the local levels are more important for the future of the movement and the future of the country,"" said Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, a national umbrella organization. ""It's creating a farm team for the future.""

The Republican establishment, however, is concerned about 2014. Party leaders worry about the GOP's most passionate advocates walking away, particularly those supporters angered by the Senate's immigration bill. In a nod to the tea party, business and conservative groups have launched ad campaigns recasting the bill as a national security measure.

The conservative American Action Network spent $750,000 on pro-reform commercials. One ad aimed at Florida voters called the legislation ""the toughest border security plan ever passed by Congress"" and urged viewers to thank Rubio for ""keeping his promise and fighting to secure the border.""

National Tea Party leaders hope to re-energize followers by focusing on two of the movement's chief targets: the Internal Revenue Service and the health law. They said the Obama administration had handed them a recruiting tool when it delayed the law's implementation and when the IRS singled out tea party groups and other conservative political organizations for special scrutiny.

""The very issues that brought us together in the first place are emerging as more center stage than they were in 2009 and 2010,"" said Matt Kibbe, president of FreedomWorks. ""That animates the political conversation and mobilizes our grass roots going into the 2014 election.""

Some Republicans are also moving to repair their relationships with the movement.

Rubio recently spoke to about 50 conservative activists and other lawmakers at a meeting of the Senate's tea party caucus. Organizers said he breezed past immigration, instead devoting much of his speech to repealing the health law."

He has been struggling against Booker%2C nationally known in a state with more Democratic voters

PARSIPPANY, N.J. — The inconvenience of a federal government shutdown is worth the trouble if it can derail Obamacare, the Republican nominee for the unexpired term of New Jersey's late senator said in a meeting with Gannett New Jersey newspapers' editorial boards.

If he were in the Senate today, Steve Lonegan said he would join Republican efforts to tie the budget to a delay in the Affordable Care Act.

""If some people are inconvenienced by the shutdown of the federal government in order to drive this issue, to drive this debate, to stop the implementation of this health care system before it causes more problems, then that's a battle we need to have now. I would be holding the line on it until we can make that happen,"" Lonegan said Thursday.

New Jersey's special election to fill the unexpired term of Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., is Oct. 16. While Newark, N.J., Mayor Cory Booker leads by 13 percentage points among likely voters in the latest poll out Tuesday, the Democratic nominee's lead has shrunk by 3 percentage points since mid-August.

Lonegan said congressional Republicans' offer represents a sound compromise because the health care law isn't ready to launch. It should be delayed while the government continues to operate, preferably with a spending cut.

""There is room for compromise, and I believe the Republicans have offered that compromise,"" Lonegan said. ""There are significant questions and uncertainties, and it's creating way too much chaos in the economy. The Republican offer to simply postpone the implementation of Obamacare for one year — exactly like the president has offered to some of his major corporate supporters, giving them an out — every American should have the same opportunity.""

Booker had said he would attend the editorial board meeting but then backed out, citing a scheduling conflict. The nationally prominent Democrat and Lonegan clashed Friday in a debate taped in Trenton, N.J., which is scheduled to be televised in the state Sunday. In the debate, Booker sought to link Lonegan to the tea party movement though one tea party group in August endorsed a rival for the Republican Party nomination.

Lonegan and Booker have one more debate Wednesday, and turnout will be important at a time when many voters are focused on the November general election where races for governor, lieutenant governor, state senators and General Assembly are on the ballot.

On Thursday, Lonegan said the health care reform law should be replaced by free-market policies. He said malpractice lawsuits against doctors should be limited, people should be able to purchase health insurance plans offered in other states, and doctors should get tax credits and exemptions from malpractice lawsuits for pro bono services provided at free health clinics.

Lonegan, a former director of the state chapter of the free-market advocacy group Americans for Prosperity, easily captured the GOP primary.

He's a former three-term mayor of Bogata, N.J., population 8,200, who has made unsuccessful bids for state Senate, the House of Representatives and the Republican nomination for governor. He used to own a cabinetry business, and now owns a custom home-building business.

""My background in building a business, my background in governing a town effectively makes me a better candidate for the U.S. Senate than my opponent. It makes me one of the best candidates for U.S. Senate in the country,"" said Lonegan, who said Booker has a ""record of failure"" as Newark's mayor, pointing to the city's unemployment rate, high school dropout rate and violent crime. Newark is New Jersey's largest city with a population of more than 275,000.

Lonegan hopes to be appointed to the Senate Finance Committee if he wins the election. He said he would like to get laws passed that would deactivate and re-establish a regulatory body — such as the Environmental Protection Agency, Occupational Safety and Health Administration or Internal Revenue Service — every seven years and compel a review on whether to reinstate each of an agency's rules.

He wants Congress to approve any new federal regulations, he said.

""You may not agree with me on my ideas on every one of these issues, but they're founded in that simple belief in liberty,"" Lonegan said. ""I think that you're going to see in the debates — I know you're going to see — that Mr. Booker is founded in nothing other than a desire to be a politician."""

http://www.wjla.com/...



Having lost the closer-than-expected Virginia gubernatorial election last week against Democrat Terry McAuliffe, he still has work to do in his remaining weeks as the state’s attorney general but nonetheless faces an uncertain political future.

Or not. That’s the word the past several days from a variety of conservative thinkers who believe Cuccinelli should run for the U.S. Senate next year against the popular incumbent and former Virginia governor Mark Warner. Take, for example what columnist Judson Phillips wrote last week in the Washington Times: “. . .In short, Ken Cuccinelli is the only potential candidate in Virginia with statewide name recognition who could take on Mark Warner and make this seat competitive. Cuccinelli has a lot of advantages that no one else has. His statewide organization is still intact. Another advantage is if he ran, the Republican Party would almost be forced to give him a significant amount of help.” And then there’s this from Quin Hillyer: “There’s every reason to believe ObamaCare will be an albatross around donkey necks next fall as well, and especially around the necks of senators such as Warner, without whose vote the dreadful law would not have passed. Because of his terrific lawsuit against Obamacare, there is nobody on Earth who is better suited than Cuccinelli to make that case against Warner.” If the Affordable Care Act continues to struggle, the thinking goes, Cuccinelli and his Tea Party supporters suddenly don’t look like obstructionists but wise people ahead of the curve. Mark Rozell, however, is skeptical. He’s the Acting Dean and Professor of Public Policy at George Mason University, and says that “unless circumstances change substantially,” Warner would be “extremely” hard to beat. - WJLA 5, 11/14/13

Honestly, who really thinks Ken Cuccinelli running up against Mark Warner next year after a narrow but humiliating defeat earlier this month? Apparently right-wing newspapers have a boner for the idea of Cuccinelli running for Senate:

http://www.americanthinker.com/...



Yet it would be a problem for the 2013 campaigner Ken Cuccinelli to run for U.S. Senate, from what we saw in Ken's unsuccessful campaign for governor. There is absolutely nothing wrong with Ken Cuccinelli as a potential senator. Yet Ken will fail badly unless he fires his 2013 campaign strategists, consultants, and leaders, and adopts a new strategy. Note that no Republican is currently running who has ever held elected office before. That is why Ken Cuccinelli is such an interesting possibility. Many leaders are enthusiastic about either Howie Lind or Shak Hill. Yet in enormous and highly political Virginia, no Republican either well-known or experienced is even hinting at running. I have been talking up Ollie North or Gary Bauer, teasing Jim Martin about running, and hoping for Jamie Radtke, Bob Marshall, or George Allen. Maybe E.W. Jackson will run. Apparently Newt Gingrich has said no. - American Thinker, 11/12/13

Will he actually run for Senate. Some folks are pretty doubtful:

http://www.staffordcountysun.com/...



Plus Virginia Democrats aren't even finished with going after Cuccinelli:

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/...



The State Board of Elections updated the count to reflect provisional ballots from Fairfax County. Herring now leads by 164 votes out of more than 2.2 million cast. Herring had declared victory late Tuesday night, saying ""voters in Virginia have spoken."" At a news conference in Richmond on Wednesday, Obenshain termed Herring's declaration ""bravado"" and said the Democrat should resign from his state Senate seat if he is so confident. Obenshain said talk of a recount is premature, pending the Nov. 25 vote certification by the State Board of Elections. Obenshain also said he is not concerned about conflict of interest questions Democrats are raising because Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli is calling on supporters to help fund Obenshain's potential recount. Cuccinelli's office advises and counsels state agencies -- including the elections board, which would be in charge of a recount. State Sen. A. Donald McEachin, D-Henrico, on Wednesday called on Cuccinelli to ""stop tainting the electoral process and to refrain from fundraising for Senator Obenshain."" Cuccinelli has a critical role to play to help ensure Virginians have confidence in the outcome, McEachin said in a statement. ""Attorney General Cuccinelli needs to take his responsibilities seriously in this process and refrain from his overt and extreme partisanship,"" he said. - Huffington Post, 11/14/13

So yeah, maybe the Cooch better think carefully about running against Warner and not give in to the right-wing fan base cheering the idea. Plus I don't want the Cooch to run. For the obvious reasons, of course, but I also just have too many races to write about. It was fun writing a lot about the Virginia Governor's race this past month but I'm ready to move on. Plus I doubt Cuccinelli would even make the race competitive for Warner but then again, I could be wrong. Stay tuned."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/05/obamacare-turnout-are-final-factors-in-virginia-governor-race/,2013-11-05 00:00:00,[],Virginia governor's race too close to call,"The polls are now closed in Virginia, and Fox News can report that Democrat Terry McAulliffe has a slight lead over Republican Ken Cuccinelli, although it is too early to call the race.

According to the latest wave of Fox News exit polls, the surprising closeness of the race can be attributed - in part - to the disastrous rollout of ObamaCare.

Virginia voters in general oppose ObamaCare by a margin of 53 to 45 percent, according to exit polls. Of those who oppose the law, 80 percent voted for Cuccinelli and 11 percent voted for McAuliffe.



McAuliffe is faring well among women voters and is also performing strongly in the Washington D.C. suburbs in Northern Virginia. Libertarian candidate Robert Sarvis remains a distant third, although he is garnering a fair amount of votes from young people.

As polls closed, so did the hard-fought Virginia gubernatorial race between an establishment Democrat and a Republican who warned that a vote for his rival was a vote for ObamaCare.

“ObamaCare has been a big part of why this race is a horse race at this point,” Republican nominee Ken Cuccinelli said after casting his vote Tuesday morning.

The race between the Tea Party-backed Cuccinelli and Democrat Terry McAuliffe was billed as the marquee 2013 gubernatorial contest and has lived up to expectations through the finals days -- with the better-funded McAuliffe clinging to a single-digit lead.

The race, in which the candidates raised a combined record $54 million, has also been marked by negative ads and accusations of questionable ethics -- and its results could be a bellwether for the 2014 and 2016 races.

The results are expected to show whether a swing state such as Virginia could elect a Tea Party-backed governor. They are also expected to gauge whether Republicans can continue to ride Americans’ dissatisfaction with ObamaCare and if Democrats can reestablish a political foothold in the South.

McAuliffe voted before dawn and visited campaign offices to help sustain his six-point lead in the polls.

Cuccinelli, the state’s attorney general, made several final-hour campaign stops in hopes his conservative supporters give him a come-from-behind win.

He told reporters after voting in northern Virginia that a strong GOP turnout was “absolutely critical.”

“I hear people's aspirations and their complaints,” Cuccinelli said. “One of their complaints is they don't like how things run. My answer is: 'Well make sure you show up.' …The world is run by the people who show up.”

A third candidate, libertarian Robert Sarvis, also was on the ballot.

Turnout was expected to be low -- 40 percent was the figure both sides were using. And both candidates were mustering their campaign organizations to find every last supporter. The negative tilt of the campaigns turned many voters off, and strategists in both parties predicted the outcome could be decided by just a few thousand votes.

Richard Powell, a 60-year-old retired IT manager who lives in Norfolk, described himself as an independent who frequently votes for members of both parties. He said he cast his ballot for McAuliffe because he was more determined not to vote for Cuccinelli, whom he said overreaches on a variety of medical issues.

Voters were barraged with a series of commercials that attempted to tie Cuccinelli to restricting abortions.

""I'm not in favor of abortion -- let's put it that way -- but I find that restricting abortion causes far more social harm than allowing abortion, so that was an issue for me,"" Powell said.

Both candidates got help from some big names. Former President Bill Clinton and wife Hillary made appearances in the final weeks for McAuliffe, a major fundraiser for the political couple and a former Democratic National Committee chairman.

President Obama campaigned for him last weekend. First lady Michelle Obama lent her voice to a radio advertisement, and Vice President Joe Biden spoke to supporters on the eve of the election.

Cuccinelli got visits from Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Sens. Marco Rubio, Florida, and Rand Paul, Kentucky -- all potential presidential contenders in 2016.

The winner will succeed term-limited Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican, for a four-year term starting in January. Obama won the state in 2008 and 2012, but far fewer voters participate in off-year elections and that gives the GOP better odds.

Republicans bet a deeply conservative candidate would be their best shot, passing over a lieutenant governor for Cuccinelli, an early crusader against ObamaCare.

""I'm scared to death about what ObamaCare is doing to Virginians, and Terry McAuliffe is scared to death what ObamaCare is doing to Terry McAuliffe,” said Cuccinelli, who has tried to make the election into a referendum on the law, which McAuliffe supports.

Democrats chose a loyal partisan in McAuliffe and recruited the Clintons to raise millions for him and rally the party faithful.

The 45-year-old Cuccinelli went into Election Day trying to overcome a lingering wariness among fellow Republicans about his conservative views, including those on climate change.

The 56-year-old McAuliffe is trying to avoid an eleventh-hour error. On Tuesday morning, McAuliffe stopped by a campaign office to rally volunteers near Richmond. He urged them to knock on one more doors and phone one more friend as the campaign neared its end. McAuliffe said that effort was needed to combat low turnout.

""This is the greatest democracy in the world. We want everyone to vote,"" McAuliffe told reporters.

The massive haul highlights how lucrative campaigning against Obamacare can be for Republicans. It also underscores how deeply motivated conservative voters are to see that the sprawling healthcare law be killed.

A college president in his hometown of Fremont, Nebraska, Sasse is a newcomer to politics, but he has spent much of the past decade working on healthcare issues. As a top advisor to President Bush’s Health Secretary, Sasse worked to cut red tape and pushed market-based solutions over government mandates. Sasse also spent several years traveling the country giving speeches and advising companies about the dangers of Obamacare and how it will hike costs, constrict innovation, and ultimately provide terrible health care.

“I am the anti-Obamacare candidate,” Sasse said cheerfully. “Not only have I read the 2,300-page bill, I have actually spent years studying it and I understand just how devastating this will be to American businesses, families and taxpayers.”

It was Sasse’s health care expertise and his outspoken opposition to Obamacare that inspired former Nebraska GOP chairman Mark Fahleson to draft Sasse to run for the open seat left by Sen. Mike Johann’s retirement.

“2014 and probably 2016 will be about one thing more than anything else,” Fahleson said. “It will be about Obamacare and the false promises and reckless entitlement spending that are set to destroy this country. And I don’t know anybody who knows more about it and is more honest about the problems of Obamacare than Ben.”

Sasse’s campaign comes just as the crusade against Obamacare has hit a fevered pitch in Washington.

“Ted Cruz has finally shown the Republican establishment in Washington just how fed up voters are with the federal government and the notion that bureaucrats know what is best for patients,” said one political consultant who advised the Cruz campaign. “That’s why a guy knowledgeable about healthcare like Ben Sasse being in the Senate would be the most destructive thing to ever hit Obamacare.”

Sasse’s cash haul of nearly $750,000 from individual donors in his first quarter breaks Nebraska’s previous record of $526,000 from individual donors, set in 2007 by Johanns while he was sitting U.S. Secretary of Agriculture.

Shane Osborn, former state treasurer who has been running for the senate seat for six months, raised just $234,000 in his first quarter, according to FEC records."

Five months after his resounding reelection victory, President Obama is bumping up against the boundaries of his political power in Washington as the core of his second-term legislative agenda moves into a still-divided Congress.

His ability to secure the three high-profile legislative items now confronting Congress — gun-control measures, reform of the immigration system and his long-term budget priorities — is likely to determine his domestic legacy. Obama’s plan now is to ensure that as much of his politically challenging agenda as possible is enacted, after months of effort to frame the policies for the American public and, perhaps more important, for the House and Senate.

Each of the issues that Obama is pursuing is being managed independently by the second-term White House team — an improvisational strategy that is testing the president’s ability to calibrate when to get involved and when to stay out of the way.

But senior administration officials acknowledge that only immigration legislation has a chance of resembling Obama’s ideal bill once it emerges from the Democratic-run Senate and the Republican-controlled House.

On his other major initiatives, they say Obama would settle for less than he claims he wants, a sign that he remains pragmatic in the face of partisan opposition that continues to limit his ambitions.

“I have the same worry about all of these issues, and it’s the Republican House,” said Dan Pfeiffer, an Obama senior adviser.

Obama outlined a broad progressive agenda in his second inaugural address, and he has spoken frequently about the validation that he believes the public gave his plans by reelecting him last year. But second-term presidents traditionally have less than two years to secure a legislative agenda before lame-duck status sets in, and Obama already has seen his popular support shrink in recent months from its post-

election highs.

The election also did not change the basic political dynamic in Washington: a Democratic president in conflict with congressional Republicans, only some of whom believe last year’s election represented a call for compromise.

Each morning, the new White House chief of staff, Denis McDonough, reviews the overall legislative progress with senior staff. Inside the White House, each issue has a group responsible for its day-to-day management on Capitol Hill.

The strategy has led Obama to alternately court Senate Republicans — as he did last week in his second such dinner with a dozen of them — and to scold them before outside-the-Beltway audi-

ences, as he did this month in denouncing GOP threats to block gun-control legislation. Advisers say he does so to keep the political momentum alive in Washington for measures with strong public support outside the capital.

After months of campaigning for his agenda, two of his priorities appear to be inching through the Democratic-controlled Senate: a compromise on gun-purchase background checks was announced last week and another deal is expected this week on immigration.

But the budget he announced last week, which proposed restricting cost-of-living increases for Social Security, appears to have angered his own supporters more than it has convinced Republicans. It is an issue on which his strongest political leverage lies in going against his own party.

“I think they put something on the table which no Democrat should ever put on the table,” said Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. “It’s not okay to be bargained with. The risk is that voters mistakenly identify his budget priorities with all of ours.”

Immigration

After outlining what he wants in an immigration bill, Obama has largely taken a hands-off approach to designing the legislation, now the subject of negotiations among a bipartisan group of senators known as the Gang of Eight.

The strategy was adopted soon after his second-term inauguration, when Obama, eager to push the issue after winning more than 70 percent of the Latino vote, prepared to introduce his own bill during a visit to Las Vegas to break a long-standing deadlock among Senate negotiators.

Administration officials said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), a Gang of Eight member, called the White House a few days before the Jan. 29 event. Schumer said the group was close to reaching consensus on a bill and asked Obama to hold off on announcing his own in order to avoid disrupting the talks.

Obama agreed.

“On any issue where there is progress being made, we don’t want to get in the way,” said a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the White House legislative strategy and assess its prospects. “Every one of these issues has potential pitfalls and potential opportunities.”

Inside the White House, the issue is being managed by Cecilia Muñoz, director of the Domestic Policy Council. Administration officials acknowledge that immigration is the issue on which they can be the most patient, given that many Republicans are eager to repair relations with the fast-growing Latino electorate after the November election.

While Obama has allowed Senate negotiators to work on a compromise that can win approval, a White House staff member attends each staff-level meeting to monitor progress and assist with the technical aspects of writing the bill.

“We know we have the upper hand on immigration,” the administration official said, acknowledging that Obama has far less sway when it comes to gun-

control measures and the budget.

Obama has employed an outside-the-Beltway strategy on guns, traveling to the sites of mass shootings to implore Congress to take action.

White House aides believe that the school massacre in Newtown, Conn., in December, in which a gunman killed 20 children and six adult staff members, created the first political moment in decades for Congress to tighten gun laws. A large majority of the public supports tighter restrictions, but many in Congress would rather not confront the powerful gun rights lobby.

Obama’s aides also worry that the political environment could change quickly unless the president keeps pressuring Congress to act, which he did Monday when he visited the University of Hartford in the company of Newtown parents.

This weekend, for the first time ever, Obama turned his weekly radio address over to someone other than Vice President Biden: Francine Wheeler, whose 6-year-old son, Ben, was fatally shot in Newtown’s Sandy Hook Elementary School.

“Please help us do something before our tragedy becomes your tragedy,” Wheeler said, adding that the Senate hasn’t “yet passed any bills that will help keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. “

The president began the year with a sweeping set of proposals to ban military-style assault weapons, limit the size of ammunition magazines, require background checks for virtually all weapons sales and increase funding for mental health care, among other issues.

Yet it has become increasingly clear to the administration that most of the ambitious ideas don’t have enough support to pass Congress. The issue is being managed by Biden’s office, and the White House is trying to strike a balance between when to pressure lawmakers and when to accept a compromise, even if it is far more modest than originally envisioned.

Obama took the latter approach last week when he praised a bipartisan deal to expand background checks, while acknowledging it is not as expansive as he wanted.

Advisers concede that the most high-profile of the Obama proposals — renewing the expired federal ban on assault weapons — has virtually no chance of becoming law.

“You have to have an analysis of the possible,” the senior administration official said. “Anything we do on guns is a positive for the country.”

Budget

Obama’s continuing struggles over the budget, perhaps more than anything else, show the limits of his power.

White House officials believe that Obama won the public argument over taxes and spending in the recent presidential election — a long “outside game” that Obama hopes will translate into leverage inside the Beltway.

Now the administration is trying to coax Republicans into a budget compromise that would replace across-the-board spending cuts, known as the sequester, that took effect last month and undercut Obama’s vision for how to build the economy.

Last week, Obama presented a budget that he said did not reflect his ideal view but that he believes might appeal to moderate Republicans looking to put fiscal fights behind them.

The budget fully incorporates the offer Obama made to House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) in December during “fiscal cliff” talks, embracing policies such as cuts to Social Security benefits that are noxious to many Democrats.

Obama is counting on preliminary discussions to try to reconcile separate budgets passed by House Republicans and Senate Democrats last month, although it’s not clear whether those talks will reach a more serious phase.

As Congress goes through that process, Obama plans to continue reaching out to Republicans who may be open to a deal.

“There’s an awful lot of work to be done,” said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) after the latest GOP dinner with Obama on Wednesday. “But these overtures are encouraging.”

White House aides are looking for help from lawmakers such as Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who organized the guest list for the first dinner with Obama and suggested he would be open to a compromise that raises revenue in exchange for significant entitlement reform.

But White House officials acknowledge there is no clear path toward a deal, meaning that sequester spending cuts are likely to remain in place for the foreseeable future.

The budget process is being handled by the same men who have been running it for several years: National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling and deputy chief of staff Rob Nabors. Any progress on the budget will rely on Republicans agreeing to at least some degree of higher tax revenue, White House officials said, by way of scaling back tax breaks that benefit the wealthy.

Administration officials say the only hope of getting an agreement through the House is to have resounding support in the Senate. They concede they will need to work to get even some Democrats on board given the changes to Social Security now on the table.

“The best strategy for the House is to do as well as we can in the Senate,” the administration official said. “Step two is to get as many Democrats as possible.”

http://news.yahoo.com/republicans-see-obamacare-issues-key-2014-074314054.html,,[],Republicans see 'Obamacare' issues as key to 2014,"WASHINGTON (AP) — If Republicans were writing a movie script for next year's congressional elections, the working title might be ""2014: Apocalypse of Obamacare.""

The plot: The rollout of President Barack Obama's health care law turns into such a disaster that enraged voters rebuke him by rewarding the GOP with undisputed control of Congress.

But there's a risk for Republicans if they're wrong and the Affordable Care Act works reasonably well, particularly in states that have embraced it. Republicans might be seen as obstinately standing in the way of progress.

The law already has been a political prop in two election seasons, but next year will be different.

Voters will have a real program to judge, working or dysfunctional. Will affordable health care finally be a reality for millions of uninsured working people? Or will premiums skyrocket as the heavy hand of government upends already fragile insurance markets for small businesses and individuals?

""The end of this movie has not been written,"" said Robert Blendon, a Harvard professor who tracks public opinion on health care. He says next year's movie actually will be a documentary: what happens in states that fully put the law in place and those that resist — ""a message of reality.""

One of the most prominent doomsayers is Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who predicts ""Obamacare"" probably will be the biggest issue of 2014 and ""an albatross around the neck of every Democrat who voted for it.""

""This thing can't possibly work,"" says McConnell. ""It will be a huge disaster in 2014.""

Counting on that, House Republicans are busy framing an election narrative, voting to repeal the health law and trying to link it to the scandal over the Internal Revenue Service's targeting of tea party groups. It could help excite the conservative base.

But Democratic pollster Celinda Lake doubts reality will follow the GOP script. Next year, ""we won't have to worry about the mythology laid out by the right wing about Obamacare: death panels and dramatic cuts to Medicare,"" she said.

Story continues

Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said uninsured people in her state will have over 200 coverage options to choose from. ""We have been hearing the fear, but in states like mine, people are seeing the reality,"" she said.

In just about five months, people without access to coverage through their jobs can start shopping for subsidized private insurance in new state markets. The actual benefits begin Jan. 1. But because of continuing opposition to the law from many Republican governors and state legislators, the federal government will be running the insurance markets in more than half the states.

Another major element of the law, the expansion of Medicaid to serve more low-income people, also has run into problems. With many legislative sessions over or winding down, it looks like fewer than half the states may accept the expansion. That means millions of low-income people are likely to remain uninsured, at least initially.

Other early indicators of how well the health care rollout might fare are mixed.

In a dozen or so states that have started releasing details of their new insurance markets, there's robust insurer interest in participating, according to the market research firm Avalere Health. That's a good signal for competition.

There still are concerns about a spike in premiums for people who already buy their own coverage, particularly the young and healthy. That could happen for several reasons.

The health care law forbids insurers to deny coverage to sick people, and it limits what older adults can be charged. Also, the plans that will be offered next year are more comprehensive than many bare-bones policies currently available to individuals.

Another big source of angst is the Obama administration. The Health and Human Services Department will be running the program in half the country while trying to fight off attempts by congressional Republicans to starve it financially. Unusual for a social program, the administration is largely operating behind a veil of secrecy.

Will Obama's underlings turn out to be the Keystone Kops of health care?

Frustration that he and his constituents couldn't get basic information from the administration led one of the authors of the law, Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., to warn recently that he sees ""a huge train wreck coming down.""

Republicans loved it. Lost in the uproar was the fact that Baucus was referring to potential problems with implementation. He stills thinks the health care law itself is a good thing.

The administration official running the rollout, Gary Cohen, told Congress this past that he didn't agree with the senator's statement. ""We are very much on schedule,"" Cohen said.

Republican pollster Bill McInturff says he's skeptical of what he hears from the administration as well as from his own party. McInturff, who has made polling on health care his specialty, says the launch of any national program is bound to have problems. President George W. Bush's Medicare prescription benefit went through several weeks of chaos before things got smoothed out.

""Life experience says to me there is not going to be some simple, clear narrative that is sitting here today,"" McInturff said."

Mississippi Sen. Thad Cochran’s decision to seek a seventh term – revealed on the eve of his 76th birthday -- was something of a surprise. He raised just more than $53,000 in the most recent fundraising period, and has only $800,000 in the bank. Chris McDaniel, a 41-year-old state senator, entered the race in October and has begun actively campaigning and picking up endorsements.

Cochran said in a statement that he would “run hard and be successful so that I can continue to serve the people of Mississippi and our nation effectively.”

Only Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch has served longer than Cochran among Republicans. He is fourth overall in seniority in the U.S. Senate, a distinction that no longer carries the importance it once did in the body.

As the top Republican on the Senate Agriculture Committee, he has been deeply involved with negotiations with the House over a compromise on the farm bill, an effort that has been complicated by newer fiscal hawks in the GOP who are intent on separating food stamps from agriculture subsidies. The pairing of those issues in the past has provided the bipartisan coalition needed to ensure passage.

Cochran also served as the top Republican on the Appropriations Committee, a once-powerful perch that now is at the heart of conservative criticisms of the veteran lawmaker.

“Throughout his over 40 years in Washington, Sen. Thad Cochran has done some good things for Mississippi, but he’s also done some bad things,” said Chris Chocola, president of the conservative Club For Growth, which has endorsed McDaniel in the Senate primary. “He voted to bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, voted repeatedly to raise the debt limit by trillions of dollars, and even voted against a resolution that stated Congress has a ‘moral obligation’ to cut spending.”

“Sen. Cochran has had a long and distinguished career representing the people of Mississippi,” McDaniel said in a statement. “I look forward to a positive campaign based on the future of our state, our country and the Republican Party. As a strong conservative, I will fight to bring those values to Washington.”

The Republican primary is June 3. Whoever emerges from the Republican primary would be a heavy favorite to keep the seat in the general election. No Democrat has entered yet, but Jennifer Duffy of the Cook Political Report said that the prospect now of a “bruising” Republican primary could draw more interest from prospective candidates. Possible candidates could include Ray Mabus, the former two-term governor who now serves as secretary of the Navy.

Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the minority leader, also face significant primary opposition in 2014 from candidates running to their right. Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) also faces a challenge from Liz Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney.

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — As voters in some states cast ballots Tuesday, warning signs flared for Tea Party forces and the Democratic Party about their prospects in the broader and more critical midterm elections precisely one year from now.

The staying power of the conservative movement that burst onto the scene four years ago was called into question in this year's marquee contests. Tea Party nemesis Chris Christie swept to a landslide re-election as governor in New Jersey, a case study in how more moderate Republicans can carry even Democratic-leaning states. Tea Party favorite Ken Cuccinelli lost a closer race against Democrat Terry McAuliffe for governor in Virginia, a contest establishment Republicans thought they could have won with a more mainstream candidate.

Still, Democrats saw looming problems of their own on the horizon — not so much in returns from the off-year elections but in the roiling furor over the flawed rollout of the federal health care exchange. One key official, Marilyn Tavenner, was grilled at a Senate hearing Tuesday, and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was slated to be back on the hot seat Wednesday at another hearing on Capitol Hill.

For yet another election, Obamacare seems to be emerging as the defining issue of 2014. This time, the controversy over the president's signature legislative achievement is gaining traction not as a result of Republican attacks but through administration fumbles.

""Certainly, other issues may rise and fall — but Obamacare is the constant that runs through this election,"" says Oregon Rep. Greg Walden, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee and a critic of the Affordable Care Act.

Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., who supports the law, warned Tavenner at Tuesday's hearing that enrollment snafus with the launch of the HealthCare.gov website last month had created a ""crisis of confidence.""

At stake next year is more than bragging rights. Republicans have their best shot in the foreseeable future to regain control of the Senate. Democrats harbor long-shot hopes of getting back a majority in the House of Representatives. Thirty-six states, including a half-dozen swing states in national elections, will elect governors.

And for the president, the 2014 elections will shape how ambitious his legislative agenda realistically can be for his final two years in office, how many congressional investigations he is likely to face, and the degree to which his presidency will have charted a new course for the Democratic Party or left it weaker.

The midterms are likely also to be a test for the Tea Party movement, which tapped voter outrage over passage of the Affordable Care Act to help Republicans gain control of the House in 2010.

REMEMBER THE SHUTDOWN?

To be sure, prognostication is a dangerous sport in politics.

A year ago, Obama scored a historic victory, becoming the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win two presidential terms with more than 50% of the vote. Obama predicted then — inaccurately, as it has turned out — that his win would ""break the fever"" in Washington and persuade Republicans to cooperate on issues such as immigration.

Just a month ago, Democratic hopes for 2014 were buoyed when voters were inclined to blame Republican lawmakers for the 16-day government shutdown, driving approval ratings for the GOP to new lows. The non-partisan Cook Political Report then shifted the ratings on 15 House races, moving 14 of them in the Democrats' direction.

That was then.

""Democratic pols had been gleefully anticipating the negative impact the Republican Party would incur as a result of the recent government shutdown debacle,"" Charlie Cook wrote in a National Journal column Tuesday. ""Now Democrats are shaking their heads over signs that much of the advantage they might have gained has been effectively neutralized"" by Obamacare's problems.

Democrats not only are shaking their heads. Some are urging the administration to delay key deadlines in the health care law. At Tuesday's hearing of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Sen. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., urged Tavenner to put off penalties for consumers if the website wasn't working in December. Tavenner is administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs the website for the federal health care exchange.

Eleven Democratic senators have endorsed an appeal by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire that the administration give consumers more time to sign up. The group has some common characteristics: Seven of the 11 are in potentially competitive re-election races next year, and one of the others is Michael Bennet of Colorado, who just happens to chair the Democrats' Senate campaign committee.

Republicans need a net gain of six seats to win control in the Senate. The two most endangered Senate Democrats running for re-election are Mark Pryor of Arkansas, who is likely to face Republican Rep. Tom Cotton, and Mark Begich of Alaska. The GOP also is favored to pick up seats where Democratic incumbents are retiring in Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia.

In the House, Democrats need a net gain of 17 seats to regain control.

The 36 gubernatorial races include contests in some of the states that play big roles in presidential elections, among them Florida, Iowa, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. On Monday, former Florida governor Charlie Crist, a Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat, announced he would seek his old job back, challenging Republican Gov. Rick Scott.

BEST CASE, WORST CASE

At a panel at the Brookings Institution think tank Tuesday discussing the 2014 midterms, not one of the academics and political analysts on the dais raised a hand when asked whether it's possible the Affordable Care Act could have enough of a turnaround to be an asset for Democratic candidates next year.

The best-case scenario for Democrats would be that the issue recedes, says Elaine Kamarck, a veteran of the Clinton White House. The worst case? ""They don't fix the technical problems with the sites and the insurance companies use the law as an excuse to drop or change a lot of benefits,"" she says. ""And people get really, really mad about it.""

At the moment, the issue of Obamacare splits the electorate down the middle, surveys of voters as they left polling places showed. In Virginia, just under 50% supported the Affordable Care Act, just over 50% opposed it. Democrat McAuliffe got nine of 10 votes of those who supported it. Republican Cuccinelli got eight of 10 votes among those who opposed it.

The onslaught of negative news about the Affordable Care Act in the past week or so was one possible explanation analysts gave for a closer-than-expected race for Virginia governor. ""Obamacare is a problem,"" Stu Rothenberg of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report said in a tweet. ""It's an obviously conclusion from close VA results.""

A series of deadlines will keep Obamacare in the news. The administration has promised to release enrollment numbers by Nov. 15; early indications are that they will be embarrassingly small. Obama has promised to fix the website by Nov. 30; a failure to fulfill that promise would intensify demands for delay.

The deadline to enroll for coverage that starts at the beginning of the year is Dec. 15. The deadline to enroll and avoid having to pay a penalty has been set at March 31.

By then, the midterm elections should be raging.

But behind closed doors in a room off the Senate floor, some of the newer Democratic senators couldn’t help themselves, gathering for a quick party to congratulate one another. They were the ones largely responsible for pushing the veteran Nevada lawmaker to pull the trigger on ending filibusters against most presidential nominations.

The partisan revelers were part of a new breed of Democrats emerging in the Senate. Mostly elected after 2006, these relative newcomers have only known a Democratic-controlled Senate and have little experience with successful bipartisan cooperation, due largely to the tea party’s grip on the Republican Party.

Now they are hoping to become a new power center in the party, nudging the old guard to adopt more aggressive tactics in pursuit of legislative goals and largely brushing aside Republican threats of retaliation and obstruction. They see the rules and traditions of the Senate as having stifled the will of the majority and stalled President Obama’s agenda.

“The Senate is a graveyard for good ideas,” Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.), who along with Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon led the filibuster reform effort and won over veteran colleagues in a body where seniority was once the most valuable currency.

PHOTOS: 2013’s memorable political moments

This newer class of Democrats came to Washington, not unlike the tea party Republicans, with a strong commitment to their ideals and policy goals. But while the tea party rule in the House has been characterized by attempts to stifle the president’s agenda, Democrats see their goal as helping to implement it.

Thursday’s action to limit the use of filibusters — seen as so drastic it was termed the “nuclear option” — shows they are willing to carve out a different path to get there.

“There’s a time to reach across the aisle and there’s a time to hold the line,” said Sen. Christopher S. Murphy (D-Conn.), the body’s youngest member at 40, who was elected in 2012. “And I think so far this year Democrats in the Senate have done a very good job of mixing across-the-aisle compromise with some heretofore unseen spine-stiffening.”

The time has come for Democrats to take a harder stance against the tea party Republicans, he said.

“These folks have come to Washington to destroy government from within and will use any tool at their disposal,” Murphy said. “To the extent that we have the ability to take tools away from the tea party, we should do it. And one of the tools was the filibuster. Another was the belief that Democrats would cave in the face of another shutdown or debt default.”

For Murphy, the failure of the Senate gun control bill earlier this year was the final straw. He took on the issue of gun violence after the Newtown school shooting in his state in 2012. A bipartisan bill crafted by Sens. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) had 55 votes but failed to advance.

“I was a proponent of filibuster reform coming into the Senate, but I became a revolutionary on this issue when we lost the gun bill,” Murphy said.

The group also includes Elizabeth Warren, elected last fall in Massachusetts. Her firebrand style and unabashed liberalism have energized the party’s left wing.

The senators’ influence has already been seen in other fights, most recently in the 16-day shutdown, when new Democrats lobbied party leaders to stand up to Republicans — a tactic that seemed to shock many on the other side of the aisle, who were betting that Democrats would blink first.

Next on their agenda is extending the filibuster rule change from presidential appointments to legislation, which would enable the Senate to move on issues including gun control and climate change.

At times, their advocacy has presented challenges to the administration. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), elected in 2006, circulated a letter among his colleagues urging the president to appoint Janet Yellen — not Lawrence H. Summers — as Federal Reserve chair because Summers’ banking policies were viewed as having contributed to the financial meltdown. About a third of the party, including Merkley and Warren, signed it. Yellen is now on track to take the post after advancing this week from the Senate Banking Committee, with Brown and Warren’s support.

And Senate confirmation is virtually assured, thanks to the new rule change against filibusters.

“The Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic Party definitely are showing that they have growing influence in the caucus, and in government in general,” said Matt Wall of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a group that works to promote progressive candidates and issues in Democratic primaries. On Friday, Warren circulated a fundraising letter to supporters on behalf of Merkley and Udall, thanking them for their role in changing the rule. Both men face reelection in 2014.

The changing Democratic tactics may reflect a generational shift occurring in the Senate. It’s almost certain that by the start of the next Congress in 2015, more than half of the Democratic caucus will have been elected since 2008, when gridlock reached new heights. But nine of the new Senate Democrats are former Congress members, all of whom served at least part of their time under Republican majorities. Three were governors who served with Republican legislatures.

The shift among Democrats has at times confounded Republicans, particularly on the filibuster issue. Aides to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), the third-longest-serving Republican, said they had felt that Reid’s most recent moves telegraphing the nuclear option were a bluff.

Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Thursday railed against the actions of “uninitiated newcomers in the Democratic caucus,” reminding them they had never served in the minority in the Senate. Those who have a longer memory “should know better,” he added.

Six-term Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan was the only Democrat to speak out against his party’s move, citing the late institutionalist Sens. Edward M. Kennedy and Robert C. Byrd in arguing against tinkering with long-standing rules.

“Before we discard the uniqueness of this great institution, let us use the current rules and precedents of the Senate to end the abuse of the filibuster,” said Levin, who will retire after next year.

But those pushing for the rule change won over one Democratic stalwart.

“There are many of us that really wanted to keep things the way they were, because that’s the way they were,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). “One thing I know: that you learn from history. And right now we can’t let the present be the future. So you’ve got to make the change, or this becomes a body that doesn’t mutate.”

Reid’s thinking has also evolved. When Merkley, as a prospective candidate, first met with Reid ahead of the 2008 election, he told the leader that filibuster reform was one of his top priorities. Reid put his head in his hands, a Merkley aide recalled. “It’s not about the filibuster,” Reid admonished the younger man. “It’s about the culture. We’ve got to change the culture.”

Six years later, the culture is the same and the filibuster is gone.

Doctor Walker is ready for you.

Scott Walkers #1, #2, and #3 top concerns have always been the same: Scott Walker.

In elected office nearly his entire adult life, he has used each office he's held exclusively as a stepping stone to his next elected office. Well known for rewarding donors and continually inflicting as much damage as possible as possible on those he identifies as enemies, Walker has amassed a zealous following among the most ideological Republican voters by resorting to the most petty politics imaginable.

Sitting in the Wisconsin State Legislature, he leapt on the opportunity to become Milwaukee County Executive in a recall election (yes, you read that right) when residents of Milwaukee County became angry at a pension deal that mainly benefitted the County Exec and several long-serving members of the Board of Supervisors. RW hate radio and the Republican-loving Milwaukee corporate media fanned the flames and paved the way for Walker. The rest is history. Walker won the recall.

As Milwaukee County Executive, Walker began to travel the state (at county taxpayer expense, of course) to increase his name recognition. His next office, naturally, would be state-wide since he was already at the top of the heap in the Milwaukee area. He cut taxes for business, pummeled Milwaukee County labor unions, squeezed public services to near extinction, shifted money out of building maintenance, privatized as many jobs as he could (ultimately costing the county millions in lawsuits), was relentless in reducing social programs, and made use of his Milwaukee County staff and facilities for political purposes including the installation and use of a secret router and private email accounts to circumvent public records laws.

In short, he didn't manage his public duties as much as use elected office for politicking for his next job. Poor bashing, union bashing, and dog whistle blowing are very attractive to Republican voters and tossing in a blind hatred of taxes appeals to far too many independents and low information voters.

The governors seat was hardly even warm from the heat of his butt when he unveiled the most horrific legislation possible. Taking nearly a billion dollars out of public schools, slashing state shared revenue to local governments, virtually abolishing unions for every public employee in the entire state whose union didn't endorse him in the election, slashing programs for the disabled, extreme reductions in state public assistance and health programs along with, of course, massive tax reductions (to business) led tens of thousands of normally politically sleepy Wisconsinites to surround the State Capitol for weeks.

He knew something would happen so he made sure to activate the Wisconsin National Guard. His attempt to use them as his palace guard or goon squad fell flat due to the good leadership of the Guard. I doubt he imagined the full extent of public pushback at his extremism. No doubt he and his staff had to order super sized containers of Poop-B-Gone to get the stains out of their underwear that first week, but Walker just loved the attention of the media as could be seen at his 2-3 pressers he held every day.

He became a national Republican Super Star and loved every minute of it. I'm surprised he could control the drool of anticipation at his next political office. Forget running for Herb Kohls Senate seat; he was becoming popular enough to run for President! He knew exactly how to lure extremist Republican primary voters and doubled down on the crazy laws he signed into office no matter how many times the courts smacked down those laws as Unconstitutional.

Campaign donors loved him and funneled plenty of payola into his coffers to enable him to put out tons of ads during the protests to promote his ""concerns for the taxpayer"" and bash protesters. A hundred million dollars flowed into his hands through the end of the recall election and that doesn't even count the ads run by Koch-funded groups like Americans for (the Koch Brothers) Prosperity and similar astroturfs.

Republicans love Scott Walker."

The key to making the health care law work is enrolling young%2C health people

WASHINGTON — Millennials have provided invaluable political support to President Obama over the course of his presidency, voting for him by a roughly 2-to-1 margin in his two successful campaigns against Mitt Romney and John McCain.

But as Obama tries to climb out of a 2-month-long malaise that saw his popularity sink with the fumbled rollout of the federal health care exchange, the president appears to have nearly as much work to do with young people as he does with older Americans.

Forty-five percent of 18- to 29-year-old Americans say they approve of the way Obama is handling his job; 46% disapprove of his job performance, according to a year-end USA TODAY/Pew Research Center Poll. The president's approval rating with young Americans — which stood at 67% just ahead of his second inauguration less than a year ago — now mirrors the general population, according to the poll.

The USA TODAY/Pew sample is of only 229 young Americans -- a subset of 2,001 adults polled from Dec. 3-8 -- and has a margin of error of +/- 8 percentage points.

But the findings mirror other recent polling that suggests Obama has seen his approval rating slide with young Americans.

--Forty-nine percent of adults age 18-34 disapprove of the job Obama is doing as president, and 45% approve, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released last week.

--A Harvard Institute of Politics poll published earlier this month found that Obama's approval rating with 18- to 29-year-olds now stands at 41%, a dramatic 11-point drop from April. Fifty-four percent said they disapprove of the president's performance. That poll has a margin of error of +/- 2.1 percentage points.

--In a Quinnipiac University poll conducted from Dec. 3 to 9, 41% approve and 49% disapprove of his performance among the 18-to-29 age group.

In the USA TODAY/Pew poll, just 41% approve of his signature health care policy, while 54% disapprove. Overall, 40% of Americans approve and 55% disapprove of his health care policy, according to the poll.

The tough polling numbers with young Americans offer a snapshot of the road ahead for the Obama administration in repairing damage caused by the troubled rollout of Obamacare, which has even worn on some of the president's most ardent supporters.

The administration has dedicated much of the president's time and political capital toward making implementation of Obamacare a success after battling with early problems -- the glitch-riddled online exchange and the outrage that ensued when millions of Americans on the individual insurance market received cancellation notices because their policies didn't meet minimum benefit requirements set by the law.

Key to making the Affordable Care Act a success is enrolling plenty of young, healthy people whose participation will offset some higher risk and older uninsured Americans who are expected to flock to the exchanges.

Kyle Olberding, 23, an Army veteran who now works at a candy shop, said that he admires Obama for ending the war in Iraq and winding down the war in Afghanistan and credits the president for pursuing a diplomatic solution with Iran over its nuclear program.

But Olberding, of Wichita, Kan., said he is unhappy with the president's efforts on the economy, reducing the federal budget deficit and implementing the health care law. Olberding, who said he works full time but doesn't make much money, said he remains uncertain about whether he can afford health insurance and resents being required to purchase it.

""At this current point in my life, I have other things that need to be paid for and the extra cost is just not something I can afford right now,"" said Olberding, who said he hasn't yet explored the website or looked into the level of subsidy he might qualify for.

It's not the first time Obama has seen his approval rating plunge with Millennials, notes John Della Volpe, polling director at the Harvard Institute of Politics. Obama saw his approval rating drop with young Americans ahead of the 2010 midterm elections — in which Democrats lost control of the House — and again late in 2011 largely as a result of a then-stagnant economy. Each time he rebounded.

If Obama is going to have success rebounding again, it's essential he do a better job communicating with young Americans about the law, Della Volpe said.

Even among young poll respondents who say they approve of how Obama is handling his job, there has been a drop-off in the intensity of their backing of the president. Twenty-two percent said that they approve strongly of Obama's performance in the latest poll compared with 41% who said they approved strongly when they were surveyed in January.

""He has good intentions but the execution and communication of the health care law came through sloppily,"" said one poll respondent, Katrina Meyer, 29, of Indianapolis. ""It was a little bit wearing.""

Jonathan Scheidegger, 27, of Bethany, Okla., said he was optimistic when Obama was elected that he would get the economy on track and put a greater focus on the middle class than he felt George W. Bush did. While Scheidegger said Obama has done a better job than Bush, he said that the current president has failed to meet his expectations.

""There's just not a middle class anymore,"" said Scheidegger, a senior technical support specialist for a large company, who said he and his wife struggle to make ends meet despite both having good jobs. ""I'd like to see that my hard work pays off. I'd like to see some things from the president and Congress where it's not just the poor getting poorer and the rich getting richer."""

Dan Benishek, Kerry Bentivolio, Gary Miller, Mike Coffman, Tim Walberg, and Bill Young

Six of the most vulnerable Republicans:

Dan Benishek, Kerry Bentivolio, Gary Miller, Mike Coffman, Tim Walberg, and Bill Young

Last week, the progressive activist group MoveOn commissioned Democratic pollster Public Policy Polling to conduct surveys in two dozen individual House districts held by Republicans, in order to gauge how the ongoing federal government shutdown might affect the 2014 midterm elections. They released the data on Sunday, and they offer positive news for Democrats. (You can find a table summarizing the key findings below the fold.)

MoveOn selected an array of potentially vulnerable seats across the nation, but because not all of these races feature challengers as yet (though most do), they tested the incumbents against the proverbial ""generic Democrat."" Before even addressing any questions about the shutdown, 17 of these 24 Republicans trail their hypothetical opponents. (Two are tied.) These results appear closely correlated with job approval ratings, as all but two of these 17 congressmen sport negative scores—that is, more voters disapprove than approve of their performance in office.

PPP then asked a trio of questions to elicit voters' feelings about the GOP's attempts to derail the implementation of Obamacare by holding the federal budget and, potentially, the debt hostage:



Do you support or oppose Congress shutting down major activities of the federal government as a way to stop the health care law from being put into place? Do you support or oppose Congress holding back on increasing the nation’s borrowing limit, which could result in a default, as a way to stop the health care law from being put into place? Would you be less likely or more likely to support Congressman X if you knew he

voted to support shutting down major activities of the federal government as a way to stop the health care law from being put into place, or does it not make a difference?

In almost every district, respondents said they opposed both tactics on the budget and debt, and they also said they'd be less likely to vote for their congressman if he support a shutdown to block ""the health care law"" (i.e., the Affordable Care Act). PPP then asked a so-called ""informed ballot"" question, again pairing each incumbent against a generic Democrat. As you might expect, the messaging contained in the prior three questions helped move the needle against Republicans in almost every case, by an average of 3 net points."

Republican Ken Cuccinelli has garnered 45.5%. The Wenzel Strategies poll has proven an accurate measure of the final days of the campaign, with Cuccinelli losing by a much smaller margin than other polling firms predicted. RealClearPolitics’s average of various polls predicted a McAuliffe win by +6.7. The Washington Post’s final poll predicted a +12 McAuliffe win.

A new poll, provided exclusively to Breitbart News, finds the Virginia Governor’s race a virtual dead-heat, with Democrat Terry McAuliffe leading Republican Ken Cuccinelli 41%-40%. Libertarian Robert Sarvis garners 10% and 9% of likely voters who remain undecided. With less than two weeks to go, the race is a toss-up that will likely be decided by turnout, a critical factor in an off-year election.

The poll comes from Wenzel Strategies, which accurately predicted closing momentum for Sens. Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Deb Fischer, among others. The slight edge McAuliffe holds is due mostly to stronger support within his partisan base. 81% of Democrats support McAuliffe, against just 68% of Republicans who support Cuccinelli.

Cuccinelli’s support seems be building, however, as public attention moves away from the recent government shutdown to the failing implementation of ObamaCare. Cuccinelli was a leading national figure suing to overturn the health care law.

The closeness of the race is apparent in the millions spent by left-wing groups to support McAuliffe in the closing days. In addition, Hillary and Bill Clinton, close allies of McAuliffe, have made themselves permanent fixtures in the Commonwealth, campaigning on his behalf.

“There’s a reason the Clintons have been called in to spend a week campaigning for McAuliffe and that Bloomberg is pouring in millions with 2 weeks to go,” Brian Baker, President of Ending Spending Action Fund, which commissioned the poll, told Breitbart News. “Their internals must be showing what our poll indicates — that his unfavorables are high and they must try to suppress Cuccinelli turnout to prevail. All indications are that the numbers are closing, especially post shutdown. The focus will be where the undecideds go and what will Sarvis draw? With the race this close, the poll indicates a vote for Sarvis is a vote for McAuliffe.”

History also is on Cuccinelli’s side. Since the 1980s, the winner of the Virginia Governor’s race has always been from the opposite party of that occupying the White House."

Just a few months ago, the media thought the government shutdown would benefit Democrats in the 2014 midterms. Today the National Journal reports that a wave is building that will hand Republicans control of the United States Senate.

A third of America’s one-hundred U.S. Senators are up for re-election every two years. Of the 33 or 34 facing a 2014 election, the National Journal identifies 15 seats as vulnerable. Thirteen of those seats are held by Democrats. But of the 7 seats most likely to turn over, all 7 are held by Democrats. Republicans need only pick up 6 seats to win the chamber.

Unlike the shutdown, ObamaCare is almost certain to be the gift that keeps on giving to Republicans as the law rains hell on American voters. By the government’s own calculations, tens of millions more insurance cancellations are expected to hit next year. And if the Administration does get the website functional, that only means that Americans will discover the other bad news about lost doctors, premium increases, and sky-high deductibles.

The unprecedented — over 225 years — move by Senate Democrats to kill the filibuster for presidential appointees is also a sign that Democrats see the writing on the wall. With only a year of majority control left, and ObamaCare dying a death of a thousand cuts, the nuclear option was the only move Obama had left to secure some kind of legacy by packing the courts and various regulatory agencies.

In other news, talk of Democrats regaining control of the House was never a very real possibility and is now a distant memory.

The good news for Republicans is that with control of both chambers, they will have two years to show the American people that they are far from obstructionists and do-nothings. John Boehner’s House has passed a number of bills, but the media refuse to report that fact and Democrat Harry Reid refuses to even allow them to come up for a vote in the Senate.

With Reid out of the picture, Republicans can craft a real agenda with real alternatives to Obama’s relentless, failed statism.

If this opportunity is handled well (always a long shot with the GOP), it could help the party heading into 2016.

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — A majority of Americans now disapprove of the way President Obama is handling his job, while Americans' assessment of the way he is handling the economy has hit a nadir for his nearly 5-year-old presidency, according to a new Pew Research Center poll published Friday.

Forty-one percent of those polled approve of how he's handling his job, while 53% disapprove. That's a 14-point drop since December, according to Pew.

Obama's job ratings on the economy have been underwater for more than four years, but the current measure is the worst of his presidency — 31% approve of the way Obama is handling the economy, and 65% disapprove.

The Pew survey, which was conducted Oct. 30-Nov. 6, found that majorities disapprove of the way the president is handling five of six issues tested. Terrorism was the lone exception, with 51% approving of his performance, and 44% disapproving. But even on terrorism, his ratings are lower than they were earlier this year, according to the poll.

Obama's slump resembles the trajectory of George W. Bush, who saw approval of his job performance rating tumble 12 points, from 48% in December 2004 to 36% at the same point in his presidency, according to Pew.

Also notable was Obama's considerable slide in the poll among those who identify themselves as independents.

Only 32% of independents approve of his job performance, while 61% disapprove. In December, 53% approved and 39% disapproved.

Like Bush, Obama retains broad support among members of his own party, though the share of Democrats who give him a positive job rating has fallen 10 points over the past year, from 88% to 78%.

Obama's job rating among Republicans, extremely low last December at 12%, has changed little since then.

The president, who has been battling the fallout from problems with the rollout of his signature health care law, received negative ratings on health care policy, with 37% approving of his performance and 59% disapproving.

The poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, was completed before Obama apologized in an NBC News interview Thursday that some Americans are losing their health insurance plans as a result of the Affordable Care Act, despite his repeated assurances over the past four years that Americans could keep their plans if they like them.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/06/obamacare-virginia-governor_n_4229062.html,2013-11-06 00:00:00,"['Senior Political Correspondent', 'Yahoo']",Scant Evidence That Obamacare Actually Moved Numbers In Virginia Governor's Race,"WASHINGTON –- Two weeks before Virginia's gubernatorial election Tuesday, Republican candidate Ken Cuccinelli's pollster e-mailed his senior campaign advisers with the latest polling results. They weren't good.



""There is nothing in the data that suggests it's not all that bad,"" pollster Glen Bolger wrote. ""It's pretty bad.""



Cuccinelli was down 9 percentage-points among voters labeled ""10's"" by the campaign because they were considered most likely to vote, trailing Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe 38 percent to 47 percent. Cuccinelli was also down 33 percent to 44 percent among all the voters surveyed, with 10 percent for Libertarian candidate Robert Sarvis.



Public polling was about the same. The HuffPost Pollster average on Oct. 18 gave McAuliffe, a former Democratic National Committee chairman, an 8.5-point lead, 45.5 to 37 percent. Bolger informed the Cuccinelli brain trust that the numbers were terrible for a few reasons: ""We are being badly outspent, and the shutdown/end game has not been successful at revving up Republicans OR deflating Democrats.""



The claim by Bolger and by many Republicans now, in the wake of a much narrower than expected, 2.5-point McAuliffe win on Tuesday, is that the numbers closed in in the last two weeks as Cuccinelli honed in on Obamacare. He stressed his early opposition to the law in 2010 as attorney general, just as the law kicked in, suffering massive implementation problems.



The takeaway, then, for some, is that Obamacare became a millstone that almost dragged McAuliffe from a sure victory to an epic collapse.



""Despite being outspent by an unprecedented $15 million, this race came down to the wire because of Obamacare,"" Cuccinelli said in his concession speech Tuesday night.



The problem is, there's not much evidence for this.

Closer to Election Day, on Nov. 1, Cuccinelli campaign manager Chris LaCivita e-mailed supporters and claimed that among the ""10's,"" McAuliffe had just a 1-point lead. This wasn't from a poll done by the campaign, however. Bolger told HuffPost on Wednesday that the Oct. 18 poll was the last one the campaign conducted. ""Had no more money,"" he wrote in an e-mail. (LaCivita did not respond to an e-mail asking what he had based his Nov. 1 claim on.)



In addition, the public polling itself was not as volatile as people thought. In mid-July, McAuliffe began opening a lead, and the HuffPost/Pollster average of the public polling showed that advantage at around 5 points for most of August and September, and at 7 points in October, all the way up to Election Day. A cluster of polls showing McAuliffe up by double digits in mid- to late October, followed by two polls showing him up only four points and two points, respectively, created the impression of a tightening race.



Late last week, in a briefing with reporters, McAuliffe's pollster said that their internal polling had showed the race steady for a month.



""Our margin both in the head-to-head and in the three-way race are exactly what they were a month ago,"" Geoff Garin, the Democratic pollster, said. Garin didn't say then what the margin was, but in a phone conversation the same day he told HuffPost's Mark Blumenthal that it was 4 points. The day after the election, Garin said, ""Terry’s lead from mid-summer on was always in the 2-4 range.""



Voter modeling conducted for McAuliffe by a group of former Obama campaign analytics experts gave McAuliffe a 2-point lead. McAuliffe's team believes they drove up Cuccinelli's negatives over the summer with attack ads, and the race never moved from there. McAuliffe communications director Brennan Bilberry said Wednesday that the Cuccinelli number showing the Republican trailing by 11 in mid-October was ""lunacy.""



Here's why the Democrats might be right, and why the Republican theory that Obamacare gave Cuccinelli momentum may be wrong: the Democrats continue to hold a data advantage over Republicans. The quality of their voter information is better, but perhaps more importantly, there is a greater cultural willingness among Democratic pollsters and campaigns to do surveys and voter targeting based on enhanced voter files.

And so McAuliffe’s polling, predictive modeling and voter targeting was, quite likely, vastly superior to Cuccinelli's and to the public polling. If that is the case, it is a repeat of what happened in 2012, when Mitt Romney's pollsters, and the public pollsters, were outclassed by the Obama machine and its deadly combination of rigorous quantitative analysis and a vast army of ground volunteers vacuuming up large quantities of raw data and feeding it back to headquarters.



Because of the 2012 election and the massive amount of resources thrown into Virginia by President Obama's reelection campaign, the Democrats said they had better data on which to base their predictive models for who was going to vote, who they were going to vote for and who was open to being persuaded.



""We just have richer data. We've been collecting more data and we've been using the same file more consistently for the past few years,"" McAuliffe campaign manager Robby Mook said last week.



This data edge drove the McAuliffe campaign's decisions on how to conduct its polling, which then dictated the results it got. It also drove the campaign's decisions on how to allocate ground-game resources, and early voting effort, as well as TV ad strategy.



If Republicans had hard data showing them closing to within a point or two, wouldn't that have drawn money for more ads into the race in the last few days? The fact that this didn't happen suggests the GOP was flying blind in Virginia, and that they are still struggling to catch up to Democrats in the realm of data-driven campaigns.



Although Republicans have promised that they are going to leapfrog the Democrats in running data-centric campaigns, the bottom line is they are trying to make up ground that has been lost over several years, which will take time to rectify.



""The problem is not that this stuff takes a ton of money to figure out once you have the data. The problem is the gathering of the data is so fucking labor intensive and requires so much work,"" said one Republican operative. ""The richer the data you have, the better targeting you can do.""



That explains why the Republican National Committee dedicated its resources in Virginia to building out a ground operation. They spent $3 million on the race, but an RNC official acknowledged that their efforts were also “building the party’s presence in Virginia.”



“We went into this race working with the campaigns about what they needed to win based on their plans. We committed to funding/running the ground games and minority engagement –- that’s what we did,” the RNC official said.



The residue of the 2012 Obama campaign also helped McAuliffe with his ground game. The Democrat claimed to have 13,513 volunteers working for the campaign in the last four days, and said his campaign knocked on over 2 million doors and made 2 million phone calls. Cuccinelli said he doubted these numbers, but neither his campaign nor the RNC ever disclosed their own ground-game numbers, despite repeated requests before and after Election Day.

None of this is to say that Obamacare is not a political problem for Democrats, and could play a big role in the 2014 midterms.

“They have to get it fixed and they have to get it fixed fast,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Israel (D-N.Y.) told HuffPost’s Sam Stein.

But it’s not clear that in Virginia, Obamacare played the role some Republicans say it did.

A Once in a Generation Opportunity for the Democratic Party in Red States in 2014.,"First of all, look at this map.



It shows which states are participating in the Obamacare and which have opted out. The red and purple states aren't any surprise.

But I'll bet this will be:



But a poll conducted in March and April by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies found that 62 percent of the people in those states support the expansion, one of the key instruments in the Obama administration’s strategy to reduce the number of uninsured Americans.

This is a study conducted by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies that interviewed 2500 residents in the states of Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia and South Carolina - some the most ""southern"" and ""conservative"" states in the country.This is an opportunity for Democrats to get ahead on this issue in states where people will see changes in coverage and where the GOP will continue to try to blame Obama and the Democratic health reform initiative. Wefight back.

Bold Blue Media Alliance has formed a coalition with several other groups and individuals in these states, including some state-level and county-level Democratic officials. We are prepared to create 60-second and 30-second television, radio ads and internet videos for their use as well as print-ready materials - to help our party get the TRUTH out; that the GOP in these states hates Obama more than they care about health and the lives of their own constituents. They are sabotaging the health care law and costing people their lives. They are saboteurs and I call these states are Sabotage States.

We plan to create clear, targeted, easy-to-understand (and hard to refute) messages for each state with numbers and information people can actually relate to. We plan, as is our Mission at Bold Blue Media, to give Democrats and Progressives at the state and local levels the tools they need to fight back and win.

It's time to empower Team Blue no matter where they are in the country. I believe that the proper framing of this issue can aid 2014 party recruitment in these tough-to-win states and localities and that we can force an open debate about the real motivations of the Republican party in states where they have been blindly followed for too long. It's time for us to rally 'round our side in these tough states where they often feel all is futile.

Open enrollment for ACA starts in October. There are 21 states that will need this media. We'd like to have the videos and infographics available to them by late July. I need your help.

HOW CAN YOU HELP?

If you have any connection with your state or local Democratic party, particularly if you live in one of the Sabotage States, please message me here or email me at m.paige at bold blue media dot com.

ANOTHER WAY TO HELP:

Like this page, share it on twitter or facebook; Especially if you have friends or followers from Sabotage States. They need to know we're all fighting for their access to health care. That we are one in the fight to make it available to EVERY American and that we won't stop until they have the same access as those participating states.

ANOTHER WAY TO HELP:

You can help by subscribing to Bold Blue Magazine. No, seriously. I can't make all these videos and infographics on my own in time. I'm busy planning our Netroots Nation booth and creating the premier issue of Bold Blue Magazine. But I feel this issue is so important and that we have a limited window of time in which to act. Although I plan to do the groundwork on the videos by laying the basic structure for them, I'll need to engage our Alliance Team Network, many of whom are Kossacks, to help complete this monumental task in time by adding state-specific imagery and information to the media. We haven't enough revenue coming in yet for me to pay them properly at this time, but I have to offer them at least something. Your subscription would help me to that and help us meet the deadline.

I know many state and county parties, particularly in these red states, are strapped. I'm presently building a partnership with a major progressive organization here in DC. I'm hoping that by the end of July they can help facilitate fundraising for media buys and work with Sabotage State Democrats to educate, expose and put pressure on recalcitrant republican state legislators.

Subscribe here. It would help a lot. PLUS, hell. You'll get a GREAT magazine in the process! (I have to tell you, I'm putting together the premier issue and it's going to be amazing!). You can choose your subscription rate. If you manage $3/month, we'd love that. There are options all the way up to $100/month (for those of you who want to treat this more like state/local campaign support). There's even some special pricing that will disappear on June 1st so take advantage of it now, while you can.

This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make progress in tough states. Let's do it.

UPDATE: Iowa has decided to go WITH the expansion. 150,000 Iowans will benefit. Imagine that. This sh*t is not hard. Really. It's not.

Despite Maryland Democratic Gov. Martin O’Malley being among the first to embrace the Affordable Care Act and create an online exchange, the state-run site has had a disastrous start, like the federal exchange. This has left gubernatorial frontrunner and Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown, who helped lead the local ObamaCare launch, taking hits from fellow Democrats.

“It’s almost like a Saturday Night Live skit,” primary challenger and Attorney General Doug Gansler told reporters last week. “It’s comical that it’s not working. … It’s tragic for folks who don’t have access to health care.”

While the health care overhaul's launch has caused consternation for Democrats across the country, Maryland is the rare battlefield where the issue is creeping into a major party primary.

Gansler -- whose campaign had its own rocky start – trails Brown by double digits, according to the most recent poll, and has tried to pin the website problems on the lieutenant governor, Maryland’s second in command.

“Brown and others were so boastful about Maryland leading the country [but] here we are behind such states as Nevada and Kentucky, let alone California and states like that,” Gansler recently told Politico.

Fewer than 4,000 Marylanders enrolled in the first two months, well short of the goal of 25,500. Just 7,435 have signed up through the first three weeks of December, though O’Malley says the site problems essentially have been fixed.

Brown, as co-chairman of the Maryland Health Care Reform Coordinating Council, was the two-term governor’s point man on improving health care across the state.

And though Brown was not directly involved in building the site, Gansler has nevertheless blamed him for failed leadership and for being part of an administration that outsourced website work to North Dakota while Maryland has “literally the smartest people in the country.”

Meanwhile, Maryland Democratic Rep. John Delaney is suggesting Maryland scrap the site and send residents to the federal exchange.

Still, no matter how nasty the primary gets, the party certainly is favored to win the November election, considering only two Republicans have taken the governorship since the late 1960s. The Democratic primary is next June.

Though Gansler continues to hammers away at Brown and the rollout debacle, he faces criticism about using the situation to right his struggling campaign, in which he calls himself “an early and ardent supporter of President Obama’s health care reform law.”

His campaign problems began in August when an audiotape surfaced in which Gansler suggests Brown, who is black, was relying more on his race than his successes.

The incident was followed by revelations in October that Gansler forced his State Police detail to break traffic laws to get him to appointments and that he stopped by a summer beach bash attended by his son and fellow graduating seniors where underage drinking seemingly was taking place.

Gansler has never denied the allegations but has accused the Brown campaign of dirty tricks.

“[Gansler] made some stupid mistakes but he’s a good candidate,” Democratic strategist David Heller, president of Main Street Communications, told FoxNew.com on Tuesday. “He’s very smart and a great fundraiser. But Brown has the blessing of O’Malley and half of the state’s congressional delegation. It’s not a fair fight.”

To be sure, O’Malley has groomed Brown for years, giving him a lead role in health care reform and the successful effort this year to tighten statewide gun laws.

Brown indeed has endorsements from both Maryland senators, Barbara Mikulski and Ben Cardin, as well as from House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer and Reps. Elijah Cummings, Donna Edwards and John Sarbanes, all Democrats.

The most recent major poll, by Maryland-based Gonzales Research & Marketing Strategies Inc., was conducted in the first 13 days of October and had Gansler trailing by 20 points.

Gansler spokesman Bob Weelock told FoxNews.com on Tuesday he “couldn’t and wouldn’t” speculate on how the extended ObamaCare fallout and Gansler’s campaign tactics might impact voters."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/13/civil-war-buffs-why-media-love-john-boehners-outbursts/,2013-12-13 00:00:00,"['Howard Kurtz', 'Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst', 'The Host Of']",Civil War Buffs: Why the media love John Boehner’s outbursts,"The Huffington Post, which loves to taunt conservatives, must have enjoyed posting this lead headline: “BOEHNER RIPS RIGHT.”

Here we go again, with lefty pundits salivating over the prospect of a bloody Republican civil war. Not since the days of the government shutdown have liberals so relished the eye-gouging on the other side.

“Boehner is going all Howard Beale this week. Fun to watch,” tweeted the New Yorker’s Ryan Lizza.

But here’s the thing about the coverage of Boehner’s mad-as-hell moment: it’s undeniably fascinating. (And a heckuva lot more interesting than the details of a budget deal that leaves 90 percent of the sequester cuts intact.)

Boehner’s gamble paid off yesterday as the House approved the cobbled-together compromise on a big bipartisan vote, with 169 Republicans joining 163 Democrats in the yes column.

But the House speaker was at it again before the vote, pouncing on the conservative groups who have slammed the party’s budget deal with the Dems: “Frankly I think they're misleading their followers. I think they're pushing our members in places they don't want to be,"" he added. ""And frankly I just think they've lost all credibility.”

Frankly, this is too good to pass up, and not just because the Beltway loves a brawl. The Tea Party wing of his caucus has made Boehner look weak, and he has mostly suffered in silence until now. On Wednesday he called the opposition of such organizations as Heritage Action and the Club for Growth “ridiculous.”

Keep in mind that Boehner and Eric Cantor were opposed to the government-shutdown strategy pushed by the GOP’s Ted Cruz faction, and they were right that it a) didn’t work, and b) hurt the Republican Party.

You know it’s a serious split when Paul Ryan, the right’s darling in 2012, goes on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” to respond to criticism from fellow conservatives that he sold out in cutting the deal with Patty Murray. Ryan says the Republicans have to deal with the reality of divided government. The more purist wing says it’s a betrayal to play small ball when the GOP wants so much more (except that such a deal could never pass the Senate or be signed by President Obama).

Not that Democrats are thrilled with an agreement that fails to extend long-term unemployment benefits. Nancy Pelosi told her members in a closed-door meeting to “embrace the suck” and support the bill, according to Politico—truly one of the strangest rallying cries ever.

So civil war buffs aside, Boehner’s stance is actually big news that could affect GOP strategy in 2014 and beyond.

At Slate, John Dickerson underscores the importance of the speaker’s language:

“Boehner was not simply voicing an alternative policy position about the merits of the plan's spending reductions. He was making a claim about the low motives and trickery of the organizations that claim to represent the interests of grassroots conservatives…

“What GOP leaders are fighting against is the outsize expectations of the faithful who want policy victories that are impossible in a system of divided government. At times like this, pragmatic party leaders often tell their stalwarts not to let the perfect be the enemy of the good, but Boehner is saying more than that. He is calling out the arbiters of purity in his party, saying that while they use the language of policy and principle, they are merely doing so to advance their own narrow aims. They can never be satisfied because satisfaction doesn't bring in donations.

“Boehner is essentially calling them grassroots con men.”

National Review turns on the party’s former VP candidate:

“House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan has now accomplished the astonishing task of pushing House Republicans substantially to the left of the Senate GOP. His budget deal, announced Tuesday night, was achieved by shutting conservative Senate Republicans out of negotiations, by resorting to the old trick of spending now while claiming savings later, by ignoring a symbolically important budgetary red line, and by treating as Democratic “concessions” things to which even Democratic budgeteers already had agreed.

“The chess equivalent of Ryan’s deal would be trading a castle for a mere pawn. No wonder conservatives are feeling rooked…

“For the duration of the Obama presidency, the deficit would actually rise, with none of the net ‘savings’ occurring until at least 2017. Once again, Congress would play Wimpy to the taxpayers’ Popeye, promising to pay Tuesday for a hamburger today.”

The New Republic says the Republicans have gambled that the collapse of ObamaCare will carry them to victory next November—and are wrong:

“The Murray-Ryan deal isn’t really about the sequester. It’s a two-year truce on fiscal self-sabotage—and, more to the point, a bet on who benefits from such a truce.

“That is, Republicans believe the Obama administration (and really the entire Democratic Party) will collapse under the weight of its irredeemable health care law if we just get through the next two years without a political catastrophe like the recent government shutdown. Democrats believe the economy will pick up momentum and solve a lot of their political problems, not to mention a good chunk of the deficit, if we can just put an end to gratuitous spending cuts while the recovery is still fragile.

“So the question becomes: who got the better side of this bet? And that answer to that, I think, is Democrats.”

Or the budget deal could turn out to be a non-factor in the midterms. A more important factor is whether Boehner’s anger at his right flank will lead him to shift gears toward greater cooperation with the Democrats.

She Is Native Of Minnesota', 'Holds Degrees Boston College', 'Uc Berkeley S Graduate School Of Journalism.', 'Christi Parsons Was The Los Angeles Times', 'White House Correspondent']",Why can’t Obama run the government as smoothly as his campaign?,"WASHINGTON — A year after his reelection triumph, President Obama is facing an awkward question from friends and foes alike: Why can’t he run the government as well as he ran his campaign?

What with the IRS targeting of tea party groups; the poor security at the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya; the eavesdropping on close allies; and the botched rollout of the landmark healthcare law, Obama increasingly seems to be battling top-level management failures as much as policy or political problems.

On each of these controversies, Obama has claimed ignorance before the fact and outrage afterward, leaving even some Democrats to see him as asleep at the wheel.

“There’s a sort of distance in his style,” said Elaine C. Kamarck, who led the Clinton administration’s government reform effort and now is at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution. “On the one hand, he’s not getting into terrible details like [President] Carter did. But on the other hand, it comes back to bite him because he seems to not know a lot of stuff that’s going on.”

That perception is growing. In public opinion surveys, Obama’s job performance numbers have dropped sharply this year. One poll last week showed his approval down to 42%, a rate comparable to that of President George W. Bush after the horrors of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

PHOTOS: The battle over Obamacare

Although unpredictable crises often upend presidents’ second terms, some of Obama’s worst problems seem self-inflicted.

The iPad-toting president who promised high-tech efficiency in government — even appointing the first chief performance officer, chief technology officer and team of innovation fellows at the White House — has launched his only major domestic policy program with a website that almost feels like a clunky relic from the dial-up age.

“They had a tech-savvy campaign, but that has very little to do with running a tech-savvy government because the presidency really doesn’t run in a management way,” said William Daley, Obama’s chief of staff from January 2011 to January 2012.

“The one kind of surprising thing, since this was the signature” domestic program, Daley said, “and for four years everybody knew this was a complicated, difficult thing to do, that there wasn’t a heavier kind of skepticism around the process.... Can the federal government bite off such an enormous thing?”

The underlying premise of the Obama presidency was an affirmative answer to that question. As a candidate, he vowed to restore government competence to earn back trust, and to make a case for expanding the government’s role in people’s lives.

“We simply cannot afford to perpetuate a system in Washington where politicians and bureaucrats make decisions behind closed doors, with little accountability for the consequences … and where outdated technology and information systems undermine efficiency, threaten our security and fail to serve an engaged citizenry,” Obama said in 2009 as he named Jeffrey Zients, a former corporate chief executive, as chief performance officer, a new title that borrowed from corporate culture.

PHOTOS: 2013’s memorable political moments

If the name is familiar, that’s because Obama tapped Zients again last month, calling him in to consult on the effort to fix the healthcare.gov website.

But Obama did not sustain the zeal for good management, Kamarck said. Initiatives that leaned heavily on updating technology, consumer-friendly interaction and trimming inefficiencies rarely got top billing at the White House.

He hardly discussed his attempt to scale back outside contracting, for example, disappointing those who called for reform. His effort to reorganize Commerce Department agencies that deal with small business stalled when it met resistance in Congress.

In 2012, Zients was named acting chief of the Office of Management and Budget. His previous duties, ensuring the government was setting and achieving performance goals, were shifted to another official. When a new chief performance officer was nominated in September, the post was announced via a news release with a list of nominees.

Inconsistency at the top is part of the problem, said Bob Stone, project director of the Clinton-era government reform effort, which was led by then-Vice President Al Gore. Gore devoted time every day to the project and stayed in close contact with agency heads.

In one of those meetings, during the federal government shutdowns in the mid-1990s, Gore learned that the Justice Department had furloughed its procurement staff, leaving no one to order food at federal prisons. The problem was fixed on the spot, Stone said.

“It seems to be that this White House has no chain to the top, even just the conventional ‘protect the boss’ standard that ought to be in place everywhere,” Stone said. “When something is about to burst, you warn the boss. That’s both a management issue and a political issue.”

PHOTOS: Team Obama, where are they now?

He added, “It’s hard to see that the president has really had any interest in actually managing the government.”

White House spokesman Jay Carney on Friday disputed that claim.

When it comes to U.S. eavesdropping on friendly foreign leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Carney said, the president is a “deliberate consumer” of intelligence reports. But he said Obama was focused on security threats that “keep him up at night,” not a close ally’s phone calls.

On the healthcare rollout, Carney said, the president did not know the website wasn’t fully functional before it was launched Oct. 1.

“The president expects results,” Carney said. “That’s the way he manages this White House. That’s the way he manages this administration. He believes that smart people ought to bring all their talents to bear to solving problems, but he expects results.”

Some past presidents learned the hard way that the mundane work of management can prove crucial.

Bush’s popularity never recovered from his slow response to Katrina’s devastation on the Gulf Coast. Carter’s reelection in 1980 was doomed by his handling of the Iran hostage crisis, when militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held 52 American diplomats for 444 days.

“In both those cases, management issues became the point of no return,” Kamarck said.

USA TODAY

Both parties are likely to focus on health care in competitive Florida district

Long-serving GOP Rep. Bill Young died in November%3B election to replace him is in March

Health care ads have begun%2C even before GOP candidate has been chosen

WASHINGTON — A special election for a vacant House seat in Florida is shaping up as an early bellwether race that may indicate how President Obama's health care law is going to affect the 2014 elections.

The death in November of Rep. C.W. ""Bill"" Young, R-Fla., opened up his St. Petersburg-based seat in a district where he would probably have been safely re-elected. The race to replace him is drawing national interest as a test battle for the party's warring messages over the Affordable Care Act.

Obama won 50% in the swing district in 2012 and 51% in 2008, placing the seat squarely in the tossup category where either party stands a chance to win. David Wasserman, a non-partisan elections analyst for The Cook Political Report, said the seat is close to a ""dead even district"" in terms of competitiveness, but he gives a narrow edge to Democrats because they have lined up behind a well-known candidate, while Republicans face a primary of relative unknowns.

Republicans hope unease with the health care law and its troubled rollout will help them not only win the Young seat but maintain their majority in the House. Democrats defend the 2010 law as an imperfect but fixable benefit that will aid millions of Americans — and the party's uphill effort to win the majority.

Democrats cleared the field for Alex Sink, an unsuccessful 2010 candidate for governor and a former chief financial officer for Florida.

Sink supports the health care law, and Democrats say she is trusted by the district's voters — she won the district in her 2010 gubernatorial bid — to make it work. Sink is a candidate who has ""spent her entire career solving problems and demanding results,"" said Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y., who runs the House Democrats' campaign operation. ""While Republicans will continue to push a damaging agenda of showdowns, shutdowns and repeals, Alex will offer a common-sense, problem-solving approach that brings people together.""

Republicans — including Young's widow, Beverly — lined up early behind David Jolly, an attorney, lobbyist and former Young aide, but he faces a three-way primary Jan. 14 against state Rep. Kathleen Peters and retired Marine Mark Bircher. Whoever wins will make health care a key issue.

""(Sink) was an early and strong advocate for the president's health care law,"" Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., who runs the House GOP's campaign operation, said at a recent roundtable. ""She's going to be an owner of Obamacare.""

Even before the GOP candidate is chosen, the National Republican Congressional Committee kicked off its campaign against Sink last week with a Web ad criticizing her support of the law. ""Why would Alex Sink support a law that makes it harder for us in Florida to have health care?"" the ad says.

The district is heavily populated by senior citizens — more than a quarter are over 65 — so the Affordable Care Act does not affect many constituents directly because they are covered by Medicare. But seniors are particularly attuned to debates on the government's role in health care coverage. ""That adds to the prominence of health care in the race,"" Wasserman said.

The Cook Political Report warned recently that the ACA's affect on the Medicare Advantage program, which provides health insurance to millions of seniors and could face cuts in 2014 because of the new law, could add to the health care debate.

Florida also ranks as a state with one of the highest levels of uninsured Americans in the nation, so more people stand to benefit from the new law as well.

The timing of the election — three weeks before the March 31 deadline to sign up for coverage — further ensures that health care is going to be a central issue, and the outcome will be an indicator of the health care law's influence on the 2014 midterms.

At issue, said several Obama allies, is a loss of trust in the president after only 106,000 people — instead of an anticipated half million — were able to buy insurance coverage the first month of the new ""Obamacare"" web sites. In addition, some 4.2 million Americans received notices from insurers that policies Obama had promised they could keep were being canceled.

""Folks are now, I think in talking to members, more cautious with regard to dealing with the president,"" said Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the senior Democrat on the House Oversight Committee and one of the first leaders in his state to endorse Obama's presidential candidacy six year ago.

Cummings, the White House's biggest defender in a Republican-controlled committee whose agenda is waging war against the administration over Benghazi, the IRS scandal, a gun-tracking operation and now health care, said he still thinks Obama is operating with integrity. But he noted that not all his Democratic colleagues agree.

""They want to make sure that everything possible is being done to, number one, be transparent, (two) fix this website situation and, three, to restore trust,"" Cummings said.

Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-Mo., like Cummings, a prominent member of the Congressional Black Caucus who personally likes Obama, struggled to describe the state of play between congressional Democrats and the president.

""I am trying to think if you can call it a relationship at this point,"" he said.

Clay said the administration is now obligated to ""fix it, fix all of it"" after Obama apologized this month for both the insurance website problems and his earlier promises that people could keep their old polices. Otherwise, he said, ""a wide brush will be used to paint us all as incompetent and ineffective.""

Obama is now allowing insurance companies to reissue their canceled policies for another year. But ""Obamacare's"" problems have left Democrats vulnerable to an orchestrated assault by Republicans who six weeks ago were on the losing end of the government shutdown.

The political body language tells the story of the strain. Thirty-nine House Democrats in Obama's party defied the president's veto threat and voted for a GOP-sponsored bill to permit the sale of individual health coverage that falls short of requirements in the law.

""I think people want to have a little more transparency going forward with whoever is implementing the website and other elements,"" said Jeff Link, senior adviser to Iowa Rep. Bruce Braley, who is running for Senate and voted for both the original health care law and the GOP-sponsored House bill this month. ""If demanding that kind of transparency means lack of trust,"" he added delicately, ""then I think people probably would like to have had more transparency.""

Across the Capitol, several swing-state Senate Democrats have signed onto legislation to further weaken the health care law. Sponsored by Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu, who's facing a tough re-election challenge, the bill would require insurance companies to permanently continue selling policies that the law deems substandard. Landrieu herself skipped an event with Obama earlier this month when he appeared at the Port of New Orleans. She said she had a long-standing engagement elsewhere in the state, which Obama lost last year by 17 points.

Repairing the relationship between Obama and his allies may be as complex as fixing the website and health care law. Much rests on rebuilding trust with the public, a solid majority of which now opposes ""Obamacare,"" according to multiple polls. Both parties will be watching on Saturday to see whether the vast majority of those who try to sign up for policies on the website will succeed, as Obama has promised. Democrats have urged the administration to quit setting ""red lines"" like the Nov. 30 deadline, that carry the risk of being broken.

Nearly a year from the midterm election, Republicans in both chambers are launching a drive to link virtually every congressional Democrat to Obamacare. In the House, the effort, based around dozens of votes to repeal the law, is about denying Democrats the 17-seat gain they would need to win back the majority. In the Senate, it's about gaining the six seats Republicans need to take control of that chamber.

""So you're running on Obamacare,"" read a faux tip sheet from House Republicans to House Democrats that went out over the holiday week. ""The best thing to do,"" it advises Democratic lawmakers in 28 districts, ""is step in front of the cameras and explain to voters why government should run their health care.""

Senate Republicans, meanwhile, showed notable discipline last week when they complained loudly about the Democrats' new limits on filibusters — then pivoted in as little as one sentence back to ""Obamacare.""

The filibuster limits, said Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, can be chalked up to ""broken promises, double standards and raw power — the same playbook that got us Obamacare.""

Democratic leaders scoff at the notion that missed deadlines and other problems could threaten the party's prospects 11 months down the road. A similar budget-and-debt fight that sparked the shutdown and smacked Republicans last month looms early next year, they point out. There is time, they insist, for the law to begin working as intended and to help elevate the Democrats' political prospects.

""Yesterday's battles and today's battles and tomorrow's battles create different environments,"" said House Democratic campaign chief Steve Israel, D-N.Y. Independent voters, the keys to elections in the most competitive districts in the country, are pragmatic, he added. ""They want the Affordable Care Act not to be repealed, but to be fixed. They don't want to go back, they want to go forward."""

Jefferson expanded on that theme in a segment on ""All In With Chris Hayes"" Tuesday night, playing the part of a concerned citizen wondering how the white community is going to deal with the ""problems of white culture.""

""You probably haven't heard much about the white riot in Huntington Beach,"" Hayes began. ""That's because the story of white criminal culture is not a story the mainstream media will tell you. But once you scratch the surface, these stories are everywhere you look.""

Hayes and Jefferson engaged in a back-and-forth that parodied several tired tropes that surface when talking heads discuss race on TV.

""There are people that are going to tell you that ... this has nothing to do with white people, it's just a few bad apples. What do you say to that?"" Hayes asked.

""To that I say that if that's your actual belief then you're living with your head in the sand,"" Jefferson said. ""I used to live in New York City and would occassionally go to Hoboken, New Jersey's St. Patrick's Day parade, and there were so many young white men there vomiting in the streets, urinating in the streets, getting in fistfights in the streets. It was a sight to be seen.""

""Do you have a personal problem with white people?"" Hayes later asked. ""Is this animus?""

""No, I think any time that you tell the truth there's going to be those people who come out and think you're doing it for some insidious reason and say that you're a racist,"" Jefferson said. ""I knew that some white people were going to call this playing the race card, but it isn't playing the race card. My best friend is white.""

Jefferson's Gawker piece drew ire on social media, and not just from people who disagreed with his critique of how African Americans are portrayed in the news.

Just a few months ago, the media thought the government shutdown would benefit Democrats in the 2014 midterms. Today the National Journal reports that a wave is building that will hand Republicans control of the United States Senate.

A third of America’s one-hundred U.S. Senators are up for re-election every two years. Of the 33 or 34 facing a 2014 election, the National Journal identifies 15 seats as vulnerable. Thirteen of those seats are held by Democrats. But of the 7 seats most likely to turn over, all 7 are held by Democrats. Republicans need only pick up 6 seats to win the chamber.

Unlike the shutdown, ObamaCare is almost certain to be the gift that keeps on giving to Republicans as the law rains hell on American voters. By the government’s own calculations, tens of millions more insurance cancellations are expected to hit next year. And if the Administration does get the website functional, that only means that Americans will discover the other bad news about lost doctors, premium increases, and sky-high deductibles.

The unprecedented — over 225 years — move by Senate Democrats to kill the filibuster for presidential appointees is also a sign that Democrats see the writing on the wall. With only a year of majority control left, and ObamaCare dying a death of a thousand cuts, the nuclear option was the only move Obama had left to secure some kind of legacy by packing the courts and various regulatory agencies.

In other news, talk of Democrats regaining control of the House was never a very real possibility and is now a distant memory.

The good news for Republicans is that with control of both chambers, they will have two years to show the American people that they are far from obstructionists and do-nothings. John Boehner’s House has passed a number of bills, but the media refuse to report that fact and Democrat Harry Reid refuses to even allow them to come up for a vote in the Senate.

With Reid out of the picture, Republicans can craft a real agenda with real alternatives to Obama’s relentless, failed statism.

If this opportunity is handled well (always a long shot with the GOP), it could help the party heading into 2016.

And yet the forced birthers in America have spent the entire four decades since the Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision doing everything in their power to prevent women from having access to this legal medical procedure. Today's action by Michigan Republicans is one more cut in their ""death by a thousand cuts"" approach that has included terrorists activities such as bombing abortion clinics and murdering doctors who perform abortions.

It's worth noting that this new law does not just impact insurance provided by state or federal governments. It covers ALL insurance including private insurance. It begs a couple of questions: What are girls under the age of 26 who are their parents' health insurance supposed to do? Also, if you have health insurance through your employer, are you now required to inform them that you want this coverage? This would be a monstrous invasion of medical privacy.

None of this matters to the minority group of forced birthers who believe every pregnancy should end with the birth of a child even if it's the result of a rape or incest. Don't have the means to support a child but have an unplanned pregnancy and can't afford an abortion? That's tough. And you can sure the same legislators that voted for this egregious attack on women's reproductive rights will be there to cut your food stamps and other social safety net programs that will assist your child once it's born.

If a woman has a life-threatening problem with her pregnancy, the difficult choice to have an abortion will come with a doctor's bill to add one more level of pain to an otherwise painful situation, courtesy of Michigan Republicans.

The outrage over this new law is pouring in.

Democratic candidate for governor Mark Schauer:



This bill is a shameful attack on Michigan women. The fact is, this legislation will force Michigan women to pay more for health insurance and limit access to critical health care services for women who have been the victim of a crime. At a time when Michigan has the third worst unemployment rate in the nation, it’s clear that we need new leaders in Lansing who are focused on creating jobs instead of passing bills that hurt Michigan women and families.

Whether a planned pregnancy has gone horribly wrong and a woman needs a medically necessary D & C procedure, or the deplorable and devastating acts of rape or incest have resulted in an unwanted pregnancy, the Senate Republicans’ passage of this cold-hearted rape insurance proposal means Michigan women now have to anticipate the unimaginable and plan to have these unspeakable things happen to them. This is the height of hubris and paternalism that a room full of men have decided they are fit to dictate the terms of Michigan women’s health care, that they can make this decision recklessly without giving a moment’s consideration to the various personal circumstances we women face, and it is an appalling example of political pandering that the Michigan Legislature is bending to the whims of a single high-powered and extreme special interest.

To even claim that women will have the option of abortion insurance under this initiative is deceitful. Michigan is not the first state to take action on this issue; seven other states have already enacted this legislation. In five of these seven states, purchasing an abortion rider is not even an available option. In passing this initiative, we are allowing that 4% of Michigan’s people to dictate the health care options for 100% of Michigan women. For that reason, I firmly believe that this policy must be repealed as an insincere representation of the will of the people.

Even with their own governor being against it, Right to Life went ahead and gave 3 percent of the population the voice for 100 percent of women in Michigan. Legislative Republicans are once again catering to the whims of special interest groups, and the citizens suffer. Now, Michigan woman need to plan ahead for ‘rape insurance’ in case the absolute worst happens.

A woman’s health care decisions should be made by herself, her doctor and her family. Health care decisions are private matters, and special interest groups shouldn’t be allowed to collude with government to intrude upon them.

Republicans have been insisting that the government shouldn’t interfere with insurance company practices, but in this case, that’s exactly what they’re doing. It’s time for the so-called ‘party of small government’ to be exactly that. Republicans need to let the people have the final word on this terrible piece of legislation.

Today it’s official: Michigan Republicans truly view women as second-class citizens.

The present outrage becomes our complete obsession; the countless frustrations that telegraphed it fade from view. So it is with the shutdown of the federal government, which we could and should have seen coming. Which we did see coming, more or less.

The shutdown isn’t a new story. It’s the same story as the demise of sensible gun control legislation, even after Newtown, which was supposed to change everything. It’s the same story as the stalling of immigration reform. It’s all one cancer, sprouting tumors of various sizes. The mass we’ve been staring at over the past week just happens to be bigger and uglier than the ones we beheld in the buildup.

Our federal government doesn’t work, at least not the Congress, not the way it should if we’re going to preserve and pass on the treasure and blessings that were bequeathed to us, not the way it should if we’re going to strut around ceaselessly congratulating ourselves on how exceptional we are. We’re exceptional all right, in that we can’t summon the will, discipline or character to fix even those problems that most of us would like to see addressed. How many Americans doubt that our infrastructure is inadequate and leaves us at a serious global disadvantage? Few, but for all our hand-wringing, little gets done.

We’re exceptional in the billions of dollars that we pour into elections. All those commercials, air miles, speechifying and tweeting — and for what? We’ve spent a fortune on sclerosis, a king’s ransom on dysfunction. Then again, the money is a big part of the problem. In America your hobbyhorse can be a lonely, mangy one. Finance it generously enough and it has Secretariat’s stride."

http://news.yahoo.com/promises-promises-obama-curbs-ambition-time-075112535--politics.html,,[],"PROMISES, PROMISES: Obama curbs ambition this time","WASHINGTON (AP) — Despite a relentless workload ahead, President Barack Obama is lighter on his feet in one sense as he opens his second term. Gone are the hundreds of promises of the past. He's toting carry-ons instead of heavy cargo this time.

Obama's first presidential campaign and the years that followed were distinguished by an overflowing ambition, converted into a checklist of things he swore to do. The list was striking not only for its length but its breadth, ranging from tidbits in forgotten corners of public policy to grand — even grandiose — pronouncements worthy of Moses.

He made a sweeping vow to calm the rise of the seas. And a literally down-in-the-weeds pledge to aid the sage grouse and its grassy habitat.

Obama worked his way through that stockpile, breaking dozens of his promises along the way and keeping many more of them.

Thanks to the messy business of governing, the president's record on promises is not cut and dried. Some of his most notable flops, for example, contained seeds of future success.

Failing to achieve a promised first-term overhaul of immigration law, Obama took stopgap executive action to help as many as 1.7 million younger illegal immigrants stay in the country for up to two years. Now, after an election marked by Hispanic clout, he finds the political landscape more amenable to trying again.

Climate change legislation was another prominent broken pledge, but he came at the issue piecemeal, imposing the first regulations on heat-trapping gases blamed for global warming, setting tough controls on coal-fired power plants and greatly increasing fuel efficiency for cars and trucks.

Likewise, not all of his successes are all they were cracked up to be.

Yes, he achieved the transformational health care law, putting the U.S. on a path to universal coverage. But it remains in question whether costs will come under control as he said they would — and as the name of the Affordable Care Act implies. Obama swore a typical family's premium would drop by up to $2,500 a year by the end of his first term, but they've continued to rise. That's a broken promise tucked inside a kept one.

Story continues

Yes, Obama is extricating the U.S. from wars as he promised before and after he became president, but what instabilities does he leave behind? And how many troops? His vow that, in 2014, ""our longest war will be over"" is on track to be true in the main, yet thousands of troops might stay indefinitely in Afghanistan as a residual force once the bulk of the 66,000 now there are gone.

His promise to raise taxes on the rich finally came to be at the bitter end of the last Congress, during the debate to avoid going off the ""fiscal cliff"" of severe spending cuts and steep tax increases that would have started automatically absent an agreement. He also made good on his vow to hold rates steady for everyone else. (The fine print: Households making $250,000 to $400,000 are off the hook from the higher rates. Obama had said he'd tax them more, too.)

As for falling sensationally short, the bitterness in Congress on display in that debate, and so many others, was to be swept away as part of the change Obama promised to bring to Washington's ways and manners. Candidate Obama vowed to turn the page from ""ugly partisanship,"" only to concede that such a transformation was beyond his reach because ""you can't change Washington from the inside. You can only change it from the outside.""

If Obama can't be held responsible for cantankerous lawmakers, though, it's worth remembering that not all of the change he promised to bring to governance was centered on Congress. He also vowed to restrain the power of Washington's special interests by barring lobbyists from serving in his administration, only to backtrack by issuing waivers and other exceptions to those new rules. That was strictly an ""inside"" job.

On another key promise, deficits have shot up, not dropped by half as he pledged in his 2008 campaign and again as president when the recession was raging. That inherited recession, the halting recovery and his heavy spending to spur growth yielded four straight years of trillion-dollar deficits.

Ahead? A far leaner list, but still a tough one to achieve.

In the 2012 campaign, Obama counted ""comprehensive immigration reform"" as the first thing he would do this year after the fiscal-cliff deal. Dormant for years, gun control is back as an issue because of the deadly rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary and took top priority outside fiscal matters. But a push on immigration is coming.

Among other promises from the campaign:

—Make higher education affordable for everyone. Obama said he'll ensure by the end of the decade that the U.S. has more people with college degrees than any other country, recruit 100,000 math and science teachers in 10 years, help 2 million workers attend community college and seek to restrain the growth in college tuition by half over 10 years.

—Put government on a path to cutting deficits by $4 trillion over 10 years. That's off to a rocky start. The fiscal-cliff deal represented a failure to settle on a plan to reduce the national debt, instead increasing both spending and taxes while putting off decisions on the big budget cuts that will be essential to bringing down trillion-dollar deficits.

—Cut imports of foreign oil by half by 2020. Once a pipe dream of a succession of presidents, a path toward energy self-sufficiency has become more conceivable thanks to a boom in domestic production.

—End subsidies to the oil industry. A failed promise from the first term, it's given low odds of succeeding this time.

—Prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Obama has left open the possibility of military action if that's what it takes to stop Iranian nuclear development. Meantime, he's imposed stiff economic penalties on Iran to persuade it to cease uranium enrichment activity, so far without apparent success.

—""Continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet — because climate change is not a hoax."" When Obama secured the primary victories needed for the 2008 Democratic nomination, he pledged that future generations would look back on that very night as ""the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal."" At the heart of that was a pledge for strong action on climate change in his first term.

But legislation to cap emissions failed, without Obama leading a charge to pass it, and he all but stopped talking about the issue afterward.

Still, his administration began treating carbon dioxide as a pollutant under the law and steered billions of dollars into cleaner energy. The initiative could be revived in his new term, as an ""obligation to ourselves and to future generations,"" as he now puts it.

—Help factories double their exports, creating 1 million manufacturing jobs. It's a tall order because manufacturing jobs have been declining steadily for nearly two decades.

—Consolidate a ""whole bunch"" of federal agencies dealing with business issues into one new department led by a secretary of business.

Altogether, it's a more restrained to-do list than Obama produced for his first four years, when PolitiFact.com counted more than 500 Obama promises and found that 47 percent were kept, 23 percent broken and 25 percent ended in a compromise, with a smattering still in the works or stalled.

The sage grouse lucked out, gaining a Sage Grouse Initiative to give the species more grass cover for nesting. As promised.

An analysis by The New York Times shows the cost of premiums for people who just miss qualifying for subsidies varies widely across the country and rises rapidly for people in their 50s and 60s. In some places, prices can quickly approach 20 percent of a person’s income. Experts consider health insurance unaffordable once it exceeds 10 percent of annual income. By that measure, a 50-year-old making $50,000 a year, or just above the qualifying limit for assistance, would find the cheapest available plan to be unaffordable in more than 170 counties around the country, ranging from Anchorage to Jackson, Miss.

(CNN) —

Justice Anthony Kennedy was among the first of his colleagues to arrive Wednesday at the U.S. Supreme Court. His chambers lit up several hours before the last-day release of monumental rulings on same-sex marriage.

There was little doubt that later that morning, this quietly powerful justice would be having a major say in the legal, political, and social path of gay rights moving forward.

And at precisely 10 a.m., Kennedy kicked off the public session with his eloquent majority ruling striking down a key part of a federal law that blocks a range of benefits for legally married gay and lesbian couples.

The Defense of Marriage Act “humiliates tens of thousands of children now being raised by same-sex couples,” he said. “The law in question makes it even more difficult for the children to understand the integrity and closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in their community and in their daily lives.”

What’s next for gay rights movement?

It was vintage Kennedy – a mix of sweeping rhetoric mixed with practical legal and social considerations.

“If Bill Clinton was ‘the first black president,’ Anthony Kennedy has now firmly secured his place in history as ‘the first gay justice,’” said Michael Dorf, a law professor at Cornell University and a former Kennedy law clerk. “Justice Kennedy makes clear that he not only accepts, but welcomes the task of writing majestic opinions affirming the dignity of gay persons and couples.”

By the Numbers: Same-sex marriage

Kennedy, a moderate-conservative, is in many ways the “power broker” on the court. He shared the role of a “swing vote” with fellow centrist Sandra Day O’Connor before she retired seven years ago.

“The basic principle is, it’s Justice Kennedy’s world and you just live in it,” said Thomas Goldstein, a private attorney who publishes the well-read SCOTUSblog.com. “Justice O’Connor, having been the most powerful woman in the world, handed the keys to him on her way out the door and said, ‘Have fun.’ And he took up that invitation.”

The thinking goes that with four solid conservatives aligned on the right and four liberals on the left, Kennedy is the man in the middle, often able to cast the deciding vote in contentious cases, assuring his views of the law prevail.

Kennedy has crafted a powerful, if hard to define, judicial legacy – seemingly in the forefront of every major ruling during his tenure. As an unapologetic “swing” vote, he was the key behind-the-scenes architect of the 2000 Bush v. Gore drama, and a 1992 opinion upholding abortion rights. He has written majority decisions upholding rights to homosexual couples, underage killers, and foreign fighters held by the U.S. military in the war on terror.

That was true this past term in several other hot-button cases in which he played a key role by:

• Writing the majority opinion allowing for the continued but limited use of race in the college admissions process, yet making it harder for institutions to use such policies to achieve diversity.

• Siding with his fellow conservatives to strike down a key section of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, weakening federal oversight of states and counties with a past history of discrimination of minority voters at the polls.

• Concluding criminal suspects can be subjected to a police DNA test after arrest but before trial and conviction.

• Blocking a lawsuit by privacy advocates challenging the federal government’s sweeping electronic eavesdropping on suspected foreign terrorists and spies.

Kennedy was in the majority 91% of the time in the court’s 78 argued cases this term, more than any justice. In divided cases – where there was no unanimity – he was on the winning side 83%, again tops on the court.

Sometimes he sides with his more liberal colleagues, as he did in the Defense of Marriage Act case, but he is mostly a reliable conservative vote, especially on business and regulation disputes.

That unpredictability has long made liberals and conservatives equally nervous, but many on the right are more outspoken in their disappointment in the Ronald Reagan nominee, who turns 77 in July.

“Kennedy’s style as the ‘man in the middle’ is often as a ‘justice in a muddle,’” said Douglas Kmiec, a law professor at Pepperdine University and a former lawyer in the Reagan and Bush administrations. “He writes cryptically … suggesting a standard of his own making that is not fully developed.”

Despite the rhetoric, Kennedy’s moderating force has generally benefited his conservative colleagues.

Of the 23 divided 5-4 cases this term – including the two marriage cases as well as voting rights – Kennedy was in the majority 20 times, according to SCOTUSblog.com, again higher than anyone on the nine-member bench. Only on six decisions did he side with the four left-leaning justices: Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan.

But it was his majority opinion in the DOMA case that could have ripple effects for years to come.

“Although Justice Kennedy’s opinion explicitly states that it is confined to same-sex marriages that have been recognized by states, it contains reasoning and language that will certainly be used, in later cases, to argue that legal recognition of same-sex marriage by all states is constitutionally required,” said University of Notre Dame law professor Richard W. Garnett, a past clerk to former Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. “Almost certainly, and fairly soon, that argument will be presented squarely to the court.”

What about us, ask other gay couples

Within the marbled halls of the high court, Kennedy is personally respected by his colleagues, both for the power he wields and for his courtly, low-key manner.

But professionally, justices on the losing side of a big case can often be unsparing in their criticism of Kennedy and his legal reasoning.

Justice Antonin Scalia on Wednesday called Kennedy’s analysis in the DOMA case “jaw dropping” and an assertion of “judicial supremacy” that “envisions the Supreme Court standing (or rather enthroned) at the apex of government.”

And this from a close friend – Scalia and Kennedy joined the court a year apart, were born the same year, and live on the same street.

The Sacramento, California, native joined the high court in 1988, the third choice of President Reagan after more conservative nominees Robert Bork and Douglas Ginsburg flamed out.

And along with O’Connor for almost two decades, the two native Westerners carved out a jumpy place in the center. Less driven by practical concerns than O’Connor was, Kennedy has striven for a loftier sense of the law’s impact on society.

“He has brought to the bench a combination of a very scholarly, erudite, academic bent,” said Brad Berenson, a friend and former law clerk to Kennedy, “and a very practical bent he had developed while practicing law on his own.”

Kennedy himself acknowledged the unique role he played for decades on the court. “There is a loneliness” to his job, he once told CNN.

For now, Kennedy, like his eight colleagues, will retreat from the public spotlight. He has some vacation time ahead, mixed with his annual overseas teaching gig in Austria in two weeks.

Then, come the first Monday October, Kennedy is expected back in his familiar seat, just to the left of Chief Justice John Roberts on the bench. But clearly he is the man in the middle, and the man that in many ways shapes the direction of a divided court."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/03/20/Ann-Curry-Ambush-Kirk-Cameron,2012-03-20 00:00:00,['John Nolte'],NBC's Curry Attacks Kirk Cameron's Religious Beliefs,"Shorter Ann Curry: Your religious beliefs represent hate speech!

Make no mistake about it, this is all about going after the Christian Church. Same-sex marriage, GLAAD’s fascist rampages, and all of this Orwellian political correctness is part of a long-term goal: to make Christian beliefs a form of bigotry and to force a left-wing agenda on the church–all under a Trojan horse labeled “discrimination.”

In many respects, Obama forcing the Catholic Church to violate its conscience with respect to providing birth control and abortion drugs through their social service institutions is a dry run for this. The left wants to know if they can persuade the American people that a non-existent right (in this case, free birth control) trumps a First Amendment that declaratively restricts the government from impeding the free exercise of religion.

The obvious next step will be to attempt an end-run around the First Amendmen, by declaring as bigoted the Church’s refusal to marry same-sex couples. They will also attempt to declare as hate speech any belief held by the church that in any way angers GLAAD.

What Ann Curry did to Kirk Cameron this morning is the first phase of that war: The shaming campaign. On national television, she brought the actor on to declare that his religious belief’s “hate speech” will encourage others to “mistreat gay people.”

We all know what the next step is, and that’s the outlawing of these opinions under the principle that the speaking of such things will cause harm to others.

This, of course, would mean the end of the church — which is the whole idea.

Newsbusters:

Leading off an interview with conservative Christian actor Kirk Cameron on Tuesday’s NBC Today, co-host Ann Curry immediately attacked him for recent comments he made to CNN’s Piers Morgan: “I’m going to ask you about this firestorm that you set off…on the topic of gay marriage….Many people are suggesting that this is hate speech. Are you encouraging people to feel hate towards gay people?” [Listen to the audio or watch the video after the jump] Curry plucked out a single sentence from Cameron’s CNN interview: “…you said, quote, ‘I think that it’s unnatural. I think that it’s detrimental and ultimately destructive to so many of the foundations of civilization.'” Cameron called out her selective framing of the topic: “I love all people. I hate no one. And, you know, when you take a subject and you reduce it to something like a four-second sound bite, and a check mark on a ballot, I think that that’s inappropriate and insensitive.” Even after Cameron explained that the “edited down” quote “certainly didn’t reflect my full heart on the matter,” Curry still asserted he was encouraging hate: “Do you feel any responsibility saying words like that, that might encourage people to feel that it’s okay to treat – mistreat gay people?” Cameron pushed back and cited Morgan’s blatant bias on the issue: “Nobody should mistreat anybody….what I think this reveals is that – the interviewer that asked me these questions even used the words with me, “I think your views are destructive” – so what that shows me is that all of us who really think deeply about social issues, like gay marriage, and abortion, and homosexuality, have convictions on issues.”

Ann Curry and Leftists like her don’t give a damn about gays. If they did, you would see the same amount of hostility directed towards Muslims."
http://news.yahoo.com/nj-governor-sign-ban-gay-conversion-therapy-104716697.html,,[],NJ governor to sign ban on gay conversion therapy,"TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — Gov. Chris Christie plans to sign a bill Monday barring licensed therapists from trying to turn gay teenagers straight, making New Jersey the second state to ban so-called conversion therapy, along with California.

The bill passed both houses of the New Jersey Legislature with bipartisan support in June. Assemblyman Tim Eustace, who sponsored the bill and is openly gay, described the therapy as ""an insidious form of child abuse.""

In a signing note accompanying the bill that will be made public Monday, Christie said he believes people are born gay and that homosexuality is not a sin. That view is inconsistent with his Catholic faith, which teaches that homosexual acts are sins.

The Republican governor also said the health risks of trying to change a child's sexual orientation, as identified by the American Psychological Association, outweigh concerns over the government setting limits on parental choice.

""Government should tread carefully into this area,"" he said in the signing note, which was obtained by The Associated Press, ""and I do so here reluctantly.""

""However, I also believe that on the issues of medical treatment for children we must look to experts in the field to determine the relative risks and rewards,"" Christie said, citing a litany of potential ill effects of trying to change sexual orientation, including depression and suicide. ""I believe that exposing children to these health risks without clear evidence of benefits that outweigh these serious risks is not appropriate.""

Gay rights activists applauded the ban but pushed for more.

""It is our truest hope that the governor will realize, as the majority of the legislature and a super-majority of the pubic have realized, that the best way to ensure lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender youth are protected from the abuse of being ostracized is to provide them with equality,"" Troy Stevenson, executive director of the state's largest gay rights group, Garden State Equality, said in a statement.

Story continues

Christie previously vetoed gay marriage legislation. He has said he supports the state's civil union law, which was enacted to give gay couples the benefits of marriage but not the title. Gay couples have since sued, claiming that the law provides unequal treatment to same-sex couples. Their lawyers say the U.S. Supreme Court ruling granting federal benefits to gay married couples strengthens their case in state court, while Christie administration lawyers say the federal government should recognize the state's civil union law as the equivalent to marriage. A trial court decision is expected next month.

Gay rights groups say the practice of conversion therapy is damaging to young people because it tells them that it's not acceptable to be whoever they are.

Some social conservatives framed the debate as a parental rights issue, saying a ban on the counseling would limit the ability of parents to do what they think is best for their children.

The idea of conversion therapy is an old one that has increasingly drawn criticism for its methods. Last year, four gay men sued a Jersey City group for fraud, saying its program included making them strip naked and attack effigies of their mothers with baseball bats.

Lawmakers heard horror stories from some during hearings on the ban, including Brielle Goldani of Toms River, who testified she underwent electric shocks and was given drugs to induce vomiting after being sent to an Ohio camp at age 14 to become straight.

But, they also heard from Tara King, a Brick-based counselor, who said she should be allowed to ""fix"" what patients, even under-aged clients, want fixed."
http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/06/20/cnn-poll-judging-the-supreme-court/,2013-06-20 00:00:00,"['Tampa Tim', 'Rudy Nyc', 'The', 'Compassionate', 'Gop Solution', 'Posted By']",CNN Poll: Judging the Supreme Court,"8 years ago

Washington (CNN) - As the Supreme Court gets ready to issue opinions on some high profile and contentious cases, a new national poll indicates Americans are split on whether the high court is doing a good job.

According to a CNN/ORC International survey released Thursday morning, 48% of the public say they approve of the job the Supreme Court's doing, with an equal amount saying they disapprove.



There is, however, an ideological divide. Fifty-three percent of liberals and 58% of moderates, but only 37% of conservatives, say that they approve of the court.

""That's probably a reaction to last year's decision on Barack Obama's health care law,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.

In a closely watched ruling, the court upheld the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, last June.

""Before that ruling, most conservatives supported the Supreme Court, compared to only 44% of liberals. Now, most liberals approve of the court, with most conservatives saying they disapprove,"" adds Holland.

All that may change over the next week as the Supreme Court releases opinions on affirmative action, same-sex marriage, and the Voting Rights Act, cases that are sure to generate fresh controversy.

The case involving affirmative action is Fisher v. the University of Texas at Austin. Abigail Fisher individually sued the flagship state university after her college application was rejected in 2008 when she was a high school senior in Sugar Land, Texas. Fisher claims she was turned away in part because she is white, despite being more qualified than some minority applicants. The school defends its policy of considering race as one of many factors, such as test scores, community service, leadership and work experience, to ensure a diverse campus.

According to the poll, nearly seven in ten disapprove of affirmative action admissions programs at colleges and law schools that give racial preferences to minority applicants, with 29% saying they disagree.

There's an obvious partisan divide, with 49% of Democrats, 24% of independents, and just 14% of Republicans approving of such affirmative action programs. And there's a racial gap, with 51% of non-white respondents but just 19% of white respondents saying they approve of giving preferences to minority applicants.

Also in front of the Supreme Court is the Voting Rights Act, which was passed in 1965 to prevent some state and local governments from using rules and procedures which prevented many black Americans from voting. The key enforcement provision of the measure was reauthorized in 2006 for another 25 years, with all or parts of 16 states covered under the ""pre-clearance"" provision.

A county in Alabama subsequently filed suit, saying the federal monitoring of their election procedures was overly burdensome and unwarranted. The case before the high court is called Shelby County, Alabama v. Holder.

.

The survey indicates the public is evenly divided over whether the Voting Rights Act is still necessary, with 48% saying yes and 50% saying no. There's a slight racial gap and a larger partisan divide.

There are two same-sex marriage cases in front of the Supreme Court.

At issue in Hollingsworth v. Perry is whether the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment guarantee of ""equal protection"" prevents states from defining marriage as being only between one man and one woman. The case involves California's Proposition 8, a statewide ballot measure that banned same-sex marriages in the Golden State, which California's Supreme Court had previously ruled were legal.

According to the poll, 55% of Americans support same-sex marriage, with 44% opposed. The 55% support is up 11 percentage points from 2008.

""In the 1970s, when polls first tackled this touchy topic, a majority of Americans believed that homosexual relationships between consenting adults were morally wrong, a belief that persisted into the 1990s and the first few years of the 21st century,"" says Holland. ""But three years ago, the number who felt that homosexual relationships were morally wrong began to drop below 50%, and currently 54% of the public says that homosexual relationships are not a moral issue. Not surprisingly, that shift in opinion coincided with a growth in support for same-sex marriage.""

The other case is Windsor v. U.S.. At issue is whether the federal Defense of Marriage Act violates equal protection guarantees in the Fifth Amendment's due process clause as applied to same-sex couples legally married under the laws of their states.

The case involves Edith ""Edie"" Windsor, who was forced to assume an estate tax bill much larger than those other married couples would have to pay. Because her partner was a woman, the federal government did not recognize the same-sex marriage legally, even though their home state of New York did. The law known as DOMA defines marriage for federal purposes as a union between a man and woman only.

The legal issue is whether the federal government can deny tax, health and pension benefits to same-sex couples in states where they can legally marry.

According to the poll, 60% say the federal government should recognize same-sex marriages performed in states that allow them, with 39% saying they disagree.

The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International June 11-13, with 1,014 adults nationwide questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points."

The easy-to-miss language was part of Obama's package of executive actions and legislative proposals that includes a new assault-weapons ban and universal background checks. The provision on doctors, though, has begun to generate just as much controversy.

""The idea that your doctor would ask you if you have firearms in your house as part of an examination of your health is repugnant,"" National Rifle Association President David Keene told Fox News on Thursday, accusing the administration of trying to ""demonize firearms"" by implying that owning them is a ""health problem.""

One of the 23 executive actions Obama approved Wednesday was to ""clarify"" that the federal health care overhaul ""does not prohibit doctors asking their patients about gun in their homes.""

An overview of the plan said ""we should never ask doctors and other health care providers to turn a blind eye to the risks posed by guns in the wrong hands.""

Coupled with the language on asking patients about guns was a decision to ""clarify"" that no federal law prevents doctors from warning law enforcement about ""direct and credible threats of violence.""

The latter provision is actually in line with the policy of most states. All but a few allow mental health professionals to report information about patients they believe may become violent. Of them, most have laws requiring that information to be disclosed -- New York was one of the latest to update its law to mandate that doctors report when patients might pose a danger.

Conservative columnist and Fox News contributor Charles Krauthammer, who is a psychiatrist, said this language from Obama ""doesn't change anything at all"" -- he tried to assuage any concern about the provision.

But the line that appeared to encourage doctors to ask about guns in the home is what drew the ire of pro-gun rights lawmakers on Capitol Hill. They voiced concern that this could lead to doctors asking inappropriate and probing questions of their patients.

""President Obama has no business interjecting himself in the doctor-patient relationship by pressuring medical professionals to ask their patients what kind of guns they own in their homes. President Obama's latest executive orders give new meaning to the term 'house call,'"" Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., chairman of the Republican Study Committee, said in a statement.

Rep. John Fleming, R-La., himself a physician, accused Obama of ""pushing the government further into the exam room.""

""He's trying to press doctors into government service by pushing them to ask patients, even child patients, if there are guns in their home. After more than thirty years of operating a family practice, I can tell you it should not be the business of a family physician to take inventory of the guns in a patient's home,"" he said, noting that there are already laws ensuring that doctors warn authorities about criminal activity.

Still, despite Republicans' objections, the American Psychiatric Association has actually pushed for such a clarification from the administration.

""We are glad that the president has clarified that doctors are not prohibited from asking their patients about guns in their homes,"" the group said.

Howard Zonana, a professor in the Yale Department of Psychiatry, said that while it may be controversial for doctors in other fields to ask about firearms, it's virtually standard practice among psychiatrists.

""That is part and parcel of any suicide risk assessment,"" he told FoxNews.com. ""That's standard psychiatric practice and negligent if you don't do it.""

In most cases, he said, the psychiatrist would, if a patient acknowledges owning a gun, talk to that patient about it first. But, he said, if a patient is considered suicidal and not doing anything about his or her guns, ""my threshold for having them hospitalized is going to be lower.""

The administration argues that doctors ""need to be able to ask about firearms"" and how those firearms are stored, ""especially if their patients show signs of certain mental illnesses"" -- or if there's a young child or mentally ill family member at home.

Even Fleming acknowledged it's important ""that people who are a known danger to others do not have access to guns."" He just doesn't think it's a doctor's role.

The 2010 Affordable Care Act did include language meant to protect Second Amendment rights. Though it does not prohibit doctors from asking about firearms, the law states that the government cannot require that information to be disclosed either.

Further, the law said gun ownership cannot be used to determine insurance premium rates."

NRA officials say they requested the provision out of concern that insurance companies could use such data to raise premiums on gun owners. The measure’s supporters in the Senate say they did not intend to interfere with the work of doctors or researchers.

The research restrictions began in the 1990s, when the NRA urged Congress to cut funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s division that studied gun violence. In 1996, Congress sharply limited the agency’s ability to fund that type of research. More limits came last year in a spending bill setting restrictions on the National Institutes of Health after complaints from gun rights advocates about an NIH-backed study drawing links between alcoholism and gun violence. The provision, added by Rep. Denny Rehberg (R-Mont.), prohibits the NIH from spending money to “advocate or promote gun control” — language that researchers say does not explicitly forbid studies but sends a signal to federal research agencies to steer clear of the topic. The NRA push has extended into state capitals as well, with Florida lawmakers last year crafting a plan to impose jail time on doctors for inquiring about their patients’ gun ownership. Gov. Rick Scott (R) signed a scaled-back version of the proposal requiring health-care workers to “refrain” from asking patients about their ownership or possession of firearms unless the providers believe “in good faith” that such information would be relevant. A federal judge this year declared the law unconstitutional and blocked its enforcement, but the ruling was appealed by the state and is under review.



But that excuse is pathetic, since this has been ongoing for a while:The NRA is specifically targeting research that they don't like the results of. This has nothing to do with premiums and insurance companies. That's just a silly excuse they came up with, now that their hand is caught in the cookie jar. And I can't repeat often enough how revolting that is.

Now, I am not writing this to blame the administration, I believe that there were several bitter pills we needed to swallow to get a good bill passed, and then address the flaws later.

As Senator Franken, whom I respect deeply, said of this issue:



he was aware of the late addition and found it “objectionable.” But, he said, “it’s helpful to remember that we were in the position of having to get 60 votes from 60 senators. And, as a result, some things ended up in the bill for reasons I was not privy to and were certainly not to my liking.”

So the provision by the NRA was a late addition, only ""several weeks"" before the bill passed, and Franken supported it reluctantly for the sake of the overall bill. I'm willing to let that go, but I can't let go the inhumanity of the people who pushed for the provision.

Well, now is the time to address this particular flaw. Doctors are fighting back hard:



""This illustrates the fact that the NRA has insinuated themselves into the small crevices of anything they can to do anything in their power to prohibit sensible gun-safety measures,” said Denise Dowd, an ­emergency-care physician at a Kansas City, Mo., children’s hospital and an adviser on firearms issues to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Dowd called the provision in the health-care bill “pretty outrageous,” saying it risked creating a sense among doctors that “this is dangerous information to collect.” “We ask our patients about many things, not because we’re anti-gun but because we have an obligation and an ethical duty to keep the kids safe,” she said

The last statement in particular, really highlights the bitter irony when conservatives argue that the Government should not get in between the doctor and the patients. And then they support provisions that do exactly that. These people have no principles.

More action by the experts:

The pediatricians group last week submitted a strongly worded letter to the Obama administration saying that pediatric advocates “vehemently reject” the gun provision in the health-care law. The group notes that the provision runs counter to guidelines included in other sections of the legislation that ask family doctors and pediatricians to inquire about the presence of guns in patients’ homes, along with other potential dangers, such as mold, lead, cigarette smoke and a lack of smoke detectors. ...“Gun use and gun violence is a public health issue, and it should not be out of bounds to ask questions about it,” said David Satcher, a surgeon general under President Bill Clinton, who headed the CDC in the 1990s, when the NRA began to challenge gun research. “Privacy needs to be protected, but it’s important that this kind of data be gathered.” ...“It’s a problem when you don’t have access to a ­high-quality stream of robust, effective research,” said Arthur L. Kellermann, an emergency-room doctor and public health advocate who published studies in the 1980s that found elevated risks of death or injury associated with gun ownership. “And it’s an even bigger problem when you gag physicians in order to keep them from talking to their patients.”



From 1986 to 1996, the CDC sponsored peer-reviewed research into the underlying causes of gun violence. Among the findings: People who kept guns in their homes for ­self-defense did not gain protection. Instead, according to research published in the New England Journal of Medicine, residents in homes with a gun faced a 2.7-fold greater risk of homicide and a 4.8-fold greater risk of suicide compared with those in similar homes without guns. ...Lobbyists for the gun industry worked with Rep. Jay Dickey (R-Ark.) to redirect $2.6 million in CDC funds that had been designated for research into firearms safety. The move, which Dickey would later come to regret, unnerved scientists at the CDC and across the country.

But the best part is the last- real research that shows the futility of owning a gun for self-defense:And there it is: the reason they want to stop gun violence research"

Mr. Reid, a former policeman, eagerly displayed his sportsman’s enthusiasm to the voters.

It turned out his solidarity with the N.R.A. extended to quietly inserting an amendment that year into President Obama’s health care reform law that restricted the ability of physicians to gather data about their patients’ use of firearms.

The provision, reported last month in The Washington Post, reflected the N.R.A.’s long-running obsession with preventing gun-related deaths and injuries from being studied as a major public health problem that should be controlled the way government monitors risks connected to automobiles, airplanes and consumer products. For decades, lawmakers have let the gun lobby block financing for and limit gun research by the National Institutes of Health and other agencies.

Mr. Reid’s office insisted the amendment was intended to head off N.R.A. opposition to health care reform. In any case, mass shootings as a public health threat should be a major part of the debate over gun reform taking shape after the massacre of schoolchildren and teachers in Newtown, Conn. An adviser to Mr. Reid, who will be at the center of any Senate action, told CNN that the senator is now “in a different place” on the gun control issue."

Lawmakers seek way out of ObamaCare showdown,"Concerned their party is painting itself into a corner, some Republicans are trying to find a way out of the congressional showdown over a House-passed bill that would keep the government open past Sept. 30 only if lawmakers agree to defund ObamaCare.

Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid on Monday is expected to start the process of setting up a test vote on the House bill.

Reid and his fellow Democrats, naturally, want to strip out the provision defunding the health law. Republicans don't want that. So Tea Party-aligned senators like Ted Cruz have rallied around an only-in-Washington kind of approach -- in order to defend the House bill which they supported, they will try to block Reid from calling it up.

But this raises a perplexing question: Even if Republicans can muster the votes to block the bill, what then?

The approach threatens to end in a stalemate, with the Senate holding on to a bill and neither chamber, then, voting on anything that would keep the government open past Sept. 30. Congress hasn't passed a bona fide budget since 2009, forcing the government to operate on a series of short-term spending bills -- this practice sets up periodic deadlines, and opens the door each time to the risk of a shutdown.

Some Republicans and Democrats are now looking for a resolution, worried about the political blowback from a shutdown.

Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., suggested Monday that his fellow Republicans set the bar a bit lower, aiming instead to repeal ""some of the really egregious things"" in the law.

Speaking with Fox News, Toomey said the widely unpopular medical device tax -- which medical device companies warn could put them out of business -- is a prime candidate for repeal. Plus, he said lawmakers should continue to push for a delay in the individual mandate, which is expected to require individuals to purchase health insurance starting in 2014.

""I don't think we're gonna be able to completely defund ObamaCare as long as President Obama's in the White House,"" Toomey said.

Toomey's comments speak to the divide in the Republican Party. Many GOP lawmakers want to repeal ObamaCare entirely, warning that it is driving Americans off their current health care plans and, because of quirks in the law, forcing others into part-time work. But many also say that, with Democrats controlling the Senate and White House, defunding it is simply not possible.

On CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., made a suggestion similar to Toomey's.

""Let's fix it. Let's repair it,"" he said of the law.

Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., on the same show, was skeptical about the GOP push to defund the law. ""We don't have the ability ... to put a total stop and defund ObamaCare. It would be nice if we did. I'd be in the fight,"" he said.

He predicted that Reid would ultimately marshal the votes to strip out the ObamaCare language and send the budget bill back to the House. He predicted the government would not shut down over this ""exercise.""

With time running out to reach an agreement, there appear to be a few possible outcomes.

Cruz and his allies could successfully stall the bill in the Senate, forcing concessions or forcing a shutdown come Oct. 1.

Or, Reid could succeed in calling up the bill, stripping out the ObamaCare language and sending it back to the House. Then House Speaker John Boehner would be forced to decide whether to stick by his party's demands to defund ObamaCare, or call up the clean budget bill, relying on perhaps a majority of Democrats to pass it.

Cruz, in an interview with ""Fox News Sunday,"" also floated an alternative route. He said the House should ""hold its ground,"" and start passing miniature spending bills, ""one department at a time.""

""Fund the military, send it over, and let's see if Harry Reid is willing to shut down the military because he wants to force ObamaCare on the American people,"" he said.

While Republicans debate internally over strategy, Democratic leaders have a largely united message.

Reid said last week that any bill that strips funding from ObamaCare is ""dead.""

President Obama says any push to nix the health care law is ""not going to happen."""

The report revealed the White House calendar records a single one-on-one meeting between her and President Barack Obama in over three-and-a-half years.

“How many times did you actually visit with the President since 2009 or 2010 when you came on board?” asked Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-GA), who is also a medical doctor. “How many personal visits did you have with him at the White House regarding the Affordable Care Act?”

“A lot,” said Sebelius.

“Can you verify that?” asked Gingrey.

The chair then said, “The Gentleman’s time has expired.”

“I, I…,” a flustered Sebelius said while raising her hands in the air.

The GAI’s report and Schweizer’s Politico Magazine op-ed revealed the White House’s official calendar and the Politico presidential calendar list just a single meeting between Obama and Sebelius from July 12, 2010 to November 30, 2013. On Friday, HHS spokesperson Joanne Peters released a statement claiming that Sebelius and Obama held “countless” one-on-one meetings together and that “dozens” of those private meetings were held in the last year alone.

Similarly, when asked by NBC News reporter Peter Alexander and ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl about the GAI’s explosive report, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney claimed Sebelius has one-on-one meetings with Obama “frequently” and that “it’s safe to say that Kathleen Sebelius has been one of the more frequent visitors to and attendants to meetings with the president.

However, Carney admitted to Jonathan Karl that he had no numbers, figures, or dates of meetings but said, “I think on this case, they’ll [HHS] have information for you.” But today during her testimony, Sebelius could only answer, “A lot,” when questioned how many times she had met with the president. And HHS spokesperson Joanne Peters has yet to release the “countless” and “dozens” of dates she claims Obama and Sebelius met one-on-one over the last three-and-a-half years leading up to the Obamacare rollout.

Analysts say the GAI report hits at the core question of presidential leadership and executive management, traits that when damaged can do significant damage to a president’s popularity, especially among Independent voters. Former White House adviser to four presidents of both parties, David Gergen, said on CNN that the GAI’s report demonstrated “malfeasance” by the Obama White House. “The fact that he was not meeting with her one-on-one, I think, frankly, is not so much an indictment of her but of the White House operation,” said Gergen. “At the same time three years pass with no one-on-one meetings according to this Politico article. The president had 277 one-on-one meetings with other members of his cabinet.”

Other GOP committee members expressed frustration with Sebelius for what they considered evasive and misleading answers.

“We just don’t get the truth out of you!” Rep. John Shimkus (R-IL) said to Sebelius. “It’s like talking to the Republic of Korea.”

Democrats on the committee like Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ) laughed off Republican criticisms of Obamacare and said GOP concerns over millions of American families receiving insurance cancellations proves Republicans are “living on Mars.” Pallone added: “The reality is the Affordable Care Act is working…I’m proud of this law.”

“Republicans are afraid this law is going to be popular,” said Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA).

Obama claims he was never notified of problems with healthcare.gov prior to the website’s disastrous October 1 launch.

The White House and HHS have yet to release the dated list of one-on-one meetings each claims occurred between Obama and Sebelius."
http://www.nbcnews.com/health/some-states-push-employee-choice-small-business-insurance-6C10606242,2013-07-11 18:16:00+00:00,['Julie Appleby'],Some states push 'employee choice' for small business insurance,"Small business workers in at least 15 states and the District of Columbia may have a menu of health insurance choices next year, something that didn’t seem likely a few months ago.



Back in April, federal officials concerned about the potential for major glitches put off until 2015 a provision that would offer small businesses owners a way to allow their employees to choose from among a variety of competing plans in the new online marketplace being overseen by the Obama administration.

Similar to last week's announcement of a one-year delay in the requirement that businesses with 50 or more workers provide coverage or pay a fine, the move to delay the ""employee choice provision"" was cited by opponents as an example that the health law was in trouble.

Still, the decision at the time relieved insurers, who feared there wasn’t enough time left to sort out operational complexities, but proponents lamented a loss of choice for employees.

But now, as new marketplaces prepare to open for enrollment Oct. 1, it appears that most of the states creating their own online marketplaces are going ahead with “employee choice” for small business workers, researchers at Georgetown University’s Health Policy Institute found in a report Thursday for the Commonwealth Fund.

By doing so, the states hope to make the small business marketplaces -- for firms with 50 or fewer workers -- more attractive to employers and workers, said co-author Sarah Dash.

The ""choice"" option will not be available in the 33 states whose new marketplaces, also known as exchanges, are overseen by the federal government. Small employers will still have the option of shopping for coverage through the marketplace, but workers’ choice of plans will be limited to the one their employer picks.

In the 17 states doing their own marketplaces, 15 intend to offer the choice model, as will the District of Columbia, according to the report. Idaho is not including an employee-choice program because it is using the federal marketplaces’ information technology platform, which will not include it. New Mexico is still considering its options.

Under the state programs moving forward, a business owner could pay a set amount toward coverage for each worker, then let each employee go to the Small Business Health Options Program, known as the SHOP exchange, to select from a variety of plans. Workers could choose to pay the difference if they wanted a more expensive plan, or potentially see all or most of their premium covered if they chose a less costly one.

Insurers raised concerns late last year that the SHOP marketplaces will be very complex – and feared the marketplaces would not be ready to handle those issues this fall. They did not want to be required to participate unless there was a delay.

On Wednesday, Alissa Fox, a senior vice president of Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, said it is “news to us” that so many states were moving forward.

“Our strong recommendation for the past three years is that the focus needs to be on getting the individual marketplace up and running and getting the core functions done right,” said Fox. “Any functions not critical to that core mission should be put off so we get it right for consumers.”

Seven states – Hawaii, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont – will allow workers the widest variety of choices, selecting from across multiple insurers and coverage levels, the report says. Other states will allow workers to choose among plans at a specific level of coverage selected by the employer.

State marketplaces, Dash said, are responsible for ensuring they have the technology available to track the worker choices, a complex challenge. At least two states have slowed their effort: In Washington state, not enough insurance carriers applied, so the state will pilot its employee-choice program in only one region of the state, said Dash.

In Maryland, the small business section of the online marketplace won’t open for enrollment until Jan. 1, 2014, three months behind the opening of the market to individuals. Coverage under the small business program won’t begin until March 1, 2014, according to minutes from the board overseeing the state’s marketplace.

Under the health law, small businesses are not required to offer coverage or use these marketplaces. Workers at firms not offering health insurance would be able to go to a parallel online marketplace for individuals, which is also being set up by the federal government and the states."

It has reached a boil, especially concerning border security, at a moment when illegal entries are at a 40-year low and net immigration from Mexico has recently been approximately zero, largely because enforcement efficiency has already been substantially improved and because America’s economic growth is inferior to Mexico’s. Yet some Senate Republicans support spending $46 billion over 10 years to, among other things, double the number of border agents.

The Government Accountability Office says border security in 2011 was about 84 percent effective. A much-discussed aspiration is 90 percent. So the $46 billion is supposed to purchase a six-point improvement. This embarrassing militarization of the border was designed to entice a few of the 14 Senate Republicans (of 46) who joined all Democrats in supporting the Senate bill. Some senators expect House Republicans to be swayed because a minority of the Senate minority supported the bill. These senators should trek to the other side of the Capitol and, like Margaret Mead among the Samoans, mingle with the natives.

On a Friday, the Senate received a 114-page amendment to the (by then) more than 1,000-page “Gang of Eight” bill, which the Senate passed the following Thursday. Senators can repent at leisure after they read details such as: Never mind what maps say, the Senate says Nevada is a border state. So Majority Leader Harry Reid’s constituents, and those of Nevada’s Republican Sen. Dean Heller, who supported the bill, can feast on border-security pork.

Such provisions reflect an imperative of legislating in a continental nation. Because durable, principle-based congressional majorities are rare, legislation often becomes large and complex through the process of cobbling together a coalition of legislators more attuned to parochial interests than philosophical arguments. Logrolling is necessary to this process, but it necessarily reduces the moral momentum of the final product.

Whatever momentum the Senate imparted to reform is a wasted asset. The House is unlikely to complete its immigration legislation before the August recess, when Republican members will return to their districts, about which the Wall Street Journal says: Only 38 of 234 House Republicans — 16 percent — represent districts that are at least 20 percent Hispanic. And “only 28 Republican-held districts are considered even remotely at risk of being contested by a Democratic challenger.” Democrats will not accept a bill that does not provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, and in a recent poll, almost half of Republicans said they were less likely to support a legislator who supports a pathway.

Four Augusts ago, Congress was busy passing — in order to find out what was in it — a different mammoth, because “comprehensive,” bill. During the August 2009 recess, legislators conducted often-tumultuous town hall meetings, where they discovered that intensity resided disproportionately among opponents of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). Opponents’ anger was registered emphatically in congressional elections 15 months later, which is one reason why implementation of the act’s most onerous provisions was delayed until 2014, after the 2012 presidential election.

The PPACA remains unpopular, and there are congressional elections in years divisible by two — not even the Obama administration can ignore that constitutional fact — so last Tuesday, the administration said this about the act’s mandate that in 2014, large employers provide expensive health-care coverage for their workers or pay a substantial penalty: Never mind.

Although the Constitution has no Article VIII, the administration acts as though there is one that reads: “Notwithstanding all that stuff in other articles about how laws are made, if a president finds a law politically inconvenient, he can simply post on the White House Web site a notice saying: Never mind.”

Never mind that the law stipulates 2014 as the year when employers with 50 full-time workers are mandated to offer them health-care coverage or pay fines. Instead, 2015 will be the year. Unless Democrats see a presidential election coming.

This lesson in the Obama administration’s approach to the rule of law is pertinent to the immigration bill, which at last count had 222 instances of a discretionary “may” and 153 of “waive.” Such language means that were the Senate bill to become law, the executive branch would be able to do pretty much as it pleases, even to the point of saying about almost anything: Never mind.

http://news.yahoo.com/republicans-see-obamacare-issues-key-2014-074314054.html,,[],Republicans see 'Obamacare' issues as key to 2014,"WASHINGTON (AP) — If Republicans were writing a movie script for next year's congressional elections, the working title might be ""2014: Apocalypse of Obamacare.""

The plot: The rollout of President Barack Obama's health care law turns into such a disaster that enraged voters rebuke him by rewarding the GOP with undisputed control of Congress.

But there's a risk for Republicans if they're wrong and the Affordable Care Act works reasonably well, particularly in states that have embraced it. Republicans might be seen as obstinately standing in the way of progress.

The law already has been a political prop in two election seasons, but next year will be different.

Voters will have a real program to judge, working or dysfunctional. Will affordable health care finally be a reality for millions of uninsured working people? Or will premiums skyrocket as the heavy hand of government upends already fragile insurance markets for small businesses and individuals?

""The end of this movie has not been written,"" said Robert Blendon, a Harvard professor who tracks public opinion on health care. He says next year's movie actually will be a documentary: what happens in states that fully put the law in place and those that resist — ""a message of reality.""

One of the most prominent doomsayers is Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who predicts ""Obamacare"" probably will be the biggest issue of 2014 and ""an albatross around the neck of every Democrat who voted for it.""

""This thing can't possibly work,"" says McConnell. ""It will be a huge disaster in 2014.""

Counting on that, House Republicans are busy framing an election narrative, voting to repeal the health law and trying to link it to the scandal over the Internal Revenue Service's targeting of tea party groups. It could help excite the conservative base.

But Democratic pollster Celinda Lake doubts reality will follow the GOP script. Next year, ""we won't have to worry about the mythology laid out by the right wing about Obamacare: death panels and dramatic cuts to Medicare,"" she said.

Story continues

Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said uninsured people in her state will have over 200 coverage options to choose from. ""We have been hearing the fear, but in states like mine, people are seeing the reality,"" she said.

In just about five months, people without access to coverage through their jobs can start shopping for subsidized private insurance in new state markets. The actual benefits begin Jan. 1. But because of continuing opposition to the law from many Republican governors and state legislators, the federal government will be running the insurance markets in more than half the states.

Another major element of the law, the expansion of Medicaid to serve more low-income people, also has run into problems. With many legislative sessions over or winding down, it looks like fewer than half the states may accept the expansion. That means millions of low-income people are likely to remain uninsured, at least initially.

Other early indicators of how well the health care rollout might fare are mixed.

In a dozen or so states that have started releasing details of their new insurance markets, there's robust insurer interest in participating, according to the market research firm Avalere Health. That's a good signal for competition.

There still are concerns about a spike in premiums for people who already buy their own coverage, particularly the young and healthy. That could happen for several reasons.

The health care law forbids insurers to deny coverage to sick people, and it limits what older adults can be charged. Also, the plans that will be offered next year are more comprehensive than many bare-bones policies currently available to individuals.

Another big source of angst is the Obama administration. The Health and Human Services Department will be running the program in half the country while trying to fight off attempts by congressional Republicans to starve it financially. Unusual for a social program, the administration is largely operating behind a veil of secrecy.

Will Obama's underlings turn out to be the Keystone Kops of health care?

Frustration that he and his constituents couldn't get basic information from the administration led one of the authors of the law, Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., to warn recently that he sees ""a huge train wreck coming down.""

Republicans loved it. Lost in the uproar was the fact that Baucus was referring to potential problems with implementation. He stills thinks the health care law itself is a good thing.

The administration official running the rollout, Gary Cohen, told Congress this past that he didn't agree with the senator's statement. ""We are very much on schedule,"" Cohen said.

Republican pollster Bill McInturff says he's skeptical of what he hears from the administration as well as from his own party. McInturff, who has made polling on health care his specialty, says the launch of any national program is bound to have problems. President George W. Bush's Medicare prescription benefit went through several weeks of chaos before things got smoothed out.

""Life experience says to me there is not going to be some simple, clear narrative that is sitting here today,"" McInturff said."

Shear']","With Enrollment Slow, Some Democrats Back Change in Health Law","WASHINGTON — Anxious congressional Democrats are threatening to abandon President Obama on a central element of his signature health care law, voicing increasing support for proposals that would allow Americans who are losing their health insurance coverage because of the Affordable Care Act to retain it.

The dissent comes as the Obama administration released enrollment figures on Wednesday that fell far short of expectations, and as House Republicans continued their sharp criticism of administration officials at congressional hearings examining the performance of the health care website and possible security risks of the online insurance exchanges.

In addition, a vote is scheduled Friday in the Republican-controlled House on a bill that would allow Americans to keep their existing health coverage through 2014 without penalties. The measure, drafted by Representative Fred Upton, the Michigan Republican who is the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, is opposed by the White House, which argues that it would severely undermine the Affordable Care Act by allowing insurance companies to continue to sell health coverage that does not meet the higher standard of Mr. Obama’s health care law.

But a growing number of House Democrats, reflecting a strong political backlash to the rollout of the law, are warning the White House that they may support the measure if the administration does not provide a strong alternative argument. The approaching House vote is shaping up as an important test for both the health measure and the unity that Democratic leaders have so far been able to maintain around it despite a fierce Republican attack."

Three federal appeals courts have ruled on the issue, with two correctly rejecting that view as without legal foundation. Given the conflicting rulings, it is a good bet the Supreme Court will agree to address this issue in the next term.

Under the Affordable Care Act, employers with more than 50 workers that provide insurance plans must include contraceptives coverage or face fines of up to $100 a day for each employee. The administration’s rule, issued in June, goes to great lengths to respect the concerns of religious institutions while preserving a worker’s right not to conform to the religious beliefs of her employer.

The rule has an exemption for houses of worship and accommodates other nonprofit religious and church-affiliated organizations, like hospitals, universities and charities, that object by letting them avoid paying for contraception for employees. In those cases, insurance companies or third-party administrators would arrange separate no-payment plans for contraceptive services. Quite properly, there is no exemption for owners of private for-profit businesses who simply don’t want to comply with a general law because of their personal views. (The House, in its idiotic push toward a government shutdown, included in its temporary spending measure a provision to let employers opt out of this requirement.)

On Sept. 19, the Conestoga Wood Specialties Corporation, owned by a devout Mennonite family, asked the Supreme Court to review a July ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that rejected the company’s argument that requiring contraception coverage in employee health plans violates the First Amendment’s free exercise clause and a federal law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act."
http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/31/politics/religion-contraceptive-insurance/index.html,2013-01-31 00:00:00,['Dan Merica'],Obama proposal would let religious groups opt-out of contraception mandate,"Story highlights Proposed rules would permit certain groups like hospitals, schools to decline to provide contraception coverage for religious reasons But women would still get coverage; outside provider would pay for contraception separately Proposal would be shift in policy, could ease friction between Obama and religious groups NEW: One group says proposal does nothing to change current policy

The Obama administration proposed updated guidelines on Friday that would allow religious-affiliated organizations opposing contraception to opt out of a federal mandate requiring that they provide their employees with insurance coverage for birth control.

The draft rule would give women at non-profit, religious-based organizations, like certain hospitals and universities, the ability to receive contraception through separate health policies at no charge.

The compromise is consistent with last year’s announcement by President Barack Obama on the contraception mandate, administration officials said.

It also continues his administration’s attempts to resolve the contentious issue of how non-profit organizations can decline to provide contraception coverage to their employees on religious grounds without facing a penalty.

“Today, the administration is taking the next step in providing women across the nation with coverage of recommended preventive care at no cost, while respecting religious concerns,” Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a statement.

“We will continue to work with faith-based organizations, women’s organizations, insurers and others to achieve these goals,” she said.

As part of the new initiative, groups that are insured – such as student health plans at religious colleges – would be required to let their insurer know that certain participants would like contraception coverage.

“The insurer would then notify enrollees that it is providing them with no-cost contraceptive coverage through separate individual health insurance policies,” the HHS statement said.

Although the agency has not estimated final costs of the plan, it said that offering free coverage would actually lower expenses over the long term, partly due to improvement in women’s health and fewer childbirths.

Case fuels debate over when life begins

Because the insurer would be covering the costs, the changes would allow religious organizations morally opposed to contraception to avoid paying for it.

An original mandate on providing contraception was part of the new federal healthcare law spearheaded by Obama, the Affordable Care Act. It required that insurers provide, at no cost to those insured, all forms of contraception approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

Houses of worship were exempt immediately and the administration widened those exemptions last year to include other religiously affiliated organizations, like universities and hospitals.

That still left groups across a wide spectrum of faiths, many of which teach that contraception is morally wrong, covered by the mandate. They denounced it as an infringement of religious liberty. A group of 43 Catholic organizations challenged the rules in federal court in May.

The administration had long defended the mandate, saying that it did not violate religious liberties.

The new proposal also clarifies the definition of a religious employer.

Instead of using a multi-part test that requires an employer to show “religious values as its purpose” and to “employ persons who share its religious tenets,” the proposed requirement would follow the International Revenue Code’s definition that includes “churches, other houses of worship, and their affiliated organizations.”

Following an uproar among religious institutions that didn’t want to pay for contraceptives, the Obama administration in March offered several alternatives. The plan unveiled on Friday is a result of that effort.

The updated rules proposal will be open for public comment through April 8. The administration would then decide whether to make it final.

A source with knowledge of the matter but not authorized to speak on the record said administration officials planned to discuss the new plan with faith-based organizations on Friday. The source also said the administration called key leaders, including presidents of Catholic universities, before the announcement.

Women’s groups, including Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America, heralded the announcement

“Today’s draft regulation affirms yet again the Obama administration’s commitment to fulfilling the full promise of its historic contraception policy,” said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL. “Thanks to this commitment, most American women will get birth control coverage without extra expense.”

“This policy makes it clear that your boss does not get to decide whether you can have birth control,” said Cecile Richards, President of Planned Parenthood Federation of America.

Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, took a wait-and-see approach.

Lawyers for Catholic hospital argue that a fetus is not a person

Today, the administration issued proposed regulations regarding the HHS mandate” he said in a statement. “We welcome the opportunity to study the proposed regulations closely. We look forward to issuing a more detailed statement later.”

Not all groups characterized it as a compromise, however.

Frank Pavone, National Director of Priests for Life, a group that launched a federal lawsuit against the mandate last year, said he was far from happy with the update and welcomes the opportunity to provide feedback.

“We at Priests for Life remind the administration that religious liberty does not just belong to religious groups and individuals; it belongs to all Americans,” Pavone said. “We see only one acceptable change regarding the mandate: rescind it completely.”

The Family Research Council, a conservative pro-life group, released a similar statement.

“The proposal does not expand religious freedom to all organizations and does nothing to change the current policy that forces religious entities to pay for insurance plans that include abortion-inducing drugs, sterilizations and contraception,” said Anna Higgins, director of the group’s Center for Human Dignity.

The issue of Obama’s health care act mandating contraception coverage became a hot-button political issue during last year’s presidential race.

(CNN) —

For the first time, someone in the Obama administration apologized for the problem-plagued Obamacare website.

Marilyn Tavenner also said on Tuesday that the online troubles were being resolved and the overall program was working, albeit slower and less successfully than hoped.

In the first congressional testimony from a government official on the botched launch of HealthCare.gov, the head of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told the House Ways and Means Committee that the “vast majority” of consumers would be able to successfully use the site by the end of November.

“I want to apologize to you that the website does not work as well as it should,” she said, adding that HealthCare.gov “can and will be fixed.”

The hearing served as a hot seat for Tavenner, whose agency has been blamed for the website troubles causing a political headache for President Barack Obama and his signature health care reforms, as well as a venting session for Republicans after their failed efforts to scuttle the reforms.

Tavenner reports to Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who has come under fire for the problems that plagued the introduction of the enrollment website.

Some congressional Republicans demand her resignation or firing, and Sebelius will face a hearing by the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday.

She is expected to tell that committee the initial experience of HealthCare.gov has been frustrating for many, and unacceptable.

But she will also defend Obamacare, according to prepared remarks.

“The fact is that the Affordable Care Act delivered on its product: quality, affordable health insurance. The tremendous interest shown in HealthCare.gov shows that people want to buy this product. We know the initial consumer experience at HealthCare.gov has not been adequate. We will address these initial and any ongoing problems, and build a website that fully delivers on this promise of the Affordable Care Act,” Sebelius is expected to say.

The health secretary will provide figures for the site, which has had more than 20 million unique visits to date. Over the past few weeks, nearly 700,000 applications have been submitted. People are also signing up through a call center, paper applications and in-person assistance.

“By enlisting additional technical help, aggressively monitoring errors, testing to prevent new issues from cropping up, and regularly deploying fixes to the site, we are working to ensure consumers’ interaction with HealthCare.gov is a positive one, and that the Affordable Care Act fully delivers on its promise,” Sebelius will say.

In an exclusive interview last week, the health secretary told CNN that Obama didn’t know of the problems with the Affordable Care Act’s website until after its troubled launch on October 1. This was despite the fact that insurance companies had been complaining and the site crashed during a prelaunch test run.

Policies canceled

More trouble for Obama came out of the testimony, as Tavenner conceded that some people with individual health coverage – rather than the group coverage that most Americans have – will be forced to get new policies because of increased requirements under the 2010 Affordable Care Act.

“These individuals in a small group, our individual markets, had no protections” before the reforms became law, Tavenner explained.

Until now, such consumers “could be kicked out any time for pre-existing conditions” or realize too late that their policies failed to cover hospitalization or cancer treatments, Tavenner said. The reforms protect them by requiring a minimum standard of coverage, she added.

For some, that means more expensive policies and any change breaks the oft-repeated pledge by Obama that “if you like your plan, you can keep your plan” when he was pushing for Congress to pass his signature reforms.

Republican Rep. Aaron Schock of Illinois hammered Tavenner on that point, noting a constituent who got a letter telling her that the health care reforms caused the cancellation of her current plan with a more expensive alternative in its place.

“She has health insurance that she likes. She’s been paying her premium. She wants to keep it. But she can’t,” Schock said. “Isn’t that a lie?”

Tavenner responded that some insurers changed or discontinued plans that failed to meet the Obamacare requirements, even though present coverage could still be offered in some cases under a “grandfather” provision in the legislation, despite lacking the full benefits of the reforms.

She advised anyone being forced to get a new policy to examine all options under the new system, including the possibility of getting federal subsidies if they are eligible.

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation website, 15.4 million people had individual health care coverage in 2011, representing about 5% of the population. The vast majority of Americans – at least two-thirds of the population in 2011 – had coverage through their employer, Medicare, Medicaid or other public providers and will not be affected by changes involving individual coverage.

At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney said “a significant portion” of the 5% of people with individual coverage will end up paying less for better policies when they shop around in the new exchanges.

“One of the issues that the Affordable Care Act was designed to address was the need to provide greater security to those Americans forced to seek insurance on the individual market,” Carney said.

On Capitol Hill, a top House Democrat told reporters on Tuesday that his party “should have been more precise” when making the pledge about people keeping coverage they liked.

“I think preciseness would have been better,” said Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland.

He added that the promise was made to try to allay the fears of the majority of Americans who get health coverage from their employers or government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.

Partisan exchanges

As expected, Tuesday’s hearing included fiery partisan exchanges, with Republicans saying the website problems foreshadow deeper problems that threaten higher premiums and government intrusion in future health coverage while Democrats accused them of trying to kill reforms that benefit millions of Americans.

Under GOP questioning, Tavenner said initial figures on how many people have enrolled so far for health coverage under the reforms won’t be available until mid-November.

She noted that the administration has expected the initial enrollment to be small, but noted that the enrollment period ends on March 31.

When asked by Republicans about the expected initial low enrollment, Tavenner pointed out that a similar dynamic occurred with implementation of the Massachusetts health care law, when people waited until the final deadline approached to sign up.

To GOP Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, the committee chairman, low enrollment signals the failure of the health care reforms, which need young people, and people who are less expensive to insure, to sign up so insurers can offer affordable plans in markets that include older and people who are more expensive to cover.

“I fear we can see a fundamental breakdown of the insurance market where premiums will skyrocket, pricing millions of Americans out of health care,” he said.

Later, Republican Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas asked Tavenner for a guarantee that consumers will be able to obtain coverage required by the health care law before the deadline.

“What I can guarantee is that we have a system that is working. We are going to improve the speed of that system,” she said.

But Brady interrupted her.

“Excuse me,” he said. “You are saying the system right now is working?”

Tavenner didn’t budge, responding: “I am saying it is working. It is just not working at the speed that we want and at the success rate that we want.”

Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey lambasted Republicans on the panel for choosing to pile on the website woes in their continuing attempt to dismantle Obamacare instead of working with Democrats to improve settled law.

Citing the political battle last decade over the Bush administration’s Medicare prescription drug benefit opposed by Democrats, Pascrell noted “we lost the policy fight” then but chose to help make the program work instead of trying to discredit or undermine it.

Standing up and pointing at his GOP colleagues, Pascrell shouted: “How many of you stood up to do that? None. Zero. Zero.”

Website problems

Late Tuesday, officials said the data hub behind the Obamacare website was experiencing an outage, prohibiting customers from submitting new applications.

Verizon, which provides some technology services behind HealthCare.gov, said federal officials asked the company to provide additional computing and storage ability.

“At the request of HHS’s deputy CIO, we are now undertaking infrastructure maintenance, which should be complete overnight,” Verizon spokesman Jeffrey Nelson said. “We anticipate the strengthened infrastructure will help eliminate application downtimes.”

A key tech malfunction brought down the site Sunday.

In prepared testimony for the hearing, Tavenner said private contractors hired to create the website “have not met expectations.” Asked about that statement, she cited one of the contractors – CGI Federal, which has a contract worth as much as $200 million for its work on the system.

This is what happens when you let this guy actually do stuff.

Last week, the Office of Personnel Management (sort of the HR department for the federal government) released its fix for the glitch in which congressional staff were in danger of losing their the employer contribution part of their health insurance. That would have meant that some staff couldn't afford to be insured at all. Under the fix, staffers will still purchase health insurance on the exchange, and will keep the employer subsidy (but not get the tax credit, or Obamacare subsidy).

Immediately, the Right screeched that Congress made itself exempt. FreedomWorks pretends like staff keeping their subsidies is an entirely new thing and that this is congress exempting itself from the law. Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) called it an ""outrageous exemption for Congress.""

As Jonathon Cohn points out, yes congressional employees are treated differently under the law. But it's because Congress adopted an amendment from Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley to make it so. Grassley thought he was being cute and putting Democrats in a bind when he suggested that Congress be put into the exchanges. Democrats thought, why the hell not, but in accepting the Grassley amendment, didn't get all the kinks worked out because Congress was the only large employer that already provided benefits being forced onto the exchange.

Making sure employees retained their employer contribution would have been an easy legislative fix, but Republicans aren't going to allow any fix to Obamacare, even one that benefits their staff. So OPM made the decision, giving the GOP yet another opportunity to screech about the law. But this time, they're screeching about their own provision. It gets more surreal every day."

Whether the president will risk signing up while cameras are rolling is still unknown. The risk in the president doing so is that HealthCare.gov crashes on him and in front of the entire world. As recently as Friday, the site collapsed.

Regardless, it certainly can’t hurt for Obama to sign up. Currently, reports show that ObamaCare enrollment is way behind where it needs to be if the program is going to be financially viable.

Moreover, reports on the number of enrollees the White House releases and the media slavishly repeats are inaccurate. You have to pay your first month’s policy in order to be enrolled and insured. Both the White House and the media are reporting those who have only put a health plan in their shopping cart as “enrolled.”

Studies show that the online abandonment rate of items placed in a shopping cart is as high as 65%.

Currently, the media have shown little interest in digging up or demanding the real ObamaCare enrollment numbers.

Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) said Tuesday, in another sign of a growing split in the Republican Party.

""I want to defund this bill, but I also want a way to do it that kills it,"" Coburn, who was one of the health care law's most vocal opponents when it passed, said in a Senate floor speech.

He argued that the plan by Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and several other tea party-backed senators to try and strip funds for the law from a September government funding bill simply won't work.

The reason, Coburn argued, is that most of the spending in Obamacare is mandatory, and the spending cannot be touched, even if the GOP were to shut down the rest of the government. He cited a new Congressional Research Service report that found as much.

""There's not a legislative method that we have that is capable of defunding it short of 67 votes in the U.S. Senate, short of two-thirds [of the] votes in the U.S. House,"" Coburn said, referring to the number of votes needed to override the presidential veto that would be sure to block any attempt to defund the law.

Nevertheless, Lee said that the GOP has an obligation to try.

He and Cruz argued that if the House passed a bill to fund all of the government except for Obamacare and the president blocked it, it would be the White House shutting down the government, not the GOP.

They also contended that this year was Republicans' last real chance to stop the health care law before it is fully implemented, and said any members of the GOP who don't stand against it now are essentially guaranteeing the law will continue to exist.

""Defund it, or own it,"" Lee said to his colleagues. ""If you fund it, you're for it.""

Cruz told reporters shortly before taking to the floor that Americans would essentially be hooked on the law if it's not blocked by the start of next year.

""Jan. 1 is when the exchanges start and subsidies start. And the administration's plan is to get as many people as possible addicted to the sugar, addicted to the subsidies,"" Cruz said, arguing that entitlements never get repealed.

""It is an iron rule of politics that those who receive subsidies, inevitably, after they start receiving those subsidies, fight to retain those subsidies,"" Cruz said. ""They want as many people as possible receiving those subsidies in order to ensure that they remain a permanent aspect of the economy.""

But other Republicans, like Coburn, think a shutdown showdown is doomed to not only fail, but to make Americans angry at the GOP, potentially harming chances to win fights in other areas, from tax reform and the debt ceiling later this year to next year's elections.

Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) has called the defunding gambit the ""dumbest idea"" he's ever heard. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) warned against it, while Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Americans were tired of GOP-led debt ceiling and government shutdown ""shenanigans."" Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said shutting down the government was ""foolish.""

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) added her criticism to the chorus Tuesday, saying the plan was simply not realistic, and that it was both bad policy and bad politics.

""The American people want commonsense solutions,"" Collins told reporters on Capitol Hill. ""They don't want us to pursue policies that are pointless, that are going to end in governments shutting down, more partisanship, more gridlock. They want us to actually get things done.""

Even conservative Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.) was not willing to join Lee, Cruz and company, although he opposes Obamacare.

""We all agree and have voted to repeal and replace Obamacare. Our conference is united on that,"" he told HuffPost. ""Now we're just working through what's the best tactic or strategy to do it. So we're working through that, and obviously there are different opinions. Nobody wants the government to shut down. Nobody wants that to happen.""

Nevertheless, Cruz said he saw a path, saying that ""August is a critical period"" to convince the public to put pressure on lawmakers while they are on their month-long recess.

""If we see a grassroots tsunami, if we see millions of Americans stand up and say, 'Stop giving speeches about Obamacare, stop casting symbolic votes that don't do anything, and actually stand and fight,' if senators, if members of the House actually listen to their constituents, I believe we will return and come September... I believe we will succeed in getting either 41 senators in the Senate to stand together, or 218 members in the House to stand together. That's the path to winning this fight,"" Cruz said. The 41 senators he referred to are the number needed to filibuster a bill in the Senate.

Cruz -- who argued on the Senate floor that no ""parade of horribles"" materialized when the GOP shut down government for several weeks in the Clinton era -- told reporters that Republicans need to stop being afraid of being blamed.

""Republicans actually will have to stand up and fight and win the argument, and say, 'No, we have voted to fund the federal government. We want to keep the federal government funded, and why is President Obama threatening to shut down the federal government in order to force Obamacare down the American people's throats?'""

During the shutdowns in 1995, the GOP took adamant positions on the budget while Clinton signaled willingness to negotiate. The showdowns are widely credited with aiding Democrats in the 1996 elections."

These middle-class consumers are staring at hefty increases on their insurance bills as the overhaul remakes the healthcare market. Their rates are rising in large part to help offset the higher costs of covering sicker, poorer people who have been shut out of the system for years.

Although recent criticism of the healthcare law has focused on website glitches and early enrollment snags, experts say sharp price increases for individual policies have the greatest potential to erode public support for President Obama’s signature legislation.

“This is when the actual sticker shock comes into play for people,” said Gerald Kominski, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. “There are winners and losers under the Affordable Care Act.”

Fullerton resident Jennifer Harris thought she had a great deal, paying $98 a month for an individual plan through Health Net Inc. She got a rude surprise this month when the company said it would cancel her policy at the end of this year. Her current plan does not conform with the new federal rules, which require more generous levels of coverage.

Now Harris, a self-employed lawyer, must shop for replacement insurance. The cheapest plan she has found will cost her $238 a month. She and her husband don’t qualify for federal premium subsidies because they earn too much money, about $80,000 a year combined.

“It doesn’t seem right to make the middle class pay so much more in order to give health insurance to everybody else,” said Harris, who is three months pregnant. “This increase is simply not affordable.”

On balance, many Americans will benefit from the healthcare expansion. They are guaranteed coverage regardless of their medical history. And lower-income families will gain access to comprehensive coverage at little or no cost.

The federal government picks up much of the tab through an expansion of Medicaid and subsidies to people earning up to four times the federal poverty level. That’s up to $46,000 for an individual or $94,000 for a family of four.

But middle-income consumers face an estimated 30% rate increase, on average, in California due to several factors tied to the healthcare law.

Some may elect to go without coverage if they feel prices are too high. Penalties for opting out are very small initially. Defections could cause rates to skyrocket if a diverse mix of people don’t sign up for health insurance.

Pam Kehaly, president of Anthem Blue Cross in California, said she received a recent letter from a young woman complaining about a 50% rate hike related to the healthcare law.

“She said, ‘I was all for Obamacare until I found out I was paying for it,’” Kehaly said.

Nearly 2 million Californians have individual insurance, and several hundred thousand of them are losing their health plans in a matter of weeks.

Blue Shield of California sent termination letters to 119,000 customers last month whose plans don’t meet the new federal requirements. About two-thirds of those people will experience a rate increase from switching to a new health plan, according to the company.

HMO giant Kaiser Permanente is canceling coverage for about half of its individual customers, or 160,000 people, and offering to automatically enroll them in the most comparable health plan available.

The 16 million Californians who get health insurance through their employers aren’t affected. Neither are individuals who have “grandfathered” policies bought before March 2010, when the healthcare law was enacted. It’s estimated that about half of policyholders in the individual market have those older plans.

Obamacare: News and analysis

All these cancellations were prompted by a requirement from Covered California, the state’s new insurance exchange. The state didn’t want to give insurance companies the opportunity to hold on to the healthiest patients for up to a year, keeping them out of the larger risk pool that will influence future rates.

Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California, said the state and insurers agreed that clearing the decks by Jan. 1 was best for consumers in the long run despite the initial disruption. Lee has heard the complaints — even from his sister-in-law, who recently groused about her 50% rate increase.

“People could have kept their cheaper, bad coverage, and those people wouldn’t have been part of the common risk pool,” Lee said. “We are better off all being in this together. We are transforming the individual market and making it better.”

Lee said consumers need to consider all their options. They don’t have to stick with their current company, and higher premiums are only part of the cost equation. Lee said some of these rate hikes will be partially offset by smaller deductibles and lower limits on out-of-pocket medical expenses in the new plans.

Still, many are frustrated at being forced to give up the plans they have now. They frequently cite assurances given by Obama that Americans could hold on to their health insurance despite the massive overhaul.

“All we’ve been hearing the last three years is if you like your policy you can keep it,” said Deborah Cavallaro, a real estate agent in Westchester. “I’m infuriated because I was lied to.”

Supporters of the healthcare law say Obama was referring to people who are insured through their employers or through government programs such as Medicare. Still, they acknowledge the confusion and anger from individual policyholders who are being forced to change.

Cavallaro received her cancellation notice from Anthem Blue Cross this month. The company said a comparable Bronze plan would cost her 65% more, or $484 a month. She doubts she’ll qualify for much in premium subsidies, if any. Regardless, she resents losing the ability to pick and choose the benefits she wants to pay for.

“I just won’t have health insurance because I can’t pay this increase,” she said.

Most Americans are required to have health coverage starting next year or pay a fine of $95 per adult or 1% of their income, whichever is greater. The fines increase over time.

A number of factors are driving up rates. In a report this year, consultants hired by the state said the influx of sicker patients as a result of guaranteed coverage was the biggest single reason for higher premiums. Bob Cosway, a principal and consulting actuary at Milliman Inc. in San Diego, estimated that the average individual premium in 2014 will rise 27% because of that difference alone.

Individual policies must also cover a higher percentage of overall medical costs and include 10 “essential health benefits,” such as prescription drugs and mental health services. The aim is to fill gaps in coverage and provide consumers more peace of mind. But those expanded benefits have to be paid for with higher premiums.

The federal law also adjusts how rates are set by age, a change that gives older consumers a break and shifts more costs to younger people. Rates by age can vary by only 3 to 1 starting next year as opposed to 6 to 1 in some cases now in California. People in their 20s just starting their careers may earn so little they qualify for subsidies. But that might not be the case for consumers who are slightly older and earning more.

“It has the effect of benefiting people in their 50s and 60s and shifting costs to people in their 20s and 30s,” said Patrick Johnston, president of the California Assn. of Health Plans. “Benefits are being increased for all, but it’s not government subsidies for all. Some will pay more.”

Rates would be going up regardless of changes from the healthcare expansion. The average individual premium will climb 9% next year because of rising healthcare costs and increases in medical provider reimbursement, according to Milliman’s estimates.

Some consumer groups have questioned whether insurers are inflating their rates under the guise of the healthcare law changes.

“We believe the prices are higher than they should be,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, a Santa Monica advocacy group. “This is giving a bad name to the Affordable Care Act.”

State regulators checked the insurance companies’ math and underlying cost projections for next year, but they don’t have the authority to deny increases. Under federal rules, insurers can be ordered to issue rebates if they don’t spend a minimum amount of every premium dollar on customers’ medical care.

“The rates aren’t going up because insurance companies are pocketing more money,” Lee said. “That is what it takes to pay the claims and deliver the healthcare.”

Javier Lopez, 38 and a self-employed aerospace engineer in Huntington Beach, pays about $750 a month for an Anthem Blue Cross plan for his family of four. His premiums may rise nearly 20% next year for a new policy because his current plan is being phased out.

Lopez says he’s willing to absorb that one-year jump if it means the government can rein in future rate hikes.

“I’m hoping with this reform,” Lopez said, “we won’t see big increases year after year.”

The ultimatum from President Obama's own party is another sign of the unrest within the Democratic caucus about the cancellation notices. The end-of-the-week deadline is significant, because House Republicans are planning to call a vote Friday on a bill that would extend current policies for another year.

It's unclear whether Democrats would go so far as to support that bill if the administration does not offer a Plan B. But one senior Democratic source told Fox News that, at a closed meeting Wednesday, Democrats made clear to the administration that they need a proposed fix before Friday's vote.

The White House has vowed to come up with a solution, but so far has not provided much detail on what such a solution would entail. Press Secretary Jay Carney said Wednesday that the president will make an announcement on possible options ""sooner rather than later.""

One senior House Democrat characterized the meeting Wednesday as ""heated."" The source said the session consisted of ""members telling the administration that they screwed it up and now we have to explain it to the public.""

Another source said that it helps for the administration to hear frank talk ""from their friends that they need to get back in front of the problem.""

""No more excuses, just get it done,"" the source said.

The administration is facing a bipartisan wall of criticism about the plan cancellations. President Obama said repeatedly when he was selling the Affordable Care Act to the public that anyone who likes their plan can keep it.

What he didn't explain is that if any of those plans were modified after early 2010, they would be subject to ObamaCare requirements. Many plans have since been canceled because they did not meet the requirements -- customers are being offered new, and presumably better, plans in exchange, but some of them are considerably more expensive.

Bill Clinton fueled the debate on Tuesday when he said in an interview that Obama should find a way to ""honor the commitment"" to let people keep their current health plans.

On the heels of that statement, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., joined the call to reinstate those policies. Feinstein announced that she's co-sponsoring a bill by Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., that would reverse the cancellations by requiring insurance companies to continue to offer all current policies as of Dec. 31, 2013.

There are certainly still divisions among Democrats about the need to address the cancellations. Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y., said Wednesday that the House GOP bill coming up for a vote on Friday is merely an attempt to undermine the health law.

House Speaker John Boehner, though, said Wednesday that both chambers could soon move to pass bills addressing the cancellations.

""We're going to move a bill through the House this week. I'm optimistic that the Senate ... [is] starting to see some momentum over there to move a similar bill,"" he said. ""This is not about politics. These are about real people in our districts that are being harmed by ObamaCare. It's time to fix this law.""

Support among 18- to 29-year-olds slips as Obama organizes White House youth summit.

Poll shows Millennials fear health care law means they will have to pay more

Less than a third currently without health insurance say they%27re likely to enroll in the exchange

WASHINGTON — President Obama is bleeding support among Millennials just as he begins a renewed push to boost enrollment under his health care law, according to a Harvard Institute of Politics poll published Wednesday.

The new poll shows that Obama's approval rating with 18- to 29-year-olds now stands at 41%, a dramatic 11-point drop from April. Fifty-four percent said they disapprove of the president's performance.

The Harvard pollsters noted that during the time they conducted their latest survey of young Americans, national polls of the general population showed that Obama's approval rating hovered between 37% and 40%.

Support from young voters was crucial to Obama's two successful presidential campaigns.

Perhaps more troubling for Obama, the poll showed 40% of young Americans believe Obamacare will bring worse care, 51% believe it will bring higher costs and 57% said they disapprove of the president's signature law.

""Although Millennials have held firm in their approval of the president in past polls, we are now seeing a sea change among this critical demographic,"" said Trey Grayson, director of Harvard Institute of Politics.

Among the 18- to 29-year-olds currently without health insurance, less than a third say they're likely to enroll in the exchange. Thirteen percent say they will definitely enroll, 16% say they will probably enroll, and 41% say they are split 50-50 on whether they will enroll, according to the poll.

The latest sobering poll numbers come as Obama took part in a youth summit at the White House on Wednesday, where he encouraged uninsured young people to sign up for health care. Enrolling plenty of young, healthy people is considered critical to making the Affordable Care Act a success.

During a speech earlier on Wednesday on the economy, Obama downplayed the importance of polls, while highlighting that more than 3 million young Americans under the age of 26 have been able to stay on their parents' plan as a result of the law and hundreds of thousands of Americans--including many who have never had health insurance--are poised to be signed up for coverage by Jan. 1.

""It is these numbers -- not the ones in any poll -- that will ultimately determine the fate of this law,"" Obama said.

John Della Volpe, polling director at the Harvard Institute of Politics, however said that it's ""absolutely the case"" that Obama has not been effective in communicating to young Americans about his health law.



""There are very few aspects of the health care initiative that they approve of,"" Della Volpe said.

The poll of 2,089 young Americans was conducted Oct. 30 through Nov. 11. The margin of error is +/- 2.1 percentage points."

Three years after President Obama’s landmark law was passed, the state unveiled the first details Thursday on what many Californians can expect to pay for coverage from 13 health plans offering policies in the state’s exchange, in which as many as 5 million people will shop for coverage next year.

Developments in California are being watched carefully around the country as an important indicator of whether the healthcare law can deliver on its promise to expand health coverage at an affordable price. Many Republicans, insurance executives and other critics of the law have been warning that consumers are in for a shock next year when insurance companies raise rates to comply with the law’s many new requirements.

Supporters were upbeat after an initial look at the proposed premiums, while critics remain unimpressed.

“These rates are way below the worst-case gloom-and-doom scenarios we have heard,” said Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California, the state agency implementing the healthcare law. “But let’s be clear, some consumers will have prices that go up. There may be some sticker shock.”

The new government-run market is aimed at many of the state’s uninsured and at Californians who already purchase their own health insurance. The majority of Californians receive health coverage from their employers and are not among those targeted for enrollment.

The health plans selected by the state will sell uniform benefits, each offering four broad categories of coverage called Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze.

Platinum policies will offer the most comprehensive benefits and carry the highest prices, followed by Gold, Silver and Bronze. The Bronze package will have the lowest premiums, but people would be on the hook for a greater share of their medical bills. The rates revealed Thursday still must be reviewed by state regulators.

Advertisement

Within each of those four benefit categories, plans will have the same co-pays, deductibles and limits on out-of-pocket medical expenses.

As a result, consumers will be able to compare insurance prices in their regions more easily, once these rates are finalized by July.

Advertisement

Consumers shopping in the exchange will have three to six health insurance plans to choose from in each of the state’s 19 regions.

In the south Los Angeles County region, for instance, rates for a 40-year-old purchasing a Silver plan ranged from $242 a month through Health Net Inc. to $325 a month through Kaiser Permanente. Overall, Los Angeles County had the lowest premiums statewide for the Silver plans.

Advertisement

The average premium for individual plans sold through EHealthInsurance in California last year was $177 a month. Covered California said the average premium for the three lowest Silver plans statewide was $321 a month, albeit for more comprehensive benefits.

Overall, state officials said they can’t estimate yet how much rates will rise on average. Blue Shield of California, one of the winning bidders in the exchange, said its existing individual policyholders would pay about 13% more, on average, for coverage in the state marketplace.

Advertisement

These rates “came in below what people legitimately expected them to be,” said Paul Markovich, Blue Shield’s chief executive.

Comparing the proposed rates for next year with current premiums is difficult, officials and experts agree, because the healthcare law mandates next year’s plans to offer richer benefits and to limit consumers’ out-of-pocket expenses.

Advertisement

Democrats in Washington were quick to hold up California’s announcement as a sign that the federal healthcare law is working and bringing a healthy dose of competition to a dysfunctional insurance market in which millions of people have been denied coverage because of their medical history or subjected to punishing rate hikes year after year.

Most Republican-led states have resisted the healthcare law and declined to set up their own state exchanges. Instead, they have opted for the federal government to step in.

Starting in January, most Americans must have health insurance or pay a penalty under the federal law.

Some industry experts said California’s outlook on rates remains far too optimistic in light of the hefty increases some consumers will see.

Advertisement

“California has no right to declare victory on rates,” said Robert Laszewski, a healthcare consultant in Virginia. He said the sample premiums released by Covered California were about 50% higher than rates for the most commonly sold health plans in the individual market primarily because of increased benefit requirements. “If rates come in higher, it speaks to the sustainability of the Affordable Care Act.”

Federal premium subsidies will ease the bite on many people’s wallets. In California, individuals earning less than about $16,000 a year will qualify for an expansion of Medi-Cal, the state’s Medicaid program for the poor. Above that threshold, individuals making less than $46,000 a year and families earning below $94,000 annually will qualify for federal subsidies.

Advertisement

One of the bigger risks is that high premiums turn off healthier, middle-income households that aren’t eligible for that federal assistance and have to pay the full premium. Rates could skyrocket if the exchange fails to enroll enough of those people to offset the higher costs of sicker, poorer policyholders.

Katharine King, 59 and a self-employed concert and event producer in Santa Monica, already pays $497 a month for her individual health insurance from Anthem Blue Cross. She wouldn’t qualify for federal premium help based on her income. Using the state’s online calculator, which doesn’t yet reflect the final rates, her premiums could shoot up to nearly $600 a month next year.

Advertisement

“The Affordable Care Act is still not all that affordable unless you qualify for a federal subsidy, which I will not,” King said. “It will likely be another case of the middle class kind of getting screwed.”

Alfredo Ceron, 44, an uninsured painter in Los Angeles, has less to worry about with these rates. He said he earns about $100 a day when he has work, which means the federal government would pick up most of the tab for him and his two adult children who still live at home.

“I’d like to get my family covered,” he said while waiting in line at a recent downtown festival to get more information about the new insurance options.

The 13 health plans selected by the state include all four of California’s largest insurance companies. They are Kaiser Permanente, Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Shield and Health Net.

The other nine health plans selected were smaller regional players and insurers that have traditionally served lower-income and Medi-Cal patients. They are Alameda Alliance for Health, Chinese Community Health Plan, Contra Costa Health Services, L.A. Care Health Plan, Molina Healthcare, Sharp Health Plan, Valley Health Plan, Ventura County Health Care Plan and Western Health Advantage.

In Los Angeles County, which was divided into two regions, six companies will compete for policyholders. They are Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Shield, Health Net, Kaiser Permanente, L.A. Care and Molina.

California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said he was troubled by the lack of choice in some markets. “There are only three statewide health insurers selling in Covered California,” Jones said, “which means less statewide competition than we’d hoped to see in the new marketplace.”

But as President Obama travels across the continent next week, so will his predecessor, George W. Bush.

Mr. Bush, who made fighting AIDS in Africa a top goal of his administration, will take a trip there — his third since leaving office — as part of a program to combat cervical cancer. He will leave late next week for Zambia, where he will help refurbish a clinic, and then head to Tanzania, where his wife, Laura Bush, is organizing a forum for African first ladies.

Mr. Bush will overlap briefly on July 2 with Mr. Obama in Tanzania, the last stop on the current president’s itinerary after Senegal and South Africa. There are no plans for the two to see each other, but Michelle Obama has agreed to attend the first ladies’ forum with Mrs. Bush in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania’s largest city, to promote women’s education, health and economic empowerment.

“It’s coincidental that we have two American presidents on the continent at the same time – in the same country at the same time – but it’s indicative of a continued commitment, which is great news,” said Hannah Abney, communications director for the George W. Bush Presidential Center. “It wasn’t planned. It really was coincidental. But we’re really excited about it.”

Africa was a personal priority for Mr. Bush during his presidency, overshadowed by Iraq, terrorism and other issues but one of the few areas where he drew praise across party lines. His Millennium Challenge program steered billions of dollars in development aid to countries that committed to reform. His President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or Pepfar, directed lifesaving drugs and other care to millions with H.I.V. and was called the largest humanitarian health effort ever undertaken by any country.

As a result, Mr. Bush remains more popular in Africa than at home, and he has taken pride in his efforts there. He devoted a substantial part of his newly opened presidential museum, outside Dallas at Southern Methodist University, to an exhibit about Pepfar. And global health has been a top focus of the former president’s public policy institute.

Teaming up with Pepfar, the United Nations, Susan G. Komen for the Cure and pharmaceutical companies, Mr. Bush helped form Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon, which is devoted to curbing cervical cancer and breast cancer. It started in Zambia in 2011 and expanded to Botswana in 2012.

Last year, Mr. and Mrs. Bush helped refurbish a clinic in Kabwe, Zambia, where nearly 30,000 women have been treated since, according to his presidential center. They will help renovate and reopen another clinic on July 1, this time in Livingstone, Zambia; a team of four Southern Methodist University students left Friday to work on the reconstruction.

Mr. Bush’s interest in Africa coincides with that of his own predecessor, Bill Clinton, who has spent much of his own time since office on programs to provide help there. “It was a critical part of his administration,” Ms. Abney said of Mr. Bush. “It’s also something he and Mrs. Bush feel personally about. They feel a commitment to the people there.”"

USA TODAY

President Obama deals with a pair of knotty problems Monday: Tensions in the Middle East, and the possibility of a government shutdown in the United States.

In the late morning, Obama discusses the Iranian nuclear program during an Oval Office meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

The Netanyahu visit comes three days after Obama spoke by phone with Iranian President Hasan Rouhani, the first direct contact between American and Iranian leaders in more than three decades.

Obama and Rouhani ordered their staffs to explore new talks on an agreement over Iran's nuclear program -- though Netanyahu and other Israeli officials warn that Iran is still seeking the means to make nuclear weapons.

Other Obama-Netanyahu topics: Talks about chemical weapons removal in Syria, and the long-standing dispute between Israelis and Palestinians.

""The president looks forward to discussing with Prime Minister Netanyahu the progress on final status negotiations with the Palestinians, as well as developments in Iran, Syria, and elsewhere in the region,"" says the White House schedule.

The White House adds: ""Prime Minister Netanyahu's visit is a demonstration of the deep and enduring bonds between the United States and Israel, and our close coordination on a range of security issues.""

Obama and Netanyahu, along with Vice President Biden, will also have a working lunch.

Later Monday, Obama meets with his Cabinet, with the prospect of a government shutdown on the agenda.

Monday is the last day of the fiscal year, and the Republican-run House passed a new spending plan over the weekend that calls for a one-year delay of the new health care plan — a condition that Obama and the Democratic-run Senate reject.

If the parties are unable to strike a deal by midnight, parts of the government will shut down.

Tuesday is also a big day for the health care plan — the opening of market exchanges that are the key to financing the project."

The life of the girl and the fetus are at high risk

Abortions for medical reasons have been outlawed since the 1973 military coup

The Chilean Senate rejected three bills last year that would have eased the total ban on abortions

SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — The case of a pregnant 11-year old girl who was raped in Chile by her mother's partner has set off a national debate about abortion in one of the most socially-conservative countries in Latin America.

Chileans were outraged on Friday after state TV reported that the girl is 14 weeks pregnant and was raped repeatedly over two years. Police in the remote southern city of Puerto Montt arrested her mother's partner, who confessed to abusing the fifth grader. The case was brought to their attention by the pregnant child's maternal grandmother.

Doctors say the girl's life and that of the fetus are at high risk. But in Chile, ending the pregnancy is not an option.

Chile allowed abortions for medical reasons until they were outlawed in 1973 by Gen. Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship. The current government of conservative President Sebastian Pinera has opposed any loosening of the prohibition.

Many Chileans were venting outrage on social media Friday. Some started an online campaign to demand legalization of abortion in cases of rape or health risks for the mother.

""When I heard about this little girl my first reaction was to support abortion because I think it's the best option in this case,"" said Eduardo Hernandez, a 30-year-old web designer.

""It's the first online petition I've signed in my life, but I think this case really deserves it,"" Hernandez said. ""We should have a law. I hope this case serves as precedent to have a serious discussion about abortion.""

The Chilean Senate rejected three bills last year that would have eased the absolute ban on abortions.

One of the bills would have permitted abortion if two doctors said it was needed because of risks to a mother's life or other medical reasons, such as a fetus with low chances of survival. Another one of the measures that was rejected would have allowed abortion in the event of rape.

Forty years after a brutal dictatorship, Chile remains firmly conservative in social matters. It legalized divorce in 2004, becoming one of the last nations in the world to grant married couples that right.

""Chile is a country that has modernized when it comes to its economy, but when it comes to its social and political culture, it has become stagnant and this is seen with the abortion issue,"" said Marta Lagos, head of the Santiago-based pollster Mori.

""It's a country that is adverse to change, that panics with any change, which is seen as a threat,"" Lagos said. ""The weight of Catholicism is still a major issue and we also have a millenary indigenous culture that always lived alienated from the rest of world. We're part of that millenary culture of isolation.""

The Roman Catholic Church retains a strong influence over society, although it has lost credibility since 2010, when four men alleged that they were abused by one of Chile's most revered priests when they were between 14 and 17 years old.

Pinera announced measures last year to combat child abuse, responding to a popular outcry over a spike in reports of these crimes. He toughened penalties on convicted pedophiles, increased the forensic institute's budget and created a children's ombudsman to protect their rights.

His center-right government also banned convicted pedophiles from working near children under a law that also requires those convicted of sexually abusing minors to be registered in a database. Reports of sexual abuse of children under the age of 14 rose by 22 percent in the first half of 2012.

But change comes slowly in Chile. An anti-discrimination law was stuck in Congress for seven years and only passed in 2012 after the killing of a gay man who was beaten by attackers who carved swastikas into his body.

""The Chilean elite is very conservative and this has had an influence in Congress,"" said Patricio Navia, a Chilean political scientist who teaches at New York University. ""Laws, therefore, change at a much slower pace than the rest of Chilean society. Because society is much less conservative than it was 15 or 20 years ago.""

Former president Michelle Bachelet, the frontrunner in the Nov. 17 presidential elections, favors legalizing abortion in cases of rape or risks to the health of the mother or the child. She spent the past several years heading the U.N. agency for women.

Her opponent, former Economy Minister Pablo Longueira, was close to Pinochet. He opposes abortion and the so-called day-after pill.

Daniel Alvarado, a prosecutor for the public ministry, told state TV that the case of the pregnant 11-year-old would be treated as a rape in any circumstance because at that age a person ""doesn't have maturity to consent to a sexual relationship within law.""

""It's not possible for any person at that age to have the capacity to understand the consequences on an act of that nature,"" Alvarado added.

In Latin America, only Cuba, Uruguay and some local governments make early abortions accessible to all women.

Uruguay recently passed a law authorizing elective abortions in the first three months of pregnancy in the most liberal law of its kind in Latin America. Passage of the law was widely seen as a landmark for a region in which many countries outlaw abortion in all circumstances."

(CNN) —

Doctors Without Borders is pulling out of Somalia after more than two decades because of frequent attacks on its staff, the aid group said Wednesday.

The group, internationally known by its French name, Medecins Sans Frontieres, has worked in the nation since 1991.

It said civilian leaders tolerate or “condone the killing, assaulting and abducting ” of aid workers.

“The same actors with whom MSF must negotiate minimum guarantees to respect its medical humanitarian mission have in some cases played a role in the abuses against MSF staff, either through direct involvement or tacit approval, particularly but not exclusively in south-central Somalia,” it said.

In 2011, two MSF members were killed in Mogadishu, and their convicted killer was released early, the group said.

Aid worker dies after attack in South Sudan

In addition, 14 other staff members have been killed and dozens of MSF’s ambulances and medical facilities have been attacked, the group said.

“In choosing to kill, attack, and abduct humanitarian aid workers, these armed groups, and the civilian authorities who tolerate their actions, have sealed the fate of countless lives in Somalia,” said Dr. Unni Karunakara, MSF’s international president. “… The situation in the country has created an untenable imbalance between the risks and compromises our staff must make, and our ability to provide assistance to the Somali people.”

The aid agency had a staff of about 1,500 in the nation to provide various services, including health care, malnutrition treatment, surgery and relief supplies.

Somalia has been plagued by a long-running struggle between government forces and Al-Shabaab, a militant Islamist group with connections to al Qaeda. It has waged a war to implement a stricter form of Islamic law in the country.

Two years ago, Somali and African forces pushed the militants out of the capital, Mogadishu, raising hopes of a return to relative security after about 20 years of violence.

But the militants have maintained control of large chunks of southern and central Somalia, where they stage attacks.

Until last year, Somalia had not had an effective government since dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown in 1991.

Editor's note: The following commentary originally appeared on RedState.com.

As bankrupt as elected Republican leadership is in Washington vis-à-vis domestic policy, they are completely clueless as it relates to foreign policy.

While America continues to become an economic and moral wasteland under this regime, Obama is attempting to spend American treasure helping one nefarious side of an Islamic civil war in Syria – one which involves Iran-allied supporters of Hezbollah (Assad regime) vs. predominantly Al Qaeda affiliated rebels.

Astoundingly, most GOP leaders are either siding with Obama or are totally insouciant to this reckless fomenting of an Islamic insurrection. Instead of fighting ObamaCare, they are allowing Obama to distract from the upheaval at home by focusing on this inane escapade in Syria.

Most media figures discuss the current foreign policy debate in broad platitudes pitting so-called neo-conservatives vs. libertarians, hawks vs. doves, or interventionists vs. isolationists. But these labels are non-sequiturs to the reality of the current debate.

More On This... Kerry, Hagel to make case for Syria strike

Most mainstream conservatives are not Ron Paul libertarians who don’t support any war on terror. Quite the contrary, we support a robust intervention to repel Islamic terrorism when it threatens our interests. But in the case of Libya, Syria, and Egypt, we are actually intervening on behalf of our enemies.

Granted, Syria is more complicated than the other two examples. Bashar Assad is a sworn enemy of the United States, the closest ally of Iran, and a prolific exporter of terror.

In a perfect world, it would be great to overthrow him and stick it to Iran (and their Russian allies). But the reality is that the strongest elements of the insurgency are saturated with Al Qaeda affiliated extremists, backed by Pan-Islamist Turkish President Recep Erdogen, much like the insurgencies in other countries.

Why place American money and weapons in the hands of people who will be just as adversarial to our interests as the current regime? This is not a matter of opposing intervention for the sake of isolationism; it is a matter of not supporting intervention that is either superfluous or deleterious to our national interests.

A “hawkish” stance towards Assad is a dovish stance towards Al Qaeda. As Sarah Palin noted, in a battle with Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah on one side and Al-Qaeda and Turkey on the other, let Allah sort it out.

This should be a slam dunk opportunity for GOP leaders to oppose a wrongheaded and unpopular intervention, while shifting the focus back to the ObamaCare civil war at home.

Yet, House leaders are either ambivalent or downright supportive of Obama’s planned strike on behalf of Al Qaeda.

In the Senate, Mitch McConnell put out his signature mealy-mouthed parsing of words, declining to take a stand on any contentious issue:

“Today the President advised me that he will seek an authorization for the use of force from the Congress prior to initiating any combat operations against Syria in response to the use of chemical weapons. The President’s role as commander-in-chief is always strengthened when he enjoys the expressed support of the Congress.”

So much for the clout and power of being “GOP Leader:”

Our only interest in Syria is ensuring that as many Islamists on both sides are killed and keep each other busy so they can’t affect our national interests or threaten Israel.

As long as the war is contained to Syria, a stalemate is the best outcome for our purposes so that neither Russia, Iran, Al Qaeda or other Islamists claim an outright victory.

Sadly, in a world of seven billion, there are innocent people killed on a daily basis due to civil wars. But we lack the resources or strategic plan to help those people in Syria without gratuitously tipping the scales to one of our arch enemies.

Some conservatives are concerned about evincing an image of weakness to our enemies by not following through with the ‘red line’ threat. Undoubtedly, they are correct about Obama’s self-contradictory policy in a wrongheaded intervention. But it is still a wrongheaded intervention, and the fact that he made the threat to begin with should not engender a need to fix that bad policy with another bad policy decision.

When Congress returns from the August recess, Republicans should vote with a unified voice against this ridiculous escapade, and summarily reconvene the fight against ObamaCare.

Our freedom and way of life should take priority over bailing out a beleaguered group of Muslim Brotherhood and Al Qaeda fighters. It’s time Republicans realize that."

The Daily Beast first reported that, according to a U.S. senator and unnamed administration officials, the administration has temporarily suspended most of the $1.3 billion in military aid, as well as the delivery of weapons and economic aid amid a review of the financial support.

The office of Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., seemed to back up this claim. An aide to Leahy, in a statement to Fox News Radio, echoed what was reported in The Daily Beast -- that Leahy's subcommittee ""was told that the transfer of military aid was stopped, that this is current practice, not necessarily official policy, and there is no indication of how long it will last.""

But White House officials said Tuesday that no decisions have been made on whether to ""cut or postpone"" aid.

Spokesman Josh Earnest said reports that suggest an aid cut-off are ""not accurate."" He confirmed that Obama planned to hold a Cabinet meeting Tuesday afternoon, though, to discuss Egypt aid.

Pentagon spokesman George Little also said ""no changes have been decided.""

""I am unaware of any de facto suspension of assistance. I don't know where that came from,"" he said of the reports of an aid cut-off.

However, if true, the move to temporarily suspend aid would be a significant step. To date, officials have said that aid is merely under review, and that they would not make a determination on whether the ouster of ex-President Mohammed Morsi qualifies as a coup -- because such a finding would, under U.S. law, require the administration to cut off aid.

The Daily Beast report indicates that the administration, for the short-term anyway, is treating the overthrow like a coup in all but name.

One administration official reportedly told the Daily Beast: ""The decision was we're going to avoid saying it was a coup, but to stay on the safe side of the law, we are going to act as if the designation has been made for now. By not announcing the decision, it gives the administration the flexibility to reverse it.""

The conflicting claims, and the possibility that the government has a distinct public and private approach to the crisis in Egypt, only add to the confusion over what the administration's policy actually is.

Violence exploded in Egypt, as the military and Muslim Brotherhood backers of Morsi clashed in the streets, while President Obama was on vacation in Martha's Vineyard. The president returned to find himself pulled in both directions by vocal members of Congress. Some, like Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., say the administration should clearly label the ouster a coup and suspend aid. Others argue the administration, despite misgivings about the military's handling of the situation, should nevertheless sustain aid in order to prevent the Brotherhood from taking power.

Yet the White House and State Department, in public, say their policy of not making a determination on whether a coup had taken place has not changed.

""We have determined that it is not in the best interest of the United States to make that determination,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday, adding that aid is under review.

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said a separate New York Times report that said economic aid programs are on hold is incorrect.

She acknowledged that roughly $585 million in military aid has not yet been obligated.

""But it would be inaccurate to say that a policy decision has been made with respect to the remaining assistance funding,"" she said.

One senior Capitol Hill staffer explained to Fox News that the remaining money in the Egypt aid pot for this year ""may not have been stopped yet, but we built in the ability to push it through fast or to slow the line down to get their attention. It's diplomacy.""

The money expires if it is not spent by Oct. 1."

Dionne Jr.: Conservatives contradict themselves on American power,"Do conservatives still believe in American greatness?

The question is not intended to discourage the healthy debate being pushed by Rand Paul and his allies over whether Republicans in the George W. Bush years were too eager to deploy our country’s armed forces overseas. After the steep costs of the Iraq war, it is a very necessary discussion.

But Paul has inadvertently called our attention to a deep contradiction within American conservatism.

Those who share Paul’s philosophical orientation are quite right in seeing the rise of American power in the world as closely linked to the rise of the New Deal-Great Society state at home. But this means that those who want the United States to play a strong role in global affairs need to ask themselves if their attitudes toward government’s role in our country, which are similar to Paul’s, are consistent with their vision of American influence abroad.

After World War II, there was a rough consensus in America, confirmed during Dwight Eisenhower’s presidency in the 1950s, in favor of an energetic national government.

We emerged from the war as a global power that had learned lessons from the Great Depression. Government action could lessen the likelihood of another disastrous economic downturn and build a more just and prosperous society at home by investing in our people and our future.

Thus did the Marshall Plan and the GI Bill go hand in hand. The Marshall Plan eased Western Europe’s recovery from the devastation of war, thereby protecting friendly governments and opening new markets for American goods. The GI Bill educated a generation of veterans, spurring prosperity from the bottom up by enabling millions to join a growing middle class.

Eisenhower built on these achievements by creating the first college loan program and launching the interstate highway system. It’s no accident that the former was established by the National Defense Education Act while the latter was known as the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act.

Lyndon Johnson operated in the same tradition. It’s worth remembering that passage of the landmark civil rights acts was helped along by our competition with the Soviet Union. We realized we could not appeal to the nonwhite, nonaligned parts of the world if we practiced racism at home.

And we fought poverty — for moral reasons but also because we wanted to show the world that we could combine our market system with economic justice. We forget that we succeeded. A strengthened Social Security system combined with Medicare slashed poverty rates among the elderly. Food stamps dealt with a real problem of hunger in our nation while Medicaid brought regular health care to millions who did not have it before.

Through it all, Keynesian economics kept our economy humming while widely shared prosperity created the sense of national solidarity that a world role required.

Paul and his allies deserve credit for consistency. They are against the entire deal.

“As government grows, liberty becomes marginalized,” Paul declared at the Conservative Political Action Conference, which announced Saturday that the libertarian senator from Kentucky had placed first in its 2016 presidential straw poll. I think the evidence of all the years since World War II proves Paul flatly wrong. But then I am not a conservative.

But what of conservatives who endorse continued American global leadership but would drastically reduce government’s investments in our citizens and our infrastructure, in economic security and in health care?

Do they honestly think voters will endorse the military spending they seek even as they throw 40 million to 50 million of our fellow citizens off health insurance and weaken health coverage for our elderly? Can they continue to deny that their goal of an internationally influential America demands more revenue than they currently seem willing to provide? Have conservatives on the Supreme Court pondered what eviscerating the Voting Rights Act would do to the image of our democracy around the globe?

And do conservatives who say they favor American greatness think they are strengthening our nation and its ability to shape events abroad with an ongoing budget stalemate created by their refusal to reach agreement with President Obama on a deal that combines spending cuts and new taxes? Would they rather waste the next three years than make any further concessions to a president the voters just reelected?

Rand Paul is very clear on the country he seeks. Conservatives who reject his approach to foreign policy need to consider where the strong America they honor came from in the first place.

As Breitbart News’ Mike Flynn wrote Thursday, Kevin Appleby, Director of Migration Policy for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) is coordinating the Church’s initiative to apply political pressure to Congress to pass an immigration reform law that will include a pathway to citizenship.

According to its USCCB website, Migration and Refugee Services (MRS) “is charged with assisting the bishops in the development and promotion of migration policy positions within the context of the Church’s social teaching:”

MRS works with grassroots Catholic networks across the US to promote fair immigration and refugee policies, advocates for the passage of comprehensive immigration reform, engages in the fight against human trafficking, develops initiatives aimed at educating Catholics on the Church’s teaching on migration, and assists the U.S. Catholic bishops in carrying the voice of the Church to Congress and the Administration.

Among the coalitions with which MRS/USCCB is closely aligned is the Justice for Immigrants Campaign which is the “boots on the ground” group that is “designed to unite and mobilize a growing network of Catholic institutions, individuals, and other persons of good will in support of a broad legalization program and comprehensive immigration reform.”

Even though support of amnesty is not a doctrinal matter for the Catholic Church, Justice for Immigrants has been so successful in its media campaign that it has positioned even the most conservative Catholic bishops, who have rebuked the Democrat-led federal government on Catholic doctrinal matters, such as abortion and marriage, to place their trust in essentially the same politicians in the area of comprehensive immigration reform and amnesty.

Even Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who heads the USCCB, publicly criticized Republicans during an MSNBC interview in May of 2012.

“You need to get your house in order when it comes to immigration,” Dolan said to the GOP. “You have the reputation of being fairly tough on immigrants…you’d better come up with a much saner, more civil, more just immigration policy.”

However, some of the founding member organizations of Justice for Immigrants are groups whose actions have not been aligned with Catholic doctrinal teachings, such as those on abortion and marriage.

Catholic Charities USA (CCUSA) has been under scrutiny for several years for its ties to pro-abortion leaders.

A Planned Parenthood lobbyist, Alisa LaPolt Snow, recently drew national condemnation when she told Florida state representatives that, if a baby is born alive during a botched abortion, the decision about whether to save its life “should be left up to the woman, her family, and the physician.”

LaPolt Snow’s biography, however, indicated that she served “on the board of Catholic Charities of Northwest Florida – Tallahassee.”





In July of 2011, CCUSA also confirmed to LifeSiteNews that it had hired the firm of gay lobbyist Tom Sheridan, the Sheridan Group, to work on its behalf.

Earlier that year, Catholic Charities of San Francisco had invited a number of pro-abortion lawmakers to its annual Loaves and Fishes fundraiser, including several with 100 percent pro-abortion voting records with NARAL. In addition, it had been previously discovered that the director of programs of San Francisco Catholic Charities had adopted children with his gay partner and was publicly supported by the charity’s leaders.

According to LifeSiteNews, Sister Jeannine Gramick, founder of New Ways Ministry, a dissident group, said, “Catholic Charities in general have been the most progressive wing of the church other than the nuns.”

CCUSA also pressed the Catholic faithful to support passage of ObamaCare “immediately,” even though the law lacked a provision that excluded funding of abortion.

Pope Benedict XVI had issued an apostolic letter last December that directed Caritas Internationalis, the umbrella group that represents CCUSA and Catholic Relief Services, to cease practices that are inconsistent with Church teaching. The former pope warned diocesan bishops and parish priests about the increase in charitable services to the poor becoming integrated with practices that are inconsistent with Church doctrine.

Catholic Relief Services (CRS), a Justice for Immigrants member organization, has also been at the center of a scandal this year regarding the funding of organizations that promote abortion and birth control. According to LifeSiteNews, CRS has denied any direct involvement in either funding or the distribution of items related to abortion or contraception.

Last week, LifeSiteNews reported, however, that CRS is a dues-paying member and on the board of directors of MEDiCAM, an organization that has supported the individual training of abortion providers, and CORE Group, which has devoted half of its total budget to “family planning.”

CRS reportedly admitted this fact, and responded, “We acknowledge our differences, air our disagreements on these issues, and contribute our Catholic voice to the conversation.”

Similarly, in July, CRS reportedly gave $2.7 million to a population control organization that uses its work to distribute anti-malaria drugs and mosquito nets as a means of spreading its population control programs.

The Catholic Health Association (CHA), also a founding member of Justice for Immigrants, last month announced that it would accept the White House’s “accommodation” for religious employers that opposed the HHS contraception and abortifacients mandate, even though the bishops said the final rule failed to resolve several key concerns for them.

Sister Carol Keehan, president and CEO of CHA had also supported the passage of ObamaCare, even after the USCCB withdrew its backing because of concerns about whether the health reform law would be used to subsidize abortions.

Though not specifically mentioned as a “member organization” of Justice for Immigrants, the Nuns on the Bus, a group of Catholic nuns that espouses liberal social policies, held a national bus tour for comprehensive immigration reform this summer.

Last year, the Nuns spoke out against Congressman Paul Ryan’s budget proposal which, they said, favored wealthy Americans at the expense of the poor. Following that tour, Sister Simone Campbell, leader of the Nuns, appeared on “The Colbert Report” and was a prime-time speaker at the Democrat National Convention, despite the fact that the DNC openly promoted abortion and same-sex marriage.

Given the backing of many well-known “Catholic” organizations, the Church’s political advocacy for immigration is significant. As Breitbart News’ Flynn noted, the “support of amnesty seems broader and more coordinated than its actions against an ObamaCare mandate requiring coverage of contraception. In recent years, the Church has been more vocal in its criticism of abortion, but even that seems muted in comparison with current plans on immigration reform.”"

Just call him Bo the Easter pooch.

First lady Michelle Obama took her best friend, first dog Bo Obama, on a pre-Easter visit today to military families staying at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in the Maryland suburbs of Washington.

As part of her ongoing effort to support military families, Mrs. O dropped in at the Fisher House, where families stay while their family members are being treated, and also visited some of the wounded warriors being cared for at the giant medical center.

She came bearing cookies, tickets to the 135th White House Easter Egg Roll (this year it's on April 1, April Fool's Day), and words of praise for the Fisher Houses at military medical centers around the country.

""As you all know, they are just so important to families who are recuperating,"" she said, according to the White House transcript. ""They're doing some great stuff... And all around the country, they are as beautiful and as welcoming and as comforting as you guys are experiencing here.""

Her surprise guest was Bo, the first family's 4-year-old Portuguese water dog, who, as usual, was a big hit. Still, Obama had to reassure some of the little ones nervous about big, bouncy dogs.

""Bo is a sweetheart, but he's big; he's bigger than some kids realize,"" said Mrs. O, dressed in a violent sweater set and a long, pleated skirt. ""But that's all he is, is big. He's really a big baby. He's a big baby. He can do tricks if he's paying attention.""

Bo had other ideas. ""No, no, he's staying down,"" she said to laughter. ""He can do some tricks, trust me."""

Editor’s Note: Eugene Declercq is professor and assistant dean at the Boston University School of Public Health. He is founder of Birth by the Numbers, a website that provides information on childbirth practices and outcomes in the U.S. and abroad.

(CNN) —

Across the U.S., many families know firsthand how high maternity care costs are. As noted in The Times recently, giving birth in the U.S. is more expensive than any other country in the world. Total costs average $18,329 for a vaginal delivery and $27,866 for a C-section, with the bulk of the bill going to insurers. However, families with insurance still have to pay about $3400 out of pocket.

What’s ironic is we can’t even claim that the extra expense pays off in healthier mothers and babies. According to a study by the Institute of Medicine, the U.S. ranks at or near the bottom on virtually all maternity care outcomes.

Eugene Declercq

So who’s to blame for these high costs?

Partly, mothers themselves. Americans are obsessed with the notions that “newer is better” and “more technology is always a plus.” When it comes to medical technology, the U.S. public becomes Oliver Twist, continually asking, “Please, sir, I want some more.”

I was part of a team that recently conducted a pair of national surveys of mothers. Among the many questions, we asked if mothers agreed with the statement, “Newer maternity tests and treatments are generally improvements over older ones.” An overwhelming majority of mothers (74%) agreed while only 10% disagreed.

Likewise, when given the statement, “Maternity tests and treatments that work the best usually cost more than those that don’t work as well,” mothers were twice as likely to agree than disagree. Mothers were also far more likely to agree that women get too few tests during pregnancy rather than too many.

“Newer equals improvement” and “More is better than less” have long been effective marketing themes in American culture. But the problem is that in the case of medical technology, the results don’t consistently bear that out.

While other countries have set up elaborate systems to assess new medical interventions for their cost effectiveness compared to existing practices before approving them, until recently that has not been a priority in U.S. medical care. The result is that public infatuation with newer technologies merges smoothly with the medical industry’s desire to profit from providing more services.

A prime example of this problem is the failure to take advantage of midwife-led birthing centers. These have been found in the U.S. and overseas to be a safe and cost effective alternative to universal reliance on large hospitals. Freestanding birthing centers (as opposed to hospitals which refer to their maternity ward as a “birthing center”) are usually directed by midwives and are affiliated with hospitals that serve as a referral site for transfers. The cost savings stem from less reliance on expensive medications and technologies, a shorter stay (mothers typically return home within 24 hours) and lower personnel costs.

While the numbers of birthing centers have increased in the last decade, less than 1 in 300 U.S. births occur in a center. How come?

Consider who loses money if birthing centers become popular: Large hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, obstetricians and anesthesiologists – all powerful groups who believe deeply that the use of their products and services is not only a source of income, but the safest option for mothers and babies.

The result is that an array of regulatory (restrictive state licensing laws) and financial barriers (denial of insurance coverage) combined with informal constraints (hospital refusal to provide backup) limit their use.

Freestanding birthing centers aren’t for everyone. They are meant to serve women with lower risk pregnancies and there’s about a 1 in 8 chance a woman would need to be transferred to a hospital during labor. Nonetheless, it is of concern that so many women who are interested in it are denied an option that can provide a safe and far less expensive experience for mothers and babies.

Medical technology has done wonders for our lives, especially in select, high-risk cases. But rising maternity care costs reflects the downside of our societal obsession with newer, bigger and shinier technology.

The U.S. needs to seriously rethink how we approach maternity care. The first question that needs to be addressed is: Do more tests and reliance on the biggest, most expensive hospital settings actually improve the health of mothers and babies? When they do, great. But when they don’t, we need to overcome the financial, institutional and cultural barriers to use reasonable options like birthing centers.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/09/30/Cruz-vs-Gregory-5-Lessons,2013-09-30 00:00:00,['Joel B. Pollak'],Cruz vs. Gregory: 5 Lessons,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) put on a masterclass in his appearance on NBC News’ Meet the Press with David Gregory on Sunday. In less than twenty minutes, Cruz not only demolished Democrat arguments–as transmitted by the ever-eager Gregory–but also showed a keen insight into debate tactics that Republicans often lack. Here are the five key tactics, which should be studied and drilled into Republican politicians in media training.

1. Question the premise. On two separate occasions, Cruz pushed back against the implicit assumptions in questions Gregory asked–assumptions designed by Gregory to put Cruz on the defensive. In each case, Cruz challenged the question itself before answering, and then used his answer to return to the offensive.

In the first case, Gregory implied Cruz had not engaged in a “debate” about how to “change” Obamacare:

GREGORY: It’s interesting. Democrats say, “You know, the problem with Senator Cruz’s position is that it’s a purist position.” There are problems with Obamacare. The White House admits that. We talked about polling in some quarters indicating great dissatisfaction with the law, as you’re talking about in Town Hall meetings. But you have to engaged in a debate about how they change the law. What you’ve gone out and said is, “Let’s kill the law all together. Let’s de-fund it.” CRUZ: Actually, with respect, David, I think the premise of your question is wrong. It is the Democrats who have taken the absolutist position. Look, I’ve engaged– I’d like to repeal every word of the law. But that wasn’t my position, even in this fight.

That turnabout created headlines, drawing public attention to the refusal of Democrats to compromise.

In the second case, Gregory brutally distorted a remark by Cruz about Neville Chamberlain:

GREGORY: Do you regret comparing the future of Obamacare to the rise of Hitler in Nazi Germany? CRUZ: Well, the premise of your question isn’t true. I didn’t make that comparison. What I said is that there have been many voices in Washington who’ve said, “We can’t do this, we can’t do this, we can’t do this.” And I went through the contracts where, over and over again, when facing big challenges, Americans have risen to the occasion, whether it was the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World War II, whether it was going to the moon under John F. Kennedy, or whether it was winning the Cold War.

The addition of Kennedy at the end–to counter Gregory’s false Hitler reference–was a nice touch.

2. Stick to the message. Gregory wanted to make the interview all about a government shutdown. Cruz kept his own answers focused on Obamacare. That frustrated Gregory, who nearly lost his composure: “You’re making an argument….You’ve made all these arguments. My goodness, you went and spoke for 21 hours to make these arguments. You haven’t moved anyone.” Cruz, in contrast, looked calm and focused–and kept the debate on terms where he had the distinct advantage, given Obamacare’s unpopularity.

An additional note on this point: Democrats, having been through the talking-points-factory that is left-wing media training (and produces such robots as Debbie Wasserman Schultz), are very good at sticking to their message, but largely because they simply keep repeating it, regardless of the circumstances. What Cruz did was different, and more effective: he found a way to make his message relevant to each context in the debate.

3. Cite your opponents’ supporters in your favor. Gregory came armed with quotes from Republicans and Beltway conservatives who disapprove of what Cruz is doing. Cruz countered, as he did frequently on the Senate floor, with direct quotes from Democrats’ core constituents, including Teamsters Union leader James Hoffa, who has led a new surge of opposition to Obamacare from the left. Cruz’s ready access to the Hoffa quote also shows the importance of research and preparation, and reflects well on his political staff.

4. Never forget your constituency. My favorite moment in the interview was when Gregory read Cruz an extended quote from George Will, and Cruz responded by saying, effectively, that Will only represents his own view, while a Senator from Texas represents millions of voters who knew what they were getting:

GREGORY: George Will, who’s been a conservative columnist for The Washington Post and others, has been very supportive of you in the past. But he wrote this, this week. I want to have you respond to it… CRUZ: Look, I’m just trying to fight for 26 million Texans and for the American people. And I’m pretty sure George Will, in that column, argued that what we should be doing is delaying Obamacare, which is exactly what the House of Representatives just voted to do.

5. Believe that your opponent secretly agrees with you. Gregory is certainly on the left, but Cruz never treated him as an enemy. Rather, he approached the host as if he could be brought ’round, given the true facts. The above quote, about George Will, is instructive. Note that Cruz did not say that Will was wrong–instead, he found a point of agreement within Will’s column and emphasized that. By finding ways to show that his opponents might actually agree with him, Cruz encouraged even skeptical viewers to ask themselves whether they might, as well. And his supporters had plenty to cheer without watching yet another Republican guest try to earn points with the press by backtracking on previous convictions."

But unlike the Republicans who uniformly voted no to the ACA in 2010 because they feared what its success would mean for the GOP's political prospects, Democrats opposed Bush's Medicare Rx plan because it was unnecessarily complex and needlessly expensive for taxpayers. After all, the Medicare Modernization didn't just prohibit the federal government from directly negotiating with pharmaceutical companies for lower drug prices, but forced beneficiaries to purchase coverage from private insurers rather than expand the lower cost Medicare program to include the new benefit.

For those reasons and more, Medicare Part D was far more unpopular before it launched than Obamacare is now. But that changed over time. Now, 9 out of 10 seniors are happy with the program they once despised. In part, Democratic cooperation explains why.

After all, when the Bush administration spent millions of dollars on television ads beginning in 2004 to promote the new Medicare drug discount cards, Democrats didn't object. (They just asked that the Bush Department of Health and Human Services tell the truth.) Despite that history and the fact that HHS funds advertising for Medicare enrollment every fall, grandstanding GOP Senator Marco Rubio called for a halt to the current ACA TV spots, accusing HHS of ""blatant misuse of federal dollars.""

The same contrast applies to the so-called ""navigators,"" the dozens of community groups, charitable organization, hospitals and non-profits that will Americans find health insurance now just as they helped the elderly find prescription drug plans. Now, Republicans on Ohio, Georgia, Texas, West Virginia and Florida are boasting about the efforts to block the work of the navigators in their states. As Georgia Insurance Commission Ralph Hudgens crowed:



""Let me tell you what we're doing [about Obamacare.] Everything in our power to be an obstructionist."" ""We have passed a law that says that a navigator, which is a position in that exchange, has to be licensed by our Department of Insurance. The ObamaCare law says that we cannot require them to be an insurance agent, so we said fine, we'll just require them to be a licensed navigator. So we're going to make up the test, and basically you take the insurance agent test, you erase the name, you write 'navigator test' on it.""

Before the program was implemented, only 21 percent of seniors had a favorable opinion of it, and 66 percent didn't understand what the reform would mean for them. So we spent 18 months devising and implementing a campaign to explain the prescription drug benefit, prepare seniors as well as partners -- such as community groups, churches, pharmacies, insurance plans and state and local governments -- and then sign people up. A national bus tour supported each phase. The summer before enrollment (the same period that the ACA is in now) we logged more than 600,000 miles and visited 48 states. As secretary, I made 119 stops in 98 cities. I learned that with a program like the ACA, you can't count on Washington to sell it. You have to reach people where they live, work, pray and play.

As President Bush's former Secretary of Health and Human Services Mike Leavitt explained in July, the ""navigators"" were critical to the outreach campaign for Medicare Part D: Many of the same navigators then (like the AARP) are Obamacare navigators now. Ironically, President Bush and his Republican allies also counted on organization that doesn't exist anymore: ACORN.

Nevertheless, the Bush administration rollout of the Medicare drug benefit for 43 million elderly Americans was a disaster. Ohio Congressman John Boehner admitted as much to Fox News in February 2006:



""The implementation of the Medicare plan has been horrendous,""

In 2006, the bill went into effect. It was a disaster. Computer systems didn't communicate with one another. Seniors were confused. Some of the poorest and sickest enrollees -- ""dual eligibles"" who qualify for aid under both Medicare and Medicaid -- weren't able to get their drugs. It was so bad that in his 2006 State of the Union address, Bush ""said nothing about the new Medicare prescription drug program, an initiative Republicans once hoped to trumpet but has angered many seniors in its implementation,"" reported the Washington Post.

""I voted against it, but once it passed I certainly determined that I would try to do everything I could to make sure that New Yorkers understood it, could access it, and make the best of it.""

As Ezra Klein recently recounted, in a rare moment of candor the future Speaker was right:Unlike Republicans like Tim Huelskamp (R-KS) and Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) who have announced they will not answer constituents' calls for help with Obamacare, Democrats took a different approach. As then Senator Hillary Clinton reasoned in 2006:When Wisconsin Senator Kohl, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Select Committee on Aging asked his colleagues ""to put aside any partisan thoughts to work together to get this program running,"" Democratic governors were already spending billions of dollars to help out.

As the Washington Post reported in January 2006, ""Two weeks into the new Medicare prescription drug program, many of the nation's sickest and poorest elderly and disabled people are being turned away or overcharged at pharmacies, prompting more than a dozen states to declare health emergencies and pay for their life-saving medicines."" Roughly 6.4 million seniors who just days earlier had gotten their prescriptions for free faced the prospect of going without because of untrained pharmacists and computer glitches. By January 16th, 2006, the New York Times reported, many states (most of them led by Democrats) came to their rescue. ""About 20 states, including California, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and all of New England, have announced that they will help low-income people by paying drug claims that should have been paid by the federal Medicare program."" Among the governors taking action were future Obamacare foes Tim Pawlenty and Mike Huckabee, who declared a health emergency in his state of Arkansas. The fiasco prompted the Bush administration to take drastic measures:



With tens of thousands of people unable to get medicines promised by Medicare, the Bush administration has told insurers that they must provide a 30-day supply of any drug that a beneficiary was previously taking, and it said that poor people must not be charged more than $5 for a covered drug.

It's no wonder why Paul Krugman summed up the whole catastrophe as "" D for Debacle .""

The blame for that debacle has to be placed squarely at the feet of President Bush and his Republican allies who structured the Medicare Part D bill. But once the ill-conceived legislation was the law of the land, Democrats didn't stand in their way. They helped make it work. Democrats didn't go the Supreme Court, or refuse to accept coverage for millions in their states, or say no to enforcing new insurance rules or try to prevent the work of the navigators receiving federal grants to provide information and customer service to Americans.

As Chuck Todd explained in a rare act of journalism, only Republicans do that."

Ban on over-16-ounce drinks was set to take effect Tuesday

Mayor Bloomberg calls it %22portion control%22

A New York State judge says loopholes defeated the purpose

Talk about a sugar high.

New York City's soft drink sellers celebrated a sweet victory Monday when Mayor Michael Bloomberg's controversial ban on large-size sugary beverages was overturned by a New York state judge.

""We're excited. We're happy,"" said Russell Levinson, general manager of Movieworld in Queens. He said he is relieved that, at least for now, the theater doesn't have to ditch the four drink sizes that would have been banned under the new regulations.

The size limit had been set to take effect Tuesday.

On Monday afternoon, New York Supreme Court Judge Milton Tingling ruled that the city health board didn't have the authority to limit or ban a legal item under the guise of ""controlling a chronic disease.""

""The Board of Health may supervise and regulate the food supply of the city when it affects public health,"" and can do so when the city ""is facing imminent danger due to disease,"" but that was not proven in this case, Tingling said in his written decision.

The limit put a 16-ounce cap on sweetened bottled drinks and fountain beverages sold at city restaurants, delis, movie theaters, sports venues and street carts.

The size limit applied to beverages with more than 25 calories per 8 ounces. It didn't include 100% juice drinks or beverages with more than 50% milk.

""We are elated with today's decision,"" the National Association of Theatre Owners said in a written statement. ""This issue was never about obesity, nor about soda. This was all about power. The court rejected the mayor's attempt to unilaterally tell New Yorkers what to drink.""

At a news conference Monday evening, Bloomberg said he disagreed with the court decision and that the city would appeal. With a rising number of overweight and obese people, he said, ""it is reasonable and responsible to draw a line.""

Bloomberg has been going full force with his efforts to show the detriments of sweetened drinks. On Monday, he released data that showed a correlation between sugary-drink consumption and obesity.

And on Sunday, Bloomberg defended the regulation. ""We're not banning anything,"" he said on CBS' Face the Nation. ""It's called portion control.""

""All we're doing in New York is reminding you that it's not in your interest to have too many empty calories,"" he said. ""If you want to have 32 ounces, just buy two 16-ounce cups.""

The group that filed suit against the rule applauded the decision. ""The court ruling provides a sigh of relief to New Yorkers and thousands of small businesses in New York City that would have been harmed by this arbitrary and unpopular ban,"" said Chris Gindlesperger, spokesman for the American Beverage Association, one of the plaintiffs. ""With this ruling behind us, we look forward to collaborating with city leaders on solutions that will have a meaningful and lasting impact on the people of New York City.""

The suit against the city health board and health department was brought by the New York Statewide Coalition of Hispanic Chambers of Commerce, the New York Korean-American Grocers Association, the Soft Drink and Brewery Workers Union Local 812, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the National Restaurant Association, the National Association of Theatre Owners of New York Stateand the American Beverage Association.

Soft-drink sellers had taken different approaches to the coming ban. Some bought smaller cups. Some planned to ask patrons to sweeten their own beverages.

Movieworld 's Levinson had planned to wait out the 90-day grace period before making any changes.

He said the fact that the ban wouldn't affect beverages sold in grocery or convenience stores made it ""terribly unfair"" to the businesses that were covered.

Levinson also worried about longer-term ramifications. The legislation had opened up ""the possibility of (Bloomberg) or someone like him — or the health department — creating similar laws on candy or popcorn,"" he said. ""It's opening up a door that can lead to the government really telling you what you can and can't drink and eat.""

By Monday, Brother Jimmy's BBQ, a restaurant chain with five Big Apple outposts, had already bought 1,000 new 16-ounce cups to replace its 24-ounce cups. It already recycled the old cups, so it's stuck with the smaller size.

Bloomberg said he hopes soft-drink sellers in general will follow the ban voluntarily. ""I don't think it'll hurt your bottom line,"" the mayor said. Even if it did, he said, saving lives is more important than profits: ""We all have an obligation to do what we can to help each other."""

Jerry Brown.

Schools will now be allowed to suspend students for bullying classmates on social networking sites, including Facebook. Assemblywoman Nora Campos (D-San Jose) introduced the legislation to update California’s anti-bullying laws.

“The increase in popularity of social networks has also brought an increase in abuse, and in some instances depression and suicide,” she said in a statement.

There was no organized opposition to her bill, AB 746, which was backed by the California State PTA and the California Teachers Assn.

Brown also signed a bill written after The Times reported on felons working in a state-financed program providing care for the elderly and disabled in their homes. The recipients were allowed to sign waivers accepting felons — often relatives or acquaintances — as their home aides. Existing law also allowed the aides to sign the waivers on the client’s behalf.

The new law, by Assemblyman David G. Valadao (R-Hanford), forbids a caregiver who has a criminal record to represent a recipient in signing such a waiver unless that person is a parent, guardian, spouse or conservator.

“The state of California should not facilitate the abuse of the elderly and disabled by convicted felons,” Valadao said in support of his measure, AB 876.

The governor also signed legislation that forces elected officials to forfeit their office if convicted of falsely claiming they have been awarded military decorations. Assemblyman Paul Cook (R-Yucaipa), a veteran of the Marines, created the measure to plug a loophole in the law.

“When politicians misrepresent themselves and make false claims of military rank and heroism, it does a tremendous disservice not only to our vets but to the public,” Cook said.

His bill, AB 167, comes a year after an appeals court struck down a federal law that made it illegal to lie about receiving military decorations. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said the federal law was an unconstitutional restraint on free speech.

Brown vetoed legislation that would have allowed senior citizens, the blind and the disabled to postpone their property tax payments. A law allowing the postponements was suspended in 2009 by then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger because of the state’s budget problems.

“Given the very significant cuts to state and local core public services that are occurring, the state cannot afford the $19.3 million that the Department of Finance estimates this bill would cost” this year, Brown wrote in vetoing ABX1 29 by Assemblyman Bob Blumenfield (D-Woodland Hills).

* Republicans deeply divided on strategy to stop or weaken health law

By Caren Bohan and Rachelle Younglai

WASHINGTON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner warned rank-and-file Republicans in a conference call on Thursday against using the threat of a government shutdown to stop the implementation of Obamacare, according to people on the call.

In the call, Boehner reminded Republicans of the political backlash their party suffered when the government shut down in 1995-1996, according to one person on the call.

Another participant in the call, Oklahoma Representative Tom Cole, said the speaker's main message was that he and other leaders were still committed to killing President Barack Obama's signature health care law but that they did not want a government shutdown.

Republicans agree strongly on their opposition to Obamacare, viewing the law as a burden to businesses that will cost jobs.

But the party has been roiled by heated debate over the strategy for trying to stop the law.

Hours before Boehner's conference call, about a third of the Republican caucus sent a letter to Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor urging them to oppose any annual spending bills that include funding for Obamacare.

Without an agreement between Congress and Obama on fresh legislation to fund federal agencies, the government could shut down on Oct. 1. Even many Republicans believe Obama would never agree to sign a spending bill that removed funding for his signature domestic policy achievement.

Cole disagrees with the idea of using a government shutdown threat to try to take aim at Obamacare but added, ""the frustration is how do you keep fighting it without taking an action that is counterproductive.""

On the call, Boehner sketched out a plan in which Republicans would pass a short-term measure to fund the government until around December while insisting on keeping in place steep cuts in spending known as the ""sequester.""

When Congress reconvenes on Sept. 9 after its summer break, Boehner said, ""Our intent is to move quickly on a short-term continuing resolution that keeps the government running and maintains current sequester spending levels.""

Earlier on Thursday, about a third of the Republican caucus sent a letter to Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor urging them to oppose any annual spending bills that include funding for Obamacare.

The letter was spearheaded by Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina and got the signatures of 80 House Republicans.

During the call, one member asked Boehner, ""Can you at least announce that you want to defund Obamacare?"" Another asked Boehner how he would get a short-term spending measure passed, according to one person on the call.

Congressional Republicans have sought repeatedly to repeal the law.

While Republicans say the law will hurt job creation, supporters view it as a landmark initiative that will extend health insurance coverage to millions of Americans.

In addition to the House lawmakers who signed the letter to Republican leaders, there is support for denying funds to Obamacare from prominent Republican senators including Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida.

During the five-week summer recess, Obamacare has been riling up constituents at town hall-style meeting in lawmakers' home districts, with both critics and supporters airing their views.

Republican Representative Tim Huelskamp of Kansas told Reuters there was a ""large divide between Republican leaders in (Washington) D.C. and Republicans in the rest of the country.""

Huelskamp, who participated in the call and agrees with using the government shutdown strategy on Obamacare, said Republican leaders were ignoring that divide ""at their own peril.""

Republican leaders have been working to find alternative ways to weaken the health law.

One idea under consideration is tying approval of an increase in the country's borrowing limit to agreement by the Obama administration to delay implementation of the measure.

An aide to Cantor, the No. 2 House Republican, told Reuters on Wednesday that the debt limit was a good ""leverage point"" to try to force action on Obamacare."

Updated 10/9/2013 at 8:00 a.m.

Washington (CNN) – There appeared to be enough votes in the House on Wednesday to approve legislation to reopen the federal government, according to an ongoing CNN survey of House members.

CNN's vote count

All 200 Democrats and 19 Republicans support passing a continuing resolution with no additional legislative strings attached that would reopen the federal government, which has been partially closed for a week over a bitter policy dispute between Republicans and Democrats on health care. With three vacancies in 435 member House, 217 votes are currently the minimum needed for the measure to win approval in the House.

CNN's vote count appears to bear out what President Barack Obama said on Monday.

""The truth of the matter is, there are enough Republican and Democratic votes in the House of Representatives right now to end this shutdown immediately with no partisan strings attached,"" Obama said.

But this does not mean a vote will happen any time soon, given that these Republicans have not indicated a willingness to try to force Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to bring a continuing resolution with no strings attached to the floor for a vote. After a meeting with Republicans on Tuesday, Republican Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma told CNN that the speaker told members there would not be a House vote on a ""clean"" government funding bill.

The clean CR is at the center of the dispute between Obama and Republicans, the latter trying to use the government shutdown as a legislative avenue to help defund the president's health care law. Many House Republicans are demanding that passage of a continuing resolution is contingent on the health care law being delayed – the first step in an effort they hope to use to dismantle it. The president and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, have said that the GOP's efforts are a non-starter.

As is the case with all vote counts, the numbers continually evolve and change by the hour and day.

Still, Boehner has maintained that there are not enough votes in the House to pass a ""clean"" CR.

""There are not the votes in the House to pass a clean CR,"" the speaker said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" ""The American people expect in Washington, when we have a crisis like this, that the leaders will sit down and have a conversation. I told my members the other day, there may be a back room somewhere, but there's nobody in it.""

Republican Rep. Charles Dent of Pennsylvania disagreed with the speaker's assessment. He told CNN on Monday that if the vote were to come to the floor, he believes it would pass.

""I believe a clean CR would pass comfortably,"" said Dent. ""I'm not here to predict the number, I think it would clear the 217 vote barrier.""

In response, Obama dared Boehner on Monday to prove that he doesn't have the votes for a clean continuing resolution.

""If Republicans and Speaker Boehner are saying there are not enough votes then they should prove it,"" Obama said. ""Let the bill go to the floor, and let's see what happens. Just vote.""

On Monday, as Democrats trumpeted other vote counts that appeared to show there are enough votes in the House to pass a clean government funding bill, a number of lawmakers began to walk back previous statements.

Republican Rep. Devin Nunes of California was one of those lawmakers. After telling Huffington Post and others that he supported a government funding bill with no strings attached, his spokesman said Monday that ""that was never the case.""

""He does not support a clean CR, does not support it, does not advocate it,"" said Jack Langer, a spokesman for Nunes.

Republicans Leonard Lance of New Jersey and Randy Forbes of Virginia, who other news outlets report have supported a clean government funding bill, told CNN on Monday that they did not back the measure.

""Reports that Randy Forbes supports a 'clean' CR are not true,"" a Forbes said. ""This was misrepresented in a story by the Virginian Pilot (newspaper), which subsequently was picked up by HuffPo and other national outlets – none of which bothered to contact our office to verify.""

Instead, Forbes has introduced legislation that would fund all of the government except Obamcare, the aide said.

Not all Republicans moved away from voting for a government funding bill with no strings attached.

Late on Monday, Republican Rep. David Reichert of Washington said he would ""continue to vote for any legislation that keeps the federal government open.""

Likewise on Tuesday, Republican Rep. Mike Coffman of Colorado announced he supported a government funding bill with no strings attached in a Denver Post opinion-editorial and Republican Rep. Walter B. Jones of North Carolina said he wished the House ""would pass a clean CR"" during an interview with MSNBC.

Other Republican members, like Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, would not confirm a report from the Miami Herald that said the lawmaker would support a clean resolution.

""The president needs to sit down and negotiate with the speaker,"" Cesar Gonzalez, a spokesman for Diaz-Balart, said. ""In the meantime, the congressman does not think it is wise to negotiate through the press.""

The 19 Republicans who support a government funding bill with no strings attached are:

Walter B. Jones, R-North Carolina: Said during an interview with MSNBC that he wished the House ""would pass a clean CR.""

Mike Coffman, R-Colorado: Announced he supported a government funding bill with no strings attached in a Denver Post opinion-editorial.

Tim Griffin, R-Arkansas: ""Tweeted the he would support a clean government funding bill.""

Bill Young, R-Florida: A spokesman tells CNN that Young would support a clean government funding bill.

Dennis Ross, R-Florida: A spokeswoman told CNN Ross would support a one-year government funding bill at sequestration levels with no strings attached.

Mike Simpson, R-Idaho: Statement: ""Similar to Sen. Rand Paul, I could support a very short-term clean CR, perhaps one or two weeks, while we continue to negotiate on a longer-term bill.""

Frank LoBiondo, R-New Jersey: LoBiondo penned an editorial in the Philadelphia Inquirer that said he supported a clean government funding bill.

Jon Runyan, R- New Jersey: Runyan penned an editorial in the Philadelphia Inquirer that said he supported a clean government funding bill.

Pete King, R-New York: Told CNN he supports passing a clean government funding bill.

Michael Grimm, R-New York: Grimm told CNN he would support a clean government funding bill.

Jim Gerlach, R-Penn.: A spokesman told CNN that Gerlach would support a clean government funding bill if it came to the floor.

Pat Meehan, R-Penn.: Statement on October 1: ""I believe it’s time for the House to vote for a clean, short-term funding bill.""

Michael Fitzpatrick, R-Penn.: Fitzpatrick penned an editorial in the Philadelphia Inquirer that said he supported a clean government funding bill.

Lou Barletta, R-Penn.: A spokesman told CNN that Barletta would vote yes if a clean government funding bill came to the floor. On Tuesday morning, the spokesman said while Barletta is now focused on passing a compromise that includes repealing of the medical device tax, it is fair to include him as a yes vote for a funding bill with no strings attached.

Charles Dent, R-Penn.: Told CNN he supports a clean government funding bill. ""I think now it's imperative that we just fund the government,"" he said.

Robert Wittman, R-Virgina: A spokeswoman tell CNN Wittman would vote yes on a clean government funding bill.

Scott Rigell, R-Virginia: Told CNN on October 1 that he supported passing a clean government funding bill.

Frank Wolf, R-Virginia: A spokesman tells CNN that Wolf will support a clean government funding bill.

David Reichert, R-Washington: October 7 statement: ""I will continue to vote for any legislation that keeps the federal government open.""

She Received The Pulitzer Prize For Commentary In']",Kathleen Parker: Obama’s monumental mistake in the shutdown,"Losing a hard-fought battle confers no dishonor, but losing a badly chosen battle is embarrassing.

And then there’s ridiculous.

Into the last category goes the decision to close the nation’s monuments to make sure that the government shutdown strikes the hearts of all The American People, whose constant invocation by pandering politicians fills one with self-loathing. (Who wants to be an “American People,” given the quality of our spokesfolksen?)

Then again, ridiculous is perhaps too generous a word. Closing the monuments, especially the World War II Memorial, can be reduced, fittingly, to a single syllable: Dumb. It is fitting because the seated patron of the Mall, Abraham Lincoln, was famously monosyllabic. In trivia you can use, more than 70 percent of the words in the Gettysburg Address are of one syllable.

In more recent history, when a group of World War II veterans recently faced barriers blocking entry to the memorial — an open space requiring not so much as an attendant — these elderly warriors took a page from their Normandy playbook and stormed the barricades.

Can there be an image more inspiring than members of this venerable club, whose living roll declines each day by about 640, pushing their way through flimsy, useless, pointless barriers to roam among pillars erected to their heroism? What was Washington thinking?

Dumb, dumb, dumb.

President Obama, whose grandfather was a World War II veteran, might have known better. We may have to close down the government, he could have said, but don’t touch the monuments.

Instead, the Office of Management and Budget ordered the barricades.

That’ll show ’em.

Among the many reasons this was so clumsy, one stands out starkly: It isn’t as though the WWII guys can always come back another day. All are in their late 80s and early 90s, and time is of the essence. Moreover, most plan these trips well in advance and at considerable expense.

Thanks to the monument liberators, Washington officials were forced to rethink their decision and removed the barriers. The American People are now free to roam their public spaces that remember sacrifices beyond most imaginations.

Optically, symbolically and every other way, this seems too little too late. Shutting out veterans from their memorial touchstone was more than a bad call, a lapse of judgment, a mere moment of tone-deafness. In reality, it may have been the tidy effort of a box-checking bureaucrat, but it reeked of the small work of a petty bully.

Ditto the closing of the D-Day cemetery in Normandy, France, where more than 9,000 Americans are buried. And this is the president who recently declared that The American People are not political pawns to be used to score political points?

Barack Obama must have been an inkling in the prescient mind of H.L. Mencken when the curmudgeon from whom all op-eds flow once described democracy as “the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard.”

While one may sympathize with Obama’s contempt for his congressional adversaries, he may have cut off his own nose with an unforced error of magnified proportions. Spite is unbecoming a president, as Richard Nixon proved in another era of national disruption. But beyond personality, it is baffling to imagine anyone thinking that the way to winning hearts and minds is by disrespecting the nation’s most beloved demographic.

I’ve often lamented the prospect of a world without my parents’ generation, not because they were perfect but because these mothers and fathers take with them a national treasure — their personal experiences and memories of the Great Depression and World War II and the lessons of sacrifice, thrift, courage and duty that defined them.

In their place, we have a bickering, twittering, snarling, snarky, toxic public square that has contaminated even our highest offices. How surreal it must seem to our oldest and wisest citizens to witness the breaking bad of America.

Nearly any but the die-hardest tea party member regrets the shuttering of the U.S. government. It was unnecessary, counterproductive and punishes all the wrong people — including federal employees, who do yeoman’s work for which they receive little credit.

Tying the defunding of Obamacare to the shutdown was folly, which sensible House Republicans knew even as they ignored their better judgment. Even so, the White House and Democrats seem determined to prove their own toughness by punishing the least deserving.

As we approach the next battle, over the debt ceiling, would that all of Washington remember the rule of the savvy negotiator: Always leave your opponent an exit.

Washington (CNN) - As the Supreme Court gets ready to issue opinions on some high profile and contentious cases, a new national poll indicates Americans are split on whether the high court is doing a good job.

According to a CNN/ORC International survey released Thursday morning, 48% of the public say they approve of the job the Supreme Court's doing, with an equal amount saying they disapprove.



There is, however, an ideological divide. Fifty-three percent of liberals and 58% of moderates, but only 37% of conservatives, say that they approve of the court.

""That's probably a reaction to last year's decision on Barack Obama's health care law,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.

In a closely watched ruling, the court upheld the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, last June.

""Before that ruling, most conservatives supported the Supreme Court, compared to only 44% of liberals. Now, most liberals approve of the court, with most conservatives saying they disapprove,"" adds Holland.

All that may change over the next week as the Supreme Court releases opinions on affirmative action, same-sex marriage, and the Voting Rights Act, cases that are sure to generate fresh controversy.

The case involving affirmative action is Fisher v. the University of Texas at Austin. Abigail Fisher individually sued the flagship state university after her college application was rejected in 2008 when she was a high school senior in Sugar Land, Texas. Fisher claims she was turned away in part because she is white, despite being more qualified than some minority applicants. The school defends its policy of considering race as one of many factors, such as test scores, community service, leadership and work experience, to ensure a diverse campus.

According to the poll, nearly seven in ten disapprove of affirmative action admissions programs at colleges and law schools that give racial preferences to minority applicants, with 29% saying they disagree.

There's an obvious partisan divide, with 49% of Democrats, 24% of independents, and just 14% of Republicans approving of such affirmative action programs. And there's a racial gap, with 51% of non-white respondents but just 19% of white respondents saying they approve of giving preferences to minority applicants.

Also in front of the Supreme Court is the Voting Rights Act, which was passed in 1965 to prevent some state and local governments from using rules and procedures which prevented many black Americans from voting. The key enforcement provision of the measure was reauthorized in 2006 for another 25 years, with all or parts of 16 states covered under the ""pre-clearance"" provision.

A county in Alabama subsequently filed suit, saying the federal monitoring of their election procedures was overly burdensome and unwarranted. The case before the high court is called Shelby County, Alabama v. Holder.

.

The survey indicates the public is evenly divided over whether the Voting Rights Act is still necessary, with 48% saying yes and 50% saying no. There's a slight racial gap and a larger partisan divide.

There are two same-sex marriage cases in front of the Supreme Court.

At issue in Hollingsworth v. Perry is whether the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment guarantee of ""equal protection"" prevents states from defining marriage as being only between one man and one woman. The case involves California's Proposition 8, a statewide ballot measure that banned same-sex marriages in the Golden State, which California's Supreme Court had previously ruled were legal.

According to the poll, 55% of Americans support same-sex marriage, with 44% opposed. The 55% support is up 11 percentage points from 2008.

""In the 1970s, when polls first tackled this touchy topic, a majority of Americans believed that homosexual relationships between consenting adults were morally wrong, a belief that persisted into the 1990s and the first few years of the 21st century,"" says Holland. ""But three years ago, the number who felt that homosexual relationships were morally wrong began to drop below 50%, and currently 54% of the public says that homosexual relationships are not a moral issue. Not surprisingly, that shift in opinion coincided with a growth in support for same-sex marriage.""

The other case is Windsor v. U.S.. At issue is whether the federal Defense of Marriage Act violates equal protection guarantees in the Fifth Amendment's due process clause as applied to same-sex couples legally married under the laws of their states.

The case involves Edith ""Edie"" Windsor, who was forced to assume an estate tax bill much larger than those other married couples would have to pay. Because her partner was a woman, the federal government did not recognize the same-sex marriage legally, even though their home state of New York did. The law known as DOMA defines marriage for federal purposes as a union between a man and woman only.

The legal issue is whether the federal government can deny tax, health and pension benefits to same-sex couples in states where they can legally marry.

According to the poll, 60% say the federal government should recognize same-sex marriages performed in states that allow them, with 39% saying they disagree.

The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International June 11-13, with 1,014 adults nationwide questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points."

Yes, this image perfectly encapsulates the current government shutdown, in which a fringe band of GOP representatives in the House have effectively held the federal government hostage (with the help of the GOP's spineless leadership).

However, this image also perfectly encapsulates, unintentionally, the extent to which our elected officials truly represent America's citizenry today. For as mainstream pundits yap about which monuments might close, the wealth gap between those who have, and those who have not, is larger than it's ever been.

New Yorkers with two jobs are increasingly becoming homeless. Metropolises are becoming income distribution wastelands. Things are getting worse for so many.

And today, a small collection of lawmakers is focused on shutting down the government, rather than ensure it functions for those who need it most.

The majority is not ruling. In so many ways.

http://news.yahoo.com/wis-gov-signs-abortion-bill-requiring-ultrasound-184945474.html,,[],Wis. gov signs abortion bill requiring ultrasound,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Gov. Scott Walker quietly signed a contentious Republican bill Friday that would require women seeking abortions to undergo an ultrasound and ban doctors who lack admitting privileges at nearby hospitals from performing the procedures.

Opponents contend legislators shouldn't force women to undergo any medical procedure and the bill will force two abortion clinics where providers lack admitting privileges to shut their doors. The law takes effect Monday. Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin and the American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit within hours of the signing alleging the bill is unconstitutional and asking for a temporary restraining order blocking the measure.

""What the Legislature has done is to set up a system where the ability to provide abortions is contingent on the decision of a private institution and that's unconstitutional,"" Planned Parenthood's attorney, Lester Pines, said in an interview.

A spokeswoman for the state Department of Justice, which defends state laws, said agency attorneys would review the lawsuit and respond in court.

The bill is part of a broad GOP push to dramatically curtail abortions nationally.

North Dakota's governor, Republican Jack Dalrymple, signed a law this spring that outlaws abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, making North Dakota the most restrictive state in the nation to get an abortion. The state's lone abortion clinic has filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block the law.

Republicans in Arkansas this spring passed a law that bans most abortions after 12 weeks. The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas and the Center for Reproductive Rights. A federal judge has temporarily blocked that law. A trial has been tentatively scheduled for next year.

Alabama passed a law similar to the Wisconsin bill in April requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit contending the law would shut down three clinics because doctors at the clinics haven't been able to get admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. A federal judge temporarily blocked the law in June. Another federal judge has temporarily blocked Mississippi officials from closing down that state's only abortion clinic because providers there lack admitting privileges.

Story continues

Under the new Wisconsin law, any woman seeking an abortion would have to get an ultrasound. The technician would have to point out the fetus' visible organs and external features. Abortion providers would have to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles to perform the procedures.

Supporters argue ultrasounds will help the woman bond with the fetus and convince her to save it. The admitting privileges requirement ensures a woman who suffers an abortion-related complication has an advocate who can explain what happened when she reaches a hospital, they say.

Opponents maintain the law authorizes the government to dictate medical procedures. They've blasted the admitting privileges as ridiculous, saying an ambulance would take an ailing woman to the nearest hospital regardless of whether the abortion provider has admitting privileges.

Walker, a Republican, didn't sign the bill in public, instead sending out a statement early Friday afternoon saying the bill was now law.

""This bill improves a woman's ability to make an informed choice that will protect her physical and mental health now and in the future,"" the statement said.

The fight now shifts to court, just as it has in other states.

Planned Parenthood and the ACLU allege the admitting privileges will force a Planned Parenthood abortion clinic in Appleton to close as well as the Affiliated Medical Services abortion clinic in Milwaukee to close. The physicians in both clinics lack local admitting privileges and don't have time to secure any before the law takes effect, the lawsuit alleges.

Hospitals often grant privileges only to physicians who guarantee a minimum number of annual referrals, a requirement the abortion providers can't meet because abortion problems that require hospitalization are rare, according to the lawsuit. And some hospitals won't grant admitting privileges to abortion providers out of political, ideological or religious reasons, the lawsuit added.

Without a clinic in Appleton northern Wisconsin women will have to travel hundreds of miles to obtain abortions at Planned Parenthood's remaining clinics in Madison and Milwaukee, the lawsuit said.

The case fell to U.S. District Judge William Conley. It was unclear whether he would take any action before Monday.

Barbara Lyons, executive director of Wisconsin Right to Life, praised Walker for following through on promises to sign the bill. She said the law is on solid legal ground, noting eight other states have similar admitting privileges requirements for abortion privileges.

""It's no surprise they'll be challenging,"" she said of Planned Parenthood. ""They see their livelihood threatened, their income threatened. We don't think in the long run they'll be successful."""
http://news.yahoo.com/cruz-senate-wont-same-mistake-next-fight-191408114--politics.html,,[],Cruz: Senate won't make same mistake in next fight,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz said Saturday that the GOP lost the government shutdown budget battle because some congressional Republicans turned on others, but that he doesn't think they will make the same mistake during the next political impasse.

""I am hopeful that in the future the Senate will listen,"" Cruz, the tea party favorite and freshman senator from Texas, told a convention in Austin of the Texas Medical Association.

Cruz staged a more than 21-hour quasi-filibuster in the Senate late last month, helping spark a budget fight in the Republican-led House that partially shuttered the government in an attempt to sever funding for the nation's new health care law.

Then, with the country facing a debt default, leaders in the Democratic-led Senate brokered a deal to end the standoff — which Cruz dismissed as ""selling the American people down the river.""

""You don't win a fight when your own team is firing cannons at the people who are standing up and leading, which are the House Republicans,"" he said.

The deal sets up the potential for another budget showdown in January. Senate GOP leaders, however, have suggested that there won't be a repeat of the shutdown or a potential default crisis like in recent weeks.

But addressing reporters after his speech, Cruz would not say that another fight won't be coming.

""There will be plenty of time to consider the particular practical or strategic decisions,"" he said.

Asked if he was worried about retaliation from more-senior Republican leaders in the Senate, Cruz said, ""I try very hard not to worry about the politics and the internal back-and-forth in Washington.""

Many attendees gave Cruz a standing ovation at the end of his speech.

Some political observers now see Cruz as Texas' most popular Republican. But his approval ratings across the country may be slipping.

National polls have shown that while Americans in general don't love the health care law, they oppose defunding it — especially if it means shutting down the government. And many of Cruz's Senate colleagues have bemoaned the shutdown for tarnishing the GOP's image.

Cruz also took questions from the audience and was asked if ideology driving Washington could outweigh political pragmatism.

""The arguments I have laid out today have not been ideological,"" Cruz said. ""These were the essence of practical."""

Brad Dayspring, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, called Grimes “an empty dress” in an interview with The Hill published Wednesday.

The insults continued from there.

“Alison Lundergan Grimes seems incapable of articulating her own thoughts, and faced with questions, either directly parrots the talking points handed to her by [Sen.] Chuck Schumer or she babbles incoherently and stares blankly into the camera as though she’s a freshman in high school struggling to remember the CliffsNotes after forgetting to read her homework assignment,” Dayspring told The Hill.

""This degrading and offensive comment from McConnell's campaign team is appalling and he should condemn it immediately,"" Grimes spokeswoman Charly Norton told The Huffington Post. ""It shows his team's true feelings towards women and continues his disgraceful pattern of not standing up for the women of Kentucky. From misleading Kentuckians on his votes against the Violence Against Women Act, to voting against equal pay for equal work, Senator McConnell has failed to lead on issues important to women and their families.""

""Republicans think a substance-free insult is the right way to deal with a qualified, popular woman challenger – at least their rhetoric is consistent with their anti-woman policies,"" said Jess McIntosh, communications director at EMILY's List, which endorsed Grimes.

""The only surprising part of all this is the GOP’s continued unwillingness to understand that other women –- including Kentucky women -– can hear them when they say this stuff. It’s why women turned out in historic numbers for Democratic candidates last election, and it’s why we’ll see a repeat next November.""

Grimes, Kentucky's secretary of state, has been hesitant to talk about policy specifics since she officially jumped into the 2014 Senate race. But she has pushed to raise the minimum wage, been vocal about her support for reproductive rights, and announced her intention to delay the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that small businesses provide medical coverage to their employees.

“The president and I disagree on a lot of things,” she said in an August interview with HuffPost's Howard Fineman. “Sen. McConnell will use the same tactics that the GOP has used in other red states, and try to claim that I was a cheerleader for President Obama.

(CNN) - Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was already having a rough week when she was presented with an unwelcome gift at an event in Memphis on Friday.

After being grilled on Capitol Hill and receiving subpoenas from one congressional committee, Sebelius was wrapping up her week at an outreach event when Tennessee state Sen. Brian Kelsey approached her with a copy of the book ""Web Sites for Dummies,"" according to Memphis' The Daily News, which captured the moment on camera.

In the picture posted on The Daily News' website, Sebelius holds the book out with what seems to be an irritated expression.

Kelsey, a Republican, later tweeted, ""Just presented Sec Sebelius with 'Websites for Dummies,'"" and then, ""The book is simply a reminder to Sec. #Sebelius of my message to her that Tennessee does NOT want Medicaid expansion.""

The secretary's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Sebelius was in Tennessee to promote the Affordable Care Act and explain how her department is working to fix the botched insurance exchange website, HealthCare.gov.

""Clearly we did not do enough end-to-end testing,"" admitted Sebelius, though she defended the market itself, saying, ""The market is ready. We have competitive plans in every market in this country.""

""We have brought in a lot of technology experts to help make sure that we have all the eyes and ears on the problems and the puzzle, “Sebelius added.

On Wednesday, Sebelius apologized for the flawed website when she testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. President Obama has thus far resisted calls from congressional Republicans to fire Sebelius."

46%25 disapprove of his job performance

Millennials played a key role in helping Obama%27s two presidential election victories

The key to making the health care law work is enrolling young%2C health people

WASHINGTON — Millennials have provided invaluable political support to President Obama over the course of his presidency, voting for him by a roughly 2-to-1 margin in his two successful campaigns against Mitt Romney and John McCain.

But as Obama tries to climb out of a 2-month-long malaise that saw his popularity sink with the fumbled rollout of the federal health care exchange, the president appears to have nearly as much work to do with young people as he does with older Americans.

Forty-five percent of 18- to 29-year-old Americans say they approve of the way Obama is handling his job; 46% disapprove of his job performance, according to a year-end USA TODAY/Pew Research Center Poll. The president's approval rating with young Americans — which stood at 67% just ahead of his second inauguration less than a year ago — now mirrors the general population, according to the poll.

The USA TODAY/Pew sample is of only 229 young Americans -- a subset of 2,001 adults polled from Dec. 3-8 -- and has a margin of error of +/- 8 percentage points.

But the findings mirror other recent polling that suggests Obama has seen his approval rating slide with young Americans.

--Forty-nine percent of adults age 18-34 disapprove of the job Obama is doing as president, and 45% approve, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released last week.

--A Harvard Institute of Politics poll published earlier this month found that Obama's approval rating with 18- to 29-year-olds now stands at 41%, a dramatic 11-point drop from April. Fifty-four percent said they disapprove of the president's performance. That poll has a margin of error of +/- 2.1 percentage points.

--In a Quinnipiac University poll conducted from Dec. 3 to 9, 41% approve and 49% disapprove of his performance among the 18-to-29 age group.

In the USA TODAY/Pew poll, just 41% approve of his signature health care policy, while 54% disapprove. Overall, 40% of Americans approve and 55% disapprove of his health care policy, according to the poll.

The tough polling numbers with young Americans offer a snapshot of the road ahead for the Obama administration in repairing damage caused by the troubled rollout of Obamacare, which has even worn on some of the president's most ardent supporters.

The administration has dedicated much of the president's time and political capital toward making implementation of Obamacare a success after battling with early problems -- the glitch-riddled online exchange and the outrage that ensued when millions of Americans on the individual insurance market received cancellation notices because their policies didn't meet minimum benefit requirements set by the law.

Key to making the Affordable Care Act a success is enrolling plenty of young, healthy people whose participation will offset some higher risk and older uninsured Americans who are expected to flock to the exchanges.

Kyle Olberding, 23, an Army veteran who now works at a candy shop, said that he admires Obama for ending the war in Iraq and winding down the war in Afghanistan and credits the president for pursuing a diplomatic solution with Iran over its nuclear program.

But Olberding, of Wichita, Kan., said he is unhappy with the president's efforts on the economy, reducing the federal budget deficit and implementing the health care law. Olberding, who said he works full time but doesn't make much money, said he remains uncertain about whether he can afford health insurance and resents being required to purchase it.

""At this current point in my life, I have other things that need to be paid for and the extra cost is just not something I can afford right now,"" said Olberding, who said he hasn't yet explored the website or looked into the level of subsidy he might qualify for.

It's not the first time Obama has seen his approval rating plunge with Millennials, notes John Della Volpe, polling director at the Harvard Institute of Politics. Obama saw his approval rating drop with young Americans ahead of the 2010 midterm elections — in which Democrats lost control of the House — and again late in 2011 largely as a result of a then-stagnant economy. Each time he rebounded.

If Obama is going to have success rebounding again, it's essential he do a better job communicating with young Americans about the law, Della Volpe said.

Even among young poll respondents who say they approve of how Obama is handling his job, there has been a drop-off in the intensity of their backing of the president. Twenty-two percent said that they approve strongly of Obama's performance in the latest poll compared with 41% who said they approved strongly when they were surveyed in January.

""He has good intentions but the execution and communication of the health care law came through sloppily,"" said one poll respondent, Katrina Meyer, 29, of Indianapolis. ""It was a little bit wearing.""

Jonathan Scheidegger, 27, of Bethany, Okla., said he was optimistic when Obama was elected that he would get the economy on track and put a greater focus on the middle class than he felt George W. Bush did. While Scheidegger said Obama has done a better job than Bush, he said that the current president has failed to meet his expectations.

""There's just not a middle class anymore,"" said Scheidegger, a senior technical support specialist for a large company, who said he and his wife struggle to make ends meet despite both having good jobs. ""I'd like to see that my hard work pays off. I'd like to see some things from the president and Congress where it's not just the poor getting poorer and the rich getting richer."""

State Senate Leader Phil Berger (R) Gets Caught Spreading Lies About Obamacare,"North Carolina State Senate Leader and Art Pope loyalist, Phil Berger (R), who is considered a serious contender for the 2014 U.S. Senate race was busted for spreading lies about Obamacare:

http://www.journalnow.com/...



The petition appears on the Eden Republican’s campaign website. And its language perpetuates one of the bigger myths about the Affordable Care Act, said Mark Hall, a health policy expert at Wake Forest University’s law school. “These arguments have been rejected – it is the law of the land,” said Hall. The petition is tied to the state Senate’s passage of legislation that prevents the expansion of Medicaid and a state-sponsored health insurance exchange, two key provisions of President Barack Obama’s health care law. - Winston-Salem Journal, 2/9/13

Here's what the petition on Berger's website states:

http://www.wral.com/...



We already passed a bill in the Senate that protects us from: The government turning our health records over to the IRS

Government-forced insurance

Billions in new taxes on businesses and the people of North Carolina The form then invites people to sign a petition that would presumably be presented to opponents of Senate Bill 4. - WRAL, 2/8/13

Ok, now here are the facts:

http://www.newsobserver.com/...



The premise that the Senate is protecting the state is misleading, policy experts said. Even with the legislation now awaiting House action, the state is subject to most of the federal health care law. If North Carolina doesn’t set up a marketplace for purchasing insurance, called an exchange, the federal government will establish one for the state. The U.S. Supreme Court case upholding the Affordable Care Act in June 2012 gave states discretion about whether to expand Medicaid coverage to those making 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or $31,809 for a family of four. Most other provisions of the health care law are not affected by state action, policy experts said. As for the claim that the law will require the government to turn over health records to the IRS, Hall said that is simply not true. The IRS is the agency charged with determining whether individuals get health insurance or pay a penalty, as the law mandates. But the IRS is not going to ask for health records. The agency has told Congress that it expects taxpayers to get a form from their health insurance company certifying coverage and attach it to their federal return. The final point about taxes is based in the law. The measure raises $525 billion in revenue over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan division, to pay for health care for an estimated 32 million people by 2019. The taxes range from a 3.8 percent tax on investment income for high-income earners to an excise tax on indoor tanning services. Hall said it is safe to assume more than $1 billion likely will hit North Carolina payers on whole. - Charlotte News Observer, 2/8/13

Chris Sinclair, a Republican strategist at Cornerstone Solutions in Raleigh and an expert in digital campaigns, said it is a way to collect names and contact information for like-minded supporters – information that proves useful in future campaigns, fundraising and voter mobilization efforts. It’s particularly true with hot button issues. In Pat McCrory’s gubernatorial campaign, Sinclair used contact information collected from a voter ID petition to engage supporters ahead of the election. “The only reason you do a petition is to acquire followers and acquire advocates for your position,” said Sinclair. “It can be tremendously successful.” - Winston-Salem Journal, 2/9/13

So why is Berger continuing to push these lies about the Affordable Health Care Act? To help build his support for the crowded GOP primary:Health experts have claimed that expanding Medicaid in North Carolina could help the state meet costs it will already have to pay such as a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department over how the state cares for certain mentally ill patients:

http://www.wral.com/...



""Medication management is a major reason why people have accepted a more institutional level of care than they really need,"" Dunn said. The Justice Department has said the state needs to move away from this preference toward putting people in institutional settings rather than in less restrictive community settings. In order to move people out of these institutional settings, the state will need to create a network of community providers. Expanding Medicaid would help because it would narrow a gap in what Medicaid pays for people in institutions versus those who live in the community. - WRAL, 2/4/13

Berger is just one of the dogs Art Pope has in this race. The other is House Speaker Thom Tillis (R). The Pope Foundation played a huge rule in the GOP's complete take over of the North Carolina legislator and Governorship:

http://www.dailykos.com/...



His large transition team is being studied for signs of whether he will turn more conservative. It is heavy with Republican politicians and business leaders, including former members of President George W. Bush’s administration and former governors. The most controversial figures on the team are the billionaire businessman Art Pope and some of his allies who are connected to the John William Pope Foundation. The group, which is dedicated to conservative and free-market ideas, has given millions of dollars to libertarian and conservative groups, including the Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation and Americans for Prosperity. - New York Times, 12/11/12

Pope – whose network of organizations promotes a limited-government agenda – will be the new governor’s top budget-writer. A multimillionaire, he will take a leave from his retail chain store business, as well as from his family foundation and all public and nonprofit boards he serves on in order to take the job without pay. - Charlotte News Observer, 12/21/12

And look who's orchestrating Governor Pat McCrory's (R. NC) budget:So yeah, Pope's loyal crony, Berger, is trying to get a head start in the primary by continuing to push the same lies Republicans have been pushing about the Affordable Health Care Act. Berger and Tillis are seriously considering challenging incumbent Senator Kay Hagan (D. NC) but Pope's top choices might have to deal with this guy:

http://www.beaufortobserver.net/...



Brannon announced his intentions Saturday at a Tea Party event in Winterville, North Carolina. Regular listeners of the Bill LuMaye radio show in The Triangle may recognize Brannon, who is a frequent guest. Brannon also is known for his work with a grassroots organization called Founders’ Truth. - The Daily Haymaker, 1/28/13

You can hear Brannon's craziness here:

Hagan is very well aware of how tough of a race she's going in and she is getting ready. She has over $1.3 million in the bank and she hired former Obama For American North Carolina director, Lindsay Siler, as a senior adviser to oversee constituent outreach and engagement. Hagan also promoted her deputy communications director, Sadie Weiner, to communications director. Weiner has also worked on Senator Sherrod Brown's (D. OH) 2012 re-election campaign. She has also made herself available to her constituents with her ""Conversations with Kay"" community meetings that she has held in all 100 counties. She's even teamed up with Senators Jeff Merkley (D. OR), Mark Udall (D. CO) and Jeanne Shaheen (D. NH) to help raise money for each other's campaigns:

http://www.dailykos.com/...



Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Kay Hagan (D-N.C.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Mark Udall (D-Colo.) created a joint fundraising committee last week called Senate Victory 2014, according to Federal Election Commission records. Hagan is the most vulnerable senator in the group, and could face a tough reelection fight if a strong Republican challenger emerges, according to a recent poll. Hagan is also the strongest fundraiser of the four, ending the last reporting period with more than $1.3 million in the bank. - The Hill, 1/28/13

It's still a while away but it's good to get an early start for 2014, especially when the whole local legislator is in the pockets of Art Pope which will spend big to get rid of Hagan. Lets keep the Senate blue and donate to Hagan's campaign:"

She Is A Former Member Of The Washington Post'S Editorial Board.""]",Anne Applebaum: The GOP endangers democracy,"Over the past 20 years, I’ve spent a lot of time in countries that are not democracies but would like to be. In Central Europe and the former Soviet Union, and more recently in North Africa, I’ve met many, many people who are trying to figure out how to translate that elusive concept “the will of the people” into the practical matters of government: taxation, public spending, defense, law and order, garbage collection. Over and over again, I’ve watched them construct institutions designed to translate the mystical into the practical: parliaments, presidencies, court systems. Sooner or later, they all learn that the act of voting is a necessary but insufficient component of democracy. Without legitimate representative and executive institutions — bodies that can translate the will of the people into concrete policies — democracy always fails.

From my perch overseas, I’ve also been watching the run-up to the government shutdown in Washington. At times, I have tried to explain it to bemused foreigners. Many of them think, mistakenly, that Americans are having an argument about the budget or the deficit. I have to put them straight: This is an attempt by one part of the U.S. political system to use the budgetary process to stop the implementation of a single law, the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”). If my interlocutors come from democratic countries, they then look puzzled.

If they read the commentary pouring out of Washington, they are even more confused, as am I. What surprises — and shocks — me is how many people who have written, blogged or self-righteously tweeted about the results of various polls on these events, as if they matter. Do 47 percent of Americans oppose Obamacare? Do 73.7 percent oppose Obamacare? Do 97 percent of Republicans hate Obamacare even more than they hate death and taxes? Who cares? In a functioning democracy, it doesn’t matter what the majority happens to think at any given moment. What matters is what the legitimate, representative, legal institutions have already decided.

I am not an expert on the economics of health care, so I don’t know whether the Affordable Care Act is ultimately going to be good or bad for the United States. I am very glad that it will help poor, uninsured Americans get access to doctors, hospitals and medicine. I’m worried that it may be too expensive and will further extend U.S. indebtedness.

But I also recognize that, at this point, what I think doesn’t matter. The Affordable Care Act passed both houses of Congress and was signed into law by the president. It was confirmed by the Supreme Court. The president who sponsored the health-care reform was then sent back to the White House after an election during which that reform was a major topic of debate.

Obamacare is the law, as confirmed by the executive, legislative and judicial branches of our political system. A portion of one of those branches is not now legally or morally empowered to change that law by holding other parts of the government hostage, no matter how strongly its members or their constituents feel. So how is it possible that so many Americans, including some who have been elected to Congress, no longer understand this principle, which is fundamental to our political system and vital to the functioning of democracies? I repeat: Democracy is not designed to reflect majority opinion. It is designed to filter majority opinion through legitimate institutions and to translate it, through agreed procedures, into policy.

Plenty of people outside the United States understand how strange this debate has become. A couple of days ago, an American Egyptian (@salamamoussa) tweeted that it was “Impressive how everyone in #US follows the law even in the face of extreme political vandalism by an irrational fringe. #Egypt.” I think he meant this comment ironically, but actually, he was right. In many parts of the world — Egypt, for example — members of the “irrational fringe” who tried to subvert the political system by overturning a law already confirmed by three branches of government would be called “insurgents” or “coup plotters,” and their behavior would lead to arrest, prison or worse.

But because Americans, even irrational Americans, no longer use violence to achieve their goals, and because this process is still — just barely — taking place within the boundaries of those institutions and because the protagonists still observe the language — if not always the spirit — of the law, the result is peaceful. That is indeed impressive. But it is a narrow achievement.

Americans are paying a high price for this week’s events. The cost of shutting down the federal government, for a few days or even a few weeks, pales in comparison to the damage done to the credibility of the United States abroad — and the credibility of democracy itself.

PolitiFact rated two of her claims during her CPAC speech last Saturday as “pants on fire” false. The first was that 70 cents of every dollar that’s supposed to go to the poor actually goes to salaries and pensions of bureaucrats. The second was that scientists could have a cure for Alzheimer’s in 10 years if it were not for “a cadre of overzealous regulators, excessive taxation and greedy litigators.”

She also said during that speech that President Obama was living “a lifestyle that is one of excess” in the White House, detailing how many chefs he had, and so on.

The Washington Post gave that claim four Pinocchios, and pointed out that “during last year’s G.O.P. presidential race, Bachmann racked up the highest ratio of Four-Pinocchio comments, so just about everything she says needs to be checked and double-checked before it is reported.”

And in a speech Thursday on the House floor, she said of the federal health care law:

“The American people, especially vulnerable women, vulnerable children, vulnerable senior citizens, now get to pay more and they get less. That’s why we’re here, because we’re saying let’s repeal this failure before it literally kills women, kills children, kills senior citizens.”

Factcheck.org pointed out that her “facts” didn’t match her hyperbole.

Last year The Washington Post quoted Jim Drinkard, who oversees fact-checking at The Associated Press, as saying, “We had to have a self-imposed Michele Bachmann quota in some of those debates.”"

Ted Cruz (R-TX) in his campaign to defund Obamacare.

“Right now in the Senate, Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn are actively whipping Senators to shut down debate on the House continuing resolution so that Harry Reid can gut it with just 51 votes,” a senior congressional staffer with intimate knowledge of the situation said in an email to Breitbart News. “Unbelievably, they actually are leading the fight to fully fund Obamacare.”

McConnell and Cornyn stated earlier Monday that they oppose a possible filibuster from Cruz to keep Reid from adding language funding the Affordable Care Act to the continuing resolution passed by the House of Representatives.

As Breitbart News reported on Saturday, McConnell and Cornyn could help Cruz win:

First, when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid brings the House continuing resolution (CR) to the floor next week, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell needs to deliver 41 Republican votes to filibuster it until Senator Reid agrees not to try and restore funding for Obamacare. McConnell has the power to ensure that Reid cannot get an amendment onto the bill that strips the Obamacare defunding language with a simple majority vote. As Breitbart News laid out on Friday, McConnell has closed down one pathway that Reid could use: If [Reid] introduces an amendment before the Senate votes on cloture for the House CR[, t]hat would require a 60-vote threshold, and McConnell’s spokesman Don Stewart told Breitbart News that if Reid attempted that tactic, all Senate Republicans would stand together to block it. However, a major avenue is still open through which Reid can get the amendment onto the bill with a simple majority. If McConnell decides Obamacare is worth fighting in earnest on must-pass legislation (ie non-symbolic votes), then he will deliver the 41 necessary votes to filibuster until Reid is forced to agree to a clean up-or-down Senate floor vote on the Obamacare defunding CR the House just passed. There is something McConnell can do using his power that could accomplish this: Filibuster the House CR until there is a unanimous consent agreement that any amendments added to it after cloture is invoked would also each require a 60-vote threshold. The power rests now with McConnell. Delivering the 41 votes is essential to help Ted Cruz.

Instead of helping Cruz with their power as Senate GOP leaders, McConnell and Cornyn are working against him, this senior staffer said. But in the end, they will try to make it appear as though they do not support funding Obamacare by voting against Reid’s amendment after allowing Reid to implement it. “Once it’s a 51-vote threshold, both McConnell and Cornyn will hide behind a ‘no’ vote on Reid’s amendment–so they will have yet another show vote,” the staffer said.

“To be clear, nobody is fighting harder to make sure Obamacare is funded than Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn,” the senior staffer added."

Hagan is very well aware of how tough of a race she's going in and she is getting ready. She has over $1.3 million in the bank and she hired former Obama For American North Carolina director, Lindsay Siler, as a senior adviser to oversee constituent outreach and engagement. Hagan also promoted her deputy communications director, Sadie Weiner, to communications director. Weiner has also worked on Senator Sherrod Brown's (D. OH) 2012 re-election campaign. She has also made herself available to her constituents with her ""Conversations with Kay"" community meetings that she has held in all 100 counties. She's even teamed up with Senators Jeff Merkley (D. OR), Mark Udall (D. CO) and Jeanne Shaheen (D. NH) to help raise money for each other's campaigns:

Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Kay Hagan (D-N.C.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Mark Udall (D-Colo.) created a joint fundraising committee last week called Senate Victory 2014, according to Federal Election Commission records.

Hagan is also the strongest fundraiser of the four, ending the last reporting period with more than $1.3 million in the bank. - The Hill, 1/28/13

It's still a while away but it's good to get an early start for 2014, especially when the whole local legislator is in the pockets of Art Pope which will spend big to get rid of Hagan. Lets keep the Senate blue and donate to Hagan's campaign:"
http://news.yahoo.com/gop-boycotts-health-care-advisory-163010524.html,,[],GOP boycotts health care advisory board,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate Republican leaders told President Barack Obama Thursday that they will refuse to nominate candidates to serve on an advisory board that is to play a role in holding down Medicare costs under the new health care act.

House Speaker John Boehner, who joined Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell in boycotting the Independent Payment Advisory Board, also said that the House next week will vote again to repeal the health care act. According to a Democratic count, the House has tried some 36 times to repeal or defund all or part of Obama's landmark health care overhaul since it became law in 2010.

The 15-member advisory board, known as IPAB, would have the power to force payment cuts on insurers, drug companies and other service providers if Medicare costs rise beyond certain levels.

The health care law explicitly forbids the board from rationing care, shifting costs to seniors or cutting their benefits, but Republicans have insisted that it will be a vehicle to deny care to seniors. Former GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin referred to ""death panels"" that would allow the government to withhold life-saving care from the elderly while campaigning in 2008.

While Boehner and McConnell did not go that far, they said in their letter to Obama that reduced payments ""will force providers to stop seeing Medicare patients"" and ""this will lead to access problems, waiting lists and denied care for seniors.""

Boehner, at a news conference Thursday, said this ""is a board with 15 unelected, unaccountable individuals who have the authority to deny seniors access to care. The American people don't want the federal government making decisions that doctors and patients should be making.""

The members of the board, to consist of people nominated by both parties, would be subject to Senate confirmation. Economists have predicted that the board's services might not be needed in the near future because Medicare cost increases appear to be manageable.

Story continues

White House spokesman Jay Carney, responding to reporter questions about the IPAB boycott, saidliz that ""the fact that Republicans have continued to push for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act I believe demonstrates how out of touch they are with the American people, who are tired of efforts by Republicans to refight the political battles of the past.""

Asked why the House was voting a 37th time to repeal all or part of what Republicans call ""Obamacare,"" even though GOP leaders know the Democratic-controlled Senate will again ignore the vote, Boehner said there were about 70 new members of the House this year. ""Frankly they have been asking for an opportunity to vote on it, and we are going to give it to them.""

He said he supports total repeal of the law rather than efforts to amend it as it goes into effect over the next year. ""I don't believe there is a way to fix this and make it acceptable to the American people.""

Republicans say there have been only two previous votes to eliminate the health care law in its entirety. They say there have been more than 30 votes to partially repeal or defund the law, and several have been signed into law, including one eliminating an unpopular tax-filing requirement that would have affected millions of businesses.

WASHINGTON — President Obama on Monday made an unscheduled visit to the Federal Emergency Management Agency in his latest bid to draw attention to the effects of the government shutdown and to challenge Speaker John A. Boehner’s claim that he does not have enough votes to pass a measure to finance the government.

Mr. Boehner, appearing Sunday on the ABC News program “This Week,” said the Republican-controlled House could not pass a budget measure without provisions to limit Mr. Obama’s health insurance law. Democrats and some Republicans say that a bipartisan majority exists but that Mr. Boehner refuses to defy Tea Party conservatives.

At FEMA, Mr. Obama called on Mr. Boehner to put to a vote the Senate-passed stopgap bill to fund the government.

“The House should hold that vote today,” Mr. Obama said. “If Republicans and Speaker Boehner are saying there are not enough votes, then they should prove it. Let the bill go to the floor and let’s see what happens. Just vote. Let every member of Congress vote their conscience and they can determine whether or not they want to shut the government down. My suspicion is, my very strong suspicion is, that there are enough votes there.”

Turning up the pressure, Mr. Obama added, “The reason that Speaker Boehner hasn’t called a vote on it is because he doesn’t apparently want to see the government shutdown end at the moment, unless he’s able to extract concessions that don’t have anything to do with the budget.”

Like other federal agencies, FEMA is operating with reduced staff — 86 percent was furloughed, according to its chief, W. Craig Fugate, though some were temporarily called back to deal with storm response efforts, and the rest are working for now without pay. The agency has been busy coordinating with state and local governments to prepare for and respond to violent storms in the Midwest and Tropical Storm Karen.

The president used the appearance at the agency to reiterate his now-daily calls for Congress both to vote immediately to finance the government in the new fiscal year, which began last Tuesday, and to extend the nation’s borrowing limit, which the Treasury Department has estimated will be breached Oct. 17. Last Friday, he did the same with an unscheduled appearance at a local sandwich shop.

While the shutdown has posed myriad problems nationwide for citizens and businesses, failure to raise the debt ceiling could ultimately provoke the nation’s first default and lead to a global financial crisis.

House Republicans have refused to allow a vote on a Senate-passed funding measure until Mr. Obama negotiates limits or cutbacks in his signature health care law, which he has refused to do. The House in recent days has passed a number of bills funding various popular functions of the government, including FEMA, as public complaints have mounted, but the White House and Democratic-controlled Senate have rejected that piecemeal approach, demanding that the entire government be funded.

Mr. Boehner and other Republicans have excoriated Mr. Obama for his refusal to negotiate over their demands. Also at FEMA, Mr. Obama countered that line of attack.

“I have said from the start of the year that I’m happy to talk to Republicans about anything related to the budget,” Mr. Obama said. “There is not a subject that I am not willing to engage in, work on, negotiate and come up with common-sense compromises on. What I’ve said is that I cannot do that under the threat that if R’s don’t get 100 percent of their way they’re going to either shut down the government or they are going to default on America’s debt so that America for the first time in history does not pay its bills.”

“We’re not going to establish that pattern,” he added.

Separately, on Monday the president’s chief White House economic adviser, Gene B. Sperling, publicly reiterated what the Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, has already told Congressional Republicans: the White House will let Congress decide how great an increase to provide in the nation’s soon-to-be-breached $16.7 trillion debt limit.

Mr. Lew, in a letter over the weekend to Senate Republicans, said that under the Constitution, “Only Congress can authorize an increase in the nation’s borrowing authority, and therefore Congress must choose how long to extend the debt limit.”

The Treasury secretary expressed a preference for bigger increase, which he did not quantify, to cover a longer time. “A longer period of certainty would help protect our economy from future political brinkmanship,” Mr. Lew wrote."

Texas GOP senator referenced Bataan Death March at end of his marathon health care protest

Thousands of Filipino and American soldiers were killed by Japanese in march to POW camp

Video of apology was posted on YouTube

WASHINGTON — Sen. Ted Cruz apologized to Filipino veterans for referencing the Bataan Death March during his marathon protest last week of President Obama's health care law.

""I apologize for causing offense. I should not have said what I did,"" the Texas Republican said during a meeting with Filipino veterans of World War II.

Cruz mentioned the Bataan Death March near the end of his 21-hour, filibuster-style protest last week as he thanked Senate aides, Capitol police officers and other staff who were at work as he controlled the Senate floor from Sept. 24 into Sept. 25.

Specifically, Cruz said that he wanted ""to thank the men and men who have endured this, this Bataan Death March.""

After the Battle of Bataan in World War II, Japanese forces killed more than 10,000 Filipino and American soldiers during the forced 65-mile march to a prison camp. Tens of thousands of other Filipino and American soldiers who survived the march were held as POWs, and many died because of lack of food, poor conditions and abuse by their captors.

Cruz met with Celestino Almeda and Jesse Baltazar, both in their 90s, and other representatives of the American Coalition for Filipino Veterans, which had asked for a public apology. Video of the meeting was posted Tuesday on YouTube.

""I was trying to say they (staff) endured a long period of suffering not of their choosing, but I understand that that comment caused offense and I apologize. That was not my intention to do so,"" Cruz said after explaining the context of his remarks.

9/18/2013: SEAN HANNITY: The groundwork has been set for a monumental showdown on Capitol Hill, and it all comes down to a very simple formula. Either Democrats vote to defund the train wreck that is Obamacare, or they will risk shutting down the federal government. JOHN BOEHNER: This week the House will pass a CR that ... defunds Obamacare. REP. MICHELE BACHMANN, R-MN: Can you see the smile on my face? I am so happy because I think we're getting to a consensus now with the Republicans. ... I think that we can take a victory lap.

(balloons drop as Stephen twerks with Death to the tune of ""Blurred Lines"")

(audience cheering)

Maybe.

Because there are still a few wrinkles to iron out before this brave act of extortion takes effect.



CAROL COSTELLO (9/19/2013): You know that these things probably won't pass the Democratically-controlled Senate, and the President would veto it even if it did. KIRSTEN POWERS (9/18/2013): They're putting something in there that is absolutely a non-starter. ... This is like saying we can pass a budget if you can prove there's life on Mars.

And folks, when it comes to stopping Obamacare, there is no time to lose because the stool sample is about to hit the fan.



BILL HEMMER (9/17/2013): Two weeks from today, the first Americans can start signing up for the exchanges under Obamacare. That's the first of October.

And folks, worse than the cost or the bureaucrats or the death panels, the most dangerous thing about Obamacare is that people might like it.

As conservative writer Byron York recently Yorked:



BYRON YORK (7/11/2013): The White House knows that once those payments begin, repealing Obamacare will no longer be an abstract question of removing legislation not yet in effect. Instead, it will be a very real matter of taking money away from people. It's very, very hard to do that.

The key to implementing the President's plan are the so-called Obamacare Navigators. Now, what does an Obamacare Navigator do?



CHRIS HAYES (9/13/2013): So, you're asking what does an Obamacare Navigator do?

CHRIS HAYES (9/17/2013): They ""help low-income, uninsured residents sign up for the state's expanded insurance program"".

9/15/2013: YOLANDA FERNANDEZ, NBC8 ANCHOR: Tension over how to implement the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, appears to be surfacing again in Florida. This time, it has to do with the so-called Navigators, who are supposed to help people wade through the system to sign up for health coverage. ... The Florida Department of Health is saying that those Navigators can't operate inside county health department offices. LAUREN MAYK, NBC8 REPORTER: The State Department of Health put out a notice, saying Navigators couldn't ""conduct activities on the grounds of the health departments"".

FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL PAM BONDI (8/16/2013): These Navigators will have our consumers throughout the country's most personal and private information. Tax return information. Social Security information. And our biggest fear, of course, is identity theft.

That makes sense. You can only ask for the material that will inform you about the program if you know about the program enough to ask for the material. (audience applause) Then, you just have to fill out the Möbius form.

Hopefully, folks, hopefully, one of these plans will kill Obamacare. If not, I guess Republicans can just vote to repeal it again. And yes, I know they've already tried that 41 times. But you know what they say. If at first you don't succeed, try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try again. And if that fails, try try try try try try try try try we'll be right back. Try try try try try try...."

Sarah Palin called on Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace to release the names of the “top Republicans” that sent him opposition research on Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) to “hammer” Cruz before his appearance on the program to discuss defunding Obamacare.

“Keep it TRULY fair & balanced,” Palin tweeted. “Release the GOP names encouraging you to trash @SenTedCruz. No more anonymous sources.”

@FoxNewsSunday Keep it TRULY fair & balanced. Release the GOP names encouraging you to trash @SenTedCruz. No more anonymous sources. — Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) September 22, 2013

On Sunday, Wallace said that establishment Republicans are so worked up that Cruz is leading the defund Obamacare fight that he immediately got unsolicited questions and research on Cruz from “top Republicans” before Cruz’s appearance.

In an appearance on Washington D.C.’s Fox 5 to preview his Sunday show, Wallace said, “I will tell you I have never in my time in Washington seen a party so upset with one of its own members.”

In an exclusive op-ed for Breitbart News on Saturday, Palin urged Cruz to stay strong in the face of the inevitable backlash from fellow Republicans and suggested they compare “shiv marks” the next time they meet:

Welcome to our world, Ted. The same people have been denouncing conservatives like me for years (right after they ask for help fundraising for themselves or endorsing the latest candidate they’ve suckered into paying their exorbitant consulting fees). We can compare shiv marks next time we meet, my friend.”

A growing number of Republicans are scoffing at Louisiana Sen. David Vitter’s push to stop federal contributions that will help pay for health coverage for lawmakers and their staff under the new Obamacare exchanges. Vitter’s crusade has effectively put his GOP colleagues in the unenviable position of hurting themselves and their staff financially or siding with another political attack on a law the party universally despises. The latest pushback is another sign of how the long-running GOP fight to repeal Obamacare has suddenly degenerated into an internal Republican battle, prompting widespread concerns among party elders. “One of our strengths in this fight—even though we had minority numbers in both the House and the Senate when the law passed—was that no Republicans voted for it in the Senate,” said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a member of his party’s leadership. “Somehow, some of our members seem to think there’s forward progress in figuring out ways to divide us on something we’re totally united on. That can’t be a good idea.”

The dissension rampant in the Republican conference in the House of Representatives has spilled over to the Senate Republicans, where Sen. David Vitter's bizarre anti-Obamacare campaign is starting to piss off his Republican colleagues Again, has anyone ever accused David Vitter of having good ideas? Senate Republicans are probably just pissed the Vitter is making them look like House Republicans, because there's nothing that creates more disdain in a senator than the House.

Vitter isn't doing much to bring fellow Republicans to his side, either. When fellow Republicans like Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins and Saxby Chambliss raise the issue that Vitter's plan would take affordable health insurance away from congressional staff, and that that wasn't particularly fair, Vitter staffer Luke Bolar, (who would also lose his insurance) responded: “Lotta Americans getting screwed under Obamacare and won’t get a taxpayer subsidy.” So, basically, ""fuck all my coworkers."" That'll win friends and influence people.

Stand with Daily Kos and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in denouncing Republicans who would completely shut down the government just to destroy Obamacare.

While the House voted 230 to 189 to pass the measure that Democrats have called unacceptable, Republicans insisted their bill does nothing to shutter the federal government.

""It simply keeps the lights on in our government,"" said Rep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, on Friday.

Rogers, whose committee is effectively short-circuited by the three-month stopgap bill, said almost nothing about the Affordable Care Act, but House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) made clear that the main point of the measure is to block the health care law.

""This resolution will also protect the working middle class from the devastating effects of Obamacare,"" said Cantor. ""Let's defund this law now, and protect the American people from the economic calamity that we know Obamacare will create.""

The vote marked the 42nd time that the House Republican conference has said yes to gutting Obamacare. While some tweaks have been made to the program, the Senate has ignored nearly everything the House has pushed for.

Rep. Scott Rigell (R-Va.), who faces reelection in a district that Obama carried in 2012, was the only Republican to vote against the bill. Rigell has bucked his party on fiscal matters before; he appeared with the president at an event in February opposing sequestration and even took a ride aboard Air Force One.

Rigell released a statement in which he said he agreed that Obamacare should be defunded, but couldn't support a bill that would set government spending levels at sequester levels.

""This [continuing resolution] fails to address the sequester that is negatively impacting those who wear our nation’s uniform and is the result of Congress' inability to pass the 12 appropriations bills necessary to properly fund the government on time,"" Rigell said. ""What is needed is a comprehensive solution to our nation’s fiscal challenges, including a replacement for sequestration.""

On the Democratic side, Reps. Jim Matheson (D-Utah) and Mike McIntyre (D-N.C.) were the only two lawmakers to vote in favor of the bill. The blue dog Democrats have often voted across party lines in the past.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) slammed the bill in a floor speech ahead of the vote, saying that the measure ""was designed to shut down the government.""

""It could have no other intent. Its purpose is clear,"" Pelosi said. ""It is a wolf in wolf's clothing.""

""Either you don't know what you are doing, or this is one of the most intentional acts of brutality that you have cooked up, with stiff competition for that honor,"" she added, while underscoring the damaging effects the bill would have on a program that provides health insurance to more than 8 million moderate-income children.

The continuing resolution would not only permanently strip the Affordable Care Act of its funding, but would lock in government spending at sequester levels that conflict with the budget passed in the Senate. It also sets up another potentially even more consequential showdown over the nation's debt limit, by including the so-called Full Faith and Credit Act, a measure that Republicans say would allow the Treasury Department to still pay the nation's creditors, and therefore avoid a default, if the debt limit, now at $16.7 trillion, is not raised sometime next month.

Democrats have dubbed that measure the ""Pay China First Act,"" pointing out that it would prioritize payments to U.S. bondholders, which include many foreign governments like China, while obligations such as Medicare and military benefits would be placed on the backburner.

While leaders such as Cantor insisted that the legislation was responsible, many members of his own party, including more than a dozen senators, have called the move ""foolish"" and ""dumb.""

Even Rogers seemed aware of the potential pitfalls of the stratagem.

""I'd like to remind my colleagues … both in the House and the other body that a government shutdown is a political game in which everyone loses,"" Rogers said. ""It shirks one of our most basic duties as members of Congress, and it puts our national security at stake. To be clear, if this legislation is not enacted and we embark on a government shutdown, the consequences are severe.""

""Our brave men and women in uniform don't get paid, our recovering economy will take a huge hit,"" he added. ""A government shutdown, even the illusion of the threat of a shutdown, says to the American people that this Congress does not have their best interests at heart.""

This story has been updated with the names of those House lawmakers who did not vote with their party on the stopgap funding bill."

Sens. Mike Lee%2C Ted Cruz and other lawmakers to rally Sept. 10 on Capitol Hill

Effort to withhold funding for health care law divides Republicans

President Obama%2C Senate Democrats likely to block any attempt to deny funds for law

WASHINGTON — As the summer recess for Congress heads to a close, Tea Party groups are trying to pressure Republicans to withhold funding to implement President Obama's health care law this fall.

A cross-country anti-""Obamacare"" tour that began Tuesday highlights a divide among Republicans, with some key House and Senate leaders trying to avoid a government shutdown that could damage the party and label the GOP as obstructionist ahead of the 2014 elections.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., calls the idea of blocking funding for the health care law a ""non-starter,"" and Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., says the prospect of shutting down the government over the law is the ""dumbest idea"" he has ever heard.

On the other side are rank-and-file lawmakers, many of them elected with Tea Party support in 2010, who want to thwart Obama's signature domestic achievement before key provisions take effect. They say they won't support any bill to fund the government that doesn't bar spending for the health care law.

""There's a real concern about the lack of courage of folks who don't want to stand up to something,"" said Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kan., a proponent of denying funds for the law. ""Sometimes you just have to do the right thing — that should be more important than winning the next election.""

Oct. 1 is the launch date for open enrollment under the health care law and the date when health insurance exchanges in states will begin to help people find and buy insurance coverage.

That date coincides with the start of the new fiscal year. If Congress doesn't pass a temporary resolution funding the government or adopt year-long spending bills to fund federal agencies, then a shutdown would occur.

It is hard to see success for the anti-Obamacare effort. The Supreme Court last year upheld the constitutionality of the insurance mandate. The Democratic-controlled Senate is unlikely to pass any legislation blocking funding, and President Obama won't sign any measure that does so.

Tea Party groups, led by For America and the Tea Party Patriots, believe their push will help attract grass-roots support and pressure some Republicans. ""This may well be the last opportunity to pull the law back,"" said Jenny Beth Martin, national coordinator for the Tea Party Patriots. ""If we don't … stop spending on the law, the law may become completely cemented.""

The Tea Party groups started Tuesday with a news conference in Lexington, Ky., in the backyard of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. An event will be held Wednesday in Austin to get the attention of Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican leader. Sarah Palin, a Tea Party favorite and the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, endorsed the Tea Party strategy Tuesday.

The effort culminates with a Capitol Hill rally on Sept. 10 featuring Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Ted Cruz of Texas.

Cornyn's spokesman says the Texas senator, who is up for re-election next year, is not unsympathetic to concerns about the health care law. ""Sen. Cornyn has been fighting Obamacare tooth and nail for the better part of four years,"" said Drew Brandewie, a Cornyn spokesman.

That's not enough for the Tea Party groups. Martin wants McConnell and Cornyn to sign on to a letter saying they will not support a resolution to fund the government or any appropriations bill if it includes money for the health care law. At least a dozen Republicans have either signed the letter circulated by Lee or publicly stated their support.

Eighty House Republicans — representing more than one-third of House GOP members — recently sent a letter to Speaker John Boehner saying they support withholding government funds for the health care law.

Cal Jillson, a political scientist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, said the Tea Party approach could be effective on someone like Cornyn, who must balance home-state interests with his duties as a national Republican leader. ""Constituents look at House and Senate leaders as potentially compromised by their institutional responsibilities,"" Jillson said.

Democrats say the GOP's divide on Obama's health care law helps them.

""The Republican Party is fighting an all-out civil war,"" said Justin Barasky, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which ""will ultimately prevent them from taking the majority next year.""

They are hell-bent on destroying the Affordable Care Act in Americans' minds.

A document circulating among House Republicans (reported by the New York Times) instructs them to repeat the following themes and stories continuously: ""Because of Obamacare, I Lost My Insurance."" ""Obamacare Increases Health Care Costs."" ""The Exchanges May Not Be Secure, Putting Personal Information at Risk.""

Every Republican in Washington has been programmed to use the word ""disaster"" whenever mentioning the Act, always refer to it as Obamacare, and demand its repeal.

Republican wordsmiths know they can count on Fox News and right-wing yell radio to amplify and intensify all of this in continuous loops of elaboration and outrage, repeated so often as to infect peoples' minds like purulent pustules.

The idea is to make the Act so detestable it becomes the fearsome centerpiece of the midterm elections of 2014 -- putting enough Democrats on the defensive they join in seeking its repeal or at least in amending it in ways that gut it (such as allowing insurers to sell whatever policies they want as long as they want, or delaying it further).

Admittedly, the president provided Republicans ammunition by botching the Act's roll-out. Why wasn't HealthCare.gov up and running smoothly November 1? Partly because the Administration didn't anticipate that almost every Republican governor would refuse to set up a state exchange, thereby loading even more responsibility on an already over-worked and underfunded Department of Health and Human Services.

Why didn't Obama's advisors anticipate that some policies would be cancelled (after all, the Act sets higher standards than many policies offered) and therefore his ""you can keep their old insurance"" promise would become a target? Likely because they knew all policies were ""grandfathered"" for a year, didn't anticipate how many insurers would cancel right away, and understood that only 5 percent of policyholders received insurance independent of an employer anyway.

But there's really no good excuse. The White House should have anticipated the Republican attack machine.

The real problem is now. The president and other Democrats aren't meeting the Republican barrage with three larger truths that show the pettiness of the attack:

The wreck of private insurance. Ours has been the only health care system in the world designed to avoid sick people. For-profit insurers have spent billions finding and marketing their policies to healthy people -- young adults, people at low risk of expensive diseases, groups of professionals -- while rejecting people with preexisting conditions, otherwise debilitated, or at high risk of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. And have routinely dropped coverage of policy holders who become seriously sick or disabled. What else would you expect from corporations seeking to maximize profits?

But the social consequences have been devastating. We have ended up with the most expensive healthcare system in the world (finding and marketing to healthy people is expensive, corporate executives are expensive, profits adequate to satisfy shareholders are expensive), combined with the worst health outcomes of all rich countries -- highest rates of infant mortality, shortest life spans, largest portions of populations never seeing a doctor and receiving no preventive care, most expensive uses of emergency rooms.

We could not and cannot continue with this travesty of a healthcare system.

The Affordable Care Act is a modest solution. It still relies on private insurers -- merely setting minimum standards and ""exchanges"" where customers can compare policies, requiring insurers to take people with preexisting conditions and not abandon those who get seriously sick, and helping low-income people afford coverage.

A single-payer system would have been preferable. Most other rich countries do it this way. It could have been grafted on to Social Security and Medicare, paid for through payroll taxes, expanded to lower-income families through Medicaid. It would have been simple and efficient. (It's no coincidence that the Act's Medicaid expansion has been easy and rapid in states that chose to accept it.)

But Republicans were dead set against this. They wouldn't even abide a ""public option"" to buy into something resembling Medicare. In the end, they wouldn't even go along with the Affordable Care Act, which was based on Republican ideas in the first place. (From Richard Nixon's healthcare plan through the musings of the Heritage Foundation, Republicans for years urged that everything be kept in the hands of private insurers but the government set minimum standards, create state-based insurance exchanges, and require everyone to sign up).

The moral imperative. Even a clunky compromise like the ACA between a national system of health insurance and a for-profit insurance market depends, fundamentally, on a social compact in which those who are healthier and richer are willing to help those who are sicker and poorer. Such a social compact defines a society.

The other day I heard a young man say he'd rather pay a penalty than buy health insurance under the Act because, in his words, ""why should I pay for the sick and the old?"" The answer is he has a responsibility to do so, as a member the same society they inhabit.

The Act also depends on richer people paying higher taxes to finance health insurance for lower-income people. Starting this year, a healthcare surtax of 3.8 percent is applied to capital gains and dividend income of individuals earning more than $200,000 and a nine-tenths of 1 percent healthcare tax to wages over $200,000 or couples over $250,000. Together, the two taxes will raise an estimated $317.7 billion over 10 years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.

Here again, the justification is plain: We are becoming a vastly unequal society in which most of the economic gains are going to the top. It's only just that those with higher incomes bear some responsibility for maintaining the health of Americans who are less fortunate.

This is a profoundly moral argument about who we are and what we owe each other as Americans. But Democrats have failed to make it, perhaps because they're reluctant to admit that the Act involves any redistribution at all.

Redistribution has become so unfashionable it's easier to say everyone comes out ahead. And everyone does come out ahead in the long term: Even the best-off will gain from a healthier and more productive workforce, and will save money from preventive care that reduces the number of destitute people using emergency rooms when they become seriously ill.

But there would be no reason to reform and extend health insurance to begin with if we did not have moral obligations to one another as members of the same society.

The initial problems with the website and the president's ill-advised remark about everyone being able to keep their old policies are real. But they're trifling compared to the wreckage of the current system, the modest but important step toward reform embodied in the Act, and the moral imperative at the core of the Act and of our society.

The Republicans have created a tempest out of trivialities. It is incumbent on Democrats -- from the president on down -- to show Americans the larger picture, and do so again and again.

The hard-line approach failed last week in the Senate, but House Republican leaders saw little choice but to cater to the demands of their right flank and try again, setting up a rare Saturday night session. Tea party lawmakers who say they believe ordinary Americans want to end the Affordable Care Act have committed to that goal, even if Republicans are blamed for shutting down routine government services for the first time in nearly two decades.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) was cheered with chants of “Vote! Vote! Vote!” as he outlined the proposal during a noon meeting in the Capitol basement. After midnight Saturday, the House approved the plan, sending legislation to the Senate to fund the government through Dec. 15 but delay the rollout of the healthcare law for one year and repeal the law’s tax on medical-device manufacturers. A separate bill was unanimously approved to ensure that military troops continue to be paid if there is a shutdown.

House Republicans appeared unswayed by the certainty that this latest effort is doomed in the Senate, where Democrats have the majority, or by stern warnings from the White House, which promised a veto and said the amendments “advance a narrow ideological agenda and threaten the nation’s economy.”

The president’s spokesman warned Republicans against pursuing this “reckless and irresponsible” path. “Today, Republicans in the House of Representatives moved to shut down the government,” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said in a statement. “The president has shown that he is willing to improve the healthcare law and meet Republicans more than halfway to deal with our fiscal challenges, but he will not do so under threats of a government shutdown that will hurt our economy.”

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) vowed Saturday that Americans would not be “extorted by tea party anarchists.”

“To be absolutely clear, the Senate will reject both the one-year delay of the Affordable Care Act and the repeal of the medical-device tax,” he said in a statement. “After weeks of futile political games from Republicans, we are still at square one.”

The Senate, which was not expected to resume work on the bill until Monday, could operate under rules that require only a simple majority to reject the Republican amendments, a leadership aide said. That could leave the House on the hook to pass the government funding bill later Monday or launch a shutdown.

Boehner would then have few choices. He could try to approve a stopgap measure to keep the government running for a short time as talks continue or try to attach more modest changes to the healthcare law. He could also simply abandon his most conservative colleagues and seek a bipartisan coalition with Democrats to continue to fund the government and prevent a shutdown, risking the ire of his majority.

In the afternoon, Boehner walked through the crowded Speaker’s Lobby off the House chamber for a smoke break on the balcony, but declined to answer reporters’ questions.

The gloomy prospect of an economic disruption that could be triggered by furloughed federal workers and closed museums, parks and government operations on Tuesday, the first day of the new fiscal year, was no match for the enthusiasm of GOP lawmakers filling the halls of the Capitol on Saturday.

“Did you hear all the hooting and hollering?” said Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), as rank-and-file lawmakers spilled out of a private strategy session. “The conference is pretty unified. Ready to fight on.”

A day earlier, it had seemed that the Republican Party’s far-right flank had exhausted its efforts after the Senate defeated its bid to halt federal funding for the healthcare law. Boehner remained largely silent and out of sight.

But the failed GOP effort in the Senate led by tea party Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) appeared only to energize the conservative flank in the House. Cruz held the Senate floor for more than 21 hours to denounce the law, also known as Obamacare, and encouraged his compatriots in the House to carry on the fight. More than 60 GOP lawmakers pledged their support of a one-year delay of the law.

With such overwhelming numbers, Boehner had few options but to embrace their strategy lest he loosen an already wobbly grip on his increasingly defiant GOP majority.

“He saw folks coalescing around a concept,” said Rep. Tom Graves (R-Ga.), who led the effort to delay Obamacare in the House. “It’s one step at a time.”

Republicans see Tuesday’s launch of the healthcare law’s online marketplaces as one of their last chances to stop Obamacare, even though Senate Democrats appear united in their commitment to protect the president’s signature legislative accomplishment. The House bill would delay the marketplaces for a year.

Any delay in the healthcare law remains highly unlikely. Moreover, key aspects of the law are already underway.

The president said Friday that the marketplaces, where the uninsured will shop for policies, will open for business on Tuesday even if there is a federal shutdown. “That’s a done deal,” he said.

But the attempt to repeal the medical-device tax put some Democrats in a bind. More than 30 Democrats in the Senate and a similar number in the House have previously backed a repeal, including many from states with companies that make medical devices.

The 2.3% tax on devices other than such routine equipment as eyewear and hearing aids is expected to raise about $30 billion over 10 years to help pay for the Affordable Care Act.

However, key Democratic lawmakers said they would not agree to repeal the tax as part of the government funding bill. House

Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said in a statement that the repeal effort was “a gift to the insurance companies by putting them back in charge of Americans’ healthcare.” Seventeen House Democrats voted for the repeal.

The difficulty Boehner had convincing Republicans to vote for any measure that does not fully end Obamacare was evident in the bill. It includes a provision that would allow employers that have religious or moral objections to contraception not to provide it on their company health insurance policies for employees.

Only one lawmaker, Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), publicly urged his colleagues in the meeting of House Republicans to keep in mind the “big picture.” But others privately worried about the political fallout over what they feared was the inevitable outcome, and hoped a last-minute resolution would emerge on Monday. In the end, all but two Republicans voted for the delay.

“If this is part of a process, fine. I’ll vote for it,” said Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.). “But we can’t let the government shut down. If we do, we’ve just allowed people to hijack our party and the government.”

And we should be grateful for the heads-up about the speech’s majorness. Otherwise, a read of the speech might have suggested that he was offering nothing more than a meager, warmed-over selection of stale ideas.

To be sure, Mr. Cantor tried to sound interested in serious policy discussion. But he didn’t succeed — and that was no accident. For these days his party dislikes the whole idea of applying critical thinking and evidence to policy questions. And no, that’s not a caricature: Last year the Texas G.O.P. explicitly condemned efforts to teach “critical thinking skills,” because, it said, such efforts “have the purpose of challenging the student’s fixed beliefs and undermining parental authority.”

And such is the influence of what we might call the ignorance caucus that even when giving a speech intended to demonstrate his openness to new ideas, Mr. Cantor felt obliged to give that caucus a shout-out, calling for a complete end to federal funding of social science research. Because it’s surely a waste of money seeking to understand the society we’re trying to change.

Want other examples of the ignorance caucus at work? Start with health care, an area in which Mr. Cantor tried not to sound anti-intellectual; he lavished praise on medical research just before attacking federal support for social science. (By the way, how much money are we talking about? Well, the entire National Science Foundation budget for social and economic sciences amounts to a whopping 0.01 percent of the budget deficit.)"

She Received The Pulitzer Prize For Commentary In']",Kathleen Parker: The White House Comedy Club,"While the nation’s attention has been riveted on the Keystone Congress, the executive branch was busy developing its own comedy routine. Picture the cast (you know the characters) shrugging their shoulders in unison: “Who, me?”

This would be the response to the glitch-rich health-care rollout, for which no one seems responsible. “Beats me. I thought it was working!” This would also be the response to the eavesdropping scandal, which soon could become an international showdown. “Who knew?” Hint: He used to work at the National Security Agency (NSA) and now lives in Russia.

Not least, the shrug also would be the response to a White House rumor that a certain Republican House leader said to President Obama during a government shutdown meeting, “I cannot even stand to look at you.”

Except no one said it. Shrug.

The rumor kicked off uncharacteristically glitch-free when Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) heard it from what he apparently considered a reliable source and posted it on his Facebook page. Early rumor embellishments suggested that House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) was the demon source, which later was clarified to impugn Pete Sessions (R-Tex.) who denied it.

1 of 68 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Obama View Photos A collection of cartoons of the president. Caption A collection of cartoons of the president. Wait 1 second to continue.

In fact, no one said it, according to a White House official, who attributed the untruth to a “miscommunication” during a report by White House Deputy Chief of Staff Rob Nabors to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). Of course, Reid told the entire Senate Democratic caucus, identifying Sessions as the evildoer. Durbin did not name Sessions in his post.

Voilà! A rumor is born. Roll cameras. The White House regrets the “misunderstanding.” Cut.

Meanwhile, the “rollout,” a term forever tarnished by the ineptitude displayed since Oct. 1 when Americans were finally going to be able to sign up for “affordable” (translation: I buy, you pay) health insurance, has been an embarrassment. Even if one is inclined to grant the benefit of the doubt (because technology can be a beast), evidence suggests that the “glitches” were the result of poor judgment and bad decisions.

But whose?

Four contractors hired to set up the computer system testified during congressional hearings that system testing began just two weeks before the launch date — and the test failed. Part of the problem was a decision not to allow customers to browse anonymously, as most people doubtless would prefer. Privacy and all that (chortle, chortle). Instead, people had to fill out forms before they could take a peek at the merchandise — an unmanageable burden to a system inadequate for the immense demand.

Who made that decision? The contractors testified they didn’t know who made the decisions or who was responsible for correcting problems. One can blame the computer guys, of course. Or demand the head of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, under whose supervision the Affordable Care Act falls. But ultimately, the responsibility for the popularly known “Obamacare” rests with the person who insisted in the midst of a historic recession, a global financial meltdown and record unemployment that we needed to overhaul the entire health-care industry.

Not to drone on, but yet another “meanwhile” demands attention: A photo of German Chancellor Angela Merkel on the front page of Friday’s Wall Street Journal saves writers a thousand words. She may be giving the evil eye to a photographer as she arrives at a European Union summit in Brussels, but it perfectly captures sentiments she has expressed upon learning of a report that the NSA had been listening to her cellphone conversations.

Not only Merkel but as many as 35 world leaders may have been targets of our eavesdropping, according to Britain’s Guardian newspaper. They are not amused.

Consequences, which include potential damage to a transatlantic free trade agreement, are yet to be fully imagined. What we cannot avoid registering is that we look like not the glimmering city on the hill but a ship of untrustworthy fools.

We reportedly eavesdrop on our allies and force citizens to buy insurance through a system we can’t manage. We concoct character-smearing rumors and attach them to our political adversaries. And that’s just the executive branch. Most important, we have damaged our bonds of trust with nations we need to keep as friends.

Any one of the above would make for a very bad week in governance. Combined, they suggest an uncomfortable conclusion to the world we purport to lead: The lights are flickering in the city on the hill, and our ship of state is foundering.

Like hard-liners in the far right corner of the House, Mr. Cruz has grabbed for every possible lever in his campaign against President Obama’s health law, fully aware that he will not succeed but eager for the accolades and donations that will inevitably follow from the Tea Party’s misguided faithful. In the process, he has demonstrated how little he understands Senate rules and, more important, how little he appreciates the public’s desire for a collaborative Congress.

Mr. Cruz’s campaign to defund health reform consists largely of an absurd plan to filibuster the very House bill that kept the government from closing and defunded the health law, a notion that was rejected by the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, and most Senate Republicans. After he lost their support, he began an extended tirade anyway, a stunt that might resemble a filibuster but in fact will have to end Wednesday morning before a prescheduled vote on the House bill takes place.

In just the first hour of his speech, Mr. Cruz said his fellow senators were no more sincere than professional wrestlers and that accepting the health law was like appeasing the Nazis. His own goal of tearing down the law, he said, was a dream on par with President John F. Kennedy’s promise to put a man on the moon. This combination of grandiosity and pure nastiness helps explain why the senator has become the least popular man in Washington."

""There are no winners here.""



But according to a study conducted by the conservative Media Research Center, there was a clear loser presented to the more than 20 million viewers who tuned in to the evening newscasts of the three major television networks during the shutdown: the GOP.



""What those viewers heard,"" according to the MRC analysis, ""was a version of the shutdown story that could easily have emanated from Barack Obama’s own White House.""



“This current government shutdown traces its history back to a determined core of GOP House members who are vehemently against Obamacare and were willing to shut down the government because of it,” Brian Williams said on the Oct. 14 broadcast of ""NBC Nightly News,"" MRC's Rich Noyes noted in a blog post announcing the study.



Of the 124 stories broadcast on the ABC, NBC and CBS nightly newscasts about the shutdown from Oct. 1 through Oct. 15, the study found 41 blamed Republicans or conservatives for the impasse, 17 blamed both sides and none specifically blamed Democrats.



In the two weeks leading up to the shutdown, the MRC said, the same networks ran 21 stories blaming Republicans, four blaming both sides and none blaming Democrats.



That's 62 blaming Republicans and none blaming Democrats for those of you keeping score at home.



But those numbers mirror polls conducted before and during the shutdown, which found most Americans blamed the GOP for the shutdown. In one, 62 percent of respondents blamed Republicans for the shutdown, while less than half blamed Obama or the Democrats in Congress.



According to TruthRevolt.org, another conservative site, the slant against the GOP was equally evident in print. The Washington Post and New York Times, the site said, ""covered victims of the government shutdown over victims of Obamacare by a margin of 100 to 1.""



Media Matters, the progressive research center that monitors conservative media, has yet to publish a similar study on the shutdown coverage.



The MRC study did not include cable news, which had mostly wall-to-wall coverage of the shutdown since it began on Oct. 1. CNN, for example, ran on-screen shutdown and debt ceiling deadline clocks for virtually the entire impasse and consistently featured interviews with moderate Republicans who disagreed with the tea party's tactic.



""I know you have the counter on your screen right now that talks about how many hours we've been in the shutdown,"" Republican Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, a tea party conservative, said on CNN on Oct. 10. ""I would suggest that CNN also put up a counter of the debt clock, about how quickly we're accumulating debt. It's frightening when people see how fast that's accumulating.""



Fox News' approach to covering the shutdown, on the other hand, was to pretend it wasn't a shutdown at all. According to the cable news network, it was more of a ""slimdown.""



The MRC study also did not look at Sunday morning talk shows, which have featured a parade of congressional lawmakers arguing for and against the shutdown in recent weeks.



On CBS on Thursday morning, “Face the Nation” anchor Bob Schieffer declared Obama the clear winner in the shutdown.



“The president won this thing,” Schieffer said."

Progressives are angry (with good reason) over proposed cuts to Social Security; conservatives are denouncing the call for more revenues. But it’s all Kabuki. Since House Republicans will block anything Mr. Obama proposes, his budget is best seen not as policy but as positioning, an attempt to gain praise from “centrist” pundits.

No, the real policy action at this point is in the states, where the question is, How many Americans will be denied essential health care in the name of freedom?

I’m referring, of course, to the question of how many Republican governors will reject the Medicaid expansion that is a key part of Obamacare. What does that have to do with freedom? In reality, nothing. But when it comes to politics, it’s a different story.

It goes without saying that Republicans oppose any expansion of programs that help the less fortunate — along with tax cuts for the wealthy, such opposition is pretty much what defines modern conservatism.

Two years ago when Tina Brown and Diane von Furstenberg first envisioned this conference, they asked me to do a play, a reading, called – the name of the play was called Seven. It was taken from transcripts, real testimony from real women activists around the world. I was the Irish one, and I had no idea that the real women would be sitting in the audience while we portrayed them. So I was doing a pretty ghastly Belfast accent. I was just – I was imitating my friend Liam Neeson, really, and I sounded like a fellow. (Laughter). It was really bad.

So I was so mortified when Tina, at the end of the play, invited the real women to come up on stage and I found myself standing next to the great Inez McCormack. (Applause.) And I felt slight next to her, because I’m an actress and she is the real deal. She has put her life on the line. Six of those seven women were with us in the theater that night. The seventh, Mukhtaran Bibi, couldn’t come because she couldn’t get out of Pakistan. You probably remember who she is. She’s the young woman who went to court because she was gang-raped by men in her village as punishment for a perceived slight to their honor by her little brother. All but one of the 14 men accused were acquitted, but Mukhtaran won the small settlement. She won $8,200, which she then used to start schools in her village. More money poured in from international donations when the men were set free. And as a result of her trial, the then president of Pakistan, General Musharraf, went on TV and said, “If you want to be a millionaire, just get yourself raped.”

But that night in the theater two years ago, the other six brave women came up on the stage. Anabella De Leon of Guatemala pointed to Hillary Clinton, who was sitting right in the front row, and said, “I met her and my life changed.” And all weekend long, women from all over the world said the same thing:

""I’m alive because she came to my village, put her arm around me, and had a photograph taken together.""

""I’m alive because she went on our local TV and talked about my work, and now they’re afraid to kill me.""

""I’m alive because she came to my country and she talked to our leaders, because I heard her speak, because I read about her.""

I’m here today because of that, because of those stores. I didn’t know about this. I never knew any of it. And I think everybody should know. This hidden history Hillary has, the story of her parallel agenda, the shadow diplomacy unheralded, uncelebrated — careful, constant work on behalf of women and girls that she has always conducted alongside everything else a First Lady, a Senator, and now Secretary of State is obliged to do.

And it deserves to be amplified. This willingness to take it, to lead a revolution – and revelation, beginning in Beijing in 1995, when she first raised her voice to say the words you’ve heard many times throughout this conference: “Women’s Rights Are Human Rights.”

When Hillary Clinton stood up in Beijing to speak that truth, her hosts were not the only ones who didn’t necessarily want to hear it. Some of her husband’s advisors also were nervous about the speech, fearful of upsetting relations with China. But she faced down the opposition at home and abroad, and her words continue to hearten women around the world and have reverberated down the decades.

…

She’s just been busy working, doing it, making those words “Women’s Rights are Human Rights” into something every leader in every country now knows is a linchpin of American policy. It’s just so much more than a rhetorical triumph. We’re talking about what happened in the real world, the institutional change that was a result of that stand she took.

…

Now we know that the higher the education and the involvement of women in a culture and economy, the more secure the nation. It’s a metric we use throughout our foreign policy, and in fact, it’s at the core of our development policy. It is a big, important shift in thinking. Horrifying practices like female genital cutting were not at the top of the agenda because they were part of the culture and we didn’t want to be accused of imposing our own cultural values.

But what Hillary Clinton has said over and over again is, “A crime is a crime, and criminal behavior cannot be tolerated.” Everywhere she goes, she meets with the head of state and she meets with the women leaders of grassroots organizations in each country. This goes automatically on her schedule. As you’ve seen, when she went to Burma – our first government trip there in 40 years. She met with its dictator and then she met with Aung San Suu Kyi, the woman he kept under detention for 15 years, the leader of Burma’s pro-democracy movement.

This isn’t just symbolism. It’s how you change the world. These are the words of Dr. Gao Yaojie of China: “I will never forget our first meeting. She said I reminded her of her mother. And she noticed my small bound feet. I didn’t need to explain too much, and she understood completely. I could tell how much she wanted to understand what I, an 80-something year old lady, went through in China – the Cultural Revolution, uncovering the largest tainted blood scandal in China, house arrest, forced family separation. I talked about it like nothing and I joked about it, but she understood me as a person, a mother, a doctor. She knew what I really went through.”

When Vera Stremkovskaya, a lawyer and human rights activist from Belarus met Hillary Clinton a few years ago, they took a photograph together. And she said to one of the Secretary’s colleagues, “I want that picture.” And the colleague said, “I will get you that picture as soon as possible.” And Stremkovskaya said, “I need that picture.” And the colleague said, “I promise you.” And Stremkovskaya said, “You don’t understand. That picture will be my bullet-proof vest.”

Never give up. Never, never, never, never, never give up. That is what Hillary Clinton embodies."

(CNN) —

It was with a heavy heart that I heard Edward Snowden has been granted, and apparently accepted, temporary asylum in Russia for one year. Short of locking him naked in solitary confinement as an example to other leakers, as was done to Bradley Manning, Russia is exactly where the American intelligence community wants Snowden.

How better to discredit Snowden’s warnings of the threat posed to civil liberties by our ever-growing surveillance state than to ceaselessly point out that he has found sanctuary in the arms of the FSB, the successor to the KGB? I suspect this latest development will nix any possibility of reform of domestic surveillance operations coming out of the House Judiciary Committee.

Of course, at this point, where else could Snowden go? He had spent five weeks in Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport. That had to be a purgatory on earth. By leaning on our allies, America had effectively trapped him there. One should not take too seriously, though, the outrage expressed by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Congress over this latest Russian perfidy. By fleeing to America’s traditional bogeyman, Snowden has seriously blunted his own effectiveness. He has become an easy target for the U.S. government to demonize.

Into whose hands has Edward Snowden actually put himself? With nowhere else to go, he is now physically under the control of a government whose leadership under Vladimir Putin has raised human rights alarms worldwide for the alleged killing of dissenting reporters, the jailing of performance artists like Pussy Riot and – most recently – the criminalization of homosexuality.

Putin’s thumbing of the nose to the Obama administration may be seen as a great thing for Snowden and his fate, but it’s important to bear in mind that today’s Russia is no more a bastion of free speech than China.

Opinion: How Putin’s move could help Snowden and U.S.

Years ago, I was convicted of espionage, sentenced to 40 years imprisonment, and packed off in chains to a federal penitentiary. It was more than I could endure, so one cold winter night I escaped through the razor wire.

I at once became America’s most wanted fugitive. I was hunted high and low by the FBI and the U.S. Marshals Service. I was shot at and chased and forever looking over my shoulder. I too contemplated seeking sanctuary in Russia. I thought long and hard about it because there was an easy route through Havana to Moscow. But I could not stomach the thought of it. I decided I would rather live the life of a hunted fugitive in my own country than spend my years controlled as a puppet of the KGB. After my arrest in 1977, I spent 25 years in prison.

Contrary to what many believe, my partner and I did not give information to the Soviet Embassy to aid the Soviet Union. I did what I did because I wanted to publicize and strike back at the U.S. intelligence community for the things I saw that outraged me. It was a mistake that cost me dearly, and one that I lived to regret. I suspect Snowden will come to regret his actions just as deeply. This, more than anything else, would be the greatest tragedy of all.

Opinion: What’s in it for Russia?

There is no doubt in my mind that Edward Snowden will rather be anywhere else on earth than in the arms of Putin’s Russia. Of course, there are two exceptions to that statement: He does not want to be dead and he does not want to be sitting naked in an American solitary confinement cell. I do not see that his choices were all that great.

Meanwhile, the U.S. surveillance state will go on stockpiling the sensitive personal data of the American people.

The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court will continue to function as a secret rubber stamp to spy on our own citizenry.

The bulk collection of our telephone data will mushroom.

The addresses of all letters and packages mailed and received will continue to be photographed by the U.S. Post Office.

Internet companies will continue to be bent to the secret purposes of the surveillance state.

The NSA will go on recording all our e-mail.

Opinion: Snowden is an unwanted guest in Putin’s Russia

Transparency, public disclosure, and open debate will be stifled as America becomes the world’s first cyber-superpower. And politicians of both parties will go on fearing to resist lest they be blamed should a cyber-attack happen.

Our surveillance state is only just beginning to flex its technological muscles. We have nothing to lose but our civil liberties.

His Latest Novel Is', 'The Paladin.']","David Ignatius: Snowden exposed policies approved by Congress, courts","Journalists have a professional commitment to the idea that more debate is better, so we instinctively side with leakers. But I’m skeptical about some of the claims of Edward Snowden, the young National Security Agency contractor who leaked secrets about that agency’s surveillance programs to The Post and the Guardian.

Snowden has described his actions in idealistic terms. “I’m willing to sacrifice . . . because I can’t in good conscience allow the U.S. government to destroy privacy, Internet freedom and basic liberties,” he said in an interview with the Guardian. But it’s hard for me to see him as a hero.

What worries me is that Snowden is challenging the rule of law. The NSA Internet surveillance program he decided to reveal is legal, in the sense that it was passed by both houses of Congress and is reviewed regularly by the intelligence committees. It is overseen by judges who sit on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. In 2008, that court ruled against a company that challenged the law.

Perhaps Snowden would argue that Congress and the courts ­haven’t been aggressive or diligent enough in their oversight, and that the NSA has dangerously misused its surveillance authority. Or maybe he would argue that he’s answering to a higher moral code, or that Congress and the courts are wrongly interpreting the Constitution. These claims will be tested in the coming debate, but we should be wary about endorsing any contention that it’s okay to violate laws because you’re acting on higher authority.

Snowden’s case is similar to that of CIA dissident Philip Agee. He published a revelatory memoir in 1975 called “Inside the Company: CIA Diary,” which outed the names and code names of scores of operatives with whom Agee had worked. He wrote in the introduction: “When I joined the CIA I believed in the need for its existence. After 12 years with the agency, I finally understood how much suffering it was causing. . . . I couldn’t sit by and do nothing.” Agee died in 2008 in Cuba, where he had sought refuge.

The CIA claimed at the time that it had suffered great damage from Agee’s revelations, but it’s still very much in business. Indeed, you could argue that the agency is far more aggressive and willing to use deadly force today than Agee ever envisioned. In that sense, we should be skeptical both of the efficacy of whistleblowers and of claims that unauthorized disclosures (as by Agee, or now Snowden) will cause irreparable harm. Usually these turn out to be overstated.

James Clapper, the director of national intelligence who oversees the NSA, argued last weekend that Snowden made “reckless” disclosures about its monitoring of foreign Internet communications, and that “potentially long-lasting and irreversible harm” could come from the revelation of a court order authorizing collection of telephone call data from Verizon. Congress and the courts will examine such claims, but how should we as citizens evaluate them?

My guess is that Clapper is correct when he implicitly argues that these electronic surveillance programs are the United States’ best tool in combating terrorism. It’s probably also true that each revelation of U.S. capabilities weakens this advantage by putting adversaries such as al-Qaeda on notice about our snooping capabilities. The revelations likely make it harder, as well, for U.S. corporations and foreign allies to cooperate.

For evidence of how al-Qaeda goes to school on leaks about surveillance techniques, just read the collected messages of Osama bin Laden that were taken from his hideout in Abbottabad when he was killed May 2, 2011. He admonished his aides how to avoid U.S. overhead surveillance (“move only when the clouds are heavy”) and money-laundering surveillance (“get rid of the bag that the money was in because it might have a chip”).

What bin Laden understood best was the need to avoid NSA monitoring of his telephone and Internet communications. He went dark, communicating only by courier. That’s how he remained hidden in plain sight for five years: He didn’t leave any digital tracks.

Some might argue that the bin Laden case shows that the NSA’s efforts are futile; the terrorists have gotten too smart for us. But intelligence collection relies on the human fact that even smart people do stupid things; they forget how powerful and pervasive the U.S. systems are. That’s why these surveillance programs remain valuable.

The United States went security-mad after Sept. 11, 2001, in ways that harmed the country. But these excesses led Congress to restructure surveillance programs so that they were lawful and controlled. These lawful programs were the ones Snowden unilaterally disclosed.

In doing so, he proclaimed that he wanted to push forward with other legislative priorities, including a budget, immigration reform, and the long-stalled pork-laden farm bill.

“[I]n the coming days and weeks, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, a budget that grows our economy faster and shrinks our long-term deficits further,” Obama stated. Historically, “balanced” has been code for tax increases.

Obama then pushed on to immigration reform: “Number two. We should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system.” Naturally, he blamed the Republican House for stalling his preferred immigration bill.

Finally, Obama called for the farm bill to be passed: “Number three. We should pass a farm bill, one that American farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need, one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the long-term certainty that they deserve.” And, disingenuously, he called for negotiations.

On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) echoed Obama, saying, “I look forward to the next venture, which is making sure we do immigration reform.” On Thursday, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said that Obama wanted immigration reform “more than anything else” during his second term. Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-CA) said that he trusted that Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH) would cave on immigration: “Once again, the speaker for the majority party is going to be placed in a position of deciding whether he’s going to put country before party and get something done. We just need a few courageous Republicans to stand up and say they’re ready.”

Republicans, however, pushed back. “It’s not going to happen this year,” said Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID). “After the way the president acted over the last two or three weeks where he would refuse to talk to the speaker of the House…they’re not going to get immigration reform. That’s done.”

The waiver will make it easier for some undocumented spouses to remain here until reforms pass

Another change directs officers to focus on arresting%2C deporting immigrants with criminal backgrounds

Third change allows young illegals brought here as children to apply to live%2C work here temporarily

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — Hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants in the United States will have an easier time gaining legal status because of a policy change from President Barack Obama's administration.

The change takes effect March 4 and is aimed at undocumented immigrants married to U.S. citizens, such as Xochitl Hernandez, 33, who came to the U.S. illegally 14 years ago and now lives in this Phoenix suburb.

Soon, Hernandez and other undocumented immigrants married to U.S. citizens will be able to apply for a special waiver instead of having to leave the country and face tough penalties before obtaining their legal papers through a U.S. citizen spouse.

""This is really good news for me,"" said Hernandez, who has two daughters who are U.S. citizens, one with a severe physical disability. ""I no longer will have to worry about going outside the country and being separated from my babies.""

It is one of several major immigration-policy changes from the Obama administration in the past two years. The changes are intended to provide protection from deportation to undocumented immigrants with clean records and long ties to this country until Congress passes permanent immigration reforms.

The change also could have long-term political implications. Immigrant advocates have hailed the measure, and it could help boost Obama's popularity with the growing numbers of Latino and Asian voters as Congress gears up to address the long-simmering issue of immigration reform later this year.

However, some say the waiver change could make it harder for the president to negotiate a compromise with conservative Republicans, who view it as an end-run around Congress and a form of amnesty for illegal immigrants.

The Obama administration announced the waiver change in January 2012 and finalized it earlier this month.

Critics of the change are concerned that allowing undocumented immigrants to apply for waivers within the U.S. could invite marriage fraud and weaken long-standing penalties intended to discourage illegal immigration.

Under the change, undocumented immigrants married to U.S. citizens will be able to apply for a special provisional waiver from within the United States to avoid a 10-year ban from coming back to the U.S. as punishment for having lived here illegally for more than a year.

The 10-year ban was put into place as part of a 1996 law intended to discourage illegal immigration.

Hernandez and her husband, Richard Hernandez, 37, met at a restaurant where they worked as cooks. He is a U.S. citizen born in this country.

They married nine years ago. As the spouse of a U.S. citizen, Xochitl Hernandez is eligible to apply for legal permanent residency, known as a green card. But because she entered the U.S. illegally, she is first required to return to Mexico, her home country, to go through the interview process at the U.S. Consulate in Juarez.

But leaving the United States would have triggered the 10-year penalty.

Hernandez thinks she has a good shot at qualifying for a waiver because her two daughters, Karyne, 8, and Alexa, 3, both were born in this country, making them citizens.

To receive the waiver, Hernandez will have to prove that her separation would cause extreme hardship to a U.S. citizen family member.

Hernandez said her oldest daughter was born with a turned-in foot that limits her ability to walk and requires special care. Hernandez said she has to drive her daughter to and from school as well as to weekly therapy sessions and regular medical appointments.

In the past, Hernandez would have had to apply for the waiver in Mexico.

But her lawyer, Delia Salvatierra, told her that it could have taken up to a year for the waiver to be approved. And if the waiver were denied, Hernandez would have had to wait 10 years before re-entering the U.S. legally.

Until now, she figured she was better off remaining in the U.S. illegally than being separated from her family for a year or longer.

Under the new policy, Hernandez still will have to prove the 10-year ban would cause extreme hardship to her daughter. But now she will be able to apply for the waiver without having to leave the U.S.

If the waiver is approved, Hernandez would be able to return to Mexico with the waiver to go through the green-card interview process in Juarez.

Instead of a year or longer, she likely will have to wait less than two weeks to receive her green card, allowing her to return to the United States legally as a permanent resident, her lawyer said.

Focusing on families

Obama administration officials say the main goal is to prevent the long separation of families as undocumented immigrants try to legalize their status through a U.S. citizen spouse or parent.

""This new process facilitates the legal immigration process and reduces long periods of separation between U.S. citizens and their immediate relatives,"" Alejandro Mayorkas, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services director, said in a statement.

Department of Homeland Security officials have no estimate of how many undocumented immigrants may benefit from the change in the waiver policy.

But Muzaffar Chishti, director of the Migration Policy Institute's office at New York University, said hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants will more easily be able to become permanent residents as a result of the policy change.

The nonprofit research center in the District of Columbia proposed the change before the Obama administration implemented it.

""It's a big deal in many ways,"" Chishti said. ""It does open up the possibility for people to apply for the waivers who may have been reluctant to in the past"" because they didn't want to be separated from their families.

Critics say the waiver change shields undocumented immigrants from the penalties Congress put in place 17 years ago to discourage illegal immigration and punish illegal immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for more than a year. Even if they were denied, undocumented immigrants still would likely avoid the 10-year ban because they won't have to leave the country to apply.

What's more, Department of Homeland Security officials say they don't plan to go after undocumented immigrants denied waivers.

""It's allowing people to avoid this penalty,"" said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based group that favors increased immigration enforcement and reducing overall immigration.

Vaughan said she also thinks the waiver change could lead to more marriage fraud because it will be easier for undocumented immigrants who marry U.S. citizens to avoid the 10-year ban.

She also is concerned that the government, under pressure to process an increase in waiver applications, will give less scrutiny to undocumented immigrants applying for green cards through U.S. citizen spouses.

""I think there is pretty high likelihood they are going to be rubber-stamped,"" she said.

The future of reform

The waiver change is one of three Obama administration immigration-policy changes to make it easier for certain undocumented immigrants to remain in the United States until Congress passes permanent reforms, Chishti said.

Another change directs Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to focus on arresting and deporting illegal immigrants with criminal backgrounds over those with clean records and long ties here.

The third change is the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allows young undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children to apply to live in this country and work temporarily without the threat of deportation. As of Dec. 16, more than 367,903 young undocumented immigrants have applied for deferred action since the government began accepting applications Aug. 15.

Chishti said the waiver change ultimately could help Democrats in the 2016 presidential election by making it easier for undocumented immigrants married to U.S. citizens to get permanent residence.

That could result in an increase in the number of Latino and Asian voters because permanent residents married to U.S. citizens are eligible to apply for naturalization after three years, Chishti said.

He pointed out that Latinos and Asians voted overwhelmingly for Obama in the November election.

""This (waiver change) has much more of a political payoff"" than the other policy changes, he said.

Chishti said Obama's re-election has motivated Republican leaders in Congress to pass immigration reforms that include a legalization program to avoid turning Latino voters into ""permanent Democrats.""

However, Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies thinks the waiver change could backfire by making it harder for Obama to negotiate an immigration-reform deal with Republicans, especially in the House, where immigration reform faces more of an uphill battle than in the Senate.

""Every time he abuses his authority, he is making House Republicans less open to working with him,"" Vaughan said. ""I think that is kind of poisoning the atmosphere for a compromise approach. He is burning bridges.""

Meanwhile, Hernandez is busy preparing her paperwork so she can apply for the waiver in March, and after that, her green card.

""I feel very happy because I can see the time coming when I will have my papers in hand,"" she said.

According to a report in the Miami Herald, Fusion, the cable channel that will debut on October 28 in roughly 20 million homes, may collect nearly $10 million in subsidies “pledged by Miami-Dade County and Florida for the new venture, with the state contributing $7 million to the package.”

Fusion’s facility opened on Wednesday in Doral, Florida and, in return for the subsidies, Univision has reportedly “pledged to spend $247 million on the new complex over many years.”

Jorge Ramos, the host of Univision’s Al Punto Sunday Show, will anchor a one-hour show at 8 PM on Fusion, and he was clear that the channel will intend to “own” the immigration debate “from the first hour.” On his Sunday show, Ramos has been a fierce advocate of comprehensive immigration reform. On a recent episode, Ramos interviewed citizen-activist D.A. King, a staunch opponent of amnesty. Ramos’s first question to King was, “Why do you hate immigrants so much?”

“We’re going to come out on Oct. 28th, and if the House doesn’t approve immigration reform by then, then there’s going to be a new, very loud voice in Fusion, talking about immigration every single night until immigration reform passes,” Ramos told The Huffington Post in a recent interview.

As the Herald notes, Fusion is “partly a hedge against the aging of Univision’s primetime audience of nearly 4 million Spanish-speaking residents, as their children and grandchildren increasingly turn to English-language programming.”

Though “Nielsen ratings show Univision drawing an average prime-time audience of 3.6 million, large enough for it to be the No. 1 network in any language during the summer re-run season,” a Pew Research poll found that “half of Hispanic Latino adults get their news in both Spanish and English, while the number relying solely on Spanish-language news sources dropped from 22 percent in 2006 to 18 percent in 2012.”

The channel also plans to target so-called millennials, and some of their hosts do not speak Spanish. The network has even hired a former producer for The Daily Show to produce satire programming on news and sports."

Press secretary Jay Carney’s comments came after U.S. District Court Judge Gladys Kessler urged Obama to personally address the controversy over the hunger strike at the notorious facility. Kessler dismissed a suit from a Guantanamo detainee who argued that the government will infringe upon his religious freedom by force-feeding him during the Muslim holiday of Ramadan, which begins Tuesday, but called the practice “painful, humiliating and degrading"" and pressed the president to act.

Asked about Kessler's comments, Carney told reporters at his daily briefing, ""On the questions of litigation I would refer you to the Department of Justice and the Defense Department, which obviously runs Guantanamo Bay, I would refer you to them for specifics about the hunger strikers.""

But ""we don’t want these individuals to die. And, you know, the action being taken is to prevent that from happening,"" he underlined. Obama ""understands that this is a challenging situation.""

Jihad Dhiab, a Syrian detainee who was cleared for release by the Guantanamo Review Task Force in 2009 but has remained imprisoned, sued with three other detainees over the military's policy of forcibly feeding detainees who are on hunger strike and lose a certain amount of their body weight.

Dhiab claimed that the forced feeding would violate his religious freedom during the month of Ramadan, when devotees are supposed to fast until sundown each day. It is the U.S military and prisons policy not to allow prisoners to starve themselves, but the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, the World Medical Association and other groups have said the practice is inhumane and that people should have the right to starve themselves in protest. Dhiab is one of 45 Guantanamo prisoners on a force-feed list, with a total of 106 captives on hunger strike. Only 60 of the 166 Guantanamo prisoners are not currently on hunger strike.

Carney reiterated Obama's wish to close the facility.

Tim Casey, the lead attorney representing America's self-proclaimed toughest sheriff in the case, said an appeal of the finding that the agency racially profiles people was planned in the next 30 days.

The decision by U.S. District Judge Murray Snow in Phoenix backs up years of allegations from Arpaio's critics who say his officers violate the constitutional rights of Latinos in relying on race in their immigration enforcement.

Snow, whose ruling came more than eight months after a seven-day, non-jury trial, also ruled Arpaio's deputies unreasonably prolonged the detentions of people who were pulled over.

The ruling marks a thorough repudiation of the immigration patrols that made Arpaio a national political figure, and it represents a victory for those who pushed the lawsuit.

""For too long the sheriff has been victimizing the people he's meant to serve with his discriminatory policy,"" said Cecillia D. Wang, director of the ACLU Immigrants' Right Project. ""Today we're seeing justice for everyone in the county.""

Monetary damages weren't sought in the lawsuit but rather a declaration that Arpaio's office engages in racial profiling and an order that requires it to make policy changes.

Stanley Young, the lead lawyer who argued the case against Arpaio, said Snow set a hearing for June 14 where he will hear from the two sides on how to make sure the orders in the ruling are carried out.

The sheriff, who has repeatedly denied the allegations, won't face jail time as a result of Friday's ruling.

Casey said that MCSO's position ""is that it has never used race and will never use race in its law-enforcement decisions."" He added the sheriff's office relied on ""bad training"" from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

""The decision here really affects some poor training from ICE and unfortunately we relied on ICE, acted on ICE, and now it turns out ICE was incorrect,"" Casey told MyFoxPhoenix.com.

In the meantime, Casey said the agency ""will meet with the court and comply with the letter and spirit of the order.""

A small group of Latinos alleged in their lawsuit that Arpaio's deputies pulled over some vehicles only to make immigration status checks. The group asked Snow to issue injunctions barring the sheriff's office from discriminatory policing and the judge ruled that more remedies could be ordered in the future.

The group also accused the sheriff of ordering some immigration patrols not based on reports of crime but rather on letters and emails from Arizonans who complained about people with dark skin congregating in an area or speaking Spanish. The group's attorneys noted Arpaio sent thank-you notes to some who wrote the complaints.

The sheriff said his deputies only stop people when they think a crime has been committed and that he wasn't the person who picked the location of the patrols. His lawyers said there was nothing wrong with the thank-you notes.

Young, the group's lawyer, said he was still reading the decision Friday but noted it contained ""very detailed findings of discriminatory intent and effect.""

A call to ICE officials in Phoenix for comment wasn't immediately returned Friday evening.

Arpaio, who turns 81 next month, was elected in November to his sixth consecutive term as sheriff in Arizona's most populous county.

Known for jailing inmates in tents and making prisoners wear pink underwear, Arpaio started doing immigration enforcement in 2006 amid Arizona voter frustration with the state's role as the nation's busiest illegal entryway.

Snow wrote that ""in the absence of further facts that would give rise to reasonable suspicion or probable cause that a violation of either federal criminal law or applicable state law is occurring,"" Arpaio's office now is enjoined from enforcing its policy ""on checking the immigration status of people detained without state charges, using Hispanic ancestry or race as any factor in making law enforcement decisions pertaining to whether a person is authorized to be in the country, and unconstitutionally lengthening stops.""

Snow added ""the evidence introduced at trial establishes that, in the past, the MCSO has aggressively protected its right to engage in immigration and immigration-related enforcement operations even when it had no accurate legal basis for doing so.""

The trial that ended Aug. 2 focused on Latinos who were stopped during both routine traffic patrols and special immigration patrols known as ""sweeps.""

During the sweeps, deputies flood an area of a city -- in some cases, heavily Latino areas -- over several days to seek out traffic violators and arrest other offenders. Immigrants who were in the country illegally accounted for 57 percent of the 1,500 people arrested in the 20 sweeps conducted by his office since January 2008, according to figures provided by Arpaio's office.

At trial, plaintiffs' lawyers drew testimony from witnesses who broke down in tears as they described encounters with authorities, saying they were pulled over because they were Hispanic and officers wanted to check their immigration status, not because they had committed an infraction. The sheriff's attorneys disputed such characterizations, typically working to show that officers had probable cause to stop the drivers based on a traffic violation.

Plaintiffs' lawyers also presented statistics to show Latinos are more likely to be stopped on days of immigration patrols and showed emails containing offensive jokes about people of Mexican heritage that were circulated among sheriff's department employees, including a supervisor in Arpaio's immigrant smuggling squad.

Defense lawyers disputed the statistical findings and said officers who circulated offensive jokes were disciplined. They also denied the complaint letters prompted patrols with a discriminatory motive.

The ruling used Arpaio's own words in interviews, news conferences and press releases against him as he trumpeted his efforts in cracking down on immigrants. When it came to making traffic stops, Arpaio said in 2007 that deputies are not bound by state laws in finding a reason to stop immigrants.

""Ours is an operation, whether it's the state law or the federal, to go after illegals, not the crime first, that they happen to be illegals,"" the ruling quoted Arpaio as saying. ""My program, my philosophy is a pure program. You go after illegals. I'm not afraid to say that. And you go after them and you lock them up.""

Some immigrant traffic stops were made ""purely on the observation of the undercover officers that the vehicles had picked up Hispanic day laborers from sites where Latino day laborers were known to gather,"" the ruling said.

The judge also said the sheriff's office declared on many occasions that racial profiling is strictly prohibited and not tolerated, while witnesses said it was appropriate to consider race as a factor in rounding up immigrants.

""This is a blow to"" the sheriff's office, said David A. Harris, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh who studied racial profiling and wrote a book on the subject.

Arpaio's lawyers will have ""an uphill climb"" in the appeals process because of all ""the gross statistical evidence,"" he said.

According to aides familiar with the closed-door negotiations, the bill would require illegal immigrants to register with Homeland Security Department authorities, file federal income taxes for their time in America and pay a still-to-be-determined fine. They also must have a clean law enforcement record.

RELATED: Is the border secure?

The group’s current draft is largely in line with President Obama’s call to set a pathway to earned citizenship as part of a broader immigration reform package, as well as with recent efforts by prominent Republican lawmakers to resolve an issue that hurt GOP candidates in November’s election.

Though the draft is a long way from becoming law, immigration advocates expressed guarded optimism about a possible breakthrough.

“Nine months ago, people would have thought you were nuts to say that four Republicans and four Democrats were working on a way to legalize 11 million people,” said Angela Kelley, an immigration expert at the Center for American Progress, a think tank with close ties to the White House. “It’s a Rubik’s Cube, but more sides are matching in color than ever before. That’s significant.”

Still undecided is how long illegal immigrants would need to wait before they could apply for permanent resident status and eventually become citizens. The delay for a green card probably would be 10 years or longer, the aides said.

Also unresolved are such politically charged topics as how many visas to issue to high-tech specialists and other guest workers; how to keep track of when visitors leave the country; and how to pay for more Border Patrol officers, fencing and other security measures in an era of shrinking budgets, the aides said.

U.S. immigration law: Decades of debate

The eight senators met Tuesday and Wednesday, alternating between a private office in the Russell Senate Office Building and a marble-floored ceremonial room off the Senate chamber.

The group had hoped to deliver a completed bill to the Senate Judiciary Committee for consideration before the Senate leaves for Easter recess on March 22. But aides said remaining issues required more technical advice and cost estimates that could delay delivery until early April.

The group includes Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Marco Rubio of Florida and Jeff Flake of Arizona. The Democrats are Sens. Charles E. Schumer of New York, Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Michael Bennet of Colorado.

The draft bill will be several hundred pages long when finished. For now, the unfinished pieces are peppered throughout the draft.

“We’re working through them. I’m not sure we’ll get them all done,” McCain said in an interview. “Some of these issues are very controversial.”

Business groups and Silicon Valley companies have pushed for more H1B visas for software engineers and other high-skilled employees, for example, while labor unions have warned that too many immigrants would undercut qualified Americans seeking high-tech jobs in a weak economy.

Advertisement

Unless the group designs a visa program that ensures a robust labor force, Rubio told reporters, “What you’re going to have is people coming into the country illegally or overstaying visas.”

Immigration overhaul bills floated in 2006 and 2007 were sunk by disagreements between labor and business leaders over how many workers to allow into the country. Some senators are skeptical that the current group can find a solution.

“The country can absorb only so much low-skilled labor without significantly impacting the prospects of working Americans to get jobs and get higher pay,” said Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a member of the judiciary panel who has been critical of previous efforts to expand the visa program.

In an effort to resolve the issue, negotiators from the AFL-CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have worked with Senate staffers to set a formula so the number of visas for both high-tech and low-skilled workers can fluctuate. They have agreed that the tally would move up or down based on job demand, unemployment rates and other data.

“We’re really trying to fill in the details,” said Ana Avendano, an AFL-CIO negotiator.

The two sides have agreed that a work visa need not be tied to a specific employer and that foreign workers would be allowed to change jobs. Unions want assurances that foreign workers have the same rights as Americans to report mistreatment to the Labor Department and to sue employers for unpaid wages.

Unlike in the past, both business and organized labor want an immigration bill to pass, said Eliseo Medina, secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union, which represents more than 2 million workers.

“No one wants to be responsible for deep-sixing the effort,” Medina said.

Advertisement

Negotiators also have hit a roadblock on whether the government should keep track of who is leaving the country and how to do so.

Under current law, U.S. immigration authorities do not keep a record when tourists and other foreign visitors leave the country. So the government doesn’t know whether they have overstayed their visas, as thousands do each year.

Advertisement

The Senate group has tentatively agreed to create a system to check visas against an immigration database at international airports and seaports but have not determined whether it is feasible at much busier border crossings. The task is potentially huge: U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada are the most highly trafficked in the world, with 250 million crossings each year.

Some lawmakers warn that checking visas as people leave the country would be expensive to implement, further clog busy border crossings and slow crucial commerce.

Muzaffar Chishti, director of the Migration Policy Institute at New York University School of Law, said the real legislative battle over immigration would come after the bill was made public.

“We haven’t even begun to see the opposition to the bill,” Chishti said. “Because there isn’t meat on the bone.”

He quotes W.H. Auden to make his point: “to whom evil is done/do evil in return.”

Richard Falk is the UN’s “Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967.” He has held the post since 2008, despite exposure as a 9/11 conspiracy theorist.

In his latest rant, published online on April 21, 2013 by foreignpolicyjournal.com Falk repeats the libel that prior to 9/11 President George W. Bush was seeking a “pretext” for war, and that anything Israel is the opposite of “justice and peace.”

And then he attacks Bostonians head-on. The police action in Boston was a “hysterical dragnet.” Boston’s dead were “canaries” that “have to die” because of America’s “fantasy of global domination.”

Falk explains the attacks as justifiable “resistance.” In his words: “The American global domination project is bound to generate all kinds of resistance in the post-colonial world.”

He minimizes the crime and predicts worse if America doesn’t change its ways to better accommodate the demands of “the Islamic world.” As he puts it: “In some respects, the United States has been fortunate not to experience worse blowbacks, and these may yet happen…”.

For years, Falk has been espousing the worst forms of antisemitism from his UN perch, and for his efforts has been rewarded with repeated opportunities by the Council to lecture others on his world view.

That world view is shared by the 56 member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), who only a week ago at UN Headquarters refused to define terrorism unless an exception clause was created for “legitimate struggle.”

The OIC controls the balance of power at the UN’s top human rights body, by holding majorities in both the African and Asian regional groups. Africa and Asia, in turn, control 26 of the 47 seats on the Council. With the backing of the OIC, therefore, Falk has been encouraged and protected.

The Obama administration has long championed the UN Human Rights Council, which it decided to join as one of its first foreign policy moves in 2009. Thanks to the Obama administration, U.S. began a second three-year term on the Council this past January. At the opening of the Council’s most recent session in March, Assistant Secretary of State Esther Brimmer traveled to Geneva to address what she called “this esteemed body.”

There is nothing about a “human rights” body that countenances the likes of Richard Falk that is “esteemed,” and the United States should resign–effective immediately."

The decision limited the sweep of a 1789 law that had been used to address human rights abuses abroad.

The decision was unanimous, but the justices divided along ideological lines in their reasoning.

Human rights groups said the decision was a sharp blow.

“This decision so severely limited a law that has for decades been a beacon of hope for victims of gross human rights violations,” said Elisa Massimino, president of Human Rights First. “This decision cuts a hole into the web of accountability. Human rights abusers may be rejoicing today, but this is a major setback for their victims.”

Business groups said the ruling would help put an end to baseless lawsuits.

“The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision today ensures that trial lawyers cannot continue to use the American judicial system to expose global businesses to frivolous and costly lawsuits,” said Thomas J. Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce."

The rule issued Wednesday by the Department of Homeland Security aims to reduce the time illegal immigrants are separated from their U.S. families while seeking legal status, officials said.

Beginning March 4, illegal immigrants who can demonstrate that time apart from an American spouse, child or parent would create “extreme hardship” can apply for a visa without leaving the United States. Once approved, applicants would be required to leave briefly in order to return to their native country and pick up their visa.

Sources said that the administration might expand the changes to include relatives of lawful permanent residents.

The change, first proposed in April, is the latest move by the administration to use executive powers to revise immigration procedures without Congress passing a law. In August, the Obama administration began a program to halt the deportation of young people brought to the U.S. unlawfully as children.

“This is a continuation of usurping Congress’ control over immigration,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank in Washington that supports tighter controls on immigration. “This waiver rule is a small piece of this broader effort to go around Congress.”

The new procedures could reduce a family’s time apart to one week in some cases, officials said. In recent years, a few relatives of U.S. citizens have been killed in violence in foreign countries while waiting for their applications to be resolved, a process that could take a year or longer.

“It’s going to be a better future for me,” said Analy Olivas, 21, of Claremont, who crossed the border illegally from Mexico with her family when she was 8 and eventually married a U.S. citizen. She didn’t think she could bear to be separated from her 4-year-old son, Naythan, for an extended period, adding: “If I kept on going through the process, I was going to have to leave the country. I wasn’t ready for it.”

“The change will have a significant impact on American families by greatly reducing the time family members are separated from those they rely upon,” said Alejandro Mayorkas, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Wait times will be “drastically reduced,” Mayorkas said.

The immigration agency does not provide applicants with a specific definition of “extreme hardship,” despite requests from legal aid organizations to clarify the phrase. The agency “looks at the totality of the applicant’s circumstances and any supporting evidence,” according to the final rule posted in the Federal Register on Wednesday.

Advertisement

Immigration officials said they had no plans to add staff to process what could be a large number of new hardship-waiver applications. The agency received 24,780 such applications between September 2011 and October 2012.

Until now, officials said, many immigrants who might have sought legal status have not pursued a hardship waiver of strict U.S. immigration laws out of fear they would be rejected and stuck outside the country.

Advertisement

Someone who has overstayed a visa for more than six months is barred from reentering the U.S. for three years; those who overstay more than a year are barred for 10 years.

Many Mexicans applying for a visa must report to the U.S. Consulate in Ciudad Juarez, one of Mexico’s most violent cities. Fearful applicants often spend weeks in hiding while waiting for appointments with consular officials. U.S.-born spouses also must travel to Juarez for interviews to determine whether marriages are valid.

The wait proved too long for Luis Luna, who was born in Mexico but crossed illegally into Southern California last year. He married his U.S.-born high school sweetheart, but became desperate as weeks in Juarez turned to months. He was bullied by thugs, harassed by cops and witnessed several fatal shootings.

“The days were so long,” said Luna, who rented a $70-per-month room for several months while waiting for his visa to be processed. Luna, penniless and fearful, finally tried to reenter the U.S. by falsely claiming American citizenship with a Washington state driver’s license. His application was eventually rejected. He is now back in California.

The possibility of having to leave the country for Juarez long kept Andrea from applying for U.S. residency, even though she is married to an American citizen and her 4-year-old daughter is also a citizen. The 30-year-old, who lives in Orange, asked not to be further identified because she is in the country illegally.

“I’d rather have a wife without papers than a dead wife,” Andrea said her husband often told her.

Advertisement

Those whose hardship waiver applications were denied in the past will be eligible to apply again under the new rule, officials said. Family members who have been in deportation proceedings that were suspended will also qualify. But someone who has been deported before, or is facing a final deportation order, is not eligible.

Los Angeles immigration attorney Carl Shusterman hailed the end of what he called a “totally crazy system.”

“It’s going to keep families together who otherwise would have to go out of the country and sometimes wait over a year, separated,” Shusterman said.

Jessica Dominguez, an immigration attorney whose clients are mostly from Mexico and Central America, said Latinos in Southern California were celebrating the change.

“This is going to affect thousands of families,” Dominguez said.

Washington (CNN) - In personal and biting terms, House Speaker John Boehner argued that President Obama's failure to find agreement with Republicans is a result of his lack of

""courage"" and ""guts"" to do what it takes.

""To do the kind of heavy lifting that needs to be done, I don't think he's got the guts to go do it,"" Boehner told a group of television reporters and anchors in a breakfast ahead of the president's State of the Union address.

He even doubled down on that accusation, when pressed.

""He doesn't have the courage to take on the liberal side of his own party. I'm sorry but it's just clear as a bell to me,"" said Boehner.

Boehner repeatedly talked about the president's ""liberal"" agenda he laid out in his inaugural address, suggesting it is a signal that the president's focus for the next two years will not be reaching across the aisle, but helping Democrats retake control of the House.

""I think he'd love to have Nancy Pelosi as speaker and Harry Reid as majority leader for his last two years in office. Go back to the inaugural address. He knows that all of that liberal agenda he laid out, he knows none of that is going to happen as long as we have a majority in the House,"" said Boehner.

IMMIGRATION: ""How about a little foreplay?""

The speaker offered mostly pessimism about striking any kind of compromise, whether on tax reform or the debt and deficit issue that tends to force the White House and Congress into crisis mode every few months. But he did sound optimistic about ongoing bipartisan immigration reform talks in both chambers.

He said he is reluctant to dive into specifics about the divisive issue for fear of messing things up.

In fact, when asked about whether he would support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, Boehner responded with straight forward and saltiness he is often known for.

""Woah, woah slow down. How about a little foreplay,"" said a smiling Boehner, prompting some surprised and nervous laughter from reporters, and some red faces among Boehner aides.

Just like on economic issues, Boehner questioned the president's seriousness about getting something done on immigration.

""These bipartisan efforts in the House and Senate are the best shot we have at dealing with a big problem the thing I'm most concerned about is the president getting in the way. Sometimes I think he'd rather have an issue than have a solution,"" said Boehner.

SEQUESTER

Though Speaker Boehner said he certainly doesn't want the sequester – nearly $100 billion in deep cuts across the government to kick in on March 1, he also dug in deeply on the way around it: spending cuts and not new revenue, as Democrats are demanding.

""The president has gotten his revenue,"" was a line Boehner used nearly half a dozen times when talking about the sequester.

He also repeatedly threw the ball in Democrats court to find a way out of what he called ""the president's sequester,"" arguing the House voted last year on a bill to replace the mandatory spending cuts, which were designed to go deep enough and cause enough pain for force Congress to act on broad deficit reduction.

When asked whether the cuts will kick in, Boehner responded ""nobody knows.""

Boehner: ""I've gotten burned""

Speaker Boehner reiterated his vow to no longer try to negotiate wide ranging deals with the president, and instead work through ""regular order"" – let each body works its will, find compromise, and then send a bill to the president.

""I've tried repeatedly to come to agreement with the president. Every time I've gotten burned,"" said Boehner.

Later, Boehner said ""I've tried over the last two years non stop working with the president, working with the president, never got there.""

Boehner's hold on his speakership

Though Boehner had a rough ride, especially at the end of 2012, he said ""I certainly plan to be here for a while.""

""I have a job to do and I intend on doing it. I have no plans to leave. Period."""

The principle, as Obama said, “that with modest effort and risk we stop children from being gassed to death,” is there on the table for a world that preferred to look the other way. And, added bonus: the neocon warriors are gone, homeless in both parties. All of this is a hugely positive leap from where we were a week, a month, or a year ago. But outcomes don’t really matter to those obsessed by who won and who lost, those who see all politics as up-and-down nonsense instead of a clash of ideas with real consequences. So this past week has to be cast in the tired terms of the daily struggle for sound-bite supremacy. It’s a debacle. A blunder. A humiliation. “This rudderless diplomacy,” said Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican Party, “has embarrassed America on the world stage.” You want embarrassment? Just consider some of the public statements of Republicans in the last two weeks.

I talked about the death of neocon ideology this week on the Kagro in the Morning show. I'm apparently not the only one to notice.

Monte Frank on another international embarrassment:

Just two weeks ago, a gunman entered a school in Georgia with an AK-47 and began shooting. An Australian baseball player was senselessly murdered in Oklahoma City. Elementary schools in Colorado hold drills where five-year-old kids hunker down behind tables while an ""active shooter"" knocks at the door. Just this week, Colorado voters ejected in recall elections two state senators who had sponsored new gun control laws in the wake of the Aurora cinema mass shooting. And the grim parade of gun violence in our cities marches on. This madness must end – and it will when Congress stops ignoring the will of the American people and makes our nation and the entire world safer by passing common-sense and constitutional gun safety measures. The vast majority of Americans, including gun owners, agree on what needs to be done to cure our gun violence epidemic, which will not only save lives, but spare America from embarrassment in the world.

More politics and policy below the fold."

(CNN) —

Last November, Hispanic voters planted the seeds for serious immigration reform when they backed President Barack Obama by a record margin.

This April, we’ll see if those seeds can grow in Capitol Hill’s toxic partisan soil.

Congress returns from spring break Monday, and immigration reform tops the agenda. The Senate’s bipartisan “Gang of Eight” is preparing to release its long-awaited plan for resolving the status of 11 million undocumented men, women, and children now living in America’s shadows.

Can a unique confluence of factors – a Democratic president trying to build his legacy, a Republican Party grappling with new demographic realities – overcome the usual strong bias for inaction in a sharply divided Congress? The answer remains unclear.

“What we have now is not a 21st century legal immigration system,” GOP Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a key conservative at the heart of the talks, said back in January. “We have an obligation and the need to address the reality of the situation that we face.”

Who’s in the Gang of Eight? The list includes Rubio; Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina; Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona; Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona; Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey; Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois; Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colorado; and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York.

Farm worker dispute holding up immigration bill

Details of the Senate plan

A source familiar with negotiations recently told CNN that the eight senators have tentatively reached agreement on some of the thorniest issues, including the establishment of a path to citizenship and the creation of a system to assess the state of border security.

The Senate proposal could come “in the next couple of weeks,” Graham said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” But McCain told reporters later Sunday morning that he still thinks “it’s very likely” and “very possible” to have it done by the end of the week.

“I’m guardedly optimistic. I can’t guarantee it. But we have literally almost all of the issues resolved,” he said.

Specifically, the senators have agreed to a 13-year path to citizenship, the source said. It would take 10 years for undocumented workers to get a green card, and then another three years to gain citizenship.

Along the way, undocumented workers would have to pay a fine and back taxes, and pass a background check. The size of the fine remains unclear.

No undocumented worker would be eligible for citizenship until the border is considered secure. To measure border security, a commission would be created with the task of establishing and assessing a set of quantifiable criteria. The commission would be made up of officials named by state and federal leaders.

Sides reach broad agreement on immigrant guest workers

Disagreement over agricultural workers

A sharp disagreement over the future treatment of undocumented workers on America’s farms, however, is currently holding up progress on the bill.

The two key sticking points are wages and the number of visas to be granted to undocumented farm workers, two other sources close to the talks confirmed Friday. Four senators – Rubio, Bennet, Utah Republican Orrin Hatch, and California Democrat Dianne Feinstein – are trying to deal with the matter.

“It’s the one major unresolved issue,” one of the sources told CNN.

The sources were unable to provide specifics in terms of the number of visas or wage levels under consideration. But generally speaking, agricultural businesses have an interest in more visas and lower wages. Labor leaders, in contrast, typically support fewer visas and higher wages.

Saying there are a “few little kerfuffles” to work out in the drafting of the legislation – referring to the disagreement over agricultural workers – Schumer told CNN on Sunday the senators have written “most of the bill” and feel hopeful that they can announce a full agreement at the end of the week.

“We’ve solved most of the issues, there are a few more to go, there are a few more today and tomorrow. I’m very optimistic we’ll be able to solve those last few problems,” he said, declining to get into specifics.

Language like ‘illegal immigrant’ seen as a challenge

Agreement on nonagricultural workers

Business and labor leaders appear to have settled on a deal establishing a new immigrant guest worker program for nonagricultural workers.

The compromise, according to another source, is the creation of a new “W” visa for lesser-skilled workers not working in agriculture. Those workers would be allowed to enter the country based on labor market shortages, and could enter with the possibility of eventually applying for citizenship.

The W visa would affect housekeepers, landscapers, retail workers and some construction workers, the source noted. The agreement does not address visas for high-skilled workers or family members.

According to the AFL-CIO’s understanding of the agreement, the visa program would launch in April 2015. The number of visas issued would never go below 20,000 per year and could rise as high as 200,000 annually, depending on employment levels.

One third of the visas would be reserved for businesses that employ fewer than 25 people, while no more than 15,000 visas per year would go to construction workers, the AFL-CIO said.

A new government department, the Bureau of Immigration and Labor Market Research, would determine specific industries with labor shortages and make recommendations to Congress. The agency would also play a role in setting an annual cap for W visas. The bureau would fall under the existing U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and its director would be appointed by the president and confirmed by Congress.

“The beauty of this program is that it rises and falls with the economy,” the AFL-CIO’s Ana Avendano recently told CNN. “When the economy is booming, there will be more visas available for foreign workers. When it’s not, there won’t be, and that’s something we’ve never seen in the United States before.”

Randy Johnson, senior vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, released a statement declaring the proposed new visa program “a sound and workable program for the business community.”

Immigration tops agenda as senators tour border

Senate resistance

The Gang of Eight may be ideologically diverse, but that doesn’t mean there won’t be significant resistance to the plan once it’s released – especially among wary conservatives. GOP base voters remain vehemently opposed to any plan which could be construed as amnesty for those who entered the country illegally.

Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, remain concerned that conservatives will never agree the country’s southern border is secure, and will try to use that issue to continually deny citizenship to undocumented residents.

In the Senate, Alabama Republican Jeff Sessions and others have repeatedly expressed the fear that Democratic leaders will try to ram the Gang of Eight’s plan through before other members have a chance to properly consider the bill.

Top Democrats “want Congress to pass a far-reaching bill before the American people know what’s in it,” Sessions said in a statement released April 2. “Now that the special interests have what they want, the deal has been made: Force it through and set the public interest aside.”

Rubio has also said he’s worried the legislation may be rushed through Congress – a concern some observers say reflects political necessities as the Florida freshman balances his role in immigration reform with possible presidential ambitions.

Responding to GOP pressure to release details of the secretive Gang of Eight deliberations, Rubio promised Friday to brief his fellow Republican senators on Tuesday.

“This proposal will be a starting point,” Rubio wrote to four GOP colleagues. “I expect you will have ample opportunity to review, comment, and amend as you see fit.”

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, who will oversee the committee-level markup of the bill once it’s released, has repeatedly dismissed Sessions’ and Rubio’s concerns.

The Judiciary Committee “has already held several widely-attended hearings to examine the urgent need for comprehensive immigration reform,” Leahy said in an April 2 statement. “If we do not act quickly and decisively we will lose the opportunity we now have.”

Leahy said he hopes for a final Senate vote by this summer.

Immigration debate: High-stakes political poker

A House alternative

While most eyes are focused on the Senate, a bipartisan group of House members is working on its own version of immigration reform. Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told reporters last month that the members are “essentially in agreement” on a plan to deal with the issue.

The House members involved in the talks are Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Florida; Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas; Rep. John Carter, R-Texas; Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho; Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-California; Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois; Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-California; and Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Kentucky.

The members of the House group have been reluctant to talk publicly about their bipartisan negotiations. Some of them have been working on the issue since Congress failed to get a deal done in 2007.

However, two members of the House “Gang of Eight” sounded confident Sunday that their upcoming proposal will ultimately mesh well with the Senate’s proposal, despite expected battles over the issue in both chambers in the months ahead.

“I am very, very optimistic that the House of Representatives is going to have a plan that is going to be able to go to a conference with the Senate in which we’re going to be able to resolve differences,” Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

He was joined by his Republican colleague Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida.

Asked if the House version would have a similar border security prerequisite, the two House members seemed less certain.

“You can’t have a bill without border security. You just can’t,” Diaz-Balart said.

Pressed further on whether that provision would be a priority, Gutierrez said, “I think we can do this simultaneously.”

“I think first thing we’re going to do is, we’re going to put people in a safe place. That is 11 million people, you can give them a work permit, Social Security card, driver’s license,” he added. “And then the second part is the path to the green card, that permanent residency that leads to citizenship.”

US, Russia wrangle over leaker status","NSA leaker Edward Snowden may be entering a legal gray area as the U.S. and Russia continue to battle over his status as he whiles away the time at the Moscow airport.

WikiLeaks claimed on its Twitter page that a combination of factors -- namely, the revocation of his U.S. passport and an uncertain status with other countries -- could leave Snowden stuck in Moscow.

""Cancelling Snowden's passport and bullying intermediary countries may keep Snowden permanently in Russia. Not the brightest bunch at State,"" the group tweeted.

That scenario seems far-fetched. But at the least, his status poses a challenge to the diplomats and lawyers trying to handle his case on both sides.

State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell -- asked repeatedly Wednesday about the possibility of Snowden being stuck in travel limbo -- told reporters that one possibility is the U.S. could issue him a document that allows him to take a one-way flight back to the U.S.

""That's the kind of travel document we're prepared to issue an individual accused of serious crimes,"" he said, adding that U.S. officials continue to make the case to the Russians that ""there's a basis"" for his return to the U.S.

He confirmed, though, that Snowden cannot use his invalidated U.S. passport at this point for other visas. The one-way ticket option would likely require Russian cooperation.

While Snowden no longer has a valid U.S. passport, Russian media also reported he may be traveling in Russia on a temporary transit visa.

This creates more questions about his status. A representative with the Russian Embassy in Washington told Fox News that such visas are good for three days -- meaning, if he has one, it would expire on Wednesday. For a stay longer than three days, a traveler is supposed to obtain a tourist visa, something that's supposed to be sought before entering the country.

Snowden's case, however, is far from typical, and it's unclear whether officials would bend the rules to facilitate his movement. Russian media quoted sources as saying the revocation of his U.S. passport is what's really keeping him from moving on -- preventing him from buying a plane ticket or even leaving the airport and setting foot on Russian soil.

WikiLeaks has claimed, though, that Snowden has refugee documents that could allow him -- somehow -- to get to Ecuador, which is still mulling an asylum request, or some other country.

The U.S., meanwhile, continues to pressure Russian officials simply to turn him over to U.S. custody, citing charges brought against Snowden last week. President Vladimir Putin so far has refused, effectively arguing that Snowden is not Russia's problem.

The competing demands and rolling developments in the case paint a picture of a complicated diplomatic tussle with no easily discernible outcome. It has created an embarrassment for the Obama administration, but also challenged relations between the U.S. and other countries, not just Russia.

The U.S. government already was fuming over Hong Kong's decision to let Snowden leave their jurisdiction over the weekend on the flight for Moscow. Adding to the dispute, Hong Kong officials reportedly said Wednesday that the U.S. government listed Snowden's middle name wrong on documents they submitted.

According to The Associated Press, Justice Secretary Rimsky Yuen said U.S. documents used the middle name James or the initial J., though their own documents had his middle name as Joseph. He said that helped slow the processing of his arrest, which Snowden ultimately evaded.

However a Justice Department spokesperson said Wednesday, ""that Hong Kong would ask for more information about his identity demonstrates that it was simply trying to create a pretext for not acting on the provisional arrest request.""

A former senior intelligence official told Fox News on Sunday that the Russians could choose to hide behind the ""transit"" route rationale -- claiming Snowden was not formally processed by Russian customs and immigration, and therefore is not in their hands.

However, the intelligence official said Putin was well within his powers to detain Snowden ""in transit,"" and a decision was evidently made not to do so.

""We believe that Turkey's long-term stability, security and prosperity is best guaranteed by upholding the fundamental freedoms of expression, assembly and association, which is what it seems these individuals were doing. ""These freedoms are crucial to any healthy democracy,"" [Department Spokesperson] Psaki added.

Indeed, a country's long-term prosperity is best guaranteed by upholding the fundamental freedom of assembly, a freedom ""crucial to any healthy democracy.""

Unfortunately, as we've seen all too often during the past several years, particularly with regard to Occupy Wall Street, this freedom in America has been viewed as anything but absolute, and it could be rightfully argued that this right has been viewed as anything but crucial as well.

After all, this is a country with increasingly militarized police forces in which local cops are being armed with weapons suitable for the battlefield.

This is a country in which large gatherings of peaceful protesters, from Occupy Wall Street to Stop and Frisk marches, are increasingly being met with police responses that often look like this:

If we are to rebuke other nations for cracking down on protesters gathering to air their grievances in public, it is first necessary to remind ourselves just how ""crucial"" that right to do so actually is. How fundamental a right the freedom to assemble has been in shaping the character of our nation.

It is first necessary to re-examine the way in which we have been muting, with force, the voices of many in our own country who gather to protest before rebuking others.

Otherwise, to engage in such international rebukes is to engage in self-parody.

In 2008, the N.S.A.’s Middle East and North Africa group set about updating its Sigint collection capabilities. The “ambitious scrub” of selectors — essentially search terms — cut the number of terms automatically searched from 21,177 to 7,795 and the number of messages added to the agency’s Pinwale database from 850,000 a day to 450,000 a day.

The reduction in volume was treated as a major achievement, opening the way for new collection on Iranian leadership and Saudi and Syrian diplomats, the report said.

And in a note that may comfort computer novices, the N.S.A. Middle East analysts discovered major glitches in their search software: The computer was searching for the names of targets but not their email addresses, a rather fundamental flaw. “Over 500 messages in one week did not come in,” the report said about one target.

Those are daily course corrections. Whether the Snowden disclosures will result in deeper change is uncertain. Joel F. Brenner, the agency’s former inspector general, says much of the criticism is unfair, reflecting a naïveté about the realpolitik of spying. “The agency is being browbeaten for doing too well the things it’s supposed to do,” he said.

But Mr. Brenner added that he believes “technology has outrun policy” at the N.S.A., and that in an era in which spying may well be exposed, “routine targeting of close allies is bad politics and is foolish.”

Another former insider worries less about foreign leaders’ sensitivities than the potential danger the sprawling agency poses at home. William E. Binney, a former senior N.S.A. official who has become an outspoken critic, says he has no problem with spying on foreign targets like Brazil’s president or the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. “That’s pretty much what every government does,” he said. “It’s the foundation of diplomacy.” But Mr. Binney said that without new leadership, new laws and top-to-bottom reform, the agency will represent a threat of “turnkey totalitarianism” — the capability to turn its awesome power, now directed mainly against other countries, on the American public.

“I think it’s already starting to happen,” he said. “That’s what we have to stop.”

Whatever reforms may come, Bobby R. Inman, who weathered his own turbulent period as N.S.A. director from 1977 to 1981, offers his hyper-secret former agency a radical suggestion for right now. “My advice would be to take everything you think Snowden has and get it out yourself,” he said. “It would certainly be a shock to the agency. But bad news doesn’t get better with age. The sooner they get it out and put it behind them, the faster they can begin to rebuild.”"

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']",Supreme Court refuses to block legal immigrant’s deportation,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court refused Wednesday to block the deportation of a Chicago woman and thousands of other immigrants who before 2010 were not warned by their lawyers when they pleaded guilty to serious crimes and were targeted for removal.

The decision highlights the stark consequences for noncitizens of having a criminal record. The law calls for mandatory deportation for immigrants, including lawful residents, who have an “aggravated felony” on their record. The term can describe a variety of state and federal offenses.

Immigration lawyers say tens of thousands of immigrants, many of them lawful permanent residents, plead guilty each year to crimes that may lead to deportation. In many instances, they were not warned of the consequences of such a plea.

Three years ago, the high court extended relief to some immigrants when it ruled that they could seek a new trial if their lawyers had failed to warn them of the dire consequences of a guilty plea.

But in a 7-2 ruling Wednesday, the justices refused to apply the ruling retroactively to cases of immigrants who had unwittingly pleaded guilty before 2010.

The ruling came in the case of Roselva Chaidez, a Chicago woman who was born in Mexico. She has been a lawful permanent resident since 1977 and has three children and two grandchildren, all of whom are U.S. citizens.

In 2003, she agreed to plead guilty to two counts of mail fraud for what the government said was her minor role in an insurance fraud. Her son and several others staged an auto accident, and Chaidez received $1,200 from an insurance company for a claim of an injury that was false.

She was sentenced to probation and was required to help repay $22,000, the total amount of the insurance fraud. She completed her sentence and had paid her restitution by 2004.

When she later applied for naturalization, she denied having been convicted of a crime. Only then did she learn that pleading guilty to mail fraud involving more than $10,000 meant that she was subject to deportation.

Chaidez filed a court petition in 2009 seeking to have her conviction overturned on the grounds that her lawyer failed to warn her of the consequences of her guilty plea. She could have argued that because she obtained only $1,200, her crime did not meet the $10,000 threshold for what the law deems an “aggravated felony.” Her new lawyer pointed to the high court’s ruling in Padilla vs. Kentucky, which held that a lawyer had a constitutional duty to warn immigrants when they faced deportation for a guilty plea.

In Chicago, U.S. District Judge Joan Gottschall ruled for Chaidez and set aside her conviction. But the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed in a 2-1 decision and said the Chicago woman could not take advantage of the high court’s new ruling to challenge her old conviction.

Ruling in Chaidez vs. United States, the Supreme Court agreed with the appeals court and said its 2010 decision could not be applied retroactively to upset old plea deals.

Advertisement

Justice Elena Kagan said that the 2010 ruling amounted to a major change in the law, and the court has not applied such changes retroactively to old cases. “Defendants whose convictions became final prior to Padilla therefore cannot benefit from its holding,” she said.

The ruling marked a rare split between President Obama’s two appointees. While Kagan spoke for the majority, Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a dissent, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

Sotomayor argued that the 2010 decision simply made clear that lawyers had a duty to advise their clients on the law. “Today’s decision deprives defendants of the fundamental protection” that goes with having a competent lawyer, she said.

The Chicago lawyer who represented Chaidez in her appeal, Gerardo Gutierrez, said, “Obviously, we are disappointed. This will have an immediate, adverse impact on a lot of immigrant families.”

Charles Roth, counsel for the National Immigrant Justice Center, said, “It is now in the hands of the Obama administration and Congress to keep this family together, as well as hundreds of others who at least deserve consideration of whether a run-in with the law enforcement more than a decade ago outweighs the good they have since contributed to our society.”

Applauding the ruling, the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation in California said the court acted to “limit the damage caused by the discovery of new rules of laws” so as not to reopen tens of thousands of settled cases.

It would be more than just an assertion on his part.”

Mr. Snowden is living and working in Russia under a one-year asylum. The Russian government has refused to extradite Mr. Snowden, who was indicted by the Justice Department in June on charges of espionage and stealing government property, to the United States.

Mr. Snowden has said he would return to the United States if he was offered amnesty, but it is unclear whether Mr. Obama — who would most likely have to make such a decision — would make such an offer, given the damage the administration has claimed Mr. Snowden’s leaks have done to national security.

Because the N.S.A. is still uncertain about exactly what Mr. Snowden took, government officials sometimes first learn about specific documents from reporters preparing their articles for publication — leaving the State Department with little time to notify foreign leaders about coming disclosures.

With the security agency trying to revamp its computer network in the aftermath of what could turn out to be the largest breach of classified information in American history, the Justice Department has continued its investigation of Mr. Snowden.

According to senior government officials, F.B.I. agents from the bureau’s Washington field office, who are leading the investigation, believe that Mr. Snowden methodically downloaded the files over several months while working as a government contractor at the Hawaii facility. They also believe that he worked alone, the officials said.

But for all of Mr. Snowden’s technical expertise, some American officials also place blame on the security agency for being slow to install software that can detect unusual computer activity carried out by the agency’s work force — which, at approximately 35,000 employees, is the largest of any intelligence agency."

A Muslim. A Kenyan. An America Hater, the Food Stamp President who wants everyone in the Country in the Thrall of the Federal Government as PAYBACK for Slavery - and who I guess must hate Catholics because - well - why not, right? We got 'em, why not Hate Them?

But scratch the surface of this little fantasy and it falls apart faster than a paper machete mache castle doused in liter fluid.

First of all, the Embassy isn't being ""Closed"" - it's being moved Closer to the Vatican as part of a process that was initiated By His Brother.



There are no embassies for any country in Vatican City itself — there is simply no room. All countries locate their embassies in the city of Rome. The United States has decided to move its embassy from its current location — an unremarkable converted residence — to the same compound as the U.S. Embassy to Italy. It will have it’s own separate building and a separate entrance on a different street. The new building is actually a tenth of a mile closer to the Vatican than the old one. There will be no reduction in staff or activities. ... The State Department says the move, which will actually occur in 2015, will save $1.4 million per year and allow for greater security.

Imagine that, Obama is moving the Embassy to a) Save Money and b) Improve Security. Now, why on Earth would he ever care about such things?

The second part is that the Catholic Church doesn't oppose Obamacare. They actually have enthusiastically endorsed it.



Washington, DC, September 20, 2011 (LifeSiteNews.com) - The Catholic Health Association (CHA) released a statement last week lauding the effects of Obama’s health care reform program. “Provisions of the Affordable Care Act that became effective last year have helped millions get the coverage they need,” wrote CHA President Carol Keehan.

Sr. Carol Keehan of the Catholic Health Association. “At least 500,000 young adults (ages 18-24), for example, obtained health insurance last year, a two percentage point increase that is the result of an ACA provision allowing young adults to stay on their parents’ plan,” Keehan continued. She went on to urge lawmakers to “keep our nation’s vulnerable persons in mind” as they deliberate over fiscal policy.

Public Policy Polling conducted the new poll on behalf of a coalition that includes Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America. The findings indicate that Obama gained some ground with Catholics by altering the policy. An earlier PPP poll found that 53 percent of Catholic voters approved of the White House's original mandate, which required religious employers to provide contraception coverage directly.

In fact a majority of Catholics even support the Contraceptive Policy. There is an outstanding case going to the Supreme Court over that very issue, but it's certainly not something that deservesover. It's a difference of opinion, a disagreement and in a ""Free Country"" you're supposed to be able to have those from time to time. Or so you would think.

So let's think this out, Jeb Bush actually believes it's a serious proposition that the President of these United States could have decided to pettily embarrass Catholics and damage our international standing by capriciously and with full callousness of forethought closing the Vatican Embassy (and I guess in his mind not re-opening it in a more secure location, Ever!) merely out of a Fit of Pique!.

Really?

I mean, it's not like doing such a thing could be considered as a way to make his policies more popular with Religious Organizations who object to not doing a thing while their employees and students get preventive healthcare, is it? How does this argument - even as a projection - make any damn sense at all? Is that what Jeb Bush would do if the Catholics pissed him off? Gee, thanks for the heads up.

This is the kind of thing you expect from World Net Daily. (In fact, it's their Stock-in-Trade), not from Mainstream Republicans.

But then again, they do seem to running of out the sane undeluded ones aren't they? Sadly, their delusions don't make the President look bad, it only makes them look pathetic. And Desperate.

Leaders of State Department’s Benghazi review grilled by lawmakers,"The leaders of the State Department's internal review of the Benghazi terror attack were grilled Thursday by congressional Republicans who suggested their probe amounted to an ""inside job"" that let senior officials off the hook.

The hearing before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee comes days after the committee released a draft report alleging that top State Department officials escaped blame for some of the policy decisions that left the U.S. compound in Benghazi less secure. The leaders of the internal review board -- former Amb. Thomas Pickering and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Gen. Mike Mullen -- were called to testify, and defended the board's objectivity and findings.

""I had no sense anywhere that there was any conflict of interest,"" Pickering said. ""I'm proud of the report.""

Four mid-level employees were disciplined in the wake of the report, though most were later re-assigned. More than a year after the Sept. 11, 2012, attack in which four Americans were killed, many Republican lawmakers say there still hasn't been any measurable accountability. Their scrutiny recently has turned to the work of the Accountability Review Board, led by Mullen and Pickering.

""It looks like ... sort of an inside job of an investigation. The Department of State looking at the Department of State,"" Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., said.

Pickering later explained that the principle goal of the review was to find out what went wrong so such a tragedy does not happen again.

""This was not, quote, a gotcha investigative panel,"" he said.

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., retorted: ""Obviously this was not a gotcha panel. Because nobody was gotcha'd.""

The hearing was one of three being held on Benghazi on the House side this week. Democrats complained that Republicans are re-treading over tired talking points, and that the new attempt to pick apart the State Department review is inappropriate.

Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., top Democrat on the committee, said accusations that the review was a whitewash are ""reckless.""

""Those kinds of statements upset me, because I think that they are so unfair, and we're better than that,"" Cummings said. ""This Benghazi review was one of the most comprehensive ARB reviews ever conducted.""

Though it has been a year since the attack, lawmakers' frustration stems in part from the fact that nobody has been brought to justice in connection with the attack. On top of that, Secretary of State John Kerry recently re-assigned most of those who were disciplined internally over the security posture at the Benghazi post.

In a heated exchange, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, also suggested Mullen was not acting independently when he gave Cheryl Mills, a top aide to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a heads-up that department official Charlene Lamb might not be an ideal witness at a House hearing last fall. Mullen acknowledged that he told Mills he didn't think Lamb would ""represent the department well.""

Jordan questioned how that intervention squared with his claims that the review board was independent.

Mullen and Pickering claimed it was part of the board's obligation to give status updates to the secretary of State through her staff."

The newly released emails highlight the political concerns expressed in those discussions as President Obama’s administration wrestled with what to tell the public in the wake of the September attack and in the midst of the presidential campaign.

The emails show that the original CIA document underwent several revisions, including one pushed by the State Department to delete a reference to CIA warnings about the terrorist threat around the diplomatic outpost.

That information “could be abused by members [of Congress] to beat up the State Department for not paying attention to warnings,” State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland wrote, according to emails read to the Los Angeles Times by a congressional source. They were originally reported by the conservative weekly magazine Weekly Standard and ABC News. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney did not dispute their authenticity during a lengthy explanation Friday afternoon.

The talking points were originally written for members of Congress who might speak publicly about the attack that killed U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. They also went to United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice as she prepared for Sunday news shows five days after the attack.

Carney said Friday that the talking points were drafted as the facts were coming to light, and that officials were trying to say what they knew without speculating about the unknown.

“The effort is always to, in that circumstance, and with an ongoing investigation and a lot of information, some of it accurate, some of it not, about what had happened and who was responsible, to provide information for members of Congress and others in the administration, for example, who might speak publicly about it that was based on only what the intelligence community could say for sure it thought it knew,” Carney said.

The emails indicate that Nuland was the driving force behind significant changes.

The information about the advance warning could be used by Congress to criticize the State Department, Nuland wrote, “so why do we want to feed that?”

She was reacting to a paragraph that said the CIA had previously warned of a threat of “extremists linked to Al Qaeda in Benghazi and eastern Libya.”

“We cannot rule out the individuals have previously surveilled the U.S. facilities, also contributing to the efficacy of the attacks,” the original document read.

Nuland also objected to a line that mentioned a militant group, Ansar al Sharia, which had taken credit for the attack.

“I have serious concerns about all parts highlighted below,” she wrote, questioning why the administration was “arming members of Congress to start making assertions to the media that we ourselves are not making because we don’t want to prejudice the FBI investigation. Why do we want the Hill to be fingering Ansar al Sharia when we aren’t doing that ourselves?”

The FBI had signed off on the mention of Ansar al Sharia, according to an email by a staffer who was coordinating the interagency negotiations.

Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security advisor at the White House, wrote in a subsequent email that Nuland’s concerns would have to be taken into account.

The emails were discussed, though not quoted, in a report by House Republicans released last month. Nuland was not named, and little was made of it.

But the wording of the actual emails raised new questions in a contentious news conference Friday. Previously, Carney had said the changes to the talking points were stylistic, not substantive.

Some members of Congress were shown the emails months ago, according to senior administration officials, and raised no objections. House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) demanded that the White House release all of the emails for review.

“Congress is going to continue to investigate this issue using all the resources at our disposal,” he said in a statement from his office.

60 Minutes gave the guy a fake name, but his story of being an eyewitness to the attack was soon discovered to contradict what he had reported to his superiors.

Far from retracting or correcting the story, or mentioning that the contractor's book is being published by a CBS subsidiary that ""specializes in conservative nonfiction,"" 60 Minutes ended its show tonight with three teabaggerish letters praising the story.

As if the substantial media controversy over the contractor's credibility never happened.

For right-wingers, the Benghazi conspiracy theory is a two-fer -- weakening both the current Democratic President and his likely Democratic successor.

Which is why wingnut radio, Fox ""News"", and sites like Drudge and World Nut Daily have been beating the Benghazi drum for more than a year.

For 60 Minutes to join that motley crew of serial liars is shameful.

Then to refuse to correct the flawed story, instead broadcasting letters praising it, is even worse.

It's like they don't even care about the truth -- it's all about the money."

Pollak'],Democrats' Agenda for Benghazi Hearing: Protect Hillary at All Costs,"Ahead of Wednesday’s long-awaited hearings at the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee about the Benghazi terror attack of Sep. 11, 2012, Democrats have a clear agenda: protect Hillary Clinton at all costs.

Clinton, the former Secretary of State and likely frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, could be severely damaged by testimony about the attacks, which occurred in part because of security lapses for which the State Department is primarily responsible.

Past testimony about the attacks has also revealed that President Barack Obama did nothing once informed the attacks were under way, and that there was no communication among key members of the administration and military who could have responded.

In her own testimony before Congress in January before leaving office, Clinton was evasive, famously shouting at Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), “What difference does it make?” in reference to the question of who had edited the administration’s talking points to remove references to Islamist terror and emphasize a protest that never happened.

The media applauded her performance, but her outburst left an impression of apathy about the four Americans who were killed that night in Benghazi, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens.

Since the day after the attacks, Democrats and the media have treated Benghazi as an unfair political attack by Republicans, rather than a legitimate national security crisis in its own right.

Media coverage in the fall focused on Republican Mitt Romney’s response to the attacks, rather than Obama’s actions as commander-in-chief. When questions were raised about whether Obama had lied to the public about the attacks, the media covered Obama’s tracks, with CNN’s Candy Crowley intervening in the second presidential debate to defend the president, and CBS News suppressing damning footage of the president until shortly before the election.

With Obama safely re-elected, the goal is now to protect Hillary Clinton. Last week, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) called upon Speaker of the House John Boehner not only to retract, but to apologize publicly for, an inter-committee report that suggested Clinton had ignored requests for additional security in Libya.

On MSNBC, a channel that serves as the mouthpiece for the Democratic Party, Rev. Al Sharpton–who also serves as an informal White House adviser–described the Benghazi investigation as the “new vast right-wing conspiracy,” a reference to Clinton’s claim, as First Lady, that Republicans were merely out to target her husband and that he had not committed any wrongdoing in the Monica Lewinsky affair that led to his impeachment.

Though there are undoubtedly some political motives present, Democrats’ claims are largely a projection of their own political agenda in Benghazi, which has remained consistent from the start: to shield the party and its leaders from responsibility for a major terrorist attack on American sovereign territory.

That agenda far exceeds any pursued by Republicans, whose goals, however political, happen to include the national security interests at stake.

On this past weekend’s Sunday shows, Democrats showed unusual willingness to criticize the Obama administration over Benghazi, acknowledging that the Benghazi talking points had been false.

Yet that willingness to criticize may be a way of inoculating the party against further revelations to come; it may also be easier because new information about the Benghazi talking points has tended to implicate the White House rather than Clinton herself, even if State Department officials have also been listed among those involved.

Clinton’s role in Benghazi is particularly damaging because it risks becoming the signature legacy of her tenure at the State Department. Despite racking up an exhaustive travel record, Clinton had few actual achievements to show for her four years as Secretary of State–a burden as she contemplates her 2016 ambitions.

At least one key witness in Wednesday’s hearing, Mark. I. Thompson, is expected to offer testimony highly damaging to Clinton. He has alleged that Clinton sidelined the State Department’s counter-terrorism operation during the Benghazie attacks: “You should have seen what (Clinton) tried to do to us that night,” he has said, according to Fox News.

Though Democrats seem to have shifted their focus to Clinton’s prospects, Obama himself is not free of the troubles Benghazi presents. Evidence continues to emerge that senior White House officials were directly involved in the manipulation of the Benghazi talking points, suggesting that there had been a deliberate decision to mislead the public.

Obama has yet to explain his own actions–or inaction–during and after the attack. His activities throughout the evening of Sep. 11 are unknown; he flew to Las Vegas for a fundraiser the next day."

Scandal Investigation,"A former senior investigator with the State Department’s criminal investigative unit has turned whistleblower and alleged to both the media and Congress that senior staff within State Department covered up investigations into appalling behavior committed by members of Hillary Clinton’s security staff and our ambassador to Belgium. One of those alleged to have interfered was Cheryl Mills, Hillary’s chief of staff.

The case in which Clinton enforcer Mills allegedly intervened centered upon Brett McGurk, Obama’s nominee to be US ambassador to Iraq.

McGurk’s expected nomination fell apart after a computer hack exposed his racy e-mails and an extramarital affair with Wall Street Journal reporter Gina Chon.

According to the memo, the SID “never interviewed McGurk, allegedly because Cheryl Mills from the Secretary’s office interceded.”

“Without that interview, SID has been unable to close the case,” the memo concludes.

Mills is a longtime associate of the Clintons, going back to 1992, and was also at the center of the first scandal to hit Hillary’s State Department: Benghazi. Gregory Hicks, the former Deputy Chief of Mission in Libya, testified before Congress that Mills instructed him not to cooperate with the Congressional investigation into the September 11 terror attacks.

Mills isn’t the only high-ranking official being named. Patrick Kennedy, the Undersecretary of State for Management, is directly accused of killing an investigation into our Ambassador to Belgium, Howard Gutman, who is accused of slipping away from his security detail to solicit sex from minor children.

Gutman was a big Democratic donor before taking the post, having raised $500,000 for President Obama’s 2008 campaign and helping finance his inaugural.

* At least seven agents in Clinton’s security detail hired prostitutes while traveling with her in various countries, including Russia and Colombia.

Investigators called the use of prostitutes by Clinton’s security agents “endemic.”

Amid all the other scandals, this latest mess is still picking up some traction in the mainstream media. Here is Chuck Todd’s “Today Show” report:

Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) said he thinks ""Muslim brotherhood members"" have ""influence"" in President Barack Obama's administration.

In an interview on WND Radio published on Thursday, Gohmert criticized immigration reform efforts in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing, claiming that ""radical Islam is at war"" with America.

""It’s very clear to everybody but this administration that radical Islam is at war against us,"" Gohmert said.""And I’m hoping either this administration will wake up or a new one will come in at the next election before irreparable damage is done.""

Gohmert then implied that ""Muslim brotherhood members"" influence the Obama administration.

""Thank God for the moderates that don’t approve of what’s being done,"" Gohmert continued. ""But this administration has so many Muslim brotherhood members that have influence that they just are making wrong decisions for America.""

This is not the first time Gohmert has brought ""radical Islam"" into a conversation about immigration.

On April 17, Gohmert claimed that ""radical Islamists"" were being ""trained to act like Hispanic[s]"" in regards to crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.

""We know al Qaeda has camps over with the drug cartels on the other side of the Mexican border,"" Gohmert said. ""We know that people that are now being trained to come in and act like Hispanic [sic] when they are radical Islamists.""

All Americans of faith should be outraged by these comments which clearly telegraph the President’s belief system and are in fact at their core even anti-American.”

American Catholics for Religious Freedom points out that the media has completely ignored the story, and adds, “Secular progressives like President Obama ignore the truth that faith-based education is a component of the Religious Freedom guaranteed by the Constitution. He can’t bear the thought that Catholic and parochial schools not only teach important values but consistently produce better educational results at lower cost than America’s failing public schools. The President’s troubling values are showing here in a way that demonstrate just how dangerous this Administration is and how committed it is to eroding the rights of all people of faith.”

And, they note, this is the same President who has attempted to cram down anti-Catholic doctrine via Obamacare. “It’s time Americans stood up for Religious Freedom, for the U.S. Constitution and against President Obama’s radical views about the place of faith in American life,” the group concludes.

Now, officials are reluctant to join in some types of bulk collection of telephone data or preparations for offensive digital strikes against other countries.

“We simply don’t have the capability or the legal authorities,” said one senior German official involved in the talks, who, like other officials interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity because the negotiations are confidential.

The White House has tried to engage the German leadership quietly, hoping to avoid further public confrontations while Ms. Merkel formed her new government.

“At the president’s and chancellor’s direction, we continue to talk with our German partners about how we can strengthen our intelligence cooperation and address some of the concerns that have been raised,” Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said Saturday. “We’ve agreed that these talks are best held confidentially, so I’m not going to provide any details at this stage.”

Nonetheless, in interviews in the past week, American and German officials described a continued wariness in the countries’ relationship after documents that the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel received from Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor, revealed the apparent tracking of Ms. Merkel’s personal cellphone and suggested that other surveillance operations had been run out of the United States Embassy here.

While Mr. Obama tried to make amends, several senior German officials expressed suspicions that the United States might be using its surveillance technology to strengthen its negotiating hand in trade talks with the European Union, in which Germany is the most important player.

The dispute also reflects very different views of how far the state should go in conducting surveillance, both at home and abroad."

He Joined The Network In September', 'Is Based Out Of Washington']",BENGHAZI: Names of ‘whistle-blower’ witnesses revealed,"Their identities have been a well-guarded secret, known only to their high-powered lawyers and a handful of House lawmakers and staff. But now Fox News has learned the names of the self-described Benghazi “whistle-blowers” who are set to testify before a widely anticipated congressional hearing on Wednesday.

Appearing before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will be three career State Department officials: Gregory N. Hicks, the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Libya at the time of the Benghazi terrorist attacks; Mark I. Thompson, a former Marine and now the deputy coordinator for Operations in the agency’s Counterterrorism Bureau; and Eric Nordstrom, a diplomatic security officer who was the regional security officer in Libya, the top security officer in the country in the months leading up to the attacks.

U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed in the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks on the U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya.

At the time of Stevens' death, Hicks became the highest-ranking American diplomat in Libya.

Nordstrom previously testified before the oversight committee, which is chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., in October 2012. Of the three witnesses, he is the only one who does not consider himself a whistle-blower. At last fall's hearing, however, Nordstrom made headlines by detailing for lawmakers the series of requests that he, Ambassador Stevens, and others had made for enhanced security at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi in the period preceding the attacks, requests mostly rejected by State Department superiors.

More On This... How Bad Was Benghazi Botch?

""For me the Taliban is on the inside of the [State Department] building,"" Nordstrom testified, angry over inadequate staffing at a time when the threat environment in Benghazi was deteriorating,

The other two witnesses have not been heard from publicly before.

Hicks is a veteran Foreign Service officer whose overseas postings have also included Afghanistan, Syria, and Yemen.

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican and committee member, said Hicks was in Tripoli at 9:40 p.m. local time when he received one of Stevens’ earliest phone calls amid the crisis.

“We’re under attack! We’re under attack!” the ambassador reportedly shouted into his cellphone at Hicks.

Chaffetz, who subsequently debriefed Hicks, also said the deputy “immediately called into Washington to trigger all the mechanisms” for an inter-agency response.

“The real-life trauma that [Hicks] went through,” Chaffetz recalled to Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren, “I mean, I really felt it in his voice. It was hard to listen to. He’s gone through a lot, but he did a great job.”

According to the State Department website, Thompson “advises senior leadership on operational counterterrorism matters, and ensures that the United States can rapidly respond to global terrorism crises.”

Five years before the Benghazi attacks, he lectured at a symposium hosted by the University of Central Florida and titled “The Global Terrorism Challenge: Answers to Key Questions.”

Joe diGenova, a former U.S. attorney, and wife Victoria Toensing, a former chief counsel to the Senate Intelligence Committee -- Republicans -- disclosed this week that in their private practice in the nation’s capital, they now represent pro bono two career State Department employees who regard themselves as “whistle-blowers” and would be testifying before Issa’s committee at its next Benghazi hearing, on May 8.

The lawyers said their clients believe their accounts of Benghazi were spurned by the Accountability Review board (ARB), the official investigative body convened by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to review the terrorist attacks, and that the two employees have faced threats and intimidation from as-yet-unnamed superiors.

“I'm not talking generally, I'm talking specifically about Benghazi -- that people have been threatened,” Toensing told Fox News on Wednesday. “And not just the State Department; people have been threatened at the CIA. ... It's frightening. ...They're taking career people and making them well aware that their careers will be over.”

DiGenova told Fox News on Thursday, by way of describing his and Toensing’s respective clients: “There were people who were material witnesses, who wanted to talk to [the ARB], and they were not allowed to talk to them.

“The people that we are representing are career civil servants...people who have served the country overseas…in dangerous positions all over the world, have risked their lives and only want to tell the truth.”"

The events surrounding the deaths of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012, look dramatically different depending on your politics. Republicans tend to see a cover-up and a scandal. Democrats see an attempt to damage President Obama and former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton. A Pew poll suggests that the public is divided as well, with 40 percent saying the administration has been dishonest, 37 percent saying it has told the truth, and 23 percent saying they’re not sure. Let’s assess what we do and don’t know.

1. U.N. Ambassador Susan E. Rice gave a deliberately false account of the attack.

This is ground zero in the alleged scandal. Conspiracy theorists contend the administration covered up evidence that Stevens was killed in an organized terrorist attack because Obama, during the 2012 campaign, claimed he had “decimated” al-Qaeda. On Sunday talk shows five days after the attack, Rice gave interviews based on talking points supplied by U.S. intelligence agencies; she suggested that Stevens’s death resulted from “spontaneous” protests that spread from the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, provoked by a movie trailer lampooning the prophet Muhammad.

In response to charges of a cover-up, the White House this past week released 100 pages of e-mails that show the State Department sought to remove references to possible links to Ansar al-Sharia, an Islamist group tied to al-Qaeda, and to earlier CIA warnings of extremist threats in Benghazi and eastern Libya.

Was there a cover-up? It does appear White House spokesman Jay Carney wasn’t giving the full story when he said, at a Nov. 28 briefing, that the White House and State Department had made only a “single adjustment” to the talking points, changing the word “consulate” to “diplomatic facility.” It is also possible that State wanted to tone down or remove passages that might cast the department or Clinton in a bad light.

But the e-mails indicate as well that the White House and State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland were mainly concerned with prejudging an ongoing investigation by releasing classified information too soon. And there is little doubt that Rice’s taped remarks reflected the best intelligence assessment of the attacks at the time. As more information came in, intelligence officials changed that assessment publicly. If the talking points were extensively edited after an interagency consultation, that was fairly normal procedure, especially when it came to deleting classified portions referring to specific groups. Rice did allow, in her comments on TV, that “extremist elements” might have taken part in the attack.

Even now, the FBI and other agencies are not certain who the culprits were. In that light, the administration’s efforts to remove references to specific groups look more judicious than nefarious.

2. A faster military response would have saved at least some of the four Americans.

We will never know for sure. In congressional testimony, Stevens’s former deputy, Gregory Hicks, said his request that the military send in F-16s and Special Operations troops as the attack was underway was refused. The Obama administration has responded that Hicks, a career diplomat, was no military expert. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and former defense secretary Leon Panetta testified this year that a military rescue mission would not have been practical. Dempsey said it would have taken “up to 20 hours or so” to get F-16s to the site, and he called them “the wrong tool for the job.”

Former defense secretary Robert Gates delivered perhaps the most persuasive rebuttal to this myth. On CBS’s “Face the Nation” on May 12, Gates said he probably would have made the same decisions. He also said Hicks’s notion that flying a fighter jet over the attackers might have dispersed them reflected “sort of a cartoonish impression of military capabilities,” ignoring the “number of surface-to-air missiles that have disappeared from [former Libyan leader Moammar] Gaddafi’s arsenals.”

3. Obama and Clinton should not be blamed.

This is the Democrats’ favorite myth. In December, Clinton’s own Accountability Review Board concluded that “systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies” might have contributed to the four deaths. But the report didn’t assign responsibility to any individual, and it confined blame for any mistakes to “two bureaus of the State Department.”

In fact, the Obama administration did appear to be playing down or ignoring security threats in Libya at the time. As the report said: “Simply put, in the months leading up to September 11, 2012, security in Benghazi was not recognized and implemented as a ‘shared responsibility’ in Washington, resulting in stove-piped discussions and decisions on policy and security.” The report also noted “known gaps” in the intelligence community’s assessments. And it’s the responsibility of those at the highest levels — the president and the secretary of state — to fill those gaps. In congressional testimony in January, Clinton said that she didn’t read an Aug. 16 cable from Stevens that raised questions about security and that she didn’t know about a decision to reject a request for more security. “I didn’t see those requests. They did not come to me. I did not approve them. I did not deny them,” she said. If so, it’s fair to ask: Why wasn’t Clinton involved?

4. The Benghazi attack could not have been predicted.

The administration’s argument is that there was no specific threat — and it will probably be Clinton’s, too, if she reemerges in public life ahead of 2016. The circumstances were unusual. Stevens was taking extraordinary risks in traveling to Benghazi, where he established contacts with anti-Gaddafi rebels during the uprising. Few U.S. ambassadors would ever be in a similar situation.

But these risks were known before the attack. As the Accountability Review Board report concluded, “At the time of the September attacks, Benghazi remained a lawless town nominally controlled by the Supreme Security Council (SSC) — a coalition of militia elements loosely cobbled into a single force to provide interim security — but in reality run by a diverse group of local Islamist militias.” Why was Stevens allowed to travel to such an unsecure place?

5. Benghazi is a pseudo-scandal manufactured by the GOP.

Republicans have blown Benghazi out of proportion. It doesn’t appear to have been a cover-up, but neither can it be dismissed. It represents a tragic failure of U.S. policy, one that should spark a larger discussion about whether the government has responded poorly to the Islamist threats that have emerged since the Arab Spring. It is reasonable to ask whether the Obama administration, starting with the president himself, created the conditions for Benghazi by being overconfident about the destruction of al-Qaeda and playing down the significance of extremist elements, possibly linked to al-Qaeda, that had emerged in Libya and elsewhere. Unless these threats are better understood, it is easy to imagine a similar disaster happening elsewhere.

Because Benghazi cost precious American lives, it should be investigated carefully rather than politicized endlessly.

Darrell Issa issued subpoenas Tuesday for a host of State Department emails and other communications on the Benghazi terror attack, signaling that the Obama administration's recent document dump would not satisfy congressional investigators.

Issa, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, claimed in a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry that the department is still ""withholding documents.""

He demanded the department release more on the administration's behind-the-scenes discussions, in the days after the attack, on how they would describe the strike. These documents have since become known as the ""Benghazi talking points.""

""The State Department has not lived up to the administration's broad and unambiguous promises of cooperation with Congress. Therefore, I am left with no alternative but to compel the State Department to produce relevant documents through a subpoena,"" Issa wrote to Kerry.

State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said Tuesday that the department ""remains committed to working cooperatively with the Congress"" and would ""take stock"" of any requests for information -- but noted that the department has provided thousands of pages of documents.

More On This...

""We have demonstrated an unprecedented degree of cooperation with the Congress on the issue of Benghazi, engaging in over 30 hearings and briefings for members and staff, and sharing over 25,000 pages of documents with committees,"" he said. ""All of us -- in the administration, in the Congress, in the media -- we should all be focused on the issue of protecting the American diplomats and development experts who are working every day to advance America's national interest and global leadership.""

Issa, in the letter, said he was issuing a subpoena that would cover ""all documents and communications"" for 10 current and former State Department officials.

This includes former spokeswoman Victoria Nuland, as well as nine others. Nuland is the official who, in the emails released earlier this month, could be seen pressing other agencies to remove references to prior attacks and security warnings in Benghazi -- expressing concern that the warnings could be used by lawmakers to criticize the State Department.

She also questioned references to Islamic extremists.

Issa wrote that her comments suggest ""that she did not raise these concerns in a vacuum,"" noting specifically that Nuland said some of the changes did not ""resolve all my issues or those of my building leadership.""

Issa wrote: ""The documents the enclosed subpoena covers will help the Committee understand why, although on the day after the attacks senior State Department leadership believed that Islamic extremists were involved, there were reservations about publicly acknowledging any such involvement just three days later. This issue is at the heart of the Committee's ongoing investigation.""

The committee confirmed to Fox News that the subpoena has been served.

Issa gave the department until June 7 to comply. The subpoena would cover communications under the leadership of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

The intelligence community's final talking points compiled for members of Congress suggested the Sept. 11 attack that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans stemmed from protests over an anti-Islamic video rather than an assault by extremists. Five days after the attack, U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice relied on the talking points in a series of interviews on the Sunday talk shows.

Republicans have accused the Obama administration of trying to mislead the American people about an act of terrorism in the heat of the presidential campaign. The White House says Rice reflected the best information available while facts were still being gathered.

After several revisions, the gist of the talking points read: ""The currently available information suggests that the demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and evolved into a direct assault against the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi and subsequently its annex. There are indications that extremists participated in the violent demonstrations.""

Issa said the emails and documents failed to answer the question of who else at the department other than Nuland had concerns about the early versions of the talking points. The chairman is seeking all documents and communications related to the talking points from former officials such as Nuland; Cheryl Mills, counselor and chief of staff to Clinton; and Philippe Reines, a deputy assistant secretary to Clinton; as well as Deputy Secretary of State William Burns.

Ambassador Christopher Stevens%2C 3 other Americans died in Libya

Clinton%27s testimony was delayed for weeks due to her hospitalization

Clinton tells committee%3A %27I take responsibility%27

WASHINGTON — A combative Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday fended off fierce interrogations from senators and House members in congressional hearings illuminating the brutal Sept. 11 attack on a U.S. Consulate in Libya that left a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans dead.

Clinton, who testified before a Senate panel in the morning and a House panel later in the day, also promised to improve security for State Department officials in North Africa and around the world following the Sept. 11 attack in Benghazi.

""I take responsibility,"" Clinton told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""Nobody is more committed to getting this right. I am determined to leave the State Department and our country safer, stronger and more secure.""

Clinton bristled at claims that the administration misled the public by initially linking the attack to a protest that spiraled out of control.

Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis, said ""a simple phone call"" to people in Benghazi ""would have established immediately"" that there was no protest. ""Why wasn't that known?"" he asked.

Clinton said State Department officials decided it was not appropriate to talk to U.S. officials in Benghazi before the FBI conducted their interviews. Pressed further on why that call wasn't made, Clinton erupted in anger.

""With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans,"" she said. ""Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night and decided they'd go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator.""

Job One, she said, is to find the killers and ""bring them to justice.""

Clinton, in what could be her last congressional testimony before leaving her post, said the deaths were ""personal"" for her.

She was near tears as she talked of standing next to President Obama ""as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews (Air Force Base). I put my arms around the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters.""

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., gave Clinton a warm but brief welcome before quickly pressing her on security issues at the consulate. He said when he met with U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens on July 7 — more than two months before the attack — Stevens expressed ""his deep and grave concerns about security in Benghazi … and the need for additional assistance.""

Clinton said requests for more security never reached her desk. McCain said the administration's ""preference for a 'soft footprint' was part of the reason for what took place"" in Benghazi.

An Independent Accountability Review Board appointed by the State Department concluded that ""systemic failures"" left the consulate in Benghazi inadequately protected and confirmed that no protest preceded the deadly attack. In a report released in December, the board recommended that the State Department strengthen security in high-risk posts.

Clinton told the committee she has asked a deputy secretary to lead a task force to ensure that all 29 of the panels recommendations are implemented quickly and completely — and to pursue ""additional steps above and beyond"" those in the board's report.

""Benghazi did not happen in a vacuum,"" Clinton said. The instability brought on by the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011 has expanded the reach of extremists across North Africa, she said.

The State Department for days after the Sept. 11 attack blamed it on a spontaneous protest of what it called a ""reprehensible"" video that denigrated Islam's prophet Mohammed, while CIA and diplomats from the scene were reporting that no protest preceded the attack.

Clinton testified that on the day of the attack, before it happened, she had been at the State Department dealing with a different crisis that evolved from protests to a YouTube video that disparaged Mohammed.

""During most of the day, prior to getting notice of the attack on our compound in Benghazi, we were very focused on the situation around our embassy in Cairo,"" Clinton said. ""There were attempts to scale the wall, and we were in close contact with our counterparts in Cairo.""

When the attack in Benghazi happened, about 4 p.m. Washington time, she called Libyan security officials ""to get assistance as quickly as possible.""

Clinton testified she spoke to National Security Adviser Tom Donilon, then-CIA director Gen. David Petraeus, who had a compound in Benghazi, and the White House.

She said U.S. officials participated in talks about what to do in a secure video conference with senior officials from the White House, the intelligence community and the Defense Department.

""I spoke to President Obama later in the day,"" she said.

Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, asked Clinton if she selected Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to go on the Sunday talk shows where she blamed the attack on a video days after it was clear the attack was terrorism.

""I did not,"" Clinton said.

Rice's television appearances five days after the attack derailed her possible nomination to replace Clinton as secretary of State. Clinton said she was too busy at the time to appear on TV herself.

""I was not focused on talking points,"" Clinton said. ""I was focused on keeping our people safe. We still had people attacking our embassy in Yemen, trying to scale the walls. I had to call the president in Tunis and beg him to send reinforcements, which he did and eventually saved our embassy there.""

Also, the classified intelligence assessment of the Benghazi attack was still cloudy about what it was, she said.

""There were a variety of potential causes and triggers,"" Clinton said.

There were some communications and coordination before the attack, but it still wasn't clear if it rose to the level of a pre-planned terrorist attack, she said.

Clinton testified that her department reacted to the attack by taking immediate steps to protect personnel and postings in embassies and consulates facing large protests around the world.

At the House hearing, Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., noted that Clinton had been ""very close"" to Stevens and wondered whether he had ever personally asked her to get involved.

""No. None of those cables ever came before me,"" Clinton replied.

""Chris Stevens, who knew more about Libya than anyone else I know in this country, didn't see a direct threat to our diplomatic facilities, and also neither did our intelligence community,"" Clinton said. ""They did not make the connection between the deteriorating security and a direct threat on our compound.""

Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., asked why no one was significantly disciplined, despite State Department claims that employees responsible for poor security in Benghazi would be disciplined.

""There has just been a shuffling of the deck chairs,"" Ros-Lehtinen said. ""Do you find it acceptable that officials who were responsible remain employed at the State Department?""

Clinton said all four individuals have been removed from their jobs and put on administrative leave.

""This is something I need your help with,"" Clinton said. The administrative review board found that, under U.S. law, ""unsatisfactory leadership is not satisfactory for a breach of duty,"" she said. ""I have put forth to the Congress and Senate to fix that problem going forward.""

Danielle Pletka, an analyst for the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute, said Clinton's testimony provided more questions than answers.

Clinton's assertion that she did not see cables from Stevens and his security chief asking for more security reflects ""a general vibe"" throughout the administration that the White House is not going to look kindly on anything that implies the country was facing a higher threat level, Pletka said.

Clinton's testimony was an effort to make the hearing about the aftermath rather than about why it happened, Pletka said. ""Understanding why it happened, who was responsible and what lies were told makes a huge difference,"" she said.

Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!” It fell two years later.

Mr. Obama’s address came 50 years after President John F. Kennedy, in another celebrated speech here, spoke outside a town hall to affirm support for Germans against the nuclear-armed Soviets. By contrast, Mr. Obama used his speech to propose that the United States and Russia reduce their nuclear arsenals by a third.

“Our fates and fortunes are linked like never before,” he said. “We may no longer live in fear of global annihilation, but so long as nuclear weapons exist, we are not truly safe.”

Officials said 4,500 people were present, fewer than the 6,000 tickets distributed — perhaps reflecting the scorching heat. Even so, that was far fewer than the 450,000 who saw Mr. Kennedy or the 200,000 who packed a park to hear Mr. Obama in 2008, when he was a presidential candidate. Then, Ms. Merkel had discouraged his use of the Brandenburg Gate site, saying it should not be used for politicking. This time she invited him to use it.

The anticipation of Mr. Obama’s address, though, was offset by attention to revelations of the breadth of the two United States surveillance programs — one a huge database logging American phone calls and the other, called Prism, to monitor foreign communications at Internet companies and through phone logs without individual warrants."

USA TODAY

The photographer who took the viral picture of President Obama's ""selfie"" with two other world leaders says Michelle Obama's expression has been distorted.

The AFP picture — shot Tuesday at Nelson Mandela's memorial service — shows Obama posing with British Prime Minister David Cameron and Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning Schmidt, and Mrs. Obama off to the side with a disapproving look.

But, as AFP's Roberto Schmidt pointed out in a blog, ""photos can lie.""

Writes Schmidt: ""In reality, just a few seconds earlier the first lady was herself joking with those around her, Cameron and Schmidt included. Her stern look was captured by chance.""

Schmidt also discloses that Thorning Schmidt, the Danish prime minister, produced the smartphone in which the selfie is now presumably stored.

The photographer describes the incident, which occurred just after Obama's eulogy for Mandela:

""So Obama took his place amid these leaders who'd gathered from all corners of the globe. Among them was British Prime Minister David Cameron, as well as a woman who I wasn't able to immediately identify.

""I later learned it was the Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning Schmidt. I'm a German-Colombian based in India, so I don't feel too bad I didn't recognize her! At the time, I thought it must have been one of Obama's many staffers.

""Anyway, suddenly this woman pulled out her mobile phone and took a photo of herself smiling with Cameron and the U.S. president. I captured the scene reflexively.""

Schmidt also pointed out that this was a memorial service, not a funeral: ""All around me in the stadium, South Africans were dancing, singing and laughing to honor their departed leader. It was more like a carnival atmosphere, not at all morbid. The ceremony had already gone on for two hours and would last another two. The atmosphere was totally relaxed -- I didn't see anything shocking in my viewfinder, president of the U.S. or not.""

The photographer also bemoans the viral attention — and criticism — the selfie has received:

""I took these photos totally spontaneously, without thinking about what impact they might have. At the time, I thought the world leaders were simply acting like human beings, like me and you.

""I doubt anyone could have remained totally stony faced for the duration of the ceremony, while tens of thousands of people were celebrating in the stadium. For me, the behavior of these leaders in snapping a selfie seems perfectly natural. I see nothing to complain about, and probably would have done the same in their place.""

He also said: ""I confess too that it makes me a little sad we are so obsessed with day-to-day trivialities, instead of things of true importance."""

The fresh reports have surfaced two days after three whistle-blowers testified on Capitol Hill about the Benghazi attack. One of them sharply challenged the administration's decision to describe the attack out of the gate as a protest gone wrong.

ABC News reported Friday that, despite administration claims that the flawed description reflected the best intelligence at the time, the talking points that led to the statement were revised 12 times.

Initial versions, as has been previously reported, contained references to Al Qaeda that were later deleted. But the latest excerpts show how State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland pressed the CIA to scrub references to the agency's prior security warnings.

According to ABC News, the original paragraph read:

""The Agency has produced numerous pieces on the threat of extremists linked to al-Qa'ida in Benghazi and eastern Libya. These noted that, since April, there have been at least five other attacks against foreign interests in Benghazi by unidentified assailants, including the June attack against the British Ambassador's convoy. We cannot rule out the individuals has previously surveilled the U.S. facilities, also contributing to the efficacy of the attacks.""

But Nuland wrote that the lines ""could be abused by members [of Congress] to beat up the State Department for not paying attention to warnings, so why would we want to feed that either? Concerned ...""

The paragraph in question was then reportedly deleted.

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki defended her agency's actions Friday after the excerpts were published.

She said in a statement: ""The State Department first reviewed the talking points on Friday evening with the understanding that they were prepared for public use by members of Congress. The spokesperson's office raised two primary concerns about the talking points. First that the points went further in assigning responsibility than preliminary assessments suggested and there was concern about preserving the integrity of the investigation. Second, that the points were inconsistent with the public language the Administration had used to date -- meaning members of Congress would be providing more guidance to the public than the Administration.""

The Weekly Standard, which referenced the Nuland exchange briefly in a prior account, also reported new details Friday, describing how then-CIA Director David Petraeus voiced surprise when he learned the Saturday after the attack that officials had deleted all prior references to Al Qaeda and jihadists, leaving only the word ""extremists.""

U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice would use the final version of the talking points to say on several Sunday shows that the attack was triggered by protests over an anti-Islam film.

While administration officials and congressional Democrats have described the protracted debate over the talking points as politically motivated and inconsequential, the testimony this week drew new attention to it.

Greg Hicks, former deputy chief of mission in Libya, said Rice's comments actually hurt the FBI investigation by insulting the Libyan president -- who gave a conflicting account at the time by saying the attack was premeditated.

Hicks said the anti-Islam film was actually a ""nonevent"" in Libya, and his ""jaw dropped"" when he heard Rice's comments.

ABC News reported that the CIA's first drafts did say the attack appeared to be ""spontaneously inspired"" by the protests at the embassy in Cairo. However, the early versions also said ""we do know that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qa'ida participated in the attack.""

The State Department and White House have continued to defend their actions and intervention in light of the new details.

After it was first revealed that references to security concerns -- in addition to references to Al Qaeda -- were removed, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said: ""What we said and what remains true to this day is that the intelligence community drafted and redrafted these points.""

He defended administration claims that the faulty statements were merely the product of incomplete intelligence in a rapidly changing environment. Despite the excerpts, he stood by claims that White House involvement was minimal.

""The fact that there are inputs is always the case in a process like this. But the only edits made by anyone here at the White House were stylistic and non-substantive. They corrected the description of the building or the facility in Benghazi from 'consulate' to 'diplomatic facility' and the like,"" he said.

State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell also said Rice's comments were based on the intelligence community's ""best assessment that there was not any evidence of months-long pre-planning or pre-meditation, which remains their assessment."""

Obama suggested this proves there was no cover-up and no effort to downplay terrorism. But the president's re-telling of events last September appeared to clash with the actual timeline of administration statements.

Though Obama referred to ""acts of terror"" on Sept. 12, he and other top officials repeatedly declined to call it terrorism on subsequent occasions.

And even after National Counterterrorism Center Director Matt Olsen testified on Sept. 19 that the attack was terrorism -- which is the testimony Obama pointed to in his remarks Monday -- Obama himself declined to use the term the next day. ""I don't want to speak to something until we have all the information,"" Obama said on Sept. 20.

Republicans were quick to pillory the president's comments Monday.

More On This... Obama calls Benghazi controversy a ‘sideshow’

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., called it ""revisionist history."" John Bolton, former U.S. ambassador to the U.N., called it ""flatly untrue.""

""This definitely is a creative rewriting of history,"" Bolton told Fox News.

The president made two central claims Monday as he battled new reports that depicted an effort to water down the administration's early talking points on the attack in order to downplay terrorism.

First, Obama said: ""The day after it happened I acknowledged that this was an act of terrorism.""

The president has made this argument before, most forcefully during the presidential race against Mitt Romney. He is mainly referring to remarks in the Rose Garden Sept. 12 where he referred to ""acts of terror"" as he condemned the attack.

But for days afterward, he and other top officials would not use that term.

Later that day on Sept. 12, Obama told CBS News, when asked whether he thought the strike was a terrorist attack: ""Well, it's too early to tell exactly how this came about."" Obama only would call it ""an attack on Americans.""

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney also denied reports on Sept. 14 that it was a pre-planned attack.

And after U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice made her controversial Sept. 16 comments calling the attack the result of a protest, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland was again asked if the attack was terrorism. ""I don't think we know enough,"" she said.

Administration officials began to start publicly changing the narrative the week of Sept. 17.

Obama made a new claim on Monday as he tried to put that week in context.

The president suggested that, three days after Rice tied the attack to protests over an anti-Islam film, Olsen was dispatched to Capitol Hill to clear things up.

He was referring to Olsen's testimony on Capitol Hill Sept. 19 in which he called the attack terrorism.

""If this was some effort on our part to try to downplay what had happened or tamp it down, that would be a pretty odd thing that three days later we end up putting out all the information,"" Obama said. ""Who executes some sort of cover-up or effort to tamp things down for three days? So the whole thing defies logic.""

The comment suggested Olsen was sent to the Hill to announce the administration's conclusion that the attack was terrorism.

Yet Olsen's comment only came under questioning by a Senate committee. And at the time, his testimony was considered major news because it ran contrary to other accounts out of the administration.

Congressional sources also told Fox News last year that Olsen was reprimanded by the White House after he testified -- though the White House denied the allegation.

Further, while Olsen became the first administration official to publicly call it a ""terrorist attack,"" other officials were not quite on board with that description at the time.

Neither Nuland nor Carney used the term that day.

The next day, while speaking to Univision, Obama declined to use the label, saying: ""I don't want to speak to something until we have all the information.""

However, Carney said Sept. 20 that it was ""self-evident that what happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack.""

After that point, other top officials began using the term."

Carney got a “case of the Mondays” a few days early as the Obama administration's lies about Benghazi and potentially criminal acts at the IRS all caught up with them at once.

ABC Senior White House correspondent Jonathan Karl started the day off revealing that the famous Benghazi talking points were “dramatically edited by the administration” a total of 12 different times. Those changes included the removal of all references to Al Qaeda initially approved by the CIA.

That public relations disaster was followed by another later in the day. The IRS admitted that conservatives had been right all along and that right-wing groups had indeed been targeted by the IRS. In true Nixonian language, the IRS admitted “mistakes were made,” but denied they were political, convincing absolutely no one.

Fridays, famously called “take out the trash day” in the lefty TV show “West Wing,” are supposed to be days when the administration hides news. On May 10, the trash bin was overflowing and even the press noticed. Carney couldn’t dump garbage fast enough. He fielded at least 38 questions on Benghazi and another eight on the possible crimes at the IRS.

Throughout, he dodged, weaved and blamed – especially blamed. He blamed former President George W. Bush, the CIA, the IRS, Congress, Mitt Romney and, of course, Republicans. “Congress” got blamed 28 times and Republicans got mentioned 20 times by Carney as he tried to spin his way out of trouble.

He began by reminding the press that the White House did “have a background briefing” earlier for 14 news organizations. That meeting, held following these types of PR disasters, had to be spinning like a carnival ride. And the spinning had just gotten started.

The IRS questions were easier since even Carney admitted he wasn’t in the know. He stressed “two things” to pass the buck – that the IRS was an “independent enforcement agency” and “the individual who was running the IRS at the time was actually an appointee from the previous administration.” In other words, blame Bush. I think he learned that one from his boss.

When it came to Benghazi, Carney claimed the White House made a “non-substantive factual correction” to the talking points. He continued: “I must say that all of this information was provided months ago to members of Congress,” adding sarcastically, “which they have leaked now to reporters.” This, after the White House just had a background meeting with 14 different news organizations so they could leak, er, give background information

At several points, Carney embraced his inner Candy Crowley and claimed, inaccurately, that Obama had called the attack “an act of terror” during his Rose Garden speech. (Kudos to Tim Carney for that catch.) However, that’s completely untrue. Even CBS News admitted in 2012 that the transcript “shows that the president did refer to ‘acts of terror’ – but not specifically in reference to the Libya attack. Instead, he made a broader statement about American defiance.” The Team Obama shorthand has created a fictional narrative that is largely accepted by the media.

During the briefing, question after question pounded Carney on his previous comments that only “stylistic” changes had been made to the Benghazi talking points, when that obviously was not true.

The questioning grew heated and it appeared to show on Carney, as first his ears and then his face reddened to the point where people on Twitter were mocking it. Twitchy captured some of the more fun comments including one saying he was trying to “defend the indefensible.” That was an understatement.

Hilariously, Carney made multiple positive references to the famous interview of UN Ambassador Susan Rice where she made the bogus comments about the “heinous and offensive” video about Islam.

It took 37 minutes into the press conference for one of the reporters to ask a question that didn’t involve one of the day’s two big scandals. Carney seemed to breathe a sigh of relief when it happened.

But it wasn’t over. One of the later questions was telling. “Don’t this series of e-mails now I suggest that your discussion of the video was speculative. You were cherry picking,” asked one reporter. Others pointed out a key flaw in Carney’s defense, calling him out for saying the talking points were what we were sure we knew, but reminding him that the initial talking points said the CIA wrote “we do know that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qa’ida participated in the attack.” Carney’s response was to direct that inquiry to the “intelligence community.”

If the questioning was a true sign of media interest, Carney can look for many more red-faced press briefings. Perhaps he needs more make-up next time. He should try cover-up. It’s perfect.

Three State Department officials on Wednesday provided a riveting, emotional account of last year’s fatal attack on U.S. installations in eastern Libya as they accused senior government officials of withholding embarrassing facts and failing to take enough responsibility for security lapses.

The testimony provided new details on the Sept. 11, 2012, assaults on U.S. installations in Benghazi and their aftermath. But the new information failed to break the political logjam the attacks spawned, with Republicans and Democrats offering starkly different interpretations of what happened and who within the U.S. government is to blame.

Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) opened the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing by saying that panel Democrats had “mostly sat silent” while Republicans tried to wrest the truth from an uncooperative Obama administration.

Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), the senior Democrat on the committee, countered that Issa’s GOP majority had launched a “full-scale media campaign . . . of unfounded accusations to smear public officials.”

But in expanding the narrative of the intensely politicized episode, the witnesses raised fresh questions about whether then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and her deputies were sufficiently engaged in assessing the security posture of diplomatic posts last year.

Speaking before the panel, they also reiterated criticism of the administration’s initial reluctance to describe the attacks as premeditated terrorist acts. The Libyan government had labeled the attacks a terrorist assault, and the absence of similar descriptions from the United States made it more difficult for Libyan officials to assist the FBI’s investigation of the incident, according to the former deputy chief of the U.S. mission in Libya.

“It negatively affected our ability to get the FBI team quickly to Benghazi,” Foreign Service officer Gregory Hicks said. President Mohamed Yusuf al-Magariaf was “insulted in front of his own people. His credibility was reduced. His ability to lead his country was damaged,” Hicks said.

Clinton and her senior aides should have paid more attention to deteriorating security in Libya over the months preceding the attacks, along with requests from the post for additional resources, said Eric Nordstrom, who served as the embassy’s security chief until July.

If for no other reason, Nordstrom said, Clinton was planning to travel to Libya later in the year and had signaled that she wanted the United States to turn its temporary mission in Benghazi into a formal diplomatic post.

“Certainly, there’s a reasonable expectation that her staff would have briefed her” on a March 28 cable from the embassy in Tripoli asking for additional security personnel and resources, Nordstrom said.

The State Department has defended the review carried out after the Benghazi assault, calling it exhaustive. The former top diplomat who led the probe, Thomas Pickering, told MSNBC that “the notion of a coverup,” as some Republicans allege, “has the elements of Pulitzer Prize fiction.”

A team of Special Operations troops that had been assigned to the embassy in Libya in 2011 to provide security was significantly downsized and its mission changed to training shortly before the attack, Hicks testified. The team of 14 to 16 elite troops was whittled down to four after two of them were carjacked, a decision Hicks said was made by the U.S. military’s Africa Command.

After the State Department’s lightly defended Benghazi compound came under siege by a mob of 60 or so assailants, Hicks said, he initially sought to get the Pentagon to scramble jets from a U.S. base in Italy to fly over Benghazi, in hopes it would intimidate militants. When he was told that no planes could arrive for several hours, Hicks said, he tried to get the remaining four Special Operations troops on a Libyan military aircraft heading to Benghazi early on the morning of Sept. 12. Senior military leaders rejected that request, Hicks said, even though “there was every reason to continue to believe that our personnel were in danger.”

Pentagon spokesman George Little told reporters Wednesday that the stand-down order was given because the troops were needed to protect U.S. personnel in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, and that they could not have reached Benghazi in time to have made a difference.

“We continue to believe there was nothing this team could have done to assist during the second attack in Benghazi,” Little said.

The three witnesses — also including Mark Thompson, acting deputy assistant secretary for counterterrorism — were critical of the inquiry into Benghazi headed by Pickering, saying that it did not assign enough blame to senior officials.

Nordstrom and Hicks singled out Patrick Kennedy, the longtime undersecretary for management, who had ultimate responsibility for weighing security requests made by diplomatic posts.

Hicks, a 22-year veteran of the department, said senior U.S. leaders, including President Obama and Clinton, lauded his performance during the crisis. After he questioned why Susan E. Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, had delivered talking points that linked the attack to a demonstration, his superiors turned on him, Hicks testified. He specifically alleged that Clinton counselor Cheryl Mills and Assistant Secretary of State Elizabeth Jones criticized him harshly.

Early in the hearing, Hicks delivered a detailed account of the events of that night, keeping spectators in the crowded hearing room riveted.

After being alerted that the mission’s villa in Benghazi was being assaulted, Hicks said, he managed to get Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens on the phone for a few seconds — just long enough to hear him say, “Greg, we’re under attack.”

Hicks said he and his colleagues worked the phones madly that night, asking Libyan government officials for reinforcement while they waited for Washington to spring into action.

Scott Wickland, the ambassador’s main bodyguard, sought to rescue Stevens from the burning building, Hicks said.

“He tried repeatedly to go back in to try to rescue Sean [Smith] and the ambassador but had to stop due to exposure to smoke,” the diplomat testified.

A team from a house nearby that was used as a base by the CIA responded to the attack on the main compound and managed to repel it initially, Hicks said, but it later had to retreat under fire, leaving Stevens behind.

Hicks learned that Stevens had been taken to a hospital controlled by a militia, and he began hearing reports that the ambassador had died. A call from the Libyan prime minister confirming the news, Hicks said, was “the saddest phone call I have ever had in my life.”

When they realized the U.S. military would not be bailing them out anytime soon, Hicks said, his team sprang into action.

“Okay, we’re on our own,” he said, describing his reaction. “We’re going to have to try to pull this off with the resources that we have available.”

Alarmed by the possibility that the residential area where U.S. diplomats were housed in Tripoli could come under attack, Hicks began planning to move to an annex as soon as dawn broke. A female diplomat packed ammunition into their armored vehicles and then used an ax to destroy hard drives and other sensitive items that would be left unguarded.

The Tripoli team was able to move safely and coordinated medical care for the Benghazi attack survivors, who were flown to the capital on the morning of Sept. 12."

Two of the whistle-blowers' opening statements were obtained by Fox News, and in the statements they defend their credibility in testifying about what happened last Sept. 11 in Libya.

""I am a career public servant,"" Greg Hicks' statement reads. ""Until the aftermath of Benghazi, I loved every day of my job."" He was deputy chief of mission in Libya and became top U.S. diplomat in the country after Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed in the terror attack.

The other statement, by Mark Thompson of the State Department Counterterrorism Bureau, is mostly biographical. Testimony also is due Wednesday from Eric Nordstrom, a diplomatic security officer who was formerly the regional security officer in Libya.

The administration has parried Republican allegations lately by arguing that the attack is old news, that the State Department already has investigated it and that Republicans are engaged in a political witch hunt.

More On This...

But a series of carefully timed leaks on the whistle-blowers' testimony indicates House Republicans could have the goods to at least merit a second look at the administration narrative.

""The question is, where's the accountability for lying to the American people?"" Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, told Fox News. ""The American people were lied to.""

Issa claimed one ""cover-up"" is ""undeniable"" -- that the State Department botched security in Benghazi in the run-up to the attack. But, he said, ""it still doesn't explain the president misleading the American people over a period of weeks.""

Three whistle-blowers are set to testify shortly before noon to the oversight committee Issa chairs.

Issa's Democratic counterpart on the committee, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, voiced skepticism about the leaks of the witnesses' claims in advance of the hearing.

""If there was any matter that cries out for bipartisanship, it's this,"" he told Fox News, while raising criticisms that information about some witnesses wasn't available in advance to Democrats. ""This is about making sure that our diplomatic core are safe. ... I want to go wherever the evidence leads, but I want all the evidence.""

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, a member of that committee, said if it weren't for lawmakers' persistence, ""we would be left with a whole host of lies coming out of this administration, because they were not truthful about this.""

The ""truth"" surrounding the Benghazi attack has been elusive. The Obama administration has adamantly denied several of the latest charges, including a claim that then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and a key aide tried to cut the department's own counterterrorism bureau out of the chain of reporting and decision-making on Sept. 11. The administration also denied that the whistle-blowers in question were intimidated -- while behind the scenes questioning the credibility of the witnesses.

The witnesses are expected to cover a breadth of material in their testimony Wednesday. Lawmakers have questioned to what extent security requests were ignored before the attack, whether the military could have done more to respond the night of the attack and whether talking points were intentionally changed for political reasons after the attack to downplay terrorism. The witnesses could address all three areas on Wednesday.

A key area of interest is how the attack was described in the immediate aftermath.

The Weekly Standard reported last week that the initial CIA talking points on the attack said ""Islamic extremists with ties to al Qaeda participated in the attack."" The reference to Al Qaeda was later taken out, and the initial reference to ""attacks"" was reportedly changed to ""demonstrations.""

According to The Weekly Standard, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland raised ""serious concerns"" at the time about the draft, concerned it could fuel criticism of the department.

The language continued to be watered down.

Issa told Fox News, in reference to the revisions, that ""it's very clear ... that this was a political change.""

State Department officials released a statement Tuesday night labeled ""Benghazi Attack Fack Check"" to defend its security efforts.

""No one is more determined than the State Department family to bring those who perpetrated this attack to justice and do everything we need to do to keep our people safe,"" the statement reads. ""That's where our attention is, and we hope Congress and the media, too, can keep the focus.""

Hicks, according to a transcript, also told congressional investigators that he thought it ""was a terrorist attack from the get go.""

The whistle-blowers will be able to provide a new perspective on what was happening on the ground that night.

Hicks, according to transcripts, told investigators that the U.S. military could have prevented one wave of the deadly attack on American personnel in Benghazi if fighter jets had been promptly deployed. Further, he claimed that a second rescue team that was supposed to go from Tripoli to Benghazi early the next morning was told not to go.

He said Special Forces personnel were planning to board a C-130 flight at around 6 a.m. local time on Sept. 12 but got a phone call when they were on their way to the flight telling them ""you can't go now, you don't have authority to go now. And so they missed the flight.""

He added: ""They were told not to board the flight, so they missed it,"" apparently because they did not have the ""right authority.""

Thompson has also claimed that Clinton and a key aide effectively tried to cut the department's own counterterrorism bureau out of the loop that night.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney denied the claim on Monday.

Daniel Benjamin, who ran the department's Counterterrorism Bureau at the time, also put out a statement Monday morning strongly denying the charges.

""I ran the bureau then, and I can say now with certainty, as the former Coordinator for Counterterrorism, that this charge is simply untrue,"" he said. ""Though I was out of the country on official travel at the time of the attack, I was in frequent contact with the Department. At no time did I feel that the Bureau was in any way being left out of deliberations that it should have been part of."""

Jeb Bush (R) will honor former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with this year’s Liberty Medal from the National Constitution Center. The award will be presented to Clinton on September 10th, the eve of the first anniversary of the terrorist attack on the United States mission in Benghazi that killed four Americans.

The Christian Science Monitor reports that Bush, a potential GOP contender in the 2016 presidential race, is chairman of the board of trustees of the National Constitution Center located in Philadelphia.

“Former Secretary Clinton has dedicated her life to serving and engaging people across the world in democracy,” Bush said in a statement. “These efforts as a citizen, an activist, and a leader have earned Secretary Clinton this year’s Liberty Medal.”

Bush’s decision to honor Clinton, who is considered by some to be a likely Democrat candidate for president in 2016, was condemned by the Independence Hall Tea Party Association of Philadelphia. According to the Christian Science Monitor, the organization released its own statement Monday, referring to the event as “extremely distressing,” and offering, instead, an opportunity for another Liberty Medal recipient.

According to the statement:

As all of you undoubtedly know, much of the blame for the Obama Administration’s failure to contain the Benghazi attack and the scandalous handling of its aftermath, can be traced directly to Ms. Clinton. Indeed, a Congressional investigation regarding Ms. Clinton’s role in the cover-up of the Administration’s failure is still ongoing. A newly formed organization, the Independence Hall Foundation, will hold a “What Difference Does It Make” press conference on Independence Mall, September 10, 4 PM, to denounce the selection of Ms. Clinton as the 2013 Liberty Medal recipient and to offer an alternative award (details below). During the conference, the Foundation will name its choice of recipient(s) for the 2013 Defender of Liberty Medal. Dom Giordano will headline the presser and we certainly hope you will consider joining us. A 5 PM Prayer Vigil for the victims of the Benghazi attack will immediately follow the press conference.

The National Constitution Center’s announcement, dated June 27th, about the award of the Liberty Medal to Clinton, states:

As Secretary of State, Clinton advocated for “smart power” in foreign policy, elevating diplomacy and development and repositioning them for the 21st century – with new tools, technologies, and partners, including the private sector and civil society around the world.

National Constitution Center president and CEO Jeffrey Rosen said, “Hillary Clinton has devoted her life to expanding opportunities for ‘We the People’ not just in this country but around the globe.”

Upon the announcement of Clinton’s award in June, Gateway Pundit’s Jim Hoft wrote, “Really Jeb, no one else came to mind?”"

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/05/29/Blame-the-President-for-Benghazi,2013-05-29 00:00:00,['Colonel David Hunt'],Blame the President for Benghazi,"When the American mission in Benghazi, Libya was attacked on September 11th, 2012, only one person had the positional authority, legal mandate, and communications apparatus to give the order to defend our personnel on the ground: the President of the United States.

The President did not give that order, and four Americans died in Benghazi that day. All the rest of the nonsense to which we have been treated-from prepared talking points, congressional hearings, and finally to the outright lies-matter not when compared to the ignominious moments in which the President of the United States refused to do his job.

That same day, two other American embassies in the Middle East were also under attack in Sana, Yemen and Cairo, Egypt. As a result, our intelligence systems were on high alert. When the calls, satellite and drone feeds, faxes, and reports began bombarding every command center from Germany to the United States, our nation, already at war for eleven years, was again under siege. Staffs from Africa Command, European Command, the National Military Command Center, the CIA Operations Center, the State Department Operations Center, and the White House Situation Room were fully operational.

This all means that on September 11, 2012, our national security apparatus was on full alert. It means everyone was briefed. This is how it works; no games, no conjecture, no television and movie looks, just real battle in real time with real lives at risk.

The road to that indecision is littered with policy and leadership failures that culminated in an American mission and clandestine CIA base being attacked and the murder of our Ambassador and three dedicated Americans doing their jobs. However, the one person responsible for it all is the one man who could have, but refused to, even try to stop the carnage… the President of the United States.

All the President had to say within the first two hours while being briefed by the Secretary of Defense was, “Send in a response force.” This command, followed by his signature on a paper called Cross Border Authority, would have ordered the Department of Defense to do everything and anything to save lives in Benghazi, Libya.

Three and a half years earlier, on April 9, 2009, President Obama had done exactly that when pirates hijacked an American flagged merchant ship, Maersk Alabama, sailing off the coast of Somalia. In this earlier incident, the President made the right decision within hours to allow SEAL Team Six the time to plan and go. In the end, we all witnessed a textbook successful rescue operation.

Fast forward to September 11, 2012, and we have a desperate situation with Americans in jeopardy. The same President, instead of deciding how to respond, disappeared for the evening and then went to Las Vegas the following day to raise money for his re-election campaign.

Had the President ordered a rescue, he had everything he needed to mount a prompt and forceful response–from F-16’s in Aviano, Italy, to an armed and fueled plane standing by at C Company, 1st Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group, training in Croatia-a mere three hours from Benghazi by air.

When the first shot was fired in Benghazi, no one knew how long the fight would last. Subsequent government claims saying we could not get there within the seven-plus hours that the tragedy lasted are specious at best and an outright lie at worst. We did not even care enough to try; that fact alone should make all Americans who mourn the loss of four of our countrymen very angry.

This ultimate Presidential control–the ability to bring armed American forces to bear anywhere in the world within hours–has existed for over 25 years. It exists precisely because of past mistakes and embarrassing moments brought to us by various governmental agencies, congresses, and presidents.

Since September 11th, 2012, we have been treated to a tractor-trailer load of misdirection, disingenuous speeches, television appearances, and outright lying by public officials at every level of the government of the United States of America. Now with other scandals hitting the news, we are beginning to forget and confuse what is the only important point to know after we acknowledge and pray for the four Americans murdered by terrorists that fateful day.

There is one simple point to be made about Benghazi: the President of the United States is the only human being on the planet that can order a bullet, a missile, a plane, a drone, a boat, a helicopter, a soldier, sailor, spy, or push cart with a squirt gun attached to go into another country and perform an aggressive action.

On September 11, 2012, we know the President failed to give that order. We don’t know where he was, what he was doing, or why he failed to act. But we do know he failed to act, and that inaction cost the lives of four brave Americans."
http://news.yahoo.com/defiant-clinton-takes-lawmakers-libya-attack-212245534--politics.html,,[],Defiant Clinton takes on lawmakers on Libya attack,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton delivered fiery rejoinders Wednesday to Republican critics of the Obama administration's handling of the deadly attack on a U.S. mission in Benghazi, facing off with lawmakers who included potential 2016 presidential rivals.

At times emotional and frequently combative, Clinton rejected GOP suggestions in two congressional hearings that the administration tried to mislead the country about the Sept. 11 attack that killed Chris Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya, and three other Americans. She insisted the State Department is moving swiftly and aggressively to strengthen security at diplomatic posts worldwide.

In her last formal testimony before Congress as America's top diplomat — but perhaps not her last time on the political stage — Clinton once again took responsibility for the department's missteps and failures leading up to the assault. But she also said that requests for more security at the diplomatic mission in Benghazi didn't reach her desk, and reminded lawmakers that they have a responsibility to fund security-related budget requests.

Three weeks after her release from a New York hospital — admitted for complications after a concussion — Clinton was at times defiant, complimentary and willing to chastise lawmakers during more than 5 ½ hours of testimony before two separate committees. She tangled with some who could be rivals in 2016 if she decides to seek the presidency again.

Her voice cracking at one point, Clinton said the attack and the aftermath were highly personal tragedies for the families of the victims who died — Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty — as well as herself.

""I stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews. I put my arms around the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters and the wives left alone to raise their children,"" she told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at a packed hearing.

Story continues

Clearly annoyed with Republican complaints about the initial explanation for the attack, she rose to the defense of U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, who was vilified for widely debunked claims five days after the attack that protests precipitated the raid rather than terrorism.

Clinton said, ""People were trying in real time to get to the best information."" And she said her own focus was on looking ahead on how to improve security rather than revisiting the talking points and Rice's comments.

Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., pressed her on why ""we were misled that there were supposedly protests and something sprang out of that, an assault sprang out of that.""

""With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans,"" she said, her voice rising and quivering with anger as she and Johnson spoke over each other.

""Was it because of a protest? Or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they would go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator.""

If Johnson's comments drew an irritated response from Clinton, she notably ignored Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., when he said he would have fired her if he had been in charge and found that she had not read cables from her team in Libya asking for more security. Paul is a potential 2016 presidential candidate.

""Had I been president and found you did not read the cables from Benghazi and from Ambassador Stevens, I would have relieved you of your post,"" Paul said. ""I think it's inexcusable.""

Clinton and other officials have testified that requests for additional security did not reach her level, and a scathing independent review of the matter sharply criticized four senior State Department officials who have been relieved of their duties.

""I did not see these requests. They did not come to me. I did not approve them. I did not deny them,"" she said.

Later, before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Republican Rep. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina repeatedly challenged Clinton's claim to have looked at the tragedy with ""clear eyes,"" saying she should have personally ensured security at the mission.

He said Clinton had ""let the consulate become a death trap"" in denying requests for additional security and called it ""malpractice.""

Clinton said she could have let the review board's report remain classified and told Congress ""goodbye"" before leaving office. But she said, it's ""not who I am. It's not what I do.""

Absent from the Senate hearing was Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., the man tapped to succeed Clinton, who is leaving the administration after four years. Kerry, defeated by George W. Bush in the 2004 presidential election, is expected to win swift Senate approval. Clinton is to introduce him at his confirmation hearing on Thursday.

Politics play an outsized role in any appearance by Clinton, who was defeated by Barack Obama in a hard-fought battle for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. She is the subject of constant speculation about a possible bid in 2016.

A former New York senator and the wife of former President Bill Clinton, she is a polarizing figure but is ending her tenure at the State Department with high favorability ratings. A poll last month by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press found 65 percent of Americans held a favorable impression of her, compared with 29 percent unfavorable.

On the panel at the Senate hearing were two possible 2016 Republican presidential candidates — Florida's Marco Rubio and Paul, a new member of the committee — as well as John McCain of Arizona, who was defeated by Obama in November 2008.

Clinton, 65, did little to quiet the presidential chatter earlier this month when she returned to work after her hospitalization. On the subject of retirement, she said, ""I don't know if that is a word I would use, but certainly stepping off the very fast track for a little while.""

In a second round of questioning on Wednesday, Clinton testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee where Republican members pressed her on why cables and other memos about security deficiencies in Benghazi seemed to be ignored.

""The dots here were connected ahead of time. The State Department saw this was coming,"" said Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., the chairman of the panel. ""The State Department didn't act.""

Clinton told senators the department is implementing the 29 recommendations of the review board and going beyond the proposals, with a special focus on high-threat posts.

""Nobody is more committed to getting this right,"" she said. ""I am determined to leave the State Department and our country safer, stronger, and more secure.""

Clinton had been due to testify in December but postponed her appearances after fainting, falling and suffering a concussion while recovering from a stomach virus that left her severely dehydrated. She was then diagnosed with a blood clot near her brain and returned to work only on Jan. 7.

She won bipartisan well-wishes on her recovery, but while Democrats were quick to praise her for accomplishments as secretary of state, Republicans then hit her with withering criticism.

""It's wonderful to see you in good health and combative as ever,"" said McCain.

But in the same breath, he dismissed her explanation of events, the administration's response to warnings about the deteriorating security situation in Libya and even the attention paid to Libya after rebels toppled Moammar Gadhafi. ""The answers, frankly, that you've given this morning are not satisfactory to me,"" McCain said.

To McCain, a friend that Clinton served with in the Senate, she replied matter-of-factly: ""We just have a disagreement. We have a disagreement about what did happen and when it happened with respect to explaining the sequence of events.""

Some Democrats raised the point that Congress had cut funding for embassy security.

""We have to get our act together,"" she told the panels, chiding House GOP members for recently stripping $1 billion in security aid from the hurricane relief bill and the Senate panel for failing for years to produce a spending authorization bill.

In something of a valedictory, Clinton noted her robust itinerary in four years and her work, nearly 1 million miles and 112 countries.

""My faith in our country and our future is stronger than ever. Every time that blue and white airplane carrying the words ""United States of America"" touches down in some far-off capital, I feel again the honor it is to represent the world's indispensable nation. And I am confident that, with your help, we will continue to keep the United States safe, strong, and exceptional.""

Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., expressed incredulity that the independent review board did not interview Clinton for its extensive report. She also complained about the department's ""false narrative"" that four employees lost their jobs over the attack.

""There's just been a shuffling of the deck chairs,"" said Ros-Lehtinen.

Clinton said earlier that she was not asked to speak to the review board but would have been available. She said the four employees have been removed from their jobs and have been placed on administrative leave, but federal rules prevent the department from taking more drastic steps.

Her testimony followed more than three months of Republican charges that the Obama administration ignored signs of a deteriorating security situation and cast an act of terrorism as mere protests over an anti-Muslim video in the heat of a presidential election. U.S. officials suspect that militants linked to al-Qaida carried out the attack.

Venezuela, Bolivia and Nicaragua have offered Snowden asylum. None can be reached by direct commercial flight from Moscow, so taking a commercial flight could make Snowden vulnerable to arrest during a stopover and he could be returned to the United States, where he faces espionage charges.

The campaign Fly Edward Snowden Fly, which surfaced on Mashable.com, was set up by Christian Honey, a neuroscientist at the University of Oxford. Honey hopes to raise $200,000 to fund Snowden’s travel—with no stops—by private jet to Venezuela.

Beyond travel expenses, Honey explains on the Indiegogo site, “all scenarios for Edward Snowden involve substantial legal costs: asylum applications, legal advice, defense.

""All funds,” Honey says, “will go directly to the bank account set up for Mr. Snowden by Rothera and Company LLT in London, the accountants that also take care of the Wikileaks' Julian Assange's support fund.""

The campaign, which has nine days left, has a long way to go toward its goal. So far, only a little over $1,600 has been raised.

The former NSA contractor, who leaked classified documents to the media about U.S. government surveillance programs, is hoping to avoid prosecution by fleeing to a friendly country that has offered asylum.

Although Snowden has not made his travel plans public, Honey concludes that he is most likely to eventually go to Venezuela.

""Edward Snowden deserves to be free,"" Honey told Yahoo News by email. ""He revealed that the US and UK governments have secretly created spying programs that no one ever voted for.""

Honey also includes a list of famous supporters, from filmmaker Oliver Stone to Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.

“If you agree with Edward’s actions, if you agree he’s a whistle-blower and did the world good, then maybe you want to contribute to this campaign,” Honey says in a YouTube video made for the campaign.

Not everyone seems to agree. The controversy continues on Honey's YouTube page. YouTube user denisasitis posted, ""I sent money and will do all I can to spread the word, thank you for your effort."" But Ben Kotowicz writes, ""As any US Citizen, Snowden will be given a trial. If he leaves the country, chances are that he will never see his family again. I would say that is a sentence in itself."""

The original explanation of the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks on the U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya, was written by CIA officials, then revised by State Department and White House officials, according to news reports and witness testimony made available to Fox News.

Removed from the CIA's so-called talking points were references to “Islamic extremists” and Al Qaeda in Libya. And five days later, Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, made the Sunday talk show rounds to say the attacks were “demonstrations” sparked by protests in Egypt over an anti-Islamic video on YouTube.

However, the video is never mentioned in the numerous talking-points drafts, according to a Weekly Standard story last week, based in part on a 43-page House report and records of official emails.

“Well, it was scrubbed,” Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Steve Lynch told “Fox News Sunday.” “It was totally inaccurate. There's no excuse for that. It was false information. And what they try to do is harmonize what happened in Benghazi with what happened everywhere else across the Middle East.”

Lynch also acknowledged the talking points were likely revised to reflect President Obama’s decry – with his re-election bid in the balance -- that “Al Qaeda is on the run.”

Maryland Democratic Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, also acknowledged Sunday the facts as told by Rice were wrong.

“At the time, as it turns out” the information was incorrect, he said on CBS’ “Face the Nation”

Ruppersberger, who was briefed by the CIA about the attacks in immediate aftermath, asked agency officials what congressional leaders could tell the public, according to The Weekly Standard story.

On Sunday, he also said he welcomes a House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee hearing this week in which Greg Hicks, the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Libya at the time of attacks, is expected to say Rice said the attacks didn’t appear to be “pre-meditated or pre-planned,” despite having information suggesting they were.

“That's what an investigation is about,” Ruppersberger told CBS. “Let's get the facts.”"

Obama, before a meeting with congressional leaders and top administration officials at the White House, said he was open to changes in a draft resolution sent to lawmakers over the weekend to authorize a strike against Syrian President Bashar Assad’s military.

He also said he was confident that Congress would ultimately support it.

“This is not Iraq, and this is not Afghanistan,” the president said. “This is a limited, proportional step that will send a clear message not only to the Assad regime but also to other countries that may be interested in testing some of these international norms that there are consequences.”

If the United States were not to act, Obama said, there is a chance that chemical weapons could be transmitted to non-state actors, posing a risk to allies such as Israel, Turkey and Jordan.

It would also, he said, send a message “that international norms around issues like nuclear proliferation don’t mean much.”

The president was meeting with leaders from the House and Senate as well as senior members of Congress’ national security committees.

Tuesday also marks the first public hearing on the administration’s plans, with Secretary of State John F. Kerry and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel set to take questions from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the afternoon.

They are also scheduled to go before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday, and other administration officials are continuing to brief lawmakers in closed settings.

The president said he was serious about congressional consultation or he would not be calling for a vote, and that he was confident lawmakers were treating the issue with the “soberness and seriousness” it deserved.

He Is An Editorial Writer Specializing In Foreign Affairs', 'Writes A Biweekly Column That Appears In Print On Mondays.']",Jackson Diehl: Obama’s dangerous passivity on Egypt on display,"There was hope a few months ago that mounting chaos in the Middle East, and a revamping of President Obama’s national security team, would prompt the president to snap out of what looked like a deepening torpor in foreign policy.

Instead, this president’s extraordinary passivity in the face of crisis may have achieved its apotheosis this week. On Wednesday, as Egyptian security forces gunned down hundreds of civilians in the streets of Cairo, an unperturbed Obama shot another round of golf at Martha’s Vineyard. His deputy press secretary was left to explain to reporters that the administration remained firmly committed to not deciding whether what had happened in Egypt was a coup.

When the president finally deigned to address the crisis himself, on Thursday morning, the result was measured rhetoric — “deplorable” — accompanied by a classic half-measure: A biennial military exercise scheduled for next month will be canceled, sparing the White House some unseemly photo ops. But the deeper relationship with the Egyptian military, including $1.3 billion in annual aid, remains in place.

The crisis in Egypt has been distracting attention from the civil war in Syria, where Obama’s stubborn refusal to act has facilitated the emergence of the largest and potentially most dangerous incarnation of al-Qaeda since pre-2001 Afghanistan. Between them, Egypt and Syria prevent most people from thinking much about Yemen — except when an al-Qaeda plot to take over much of the country prompts the closure of the U.S. Embassy and a frantic-looking burst of drone strikes. And never mind Bahrain, another close U.S. ally where another autocratic regime is brutally suppressing protests this week without a peep of objection from Washington.

Obama looks like a president in full flight from a world that looks nothing like what he imagined when he took office. The president saw himself soothing U.S. relations with Muslim nations while gently extracting U.S. troops from Iraq and focusing his energy on other regions and issues: Asia; nuclear arms control; Israeli-Palestinian peace. What he got was an epochal upheaval in the very place from which he had hoped to disengage.

All presidents face the challenge of adapting to the problems they are presented with rather than those they expect. It could be argued that George W. Bush reacted to the attacks of Sept. 11 with a too-radical reshaping of his worldview and international ambitions. Obama’s response to the Arab revolutions has veered to the opposite extreme: a clinging to his overtaken priorities, coupled with a stubborn refusal to recognize that the Arab crises must be a top priority of his foreign policy.

In the last year, U.S. allies in the Middle East and Europe have marveled as Obama doggedly pursued a patently futile attempt to engage Russian strongman Vladi­mir Putin in another round of nuclear arms reduction talks even while tolerating toxic Russian intervention in Syria and rejecting his own national security team’s proposal for U.S. action. They have scratched their heads as Secretary of State John F. Kerry, with Obama’s blessing, has made the renewal of moribund Israeli-Palestinian talks his central focus while keeping a safe distance from Egypt.

Incredibly, some officials close to Kerry were arguing in recent weeks that one reason not to designate Egypt’s coup a coup was to avoid dampening the Mideast “peace process” — whose prospects for success are invisible to all outside the administration, including the Israelis and Palestinians themselves. Never mind the burning city, goes the logic; we’ve got our hands full building this Potemkin village.

The Arab revolutions demand bold initiatives from the United States and any other outside power seeking to influence their outcome. Airstrikes to break the Syrian military would have been one; a cutoff of military aid to Egypt would have been another. But in foreign policy, Obama is a president of half-measures, of endless internal debates followed by split-the-difference presidential decisions that serve no one’s strategy. Instead of an intervention in Syria that might make a difference, token shipments of arms are being sent to the rebels; instead of a decisive break with Egypt’s out-of-control generals, a pointless exercise is called off.

If there is any virtue to this record, it is that the reaction to it is reviving an internationalist wing of the Democratic Party that, by the end of the Bush administration, appeared nearly dead. Not just the usual neocons but Democratic senators such as Carl Levin and Robert Menendez are faulting Obama’s failure to act more forcefully in Syria. Not just Republicans John McCain and Lindsey Graham but the New York Times editorial board aredemanding a suspension of military aid to Egypt.

Obama may have meant to retire the doctrine of the United States as the world’s “indispensible nation.” Instead, the disastrous results of his persistent passivity may lead to its revival.

Darrell Issa revealed several new pieces of information about the Obama administration’s controversial description of the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, casting doubt that the White House mischaracterized its cause by mere accident.

“The talking points were right and then the talking points were wrong,” Issa explained in response to a question about reporting at the Weekly Standard. The CIA and Greg Hicks, who took over as Charge d’Affairs in Libya after the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens, both knew immediately that it was an attack, not a protest.

Hicks, who did not appear on the show but whose reactions were featured based on transcripts of interviews with Issa’s committee, said he was stunned by what UN Ambassador Susan Rice claimed on five different news shows on Sep. 16. When she appeared on Face the Nation, she followed an interview with the President of Libya who claimed he had “no doubt” it was a terror attack. Moments later, Amb. Rice contradicted him and claimed a spontaneous protest was more likely.

Acting Ambassador Hicks watched the Sunday shows and said he found this contradiction shocking. “The net impact of what has transpired is the spokesperson of the most powerful country in the world has basically said that the President of Libya is either a liar or doesn’t know what he’s talking about,” he accused. Hicks added, “My jaw hit the floor as I watched this…I’ve never been as embarrassed in my life, in my career as on that day.”

Hicks believes the stunning failure of diplomacy on the Sunday news shows explains why ittook the FBI three weeks to gain access to the Benghazi site. The U.S. had effectively humiliated the Libyan President on national TV. That decision, he believed, probably compromised our ability to investigate and track down those responsible.

According to Hicks, no one from the State Department contacted him about what Amb. Rice would be saying in advance. The next morning he called Beth Jones, Acting Assistant Secretary for Near East Affaris, and asked her why Amb. Rice had made the statements she had. Jones responded, “I don’t know.”

A report published Friday by the Weekly Standard suggests that State Dept. spokesperson Victoria Nuland took issue with the initial talking points and, with backing from the White House, removed any evidence of al Qaeda involvement and of prior attacks on western targets in the region. According to emails reviewed by the Weekly Standard, Nuland said her superiors (unnamed) were concerned about criticism from Congress."

Rep. Frank Wolf (R-VA) has introduced legislation to create a special select committee to investigate both the terrorist attack and subsequent actions by President Barack Obama’s administration and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s State Department. Wolf’s bill has 161 co-sponsors. House GOP Leadership has not scheduled a vote on the bill.

Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX) plans to harness the support for Wolf’s bill into a “discharge petition” that would force a floor vote on the bill. The petition would need to be signed by 218 members of the House.

“I’m going to describe what a discharge petition is because a lot of people have asked me questions exactly what it is,” Stockman said at the Tuesday press conference outside the U.S. Capitol building. “It’s to ask our leadership or actually demand from our leadership that we have a vote on Frank Wolf’s bill. [Wolf is] a congressman from Virginia who has a long history of being here and is articulate in demanding that we have an independent investigation.”

Stockman added, while gesturing to blown up photographs behind him of the four Americans murdered in Benghazi, “if Congress is silenced,” then “the blood of these folks behind us is on our hands.”

“We can’t be silent any more,” he said. “It’s been a year going by that we haven’t had justice. These folks demand justice. They cry out for justice. Silence is not an option any more. We’re going to challenge them. We’re going to have a discharge petition. I encourage you to contact your congressman to sign the discharge petition.”

Stockman expects most or all of the 161 members on Wolf’s bill to support the discharge petition, and at the press conference specifically said House Homeland Security Committee chairman Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) is supportive of circumventing House Leadership via the discharge petition.

Retired U.S. Air Force Col. Dick Brauer, the founder of Special Operations Speaks, said the combination of Wolf’s bill and Stockman’s discharge petition “would be done to fully investigate, something that has not been done to date, the national tragedy in Benghazi, where we lost four great citizens in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012.”

“You will hear this from me and others today but we need your help and your friends’ help and everybody else’s to make this happen because it’s our one chance to do something before the anniversary of that tragedy which will occur about seven weeks from now,” Brauer said.

At the press conference, Brauer’s group unrolled an enormous scroll of a petition that includes the signatures of about a thousand special forces veterans joining the call for this investigation. “What you see on my left is a one of a kind. I don’t think it’s ever been done before: a four-foot-by-sixty-foot copy of the Special Operations Speaks petition that we sent to the House of Representatives on the Eighth of April asking for this select committee with subpoena power,” Brauer said. “The scroll is signed by nearly 1,000 special operations veterans, from the rank of Lieutenant General Three Stars down to every other rank you can imagine, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, all of them passionate about what we’re trying to do.”

Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX), a congressman who supports the discharge petition, said at the press conference that he was asked by a reporter recently about Benghazi: “Gee, that was so long ago. Do we really want to pursue this now?”

“I told the reporter that when I was a judge handling felony cases, I had defendants ask me that question – ‘that was so long ago, do we really need to get into all this now?’ I can tell you when the blood of American patriots cries out, when the blood of individuals who were sent there into harm’s way, knowing how dangerous it was in Benghazi, and especially two former SEALs who were even told to ‘Stand Down’ but they wouldn’t have it,” Gohmert said. “They went to save lives and that’s exactly what they did. They even recruited another State Department man, a former army ranger, to go up there on the rooftop with them. What they knew from the first moment mortars were fired was that this was an organized, well-prepared attack on our people. We need to get to the bottom of it. Their blood cries out for that.”

Former Florida Republican Rep. Allen West concurred with the others there, adding: “If it’s more important to some people in Washington, D.C., to protect President Obama and to protect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, I say shame on you. Every single member of the United States House of Representatives should have their name on this discharge petition. If their name is not on that discharge petition, you are complicit in this cover-up of what happened.”

Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy said that if the truth is not uncovered in Benghazi, a terrorist attack like it is likely to happen again. “I believe that this is not likely to be an isolated incident,” Gaffney said at the press conference “If we don’t learn the lessons of what happened in Benghazi, how we got to there, what we did on the occasion and what has happened in the aftermath, you can be sure there will be other Americans who end with the same fate.”

Bob Adams, the president and founder of grassroots group Revive America which has been rallying members of Congress behind the calls for a real investigation into Benghazi, placed the blame for the lack of a real investigation at the feet of House GOP leadership.

“When Revive America first joined this fight back in March, only 48 House Republicans had mustered the courage to stand as cosponsors of this bill,” Adams said. “Frankly, the level of support at that time was an embarrassment. But over the next several weeks, after thousands of Americans had deluged Congress with a flood of phone calls, emails and personal visits, support for the House Select Committee soared to what is today 161 cosponsors. That’s over two thirds of all House Republicans.”

“But today only one person really stands in the way of a full and public investigation of the 9/11 terrorist attack in Benghazi. It’s not President Obama. It’s really not even Hillary Rodham Clinton, or Eric Holder. That one person is none other than House Speaker John Boehner.”"

Pollak'],Benghazi 9/11–What Difference It Made,"As Americans pause today to remember the trauma–and heroism–of September 11, 2001, we have a new reason to commemorate the day: the embassy attacks of September 11, 2012. A year later, there have been no arrests and no responses. Those responsible for neglecting embassy security have been restored, while those who raised concerns are still suffering. And the leaders most responsible pretend nothing happened.

The story of how President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have escaped accountability for what happened in Benghazi, Libya and in Cairo, Egypt a year ago today is one of the great political escapes, and one of the great media scandals, of our history. “What difference does it make?” Clinton railed in January. The difference is profound indeed, both for the dead and the nation as a whole.

The political consequences were decisive. What should have happened is that the media should have asked what President Obama was doing that evening, why he was not in touch with his top national security advisers throughout the evening, why he flew to Las Vegas for a fundraiser the next day, why the Secretary denied security to Benghazi, and why her officials were apologetic as crowds stormed the Cairo embassy.

Instead, the media pounced on Mitt Romney’s response late that night, which addressed the Cairo debacle and was issued before the nation knew about the Benghazi deaths. This was to be the latest of Romney’s alleged “gaffes”–none of which were incorrect, and all of which pale in comparison to the incompetence on display a year later in Obama’s response to Syria’s crossing of the chemical weapons “red line.”

Obama and Clinton concocted one of the most audacious lies ever told by an American leader–that the attacks were a reaction to an obscure anti-Islamic video made by a Christian in the U.S. Essentially, he offered fellow Americans to the enemy as scapegoats. When the story unraveled, Obama pretended to have said all along that Benghazi had been a terror attack–another lie, eagerly defended by the media.

Meanwhile, the filmmaker responsible for the video was jailed on an unrelated parole violation–a craven concession to the Muslim Brotherhood–while the terrorists themselves lounged in Libya, secure in the knowledge that Obama was in no rush to pursue them or to deal with the mess that U.S. intervention had left behind.

The collapse of the U.S. deterrent in Syria today began with Egypt and Libya a year ago.

That, ultimately, is the most important difference that Benghazi made. It showed that America is willing to abandon its own citizens to the barbaric, unabashed violence of our enemies. The culpability goes beyond Obama and extends to the Beltway media and political classes–including those Republicans who resist a full inquiry into the events of September 11, 2012, which ignored the warnings and lessons of the first 9/11.

The consequence is that Americans are less safe–as are people around the world who face the violence of tyrants and terrorists alike. Those who, like President Obama, exhort Americans not to turn away from the children of Syria (despite ignoring children killed there by conventional weapons for over two years) should consider what their own indifference to American lives has contributed to our nation’s new impotence."

According to these outlets, the spy agency has gone out of its way to keep the information from the public through intimidation of CIA personnel.

Four Americans were killed, including U.S. ambassador Christopher Stevens that evening in Benghazi almost one year ago.

In light of this new information, either the Congress’ “Gang of Eight” knew about the operation and misled the public about what they knew, or the Obama administration may have been conducting an unauthorized gun-running operation. Fox News reported in October of 2012 about a Libyan ship, reportedly containing weapons for Syrian Rebels that may have been tied into the attack against the consulate and the CIA annex:

Through shipping records, Fox News has confirmed that the Libyan-flagged vessel Al Entisar, which means “The Victory,” was received in the Turkish port of Iskenderun — 35 miles from the Syrian border — on Sept. 6, just five days before Ambassador Chris Stevens, information management officer Sean Smith and former Navy Seals Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty were killed during an extended assault by more than 100 Islamist militants. On the night of Sept. 11, in what would become his last known public meeting, Stevens met with the Turkish Consul General Ali Sait Akin, and escorted him out of the consulate front gate one hour before the assault began at approximately 9:35 p.m. local time. Although what was discussed at the meeting is not public, a source told Fox News that Stevens was in Benghazi to negotiate a weapons transfer, an effort to get SA-7 missiles out of the hands of Libya-based extremists. And although the negotiation said to have taken place may have had nothing to do with the attack on the consulate later that night or the Libyan mystery ship, it could explain why Stevens was travelling in such a volatile region on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.

According to section 503’s Presidential Approval and Reporting of Covert Actions in the 1947 National Security Act, the President may not authorize covert CIA actions without informing the intelligence committees of Congress.

Legislation implemented in 1980 gave the president the authority to limit advance notification of especially sensitive covert actions to eight Members of Congress–the “Gang of Eight”: the chairmen and ranking minority Members of the two congressional intelligence committees, the Speaker and minority leader of the House, and Senate majority and minority leaders. These members are: House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI), Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-MD), Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), Sen. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-GA).

By law, such a covert weapons operation in Benghazi should have been known by all eight members. The disastrous results from the events of September 11, 2012 have not made it easy to get answers from these lawmakers regarding this point.

Many remember when Pelosi, a “Gang of Eight” member, found herself at odds with the Democratic base in 2009 and ridiculed by Republicans, when it was revealed she was actually briefed in 2002 by the Bush White House about the administration’s tactic to water-board terrorism suspects during interrogations. Pelosi denied this fact previously.

Radio host Laura Ingraham asked Boehner on January 24 about Senator Rand Paul’s questioning to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. He asked if the secretary was aware of U.S. involvement in the procuring of weapons that were transferred, bought or sold to Turkey out of Libya. Clinton, seemingly confused, told Paul “nobody [had] ever raised” the issue with her before.

Boehner replied to Ingraham, “I’m somewhat familiar with the chatter about this and the fact that these arms were moving towards Turkey, but most of what I know about this came from a classified source and I really can’t elaborate on it.”

Boehner has refuses to appoint a House Select Committee to investigate the Benghazi attacks and previously refused to support a joint Select Committee to do the same late last year.

Four members of the “Gang of Eight” have told Breitbart News over the past six months they knew nothing about any CIA operation in Benghazi involving the smuggling of Libyan weapons into Turkey that may have been shipped to Syrian rebels, some of whom were affiliated to al-Qaeda groups.

“I get to see all of that stuff. I have seen nothing that would allow me to conclude that the U.S. government was in any way shape or form involved in gun running in Libya. I looked at it all,” said Congressman Rogers, Chairman of the House Select Intelligence Committee to Breitbart News in June.

“If it’s there, I have not seen it. I think I would have found it. I think there were some other things that were happening and people got confused, but the United States government was not running guns (from the annex).”

Senator Chambliss, ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, when asked in February if he knew anything about the gunrunning issue Senator Paul asked Clinton about a month earlier replied to Breitbart News, “I’m not familiar with that.”

Senator Feinstein, Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told Breitbart News in March she “didn’t know what” Senator Paul was talking about in regards to his questioning of Clinton and the Secretary’s knowledge about the gunrunning issue in Benghazi.

Ranking member of the House Intel Committee Rep. Ruppersberger claimed to Breitbart News in May he “didn’t know anything” about U.S. weapons smuggling or if Ambassador Stevens was involved in the operation in anyway, saying, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

Ruppersberger, added, “If I was [privy to such information], I couldn’t talk to you about it. But I have heard no information about what you’re talking about, as far as what [Ambassador Chris Stevens] was there for. I haven’t had briefings on it.”

Ruppersberger also said he knew “nothing about” any U.S. operation to smuggle weapons to Syrian rebels, explaining the secretive “Gang of Eight” briefings from the White House do not go into much detail sometimes.

“I’ve heard nothing about it. When [Stevens] was there. I don’t know. We don’t get to that minutia sometimes. Gang of 8, we get the most sensitive information, that even our own committees can’t [get.]

When asked if the White House would have had to inform the eight members of such an operation in order for it to be legal Ruppersberger responded, “No. The checks and balances is they give us information–very sensitive information. The check and balance issue, they don’t have to tell us everything or we’d be sitting having Gang of Eight briefings all day long. That’s the answer. I don’t know.”"

It was a reversal for CBS News, which played a key role in the Benghazi cover-up in 2012.

A year ago, CBS News released a previously unaired clip of an interview for 60 Minutes with President Barack Obama on Sep. 12, the day after the Benghazi attack, in which the president suggests clearly that the attack on the U.S. consulate was premeditated. The interview contradicted Obama’s subsequent claims that the attack had been a response to an anti-Islam YouTube video, repeated to the public for several days.

CBS News had withheld that portion of the Sep. 12 interview until Oct. 19, choosing instead to release a portion in which Obama criticized rival Mitt Romney’s condemnation of the administration’s response to events–a repeated theme as the media helped Obama deflect responsibility. Romney had attacked the White House’s apology for the video during the attack on the Cairo embassy, not knowing of the deaths in Libya.

After the election, Kroft continued to insist that there was “no information that anything’s been covered up” by the media or the Obama administration about the Benghazi attacks. That statement was wrong based on what was known at the time, and looks even worse today, after whistleblowers testified to Congress earlier this year they were pressured by Clinton’s chief of staff not to cooperate with congressional investigators.

Logan’s investigation featured an interview with one of those whistleblowers, Greg Hicks, who had been the deputy to slain U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens. Logan also interviewed “Morgan Jones” (pseudonym), a former British soldier who had been advising the U.S. on security in Benghazi and had warned the State Department that Libyan guards being trained to guard the compound were not up to the job.

Morgan’s warnings came to fruition on Sep. 11, 2012, when he saw the guards disperse after being told by the attackers: “We’re here to kill Americans, not Libyans.” Morgan did what little he could to stop the attack. A second attack at the CIA Annex was partly fought off by a small group that saved five American lives and has since, Logan reported, earned “the Distinguished Service Cross and the Navy Cross” for its bravery.

Yet the Obama administration did not send any assistance throughout the night, and is thought to have issued a stand-down order to prevent any intervention. What Logan’s report makes clear is that there is no way that President Obama or his Secretary of State could plausibly claim that a YouTube video had inspired a spontaneous act of violence on that scale against the U.S. consulate, the CIA annex and their personnel.

That story was a lie when it was told–and it was a lie aided and abetted by the mainstream media, including CBS News and 60 Minutes, which could have exploded the administration’s YouTube video alibi even as Obama and Clinton were telling it to the families of the victims, to the voting public, and to the world. The Sunday night report is commendable, but as an attempt to atone for malpractice, it is far too little, too late."

During her Senate testimony, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that approximately 25 Americans who were on the ground or who witnessed the terrorist attack in Benghazi were immediately evacuated. Secretary Clinton also revealed that neither she, nor her senior people, debriefed or spoke with those people immediately after the attack, or for months afterward, to understand what happened. She stated that she didn't want to be later accused of playing politics.

When I questioned her about the misinformation disseminated for days by the administration, most notably by Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice on Sunday news programs five days after the attack, she asked, ""What difference does it make?""

If you don't expeditiously debrief the people who witnessed the attack, how can you understand who initiated it, what weapons they used and who may have been involved? How do you initiate a proper response if you don't know what transpired? How do you move properly to protect other American assets and people in the region? How do you know what failures occurred, so that you can immediately correct them, if you have not debriefed the very victims of those failures? And lastly, how do you tell the truth to the American people if you don't know the facts?

Our diplomatic forces in Benghazi were denied the security they repeatedly requested for many months before Sept. 11, 2012. Secretary Clinton stated that she was not told of those desperate requests in the most dangerous region in the world. As a result, our people in Benghazi were ill-prepared to repel or avoid that attack, and four Americans were murdered. For many days after the event, the American people were also misinformed as to the nature and perpetrators of that attack.

In truth, Benghazi is a failure of leadership — before, during and after the terrorist attack.

To answer Secretary Clinton, it does make a difference. It matters enormously for the American public to know whether or not their president and members of his administration are on top of a crisis and telling them the truth.

Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., is a member of the Foreign Relations Committee."

Draft ""talking points"" obtained by The Weekly Standard and ABC News depicted efforts by State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland in the days after the attack to strip out references to prior attacks in Benghazi. According to the excerpts, she argued that the administration should not give Congress ammunition to ""beat up"" on her department.

During a press conference Monday, President Obama even acknowledged that the country now knows that ""clearly (the staff in Benghazi) were not in a position where they were adequately protected.""

A review of now-public State Department records as well as a classified State Department cable, first reviewed and reported by Fox News, shows a steady stream of documented warnings to Washington from intelligence and State security officials on the ground in Libya that the Islamist threat was severe and growing.

One of the most significant warnings was an August 2012 State Department classified cable, which has not been made public, that summarized an emergency meeting in Benghazi where the CIA briefed on the significant threat of terrorist activity.

More On This...

The cable, sent under Ambassador Chris Stevens' signature and marked SECRET, warned the office of Secretary of State Clinton that the CIA advised ""ten Islamist militias and AQ training camps (were) within Benghazi.""

The cable also warned that the 17 February Brigade, the group charged with protecting the consulate, appeared to be compromised. It said ""requests to provide a daily police presence have gone unanswered,"" adding there was also a ""lack of host nation security support to the US mission.""

In addition to identifying the presence of Al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia in Benghazi, the groups ultimately blamed for the assault, a key section of the cable, which remains classified, seemed to foreshadow the attack itself.

""RSO (Regional Security Officer) expressed concerns with the ability to defend Post in the event of a coordinated attack due to limited manpower, security measures, weapons capabilities, host nation support, and the overall size of the compound,"" it said.

During congressional hearings in January, Clinton was asked whether she had seen the cable by Republican Rep. Michael McCaul. Clinton said she had no knowledge of the warning which former diplomatic security agents have told Fox News amounted to a ""cry for help.""

""Congressman, that cable did not come to my attention,"" Clinton testified before the House Foreign Affairs committee. ""I have made it very clear that the security cable did not come to my attention or above the assistant secretary level where the ARB (Accountability Review Board) placed responsibility where, as I think, Ambassador Pickering said the rubber hit the road.""

In February, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham followed up on the classified cable.

After the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed he knew about the cable which summarized the August emergency meeting in Benghazi, Graham questioned why the military was read in when Clinton apparently was not.

Gen. Martin Dempsey responded: ""Well, I don't know that she didn't know about the cable.""

Graham said: ""She said she didn't. Are you stunned that she didn't?""

Dempsey said: ""I would call myself surprised that she didn't.""

In addition to attacks in Benghazi on the British ambassador -- which forced the temporary closure of the U.K. operation -- the International Red Cross and United Nations, in the summer of 2012 the group Ansar al-Sharia was so well-established it held an annual conference in Benghazi to promote Islamic law.

Records released by the House oversight committee, including a report from the regional security officer, also documented more than 200 cases of violence in Libya in the year leading up to the attack, specifically between June 2011 and July 2012. Another security review, on June 25, 2012, reported a spike in violence with ""foreigners also increasingly targeted.""

While much has been made of the State Department's failure to respond to repeated security requests for extra help, a former diplomatic security agent and 20-year veteran of the department, who reviewed the publicly available documents on the condition of anonymity, told Fox News the multiple warnings present a compelling argument that State Department leadership was negligent.

The State Department, in a document put out last week, noted that while an internal review found certain senior officials ""demonstrated a lack of proactive leadership and management ability"" in response to security concerns, there was no specific finding of misconduct."

A %242.2 million OAS study says marijuana legalization should be considered

A U.S. spokesman called legalization %27not viable%27

The report said there was %27no significant support%27 for legalization of cocaine

LIMA, Peru (AP) — An Organization of American States study released Friday is calling for a serious discussion on legalizing marijuana.

Drug policy reform advocates called the report historic, even though it made no specific proposals and said there was ""no significant support"" among the OAS' 35 member states for legalizing cocaine, the drug that most directly affects South America.

""This is the first time any multilateral organization anywhere has done something like this,"" said Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance.

The $2.2 million study was commissioned in response to calls by some Latin American leaders at last year's Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, for a rethinking of the war on drugs. Reform advocates call the more than $20 billion that Washington has spent on counterdrug efforts in Latin America over the past decade a damaging waste of taxpayer money.

""Sooner or later decisions in this area will need to be taken,"" says the study, which was presented by outgoing OAS Secretary-General Jose Miguel Insulza in Bogota.

The study examines four different scenarios for confronting the illicit drug trade, which has fueled violent crime and corruption, especially in drug production and transit countries, including destabilizing governments.

The most controversial scenario would involve countries unilaterally abandoning the fight against drug production and trafficking in their territory in order to reduce violence.

President Otto Perez Molina of Guatemala, a hard-hit cocaine transit country along with neighboring Honduras, made headlines before the Cartagena summit when he said he was tempted to put his country on such a path.

The report's authors conclude, however, ""that there is no absolute link between the drug problem and the insecurity experienced by many citizens in the Americas.""

Accompanying Insulza on Friday was Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, whose country remains the No. 1 source of cocaine consumed by U.S. citizens.

Santos said the report presented ""simple, realistic options"" for future action in order to ""reduce the deaths, the violence that drug trafficking wreaks, the consumption of drugs and the profits of criminals.""

The 400-page study emphasizes drug abuse as primarily a public health issue and suggests drug abusers should not be criminally prosecuted but rather treated as ill.

""Decriminalization of drug use needs to be considered as a core element in any public health strategy,"" it says.

That echoes the approach of the U.S. government. But it diverges from Washington's longstanding opposition to legalizing marijuana despite the fact that voters in two states — Colorado and Washington — have done that.

Nadelmann said the U.S. government has in the past suppressed any multilateral attempt to promote discussion of alternatives to the current drug war.

""The notion that the OAS would actually convene 50 people, including a number of my allies and people associated with reform, and then have this open-ended discussion and then produce a report that was not subject to intensive political review and censorship is actually extraordinary,"" he said from New York.

Rafael Lemaitre, spokesman for the White House's drug czar, said in response to the report that ""any suggestion that nations legalize drugs like heroin, cocaine, marijuana, and methamphetamine runs counter to an evidenced-based, public health approach to drug policy and are not viable alternatives.""

The report was released two weeks before Guatemala hosts the OAS General Assembly, where the subject of drugs tops the agenda.

Nadelmann said the report reflects to a large degree of interest in Latin America with voter-driven marijuana legalization in the United States.

Uruguay's president, Jose Mujica, is pushing marijuana legalization and wants to put the government in charge of sales.

Other findings of the study:

—Drug abuse is the 15th direct cause of death in the OAS' northern countries, 40th in Andean countries and 52nd in Central America. That supports arguments that the United States and Canada bear more responsibility for illicit drug demand.

— Retail sales of illicit drugs account for 65% of drug profits, while farmers or producers get 1%."

USATODAY

War is expensive, and no one wants to risk American lives by fighting on the cheap. But in Afghanistan, the U.S. government's open checkbook has too often produced the sort of wasteful spending that can undermine public support for the war.

In the nearly 12-year-long fight, American taxpayers have spent nearly $93 billion on ""reconstruction,"" which includes everything from building schools to equipping the Afghan military and securing the government. That's about the same amount the U.S. government is spending this year on domestic highways, airports and other transportation projects.

How much of the Afghan spending has been wasted is unknown, but examples uncovered by John Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, suggest that the amounts are substantial.

Some would be comical if they weren't so infuriating:

The Defense Department built a 64,000-square-foot, $34 million headquarters building in southwestern Afghanistan, even though a Marine commander said he didn't want or need it. The building has never been occupied and will likely be torn down without ever being used.

The Pentagon is spending more than $770 million to buy 18 Swiss turboprop planes and 30 Russian helicopters for Afghanistan's counternarcotics and counterterrorism air wing, despite a shortage of Afghan pilots capable of flying the aircraft and mechanics who can maintain them.

The Defense Department spent $11.5 million to build four incinerators for solid waste at a key U.S. military base. Sopko found that the two largest incinerators were not being used; instead, solid waste was being burned in an open pit, worsening the already bad air quality at the base.

U.S. officials hired an Afghan contractor so inept that the courthouse he built was unusable. The same contractor is bidding to, yes, tear the building down.

Other examples of mismanagement are anything but amusing:

The Pentagon hired Afghan contractors to install ""culvert-denial systems"" to stop the Taliban from planting explosive devices inside the culverts underneath roadways where U.S. troops travel. But contract officers rarely bothered to check on the work. The Afghan contractors often installed the grates incorrectly or not at all, contributing to the deaths of least two U.S. soldiers .

Despite repeated complaints, American contracts and money are going to about 60 Afghan contractors with ties to al-Qaeda or the Taliban, which means U.S. taxpayers could be helping to fund the enemy.

The Pentagon agrees with some of Sopko's findings but disputes others. Officials say the unneeded building, for example, represented $13 million of a $34 million contract. There's a plan to train pilots and mechanics for the helicopters and turboprops. The officials say they take oversight seriously and work hard at it.

If so, there's room for improvement. Afghanistan is unquestionably a tough place to operate — with a harsh security environment and often unreliable allies. But that's no excuse for serial breakdowns in basic planning, oversight and accountability. Who, for example, signed off on that unused building? The Defense Department can't say.

Congress has a role here, too, of course, because the appropriators provide the money in the first place, often in such great gobs that it seems no politician wants to be accused of having lost the war by giving the Pentagon too little.

Americans might think this will all be moot when U.S. troops leave Afghanistan next year, but not so fast: The spending in Afghanistan is set to go on long after the troops come home. If Pentagon officials expect continued backing for such spending, they'll have to do a better job of keeping it from going down a rat hole.

Bloomberg's Zara Kessler says it's ok to indulge in some fleeting moment of excitement and happiness (and puts a moment of perspective into the story):



Yes, there are many other news stories -- an earthquake in China, Israeli-Palestinian talks and the Trayvon Martin fall-out are all featured on the Guardian's home page -- that deserve far more attention. There are also news stories that deserve far less. But few stories are so universally happy and stand to produce so many winners. The British economy may cash in on what the New York Times dubbed a ""Royal Baby Boomlet,"" as people buy souvenirs and celebratory alcohol. Other babies born today will be eligible for one of 2,013 silver coins from the Royal Mint. A thousand people passing through London's Heathrow airport will receive free swag. Niagara Falls, CN Tower in Toronto and various attractions in New Zealand will glow blue this evening

.

England has a new prince, one who may one day be king. More important, a family not blind to scrutiny and controversy and tragedy has a son, a grandson, a great-grandson.

So indulge your inner Royalist and take a few moments to celebrate. Odds are higher than 2:1 that the tensions in the Middle East will wait for you to put away your Union Jack.

For a quarter century now, the Republican Party has suppressed its own instincts, refusing to nominate candidates who dared to give full voice to the sentiments of its base, refusing to surrender to that temptation. The result has been a series of lackluster nominees -- Bush, Dole, Bush, McCain, Romney -- that time and again left the party faithful disappointed in themselves for compromising. Ted Cruz, on the other hand, is their giant box of Godiva chocolates at a Weight Watchers convention, their open bottle of Jim Beam at an AA meeting. He's the bad boy tempting them to throw away all restraint, the one whispering in their ear all the things they want to hear and believe. And if they succumb, he's going to leave them fat, drunk and pregnant.

Now let’s be clear. Cruz would lose. Clinton would destroy him. Oh, maybe we’ll have an economic meltdown in September 2016, and unemployment on Election Day will be 9 percent; or maybe someone will learn that Bill has been doing something extracurricular that shocks even longtime Bill-watchers. But barring those two circumstances, she’ll crush him like a grape. Remember where you read it: If 2016 pits Clinton against Cruz, the Democrats will carry Georgia. Yes, Georgia (last carried by her husband in 1992, but not 1996). Under normal conditions, Cruz can’t possibly top 165 electoral votes against her. Even against Martin O’Malley, his various paths lead to 235, 240. And this brings us to the interesting question my liberal pals and I have been discussing, more interesting than the question of Cruz’s chances of becoming president, which are near nil. From our point of view, would Cruz-as-nominee be a good or bad thing? The “good” case is much along the lines I laid out above, although it goes further: Yes, he’d be creamed; and then, after having lost three elections in a row, and the popular vote in seven out of the last eight, the Republicans would finally return to some measure of sanity. This is the Cruz-as-Robespierre theory: he’d take things so far that nearly everyone would say, “OK, we’ve gone a little far, and we’re sick of losing, so let’s tack toward the center and change a few positions” (path to citizenship, same-sex marriage, etc.).Thermidor would set in.

In an ordinary criminal case, the adversarial process assures legal representation of the defendant. Clearly, in top-secret cases involving potential surveillance targets, a lawyer cannot, in the conventional sense, represent the target. Congress could, however, authorize the FISA judges to appoint, from time to time, independent lawyers with security clearances to serve “pro bono publico” — for the public’s good — to challenge the government when an application for a FISA order raises new legal issues. [...] Having lawyers challenge novel legal assertions in these secret proceedings would result in better judicial outcomes. Even if the government got its way all or most of the time, the court would have more fully developed its reasons for letting it do so. Of equal importance, the appointed lawyer could appeal a decision in the government’s favor to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review — and then to the Supreme Court. No opportunity for such review exists today, because only the government can appeal a FISA court ruling."

An unruly line of shoving and jostling shoppers was waiting to enter the store in a Caracas shopping district, where prices had been cut in half — by government decree — on refrigerators, washers, stoves and TVs. Fights broke out as customers tried to force their way to the head of the line.

“I’m afraid they are going to attack the store. There’s a lot of aggression, because they think we are hiding products in the warehouse,” said the salesman, Rafael Garcia. “People are desperate because they have been in line for five hours, but we’re only letting five people in at a time.”

Desperation shopping has been common in Venezuela in recent days, since President Nicolas Maduro’s move to force shop owners to cut prices on appliances and electronics. Maduro, the handpicked heir to the late leftist leader Hugo Chavez, has become increasingly aggressive — heavy-handed, say many economists — as he struggles to shore up a sinking economy.

Since his election as president in April, the month after Chavez died, Maduro has been forced to confront the fact that his predecessor — popular for socialist initiatives that eased the burdens of the poor — left the Venezuelan economy in shambles.

Things have been worsening rapidly since then. The inflation rate hovers at 54%, and nearly 1 in 4 food items on the government’s list of basic goods i considered scarce.

Venezuela may have reaped $750 billion in oil revenue since 1999, but its government is low on cash and has been forced to take on an increasing amount of debt, including more than $35 billion in advances from China secured by oil sales. An official of the International Monetary Fund said recently that Venezuela’s current economic path was unsustainable.

Maduro, a former bus driver with little formal education, lacks Chavez’s political skills and charisma. He and his supporters blame outside pressures, even sabotage, for the problems. The United States is high on their list of culprits. More-conservative economists and politicians say Chavez and Maduro created the mess themselves.

Meanwhile, the Venezuelan people are left to cope.

Outside Garcia’s establishment, butcher and Maduro supporter Ramiro Canizares was loading a freezer onto his truck. He had bought it at a neighboring store, but the discount was disappointingly low, only 5% off the previously listed price. At 17,000 bolivars, the Venezuelan currency, it would have been about $2,800 at the official exchange rate — but was only $290 at the more commonly used black market rate.

“I thought I better buy it now because after this chaos it will be difficult to buy anything at all,” Canizares said. Despite his support for the president, he is, like many Venezuelans, angry about the country’s economic disarray.

Three miles to the east, salesman Miguel Higuera at the Pablo Electronic store faced a crowd of frenzied buyers by himself. The owner had decided not to come in for fear of being arrested for price gouging.

Just a few days before, Higuera explained, the shop owner had jacked up prices by 150% to reflect the devaluation of the bolivar. Since January, the Venezuelan currency has lost 90% of its value on the unofficial market, the benchmark used by most retailers. “Even though he has since lowered prices, he’s afraid the government will now seize all our inventory,” the salesman said.

That fear is a reflection of Maduro’s increasingly hands-on management of the economy. In a Nov. 8 speech, he said his government would set legal limits on business’ profit margins in a bid to, in one observer’s phrase, “prohibit inflation.” On Thursday, the Chavista-controlled National Assembly voted to give him expanded powers to do that.

He also ordered the military to take over the Daka electronics chain and slash prices by as much as 25%.

“Nothing should be left at Daka,” Maduro said.

In addition to appliance stores, Maduro announced that government auditors would soon fan out across the country to examine the books of car dealers and shops selling auto parts, hardware and apparel. The Aldo shoe store chain cut its prices in half, anticipating government intervention.

Spared from the new controls are prices of basic foods, which have been set by the government since shortly after Chavez took office in 1999.

Those price controls, on chicken, rice, cooking oil and other items, won favor with the poor but drove many food companies out of business. As a result, the government now must import 70% of all basic foods, said Alejandro Arreaza, an economist with Barclays in New York. Even so, scarcities persist because of inefficiency and corruption.

The controls, combined with the chilling effect of government takeovers of hundreds of companies, farms and ranches, have made Venezuela’s economy among the least productive in the hemisphere, said economist Jose Manuel Puente, now a visiting fellow at Oxford University.

Puente and others are warning that more government intervention will only further weaken Venezuela’s private sector, discourage investment and accelerate unofficial devaluation.

The bolivar traded this week at 68 to the dollar on the black market, compared with the official rate of 6.3. In April, it had traded for 22 to the dollar.

Dan Hellinger, a political science professor at Webster University in St . Louis, is more sympathetic to Maduro. He said Venezuela’s problems were not all the current government’s doing and that analysts “ought not to simply dismiss Maduro’s claims of sabotage.”

Maduro has charged, among other things, that unspecified “right-wingers” were behind widespread power outages over the summer.

“Venezuela’s economy is being buffeted by both political and macroeconomic sources, and not enough attention is being paid to the former,” Hellinger said. “The opposition and the [business] owners feel that the government is on the ropes, and they would like to make the situation worse, and there is little doubt in my mind that the U.S. has the same intention.”

In the face of growing economic disorder this week, Maduro stepped up his accusations against opposition politicians, describing three opposition leaders as the “trilogy of evil” and threatening to jail opposition lawmaker Miguel Cocchiola, owner of a lumber business, whom Maduro labeled a thief.

“The government is facing a triple crisis,” said Javier Corrales, a professor at Amherst College. “The economy continues to deteriorate, there is rising social unrest, and Maduro’s popularity, never high, has dropped almost 7 points since the summer to 40%.... There is a strategic calculus behind the government’s decision to turn more repressive.”

On Thursday morning, a recurring scene played out at the Unicasa supermarket in the Montalban section of Caracas, where shoppers had waited two hours for chicken to appear on the shelves.

“People turned into savages, grabbing what they could,” one shopper said, adding that she thought Maduro’s latest measures were a means of distracting the public from the true severity of food shortages.

WASHINGTON —

Americans are divided over whether to believe the White House on controversies over the Libyan attack that killed a U.S. ambassador and the Internal Revenue Service targeting of Tea Party groups, but they overwhelmingly agree on this: The furors are going to make it more difficult for President Obama to get things done in his second term.

A USA TODAY poll conducted by Princeton Survey Research finds nearly three of four Americans say the controversies will make it harder for the president to accomplish his goals; nearly a third say they will make it much harder. Just one in five believe they won't have an impact.

The nationwide poll, taken Thursday through Sunday, finds skepticism about some of Obama's explanations of what happened. A 53% majority say the IRS decision to single out conservative groups for extra scrutiny before granting tax-exempt status was made for political reasons, something the administration flatly denies. By 50%-44%, they say Obama deserves at least a little of the blame, though the White House says he didn't know about it until the scandal was in the news.

On the other hand, even more of those surveyed are cynical about why Republicans are pursuing investigations into the attack last fall that left U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans dead. Six in 10 say Republicans are holding hearings on it more to score political points against the Democrats and Obama than to find ways to prevent future attacks. Even a third of Republicans say the hearings are driven by politics.

""With the Republicans clearly in a posture of driving a political agenda, there's a lot of risk for them, just as there's risk for the president,"" says Tad Devine, a Democratic strategist who was among a group that met with White House chief of staff Denis McDonough last week to discuss how the administration should move forward.

GOP pollster David Winston, an adviser to House Speaker John Boehner, points to the inclination by Americans to allot some of the blame for the IRS scandal to Obama. ""It means they aren't buying the Pfeiffer narrative,"" he says. Senior White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer on five TV talk shows Sunday said the president hadn't known about the targeting of conservative groups and acted appropriately when he learned of it.

Winston acknowledged GOP problems, too: ""The public is looking at what's going on and says neither one of them is doing what's needed to address the problem.""

The issues don't seem to be going away anytime soon.

Four congressional committees and the Justice Department are investigating the IRS. Douglas Shulman, a Bush appointee who headed the IRS during most of the questionable actions, is to testify today before the Senate Finance Committee and Wednesday before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Finance Chairman Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat, and ranking Republican Orrin Hatch of Utah on Monday sent outgoing IRS commissioner Steven Miller a letter with 41 detailed questions about what transpired in the agency.

Pfeiffer says the controversies don't need to slow down work on other issues, including the push for an immigration overhaul.

""That's a question that only Republicans can answer,"" he said in an interview. ""Immigration continues to progress along without much attention as all these issues were unfolding last week, and it didn't seem to slow things down at all. If Republicans use these as an excuse to delay the people's business, that's one thing. If they continue to work with us, that's another.""

A BLIP OR A TURNING POINT?

Harvard professor Joseph Nye, one of the nation's leading presidential scholars, dismisses as overblown comparisons to big scandals that bedeviled previous second-term presidents, such as the Iran-contra affair during the Reagan administration. ""It's quite plausible a year from now or five years from now what we're seeing this week or two may turn out to be a blip rather than a major turning point,"" he says.

Even so, the impact is nonetheless costly for Obama, he says.

""It distracts him from other issues; obviously you've got to spend a fair amount of time on firefighting,"" says Nye, whose new book is titled Presidential Leadership and the Creation of the American Era. What's more, he says, ""in the election in 2012, you gain a certain amount of momentum which gives you a degree of authority. This chips away or undercuts that political momentum.""

The USA TODAY poll also asked about the disclosure that the Justice Department secretly had seized phone records of Associated Press reporters and editors while investigating a leak of classified information. In a showdown between the government and the news media, more than six in 10 Americans, 62%, say it is more important that the media be able to report stories they feel are in the national interest. Just 23% say it is more important that the government be able to censor news stories it feels threaten national security.

That is by far the highest level of support for the media in the 10 times the question has been asked over the past three decades in polls by Princeton Survey Research and Gallup. Only three previous times has a majority said it was more important to be able to report the story.

Those results reflect a swing by Republicans to the side of the press — possibly at least in part because doing so puts them at odds with the Democratic president. In 2006, the last time the question was asked, 53% of Republicans said it was more important that the government be able to censor news stories. Now, 53% say it's more important that the media be able to publish.

The poll of 1,002 adults by land line and cellphone has a margin of error of +/-3.6 percentage points.

Among other findings, those surveyed:

Are divided over whether the Obama administration was involved in a political coverup about the Benghazi attack; 40% see a coverup while 45% don't.

Disapprove of Obama's handling of the attack and its aftermath by 44%-37%. His critics feel more intensity about the issue: 26% strongly disapprove, compared with 16% who strongly approve.

Say the IRS action targeting conservative groups was done for political reasons, 53%-33%. Nineteen percent say Obama deserves a lot of the blame for it; 31% say just a little.

PERILS OF BIG GOVERNMENT

Nearly six in 10 say the federal government threatens their rights and freedoms, a line of attack that Boehner, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans have hammered as a theme against Obama. Fifty-eight percent call the government a threat — 35% call it a major threat, 23% a minor threat — while 37% say it's not a threat.

McConnell decried a ""culture of intimidation"" that he said linked the IRS controversy to the AP subpoena and even implementation of the Affordable Care Act, and Republicans predicted the controversies could expand as more information is uncovered. White House press secretary Jay Carney confirmed Monday that senior White House officials had been informed weeks ago about the IRS investigation but chose not to inform the president. And The Washington Post reported on its front page Monday on an aggressive investigation by the Justice Department into leaks to a Fox News Channel reporter.

""I have a hunch that a lot more is going to come out, frankly,"" Baucus, a Democrat, told Bloomberg's Capitol Gains TV program, referring to the IRS controversy. ""And I think it's important that we have the hearings, and I think that will encourage other information to come out that has not yet come out.""

So far, Americans don't seem transfixed by any of them. In a

Pew Research Center Poll,

taken at the same time in the same omnibus survey as the USA TODAY poll, one in four said they were following the IRS and Benghazi stories ""very closely""; just 16% were very closely following the story of the AP subpoenas. To compare, 30% were closely following news of the economy.

Other surveys haven't shown them hurting Obama's approval rating, at least so far. In a CNN/ORC poll taken Friday and Saturday, the president's approval rating was 53%, up 2 percentage points from the previous survey in early April. In the Gallup daily poll, Obama's approval rating Monday was 49%, in the same neighborhood it has been for a month.

""The general pattern with scandals is that the public doesn't care very much,"" says Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth who studies political scandals. ""Only the most significant scandals move the needle on approval. The pattern is a collective shrug from the public, in part because the people who pay attention to political news already have made up their minds about the president one way or another.""

That doesn't mean the controversies don't matter, he cautions. ""They clog up the news agenda and divert more of the interest of the media and the efforts of Congress into scandals and investigations instead of legislation.""

On that, Americans already agree."

Bloomberg's Zara Kessler says it's ok to indulge in some fleeting moment of excitement and happiness (and puts a moment of perspective into the story):



Yes, there are many other news stories -- an earthquake in China, Israeli-Palestinian talks and the Trayvon Martin fall-out are all featured on the Guardian's home page -- that deserve far more attention. There are also news stories that deserve far less. But few stories are so universally happy and stand to produce so many winners.

Other babies born today will be eligible for one of 2,013 silver coins from the Royal Mint. A thousand people passing through London's Heathrow airport will receive free swag. Niagara Falls, CN Tower in Toronto and various attractions in New Zealand will glow blue this evening

.

England has a new prince, one who may one day be king. More important, a family not blind to scrutiny and controversy and tragedy has a son, a grandson, a great-grandson.

So indulge your inner Royalist and take a few moments to celebrate. Odds are higher than 2:1 that the tensions in the Middle East will wait for you to put away your Union Jack.

For a quarter century now, the Republican Party has suppressed its own instincts, refusing to nominate candidates who dared to give full voice to the sentiments of its base, refusing to surrender to that temptation. The result has been a series of lackluster nominees -- Bush, Dole, Bush, McCain, Romney -- that time and again left the party faithful disappointed in themselves for compromising. Ted Cruz, on the other hand, is their giant box of Godiva chocolates at a Weight Watchers convention, their open bottle of Jim Beam at an AA meeting. He's the bad boy tempting them to throw away all restraint, the one whispering in their ear all the things they want to hear and believe. And if they succumb, he's going to leave them fat, drunk and pregnant.

Now let’s be clear. Cruz would lose. Clinton would destroy him. Oh, maybe we’ll have an economic meltdown in September 2016, and unemployment on Election Day will be 9 percent; or maybe someone will learn that Bill has been doing something extracurricular that shocks even longtime Bill-watchers. But barring those two circumstances, she’ll crush him like a grape. Remember where you read it: If 2016 pits Clinton against Cruz, the Democrats will carry Georgia. Yes, Georgia (last carried by her husband in 1992, but not 1996). Under normal conditions, Cruz can’t possibly top 165 electoral votes against her. Even against Martin O’Malley, his various paths lead to 235, 240. And this brings us to the interesting question my liberal pals and I have been discussing, more interesting than the question of Cruz’s chances of becoming president, which are near nil. From our point of view, would Cruz-as-nominee be a good or bad thing? The “good” case is much along the lines I laid out above, although it goes further: Yes, he’d be creamed; and then, after having lost three elections in a row, and the popular vote in seven out of the last eight, the Republicans would finally return to some measure of sanity. This is the Cruz-as-Robespierre theory: he’d take things so far that nearly everyone would say, “OK, we’ve gone a little far, and we’re sick of losing, so let’s tack toward the center and change a few positions” (path to citizenship, same-sex marriage, etc.).Thermidor would set in.

In an ordinary criminal case, the adversarial process assures legal representation of the defendant. Clearly, in top-secret cases involving potential surveillance targets, a lawyer cannot, in the conventional sense, represent the target. Congress could, however, authorize the FISA judges to appoint, from time to time, independent lawyers with security clearances to serve “pro bono publico” — for the public’s good — to challenge the government when an application for a FISA order raises new legal issues. [...] Having lawyers challenge novel legal assertions in these secret proceedings would result in better judicial outcomes. Even if the government got its way all or most of the time, the court would have more fully developed its reasons for letting it do so. Of equal importance, the appointed lawyer could appeal a decision in the government’s favor to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review — and then to the Supreme Court. No opportunity for such review exists today, because only the government can appeal a FISA court ruling."

http://news.yahoo.com/pentagon-chief-says-shutdown-hurts-u-credibility-allies-102856515--business.html,,[],Pentagon chief says shutdown hurts U.S. credibility with allies,"By David Alexander SEOUL (Reuters) - The U.S. government shutdown will undermine American credibility abroad and lead allies to question its commitment to treaty obligations, the U.S. defense chief warned on Tuesday as he prepared to put 400,000 civilian workers on unpaid leave. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who was visiting South Korea to celebrate the two nations' 60-year-old mutual defense treaty, said Pentagon lawyers were analyzing a new law passed by Congress to see if additional civilian workers could be spared unpaid leave. But for the moment, when the department's 800,000 civilians report to work on Tuesday, approximately half will be told they are not exempted by law from the government shutdown and asked to go home, Hagel told reporters. The Pentagon and other U.S. government agencies began to implement shutdown plans on Tuesday after Congress failed to reach a deal to fund the federal government in the new fiscal year beginning October 1. A last-minute measure passed by Congress and signed by President Barack Obama will ensure the Pentagon's 1.4 million military employees worldwide will continue to receive paychecks during the shutdown. They were required to work under prior law but would not have been paid until Congress approved funding. The new law also ensures that civilians who are required to work despite the shutdown will also be paid, Hagel said. But under law, anyone not directly involved in protecting lives and property are not considered exempt and must be placed on leave. ""Our lawyers are now looking through the (new) law that the president signed ... to see if there's any margin here or widening in the interpretation of the law regarding exempt versus non-exempt civilians,"" Hagel said. ""Our lawyers believe that maybe we can expand the exempt status."" Hagel said he didn't know how many people the department might be able to call back from leave, or how long it would take to reach a determination, but he said it was ""the priority"" in the Pentagon's general counsel's office. The shutdown has direct implications for the staff with Hagel on his week-long trip to South Korea and Japan. They are considered exempt while supporting the secretary's mission abroad, but that status may change for some when they return home on Friday, Pentagon spokesman George Little said. The U.S. defense chief said he broke away from celebrations in South Korea on Monday to discuss the shutdown by phone with Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter and Pentagon Comptroller Robert Hale. He said they would hold another round of talks on Tuesday as the shutdown went into force. ""We'll probably have to furlough about 400,000 DoD (Defense Department) civilians when they come to work here in a couple of hours,"" Hagel said. ""Those that have been designated non-exempt will be told and will be asked to go home."" The Pentagon chief said since arriving in Seoul on Sunday night, he had been questioned by South Korean officials about the threatened shutdown and why it seemed likely to take place. ""It does have an effect on our relationships around the world and it cuts straight to the obvious question: Can you rely on the United States as a reliable partner to fulfill its commitments to its allies?"" Hagel told reporters. ""Here this great republic and democracy, the United States of America, shuts down its government,"" he added. ""The Pentagon, even though we are (partly) exempted, the military has no budget. We are still living under this dark cloud of uncertainty not knowing what's going to happen. ""It does cast a very significant pall over America's credibility with our allies when this kind of thing happens. It's nonsensical ... It's completely irresponsible,"" Hagel said. He urged Congress to ""find a new center of gravity of responsibility and start to govern as is their responsibility."" (Editing by Nick Macfie)"

""It felt almost as good as stealing cars from grandma."" — Rep. Darrell Issa, probably

On Monday, we learned that the IRS didn't single out tea party groups after all. Instead, they were looking for political groups, including not just tea party groups, but progressive groups as well. They may have used a flawed method for flagging the groups, but the IRS's intent was clear: to identify political groups that were not legally entitled to receive the tax-exempt benefit they sought to receive.

That pretty much brought the IRS ""scandal"" to a screeching halt. In the hours following the revelation, Darrell Issa's Twitter feed suddenly started spamming tweets about Benghazi. ""Change the subject, quickly!"" he seemed to be saying.

But there's still a question to be answered. If the IRS was targeting political groups from across the ideological spectrum, where did the original narrative about tea party targeting come from? The answer makes Darrell Issa and his fellow House Republicans look even worse than they did on Monday:



The Treasury inspector general (IG) whose report helped drive the IRS targeting controversy says it limited its examination to conservative groups because of a request from House Republicans. A spokesman for Russell George, Treasury’s inspector general for tax administration, said they were asked by House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) “to narrowly focus on Tea Party organizations.”

Obviously, if Issa wanted a comprehensive investigation, he should have asked for a review of all politically oriented scrutiny. Instead, he asked for exclusive focus on tea party and conservative groups. Under the most charitable interpretation of this, it never occurred to Darrell Issa that anyone other than the tea party groups could have been targeted. If that's true, it suggests he just doesn't care about whether the IRS ""targets"" anyone other than his political allies.

But I think the most likely explanation here is that Issa was simply trying to cook up a scandal, even though it did nothing to address the genuine problems with the way campaign finance and tax laws are written. He probably figured that in the best case scenario, he'd be able to get away with his fraud. And in the worst case scenario, he'd get a slap on the wrist from a few reporters, but endless approval from his political supporters. It's exactly the kind of thing you'd expect from Mr. Grand Theft Auto."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/08/12/Obama-DHS-Publishes-Instructions-For-Asylum-Loophole-On-Internet,2013-08-12 00:00:00,['Lee Stranahan'],Obama DHS Publishes Instructions for Asylum Loophole on Internet,"The process for people attempting to enter the country illegally through the Mexican border has often been characterized as grueling, dangerous and even potentially deadly; a trek across smoldering hot deserts led by ruthless ‘coyotes’ who profit from human suffering.

Meet the new coyotes: immigration attorneys and government rule-writers.

According to the clear guidelines published on the Internet and updated by the Obama administration in mid-June, there’s an easier way to cross to gain entrance to the United States: simply step right up to a border crossing and tell the officials that you have a “crediblee fear” of persecution or torture. Use that exact phrasing and you may be able to enter the USA while you await a hearing before an immigration judge…a process that could take years.

As Breitbart News reported yesterday in a story that swept through the Internet, that’s exactly what’s been happening recently with a flood of new asylum requests that seem designed to overwhelm the system.

The Obama Department of Homeland Security led by Janet Napolitano updated the information on their article Questions & Answers: Credible Fear Screening on June 18th, 2013. The article explains that if you claim ‘credible fear of persecution or torture’ that you can seek asylum, and that the process is subject to review.

Individuals Seeking Asylum If you are in expedited removal proceedings and found to have a credible fear of persecution or torture, you may seek asylum before an Immigration Judge (IJ). (See definition for Credible Fear in the “Glossary” link to the right) If the asylum officer does not find that you have a credible fear of persecution or torture, you may request that an IJ review that determination. If you do not request review by the IJ or the IJ agrees with the determination, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) may remove you from the United States.

It defines with a “credible fear” is:

Q. What Is a Credible Fear of Torture? A. A “significant possibility” that you can establish in a hearing before an Immigration Judge that you would be subject to torture if returned to your country (see definition of Torture in the “Glossary” link to the right).

Elsewhere on the DHS site, the government draws a distinction between a “credible” fear and a “reasonable”fear. The credible fear standard appears to be a lower bar, which is likely why it became the key word used by about 200 people a week ago at the Otay crossing near San Diego.

Q. What is a reasonable fear of persecution? A. You credibly establish that there is a “reasonable possibility” you would be persecuted in the future on account of your race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. The legal standard is the same standard used to establish a well-founded fear of persecution in an asylum case. You cannot establish a reasonable fear of persecution based only on past persecution without establishing a “reasonable possibility” of future persecution. After a reasonable fear of persecution or torture is found, the Immigration Judge will decide if you are eligible for withholding of removal or deferral of removal. Withholding of removal only provides protection against future persecution and may not be granted without a likelihood of future persecution. However, if you establish past persecution, there is a presumption that your fear of future persecution is reasonable.

The webpage spells out the Catch-22 of the asylum claim: if the asylum officer finds you have a “credible fear,” the next step is a hearing by an immigration judge. However, if the asylum officer does not find you have a “credible fear,” you can then request a appeal hearing by an immigration judge. Either way, you will have a hearing in front of a judge.

This is where the fun begins, because you will wait for your hearing in the United States under some sort of bond. Effectively, you are free to roam about the country for years. This “credible fear” tactic was used by Lizbeth Mateo, Lulu Martinez and the others in the Dream 9 group of illegal alien activists to gain reentry into the Unites States last week.

As the Los Angeles Times reported:

The protest took root in July when Marco Saavedra of New York, Lizbeth Mateo of Los Angeles and Lulu Martinez of Chicago — all young adults brought into the U.S. illegally as children — voluntarily crossed the border into Mexico as a protest of the administration’s deportation policies. They tried to reenter the U.S. on July 22 with six other dreamers who also had been brought to this country illegally as children but had returned to Mexico more than a year ago for various reasons.

The Times points out the claim that the Dream 9 are making that pushes the legal envelope:

A person seeking asylum must establish a well-founded fear of persecution based on “that he or she belongs to a race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,” according to Citizenship and Immigration Services guidelines. Some of the Dream 9 are petitioning for asylum, saying that they have family members who have been killed and face death threats themselves. However, many in the Dream 9 claim they should be granted asylum because they belong to a particular group of people — that they are singled out and persecuted in Mexico because they have lived most of their lives in the U.S. They could become targets for criminal organizations that see them as easy prey for extortion and violence, they claim.

It bears repeating: some in the Dream 9 are claiming that they fear persecution in Mexico because they spent time in the United States as illegal aliens. They are prepared to argue that illegal aliens are are a particular social group that is due asylum consideration for having been illegal aliens.

It’s such an outlandish argument that it’s one only a lawyer could love, but it will be years until an immigration judge hears it. In the meantime, Dream 9 activist Lizbeth Matter remains in the United States and begins her first day of law school at Santa Clara University today."

The U.S. admits about 1 million legal immigrants per year, more than any other country. That number could jump by more than 50% over the next decade under the terms of the immigration reform bill that a bipartisan group of senators expects to unveil as early as Tuesday. The impact would be felt nationwide, but areas that already have large immigrant communities would probably see much of the increase.

The immigration package includes at least four major provisions that would increase the number of legal immigrants, according to people familiar with it. Some of the parts could generate as much controversy as the provisions dealing with those who enter the country illegally or overstay their visas, according to those with long experience of the politics of immigration.

PHOTOS: The immigration reform debate

Supporters say that higher levels of legal immigration would meet the U.S. need for certain kinds of workers. Increased legal migration also would reduce most of the incentive for illegal border crossings, backers of the plan say, and would allow border agents to focus on smugglers and people with violent criminal records.

Opponents such as Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who has long opposed measures to increase immigration levels, say new workers would depress wages and crowd out Americans looking for work during a time of persistently high unemployment.

“The masters of the universe in glass towers and suites, they may not be impacted by this, but millions of struggling American families will,” Sessions said in an interview Friday. “We do need to be sure we aren’t exacerbating unemployment and wage erosion in America.”

The surge would come in several ways: The bill aims to eliminate the current backlog of roughly 4 million people waiting to be reunited with family members in the U.S. The 11 million now in the country without legal authorization would be eligible for citizenship only after that backlog was resolved. Reunification efforts would require boosting the number of visas issued each year. To keep the additional inflow under control, the bill would stop allowing adult siblings of immigrants to qualify, but children and parents would continue to be eligible.

U.S. immigration law: Decades of debate

In addition to family unification, which allows people into the country permanently, the bill also aims to increase temporary visas for both high-wage and low-wage workers. The number of visas for high-tech workers could nearly double to more than 120,000 per year. At the other end of the wage scale, a new visa system would allow businesses to bring in workers for jobs including janitors, housekeepers and meatpackers. The numbers would start small, but as the unemployment rate declined, it could reach 200,000 a year by the end of the decade. And growers could bring a total of about 330,000 new farmworkers into the country during the decade. At least some of those low-wage temporary workers eventually would be allowed to seek permanent residency.

The bill’s authors expect that legal immigration eventually would decline again, but only 10 years after the bill passed, once the backlog of residency applications shrank.

“The increased number in the years following the enactment of this bill reflects us having to clean up what has been a broken immigration system for many years,” said Angela Kelley, an immigration expert at the Center for American Progress, a liberal policy group in Washington.

“We had too few visas for too long,” Kelley said. “Congress hasn’t upgraded our immigration system in 23 years.”

The last time Congress overhauled the admissions process for immigrants was the Immigration Act of 1990. In the years after the bill’s passage, the total number of legal immigrants increased by 40%, from about 500,000 per year to more than 700,000.

But the new system didn’t allow enough flexibility as the U.S. continued to shift from a manufacturing-based economy to a knowledge-based economy, said Audrey Singer, immigration policy expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington.

“How do we get this right?” Singer asked. “The question is, can we come up with a mechanism that allows us to have a more adjustable system over time and have more flexibility?”

In theory, legal immigration has broad public support in both parties. In practice, changes to the immigration system can generate fierce political opposition.

Limiting the ability of immigrants to bring their adult siblings to the U.S. would be controversial, particularly with Asian American lawmakers and their constituents. Asian Americans use that category more heavily than other immigrant groups. The bill also would limit visas for married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens to people under the age of 30, which could generate opposition. On the other hand, the bill would allow lawful permanent residents to sponsor spouses and minor children for green cards. Currently, only U.S. citizens can do that. That change, likely to please immigrant groups, could bring in an additional 800,000 people over the next 10 years, Senate aides said.

House Republican leaders have been meeting with members to discuss immigration, and the future flow of legal immigrants has been among the top issues raised, according to officials familiar with the sessions. Because of the way many congressional district boundaries were redrawn after the 2010 census, few Republicans have large immigrant communities among their constituents, leaving many newer lawmakers unfamiliar with the issues.

“Everybody’s all over the map,” said Rep. James Lankford (R-Okla.), who has been helping coordinate the sessions for the GOP leadership. “There’s an economic benefit” to the changes being contemplated “if we have the right formula set up,” he said. “It’s people who are coming in for economic benefit rather than just family connection.”

Jonathan Johnson, president of the bargain site Overstock.com, based in Salt Lake City, said his firm had struggled to hire enough computer programmers and software developers to expand the business.

“We pay more, and they are still hard to fill,” he said.

There is little debate that Ryan defined the scope and character of the budget negotiations that played out in November and early December. Yes, he would have gone further if Senate Budget Committee chair Patty Murray (D-WA) and other Democrats had not been in positions to constrain his ambitions. But Ryan bragged that the deal reflected his bottom line: no new taxes on the extraordinarily wealthy, no closing of loopholes for corporations, no economic stimulus, continuation of many of the worst of the sequester cuts and an austerity calculus that unburdened billionaires, while resting the responsibility for reducing debts and deficits on the shoulders of federal employees and military personnel who must pay more for their benefits. Though Murray and many of the leading lights of the Republican and Democratic caucuses in the House and Senate were involved in the budget negotiations, Ryan was the definitional player. And he shaped a plan that embraces his fiscal ethic of erring consistently on the side of Wall Street speculators, “golden parachute” CEOs and million-dollar campaign donors.

A recent Pew Research poll finds that historically high numbers of Americans want their government to do less abroad. That worries many foreign policy elites, who fear that bad wars and growing debt are reviving old-fashioned isolationism.

But the public is neither isolationist nor misguided when it comes to foreign policy. Americans do not want to withdraw from the world; they just prefer not to try to run it with their military. A security strategy made to match those preferences — what we and others call restraint — would keep us out of avoidable trouble and husband our resources, ultimately making us safer and richer.

Conservatives live in constant fear of ""wussification"": That is the lesson one would learn from watching Fox News in 2013. Media Matters compiled a hilarious list of the top 10 times the word wussification—usually attached to the phrase of America—cropped up on Fox News this past year. The metaphorical testicles of America were lost to a myriad of causes, including the move to change the name of the Washington, D.C., NFL team and the push to end unpaid internships. Unmentioned as a symptom of wussification, interestingly enough, was the use of the term wussification in place of the grittier street alternative that starts with a p. Considering that Fox worried that suspending a cop for cursing at a bunch of children leads to wussification, you would think they would summon the testicular fortitude to use the word that they really mean. Lest you think this is simply Fox News employees overcompensating for working within a stone's throw of so many Broadway musicals, rest assured that this nonstop conservative anxiety about keeping things manly is hardly limited to Fox. For their last great push of freaking out over nothing this year, the culture warriors all over the right-wing media threw a major fit because an ad for Obamacare online pictured a man wearing eyeglasses and pajamas. Real men sleep in cargo pants and forsake being able to read rather than admit to needing the assistant of an optometrist, which is a word that nearly rhymes with gynecologist, after all.

In “The Mandela Barbie,” BBC journalist and investigative reporter Greg Palast’s eulogy of Nelson Mandela provides a rare breath of sanity in the media stampede to remake a legendary Marxist revolutionary into an icon of free market capitalism. According to Palast, “The ruling class creates commemorative dolls and statues of revolutionary leaders as a way to tell us their cause is won, so go home.” Al Jazeera America also offers a fairly balanced assessment of Mandela’s accomplishments. In “Mandela Sought Balance Between Socialism and Capitalism,” Martin O’Neill and Thad Williamson acknowledge that Mandela and the African National Congress totally failed to deliver on economic provisions – freedom from poverty, genuine equality of opportunity and a fair share of national wealth – in the ANC’s 1955 Freedom Charter. They also note that despite the advent of majority rule, poverty and living standards are much worse for black South Africans under the ANC. I frankly expected Democracy Now, The Nation, Mother Jones and other “alternative” media outlets to do a better job of distinguishing between superficial ballot box democracy and the genuine freedom that can only come from true economic democracy. Instead they were all happy to ape CNN and the New York Times in celebrating the cosmetic reforms masking the reality of brutal South African living conditions.

The incarceration of vast swaths of the American public is now an aging issue. Our prisons have increasingly become homes for the aging, as there are now some 125,000 prisoners age 55 or older, nearly quadruple the number there were in 1995. Many of these prisoners are serving life sentences, but others soon will be released into society facing special hardships because of their age. They will join a massive and steadily increasing population of aging ex-offenders who always will bear the scars to their mental, physical and financial well-being that come with having been a prisoner in America. [...] While many vulnerable older Americans can turn to public assistance programs for help, the options for former felons are often much more limited. Certain felons cannot receive federal housing assistance in many jurisdictions. Twelve states, including two of the three states with the largest prison populations in the country, ban people convicted of a drug felony for life from SNAP (formerly food stamps). Twenty more have modified disqualification, such as by requiring a drug test or restoring eligibility after a specified number of years. [...] In effect, our country's broken criminal justice system has condemned substantial parts of whole generations to impoverishment and ill-health of mind and body in their old age. Add to this voter disenfranchisement laws in many states, and we have fashioned a human rights disaster - a permanent under-caste of poor old people who are denied even the tiniest voice in our democratic system.

A strange new condition has seized the political imagination across our broken land. Let us call it “mayoralphilia,” a newfound faith in the office’s redemptive powers that would have made “Big Bill” Thompson, who treated the city of Chicago as his personal fiefdom, break out in belly laughs. It can be detected in a rash of recent books, including Bruce Katz and Jennifer Bradley’s The Metropolitan Revolution. And it has kindled unlikely mayoral ambitions, as when Rahm Emanuel ditched Washington for a post as hizzoner of Chicago and when billionaire Michael Bloomberg—who had the means to do whatever he wanted—lunged at an unprecedented third term as boss of New York City. Then there’s Thomas Friedman—bellwether of neoliberal groupthink—declaring flatly in a recent New York Times column, “I Want to Be a Mayor.” Benjamin Barber’s If Mayors Ruled the World: Dysfunctional Nations, Rising Cities is perhaps the most giddy among the growing pile of briefs on the subject."

Bentsen Jr., a former House lawmaker turned financial industry lobbyist, whose organization Sifma has urged Mr. Gensler to compromise on the cross-border rules.

Some of the strongest objections have come from foreign regulators, including officials from Britain, Russia, Japan and Germany, who complained about the plan last month in a letter to Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew. Global markets, they said, “will not be able to function under such burdensome regulatory conditions,” advocating instead that the United States agree to respect rules each nation adopts, assuming they are reasonably compatible.

Mary L. Schapiro, who recently stepped down as chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said she admired Mr. Gensler for his doggedness. But, she noted, “he believes very strongly in the positions he takes — that does not always lend itself to compromise quickly.”

The S.E.C., which has jurisdiction over a much smaller share of derivatives trading than Mr. Gensler’s agency, is scheduled to consider a narrower cross-border requirement on Wednesday. With American regulators in disagreement, the industry could have more leverage.

The role of Mr. Gensler’s agency greatly expanded under Dodd-Frank, which called for significantly tighter regulation of derivatives, used by a broad array of companies to help manage risk. An airline, for instance, uses them to hedge against the fluctuating cost of jet fuel. One form of derivatives, credit-default swaps, helped topple the giant insurer American International Group in 2008, deepening the financial crisis.

In the fight over the law’s provisions, the commission has been outmatched, said Bart Chilton, one of three Democratic appointees on the panel. “They have really unlimited resources,” he said of industry officials. Rules expected to take one year in the making have stretched out to three.

“It has created what I call dysfunction junction,” he added.

Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase were among the first to weigh in. Kenneth M. Raisler, a former general counsel at the commodity commission and now a partner at the New York-based law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, said the plan would damage his clients in overseas markets, as foreign customers would start to avoid American banks. JPMorgan Chase alone had $70 trillion of derivatives outstanding at the end of last year, a large portion of which were booked overseas."

What you need to know about the president's revamped team.

President Obama on Thursday nominated longtime fundraiser and hotel magnate Penny Pritzker as commerce secretary and veteran aide Michael Froman as the U.S. trade representative.

He made the announcement before embarking on a three-day economic and security trip to Mexico and Costa Rica.

If confirmed, Pritzker, an investor and daughter of the co-founder of the Hyatt hotel chain, would be the richest secretary in Obama’s Cabinet and potentially the wealthiest Cabinet secretary in U.S. history. She has a net worth of $1.85 billion, according to Forbes magazine, making her the 277th richest person on the Forbes 400 list.

The chief executive of PSP Capital Partners and its affiliate, Pritzker Realty Group, Pritzker has been a major presence in Chicago business and philanthropic circles. She was national finance chairman of Obama’s 2008 campaign and co-chairman of his 2012 reelection campaign.

The two nominations make it unlikely that Obama will move ahead with his plan to combine the government’s trade, investment and commerce functions into one department. The proposal, which he announced in January 2012 and included in his fiscal 2014 budget proposal, would combine the elements of several agencies including commerce, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Small Business Administration.

House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (Calif.) said in a statement Thursday that he and other Republicans are “still waiting” to reorganize the government. “I’m disappointed the president has not proposed a detailed plan, but if he does, a restructuring could still happen.”

After Obama was elected in 2008, Pritzker was considered a front-runner for the commerce position. But she withdrew from consideration, reportedly because of potential controversy over her net worth and complex business relationships.

In announcing the nomination on Thursday, Obama called Pritzker “one of the country’s most distinguished business leaders,” and cited her many years of experience in industries including real estate, hospitality, senior living and financial services.

“She’s built companies from the ground up. She knows from experience that no government program alone can take the place of a great entrepreneur,” Obama said. “And Penny understands that just as great companies strengthen the community around them, strong communities and skilled workers also help companies thrive.”

Pritzker has served on the President’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness and helped develop Skills for America’s Future, which the White House described as “an innovative program that brings together businesses, community colleges and others to prepare workers for 21st century jobs and connects them with employment.”

Pritzker attended Harvard University and received law and business degrees from Stanford.

Froman, Obama’s nominee for U.S. trade representative, is the deputy national security adviser for international economics. Previously at the investment bank Citigroup, he has been an aggressive free-trade advocate inside the White House but also a major supporter of policies to ensure that Americans have equal access to markets compared with workers from other countries.

“He has won the respect of our trading partners around the world,” Obama said. “He has also won a reputation as being an extraordinarily tough negotiator while doing it. He does not rest until he’s delivered the best possible deal for American businesses and American workers.”

Noting that Froman was a classmate of his at Harvard Law School, the president quipped: “He was much smarter than me then. He continues to be smarter than me now.”

Froman was the lead White House adviser on free trade deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama, the trade centerpieces of Obama’s first term. He also has been the president’s main emissary at major economic summits and has overseen economic engagement with all parts of the world, including China and the European Union. He will maintain a significant White House presence in his new role, the official said.

Froman served in the Clinton administration and in the Treasury Department. He attended Princeton, and in addition to his law degree from Harvard, he received a doctorate from Oxford.

The threat of a government shutdown starting on Tuesday appeared more real as the clock ticked and Congress remained split on the contents of a temporary spending measure.

At risk is Friday's release of the monthly jobs report, one of the most-widely watched pieces of economic data.

Bureau of Labor Statistics' commissioner Erica Groshen has indicated that it might not be possible to release the data, because the agency will ""suspend all operations"" during a shutdown and its ""staff will be furloughed.""

She said all surveys will ""cease"" and the ""website will not be updated.""

Investors will have to deal with more uncertainty and ""fewer guide posts"" on the economy, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank.

Uncertainty over the shutdown cast a pall over markets last week, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 down over 1% for the week. It was the first losing week of the month for both indexes, which had recently hit record highs. The Nasdaq managed a slight gain.

Private jobs data: Investors will have to whet their appetite on the state of U.S. employment via private researchers such as payroll processor ADP's report on Wednesday, followed by the Challenger job cuts report on Thursday.

The government's September employment report, if it is released on Friday, is expected to show a gain of 180,000 jobs in the month. Economists surveyed by Briefing expect the unemployment rate to hold steady at 7.3%.

Other economic reports: Other government reports are also in jeopardy in a shutdown. The Commerce Department is scheduled to release reports on construction and factory orders this week. Spokeswoman Sarah Horowitz said the department would not release economic indicators in the event of a shutdown.

Europe: Investors will also get a peek at how the European economy is weathering the austerity measures via the Eurozone unemployment report, due out Tuesday.

Asia: The Hong Kong Stock Exchange will be closed on Tuesday, while the Shanghai Stock Exchange is closed from Tuesday to Friday for a National Day celebration.

Obamacare launches: Back in the U.S., despite congressional Republicans' efforts to block the law, the Obamacare health insurance exchange markets for individuals are set to open Tuesday."

http://news.yahoo.com/2-years-immigration-laws-ga-143745728.html,,[],"2 years after immigration laws, Ga., Ala., stable","VIDALIA, Ga. (AP) -- Two years after Georgia and Alabama passed laws designed to drive away people living in the country illegally, the states' agricultural areas are still heavily populated with foreign workers, many of whom don't have legal authorization to be here.

There are still concerns over enforcement and lingering fears among immigrants, but in many ways it appears that people have gone on with life much as it was before the laws were enacted.

Farmers say many of the foreign workers have returned because the laws are not heavily enforced and it once again seems safe to be here.

But the story is more complicated than that: Some are still staying away or have gone underground, according to community activists, and some farmers say they are filling labor shortages not with returning immigrants but with workers hired through a program that grants temporary legal visas.

Meanwhile, employers and workers in both states are watching as Congress wrestles over plans that aim to simultaneously prevent future illegal immigration and offer a chance at citizenship for millions now living in the country illegally.

Georgia and Alabama were two of five states to pass tough crackdowns on illegal immigration in 2011, a year after Arizona made headlines for a hard-line immigration enforcement law that ended up being challenged in the U.S. Supreme Court.

Immediately after the laws were passed, farmers in both states complained that foreign workers who lived there had left and that the itinerant migrants who generally came through were staying away. American workers weren't stepping forward to perform the back-breaking work immigrants had done for years, and crops were rotting in the fields because of a lack of laborers, they said.

An informal survey conducted in Georgia showed that farmers of onions, watermelons and other hand-picked crops lacked more than 11,000 workers during their spring and summer harvests of 2011, Georgia Department of Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black told a U.S. Senate subcommittee hearing on immigration enforcement and farm labor.

Story continues

But then as courts began blocking significant elements of the law and some loopholes became apparent, some of the workers who had fled for fear of arrest and deportation returned. Others were drawn back by their longstanding ties to the communities.

Victor Valentin, 25, and his wife, Maria Gonzales, 23, came to the Vidalia onion growing region in south Georgia five years ago and found work quickly. But when the state passed its law cracking down on illegal immigration, they feared they would be caught and deported, and left for neighboring North Carolina.

They didn't last long. With two young children and no support network there, life was difficult. At the same time, the situation in Georgia seemed to have calmed down.

""We still talked to people here, and we heard there weren't really any problems, that things hadn't really changed,"" Valentin said, explaining that the family decided to return to the Vidalia area after about nine months. He's found work harvesting pine straw since his return.

This year, Black and a number of industry leaders in Georgia told The Associated Press they haven't heard of any labor shortages.

The situation in Alabama is similar.

""No one seems to be having any problems,"" said Alabama's agriculture commissioner, John McMillan, who added that he has spoken with farmers who saw migrants return once it became clear the law passed in Alabama was, in practice, mostly toothless. Courts blocked most of the law's toughest sections, including one that required public schools to check students' citizenship status, and the massive arrests envisioned by some simply didn't happen.

Also, according to government statistics, thousands of employers in Alabama have been ignoring a provision in the state's immigration law that requires them to register with the federal E-Verify system, a program to electronically verify workers' legal status.

And yet, at least in Georgia, the story is a bit more complicated than it may seem on the surface.

Some migrant families — both legally and illegally in the country — are indeed still avoiding Georgia because they fear discrimination and profiling, said Andrea Hinojosa, a community organizer who has worked with Latino workers in the Vidalia area for more than 20 years.

Other laborers who had worked their way up from the fields into more stable factory or construction work have turned to less stable jobs because businesses are starting to use E-Verify, a key provision of the Georgia law, Hinojosa said.

""I think it has probably put people back into hiding, put them back in the shadows,"" Hinojosa said. ""It doesn't mean they're not working. It could mean that they have just found a job where they can't be detected.""

Maria Barbosa, a legal permanent resident from Mexico, opened Los Olivos, a store that caters to the Vidalia area's Latino population, in July 2008. She estimates that her profits at the store, which stocks international phone cards, traditional foods and party supplies, dropped by about 30 percent after Georgia's law passed. It has rebounded somewhat in the past two years, but it's still not as strong as it was, she said.

One reason labor shortages in the fields have subsided — in addition to the return of migrant workers who had fled — is that some of the biggest farms in the area have started using or increased their use of a federal guest-worker program to bring in foreign workers legally.

Farmer R.T. Stanley of Stanley Farms, which grows more than 1,000 acres of onions, as well as other crops and vegetables in the area, is one of them.

Stanley said he has started to use more legal guest workers, who are brought into the country on a visa for a defined period of time, because he is not able to find as many experienced migrant workers locally as he used to.

For Barbosa, that can hurt business, because guest workers aren't nearly as reliable as customers as those who settle in and develop attachments to a community.

""They'll come in and buy some beans and tortillas and then send $1,000 to Guatemala,"" she said of the guest workers.

Many farmers have long complained the federal guest-worker program is too rigid and difficult to use.

""We know we've got to deal with the rules, and we do,"" said Bob Stafford, director of the Vidalia Onion Business Council. ""We do the best we can with them.""

Now farmers and workers both are turning their attention to the debate over national immigration reform and are hoping for provisions that will help them.

""We need a real good guest-worker program,"" Stafford said, ""something that will work ... for the growers and for the workers and for the community.""

Barbosa, whose husband works as a crew leader recruiting and overseeing field workers for farmers, is also watching Washington.

""People have hope,"" she said. ""But there's been a lot of talk about immigration reform before and nothing has happened, so there's still a lot of doubt.""

More than five million council house tenants in Britain will be given the right to buy their home under new government proposals.

The Housing Bill published today will give tenants who have lived in their home for up to three years a 33% discount on the market value of their home, increasing in stages up to 50% for a tenancy of 20 years.

The government believes the bill will transform the social structure of Britain for good. Michael Heseltine, secretary of state for the environment, said: ""This bill lays the foundations for one of the most important social revolutions of this century.""

But Shelter, the organisation for homeless people, has said the move will increase the number of homeless people and decrease the number of homes available to accommodate them.

Opposition

Labour are vehemently opposed to the proposals believing the impact on the nation's pocket will be huge. Roy Hattersley, shadow environment spokesperson said: ""We shall fight it very hard in the House of Commons and in the country.""

As a further incentive to prospective buyers the government will also offer tenants a 100% mortgage from the local authority.

Those who cannot afford to buy their home immediately will be able to pay a £100 deposit and postpone the sale for two years at which time they will be able to purchase their home at today's prices.

If local authorities do not comply with the new legislation the secretary of state will have the power to directly intervene in the sale.

Critics have accused the government of being too generous to council house tenants but the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher and her government are sure the new policy will pave the way for a property-owning democracy and a more socially responsible population.

Labour believe the cost to the public purse will be at least £5,000 per sale but the Conservatives maintain that central and local government will save millions through the reduction of subsidy to council house tenants."

The leaders of the nation’s teachers unions immediately fired off news releases asserting that the mediocre PISA scores of American students showed that more than a decade of testing-based reform had failed our schools. Prominent reform leaders, by contrast, concluded from the test results that the U.S. was failing to change schools radically enough to aid its most disadvantaged students. Still others predicted that the U.S. economy would crash and burn because of our students’ unimpressive math scores on the PISA exams compared with other countries’ students. (American students ranked above the median in reading and science but below it in math.)

A saner interpretation of the PISA results came from researchers who have studied international rankings in great detail, and their message goes something like this: Calm down, everyone. The results on this and other international tests are more complicated than they look, and in this case, nuance makes a difference. Despite the doomsday talk, the scores a country receives on the PISA don’t necessarily predict the strength — or weakness — of its future labor force or the trajectory of its economy, according to Martin Carnoy, a professor of education at Stanford University. Some countries with relatively low scores have built thriving, tech-based economies, while the economies of some high-scoring nations have faltered.

YEAR IN REVIEW: Washington’s 5 biggest ‘fails’ of 2013

And the results on the PISA, administered every three years to 15-year-olds in 65 countries, tell us as much about cultural differences as about differences between school systems. In the Asian countries that took the top spots — including Singapore, South Korea and areas of China — families spend heavily on private tutoring to prepare their children for college entrance examinations that closely resemble the PISA tests, Carnoy said. So the high PISA results don’t necessarily reflect on their schools.

The reasons that some countries do well (or poorly) are complicated. Finland, for instance, has historically been successful on the PISA tests — so much so that governments, including California’s, have sent delegations there to figure out the educational magic. And Finland has been successful despite the fact that, unlike in Asia, testing is de-emphasized and recesses during the school day are long. But Finland also is a country with relatively few disadvantaged children, largely because of the nation’s social welfare network. And disadvantaged children, no matter what the country, fare worse on the PISA tests than students from more educated and affluent families. A Stanford study last year found that non-school factors such as the number of books in students’ homes accounted for more than two-thirds of the variation in scores on high-profile international tests like PISA.

A study published this year by Carnoy and Richard Rothstein, a researcher at the Economic Policy Institute, found that much of the difference between U.S. scores and those of high-ranking nations is because the United States has a higher proportion of disadvantaged students. But the researchers found that the scores of the most disadvantaged U.S. students have been improving markedly over the years, while scores for their counterparts in many top-ranked nations have fallen precipitously.

In contrast, the highest-scoring U.S. math students are nowhere near their peers in top-ranking countries, Carnoy said.

Though curriculum itself isn’t a cure-all, the Common Core curriculum, which California and dozens of other states are beginning to implement, should help. It is more closely aligned to the kind of conceptual understanding and deep thinking that is both called for on the PISA tests and required for true innovation.

If there is a lesson to be gleaned from PISA, it’s that moving toward a more educated nation will require helping families give their children the resources and background they need to do better in school, as well as continuing reform efforts to improve instruction and curriculum. It requires committed action over time, not warring and self-serving pronouncements."
http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2013/12/03/what-finland-can-teach-america-about-education/,2013-12-03 00:00:00,[],What Finland can teach America about education,"Fareed speaks with journalist Amanda Ripley, author of 'The Smartest Kids in the World and How They Got That Way,' about what other countries can teach the U.S. about education. Watch the video for the full interview.

America is exceptional in many ways. Sadly, secondary education is not one of them. The most recent rankings for the Program for International Student Assessment has American 15 year-olds ranked 14th in reading, 17th in science and 25th in math, among other developed nations. Countries like Finland and South Korea always rank near the top.

In a 2011 GPS special, we went to those two countries to see what they were doing differently. Investigative journalist Amanda Ripley went one step further. She followed some American kids as they spent a year abroad in high school in those two countries and in Poland. The results are fascinating. The book is called The Smartest Kids in the World and How They Got That Way.

Amanda Ripley joins me now. So what did you find about those three countries that struck you? You actually have three models that you say that they represent. What are they?

So, South Korea is the pressure cooker model. The extreme case of what you see all over Asia, where kids are working night and day, literally, under a lot of family pressure, to get very high test scores. Now, South Korea does get those high test scores, but at great cost. So that’s one, the pressure cooker model.

Finland is, in many ways, the opposite extreme of South Korea. Not in all ways, but in some. And Finland is what I call the utopia model – they've really invested in quality over quantity and the kids are, on average, doing less homework than our kids, but still achieving at the very top of the world on tests of critical thinking and math, reading and science, with very little variation from school to school or from socioeconomic status from one to the other.

And why did you choose Poland?

Poland is the surprise. Poland is an example of the metamorphosis, a country that has a high rate of child poverty and plenty of trouble and trauma in its background, and yet has radically improved its education outcomes over the past 10 years.

So Poland is not yet at the level of Finland or Korea, but a place that shows that there is hope. You know, change happens, even in places with problems. So in a way, looking at Poland is almost like going back in time and looking at Finland and Korea 50 years ago.

Talk a little bit more about the Finland model, because that's the one that's the most intriguing. What makes Finland work? Why are those test scores so high?

It's remarkable to everyone, including everyone in Finland. They can't quite believe it, year after year. One thing that they've done that's very clear and is very unusual around the world is, in the late 1960s, they shut down their teacher training colleges, which were like ours, of highly variable selectivity and quality. And they reopened them in the top eight most elite universities in the land as part of a broader reform of higher education.

More from CNN: Shanghai schools the best in the world?

When they did that, it set off a series of cascading consequences that I don't even know that they realized. One thing that happened is the obvious – you eventually have teachers who, themselves, have the advantage of a very strong education, which makes it easier to teach higher order thinking skills.

And they're, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think they draw their teachers from the top 10 or 20 percent of the graduating class. We tend to draw teachers from the bottom third.

Yes. Thank you. We educate twice as many teachers as we need. And in many, many of these colleges, there's a very low bar for entry. So you don't have to have very good grades yourself in order to get in. And that's true around the world, actually. That's very common.

So Finland is unusual.

Finland is unusual, yes, for doing that. But I think what's really surprising about it, and what I noticed when I spent time with kids in Finland, is that the kids pick up on this. So there's a signaling effect, like economists would say, where you know how hard it is to get into teacher training colleges.

And that alone isn't enough, but it sends this message to everyone – the parents, the taxpayers, the politicians and the students – that this is serious, that you are serious about education and that teaching is really hard, not just in rhetoric, but in reality. And so it adds this credibility to the whole enterprise that helps kids buy into the promise of education.

You also point out something about all these countries – and this is true of all three of them – which is, there is almost no sports in the best schools in the world.

Right. Kids play sports, but not in school. It's sort of separate from school – pickup games or community rec centers, but it’s not a part of the core mission of school. This is controversial. I get in a lot of trouble when I talk about this, because Americans love their sports and American kids love their sports. And when I surveyed hundreds of exchange students, you know, they all agreed that sports were more important to their American peers than their peers back home.

But many of them actually really like that. They liked that there was this school spirit and this bonding. The problem is that sports can sometimes, if you don't constantly keep it contained, eat away at the mission of school, which is supposed to be education, right?

So when we are routinely spending two to three times per football player what we spend per math student, when we routinely have teachers leaving to go coach away games and have to bring in substitutes, and we're spending tens of thousands of dollars on buses for the marching band, that's something that should be weighed against the benefit.

It seemed to me, what you really said is that the systems are quite different in all these three countries, the structures are different. The one thing that's true is there's a psychology that says school is hard. You've got to spend a lot of time at it. You've got to work hard. You've got to succeed. And that's missing in America.

It's almost exactly the same attitude many of us take towards sports, towards academics. It's literally: this is important, there's a big contest at the end, not everyone is going to win. To get better, critically, you have to practice and work harder, you know, and get more help. But you're not innately just bad at math.

So that's a really powerful combination, when you take that intensity on education, when you make it rigorous through highly trained, highly supported teachers and then back it up. Kids know if this is bogus or not.

Did it leave you depressed about America?

No. Actually, oddly, I felt more optimistic when I came back than when I left. I feel like, you know, we have 45 states that have now adopted the common core state standards. Big fights still happening and still to come about that. But those are more rigorous in math and reading, which is much more aligned, particularly in math, with what these countries are doing. It's an obvious first step. Not enough, but exciting that it's even happening in 45 states. I mean that's a huge deal for America.

And I think, you know, more and more people are starting to talk about the quality of our education colleges. To get into education college in Finland is like getting into MIT in the United States. And imagine what could follow if that were true here. I mean you could make a case to pay teachers more, to give them more freedom in the classroom, and to finally give that profession the respect it deserves.

Good luck getting sports out, though.

Yes, forget about that. That's never going to happen.

Amanda Ripley, a pleasure to have you on.

Thank you."

Tomorrow, voters in the US state of Wyoming’s Teton County School District will make a decision that could, its supporters believe, cut large (and much-needed) sums from the state’s education costs. So what, you might think. Who cares about reforms in high schools across the Atlantic? But the question Teton County is putting to its citizens — should its teachers and pupils operate on a four, rather than five-day week — is one that is being asked, and indeed answered, around the world.

The pitch and tenor of [the Venezuelan elite's] hatred quickly became murderous. Privately owned media channels publically and regularly called for [Hugo] Chavez’ assassination. In 2002 a Pinochet-style coup was mounted, organized by the business elites, its representatives in the media and the reactionary political class; Chavez was snatched from power and detained in an island base while the institutions of the democracy were dissolved by formal decree. Then something else happened. The people who had provided Chavez with his electoral mandate began to come from the hills and the barrios converging on the center in their hundreds of thousands, eventually compelling the release of Chavez, and forcing his reinstatement.

Every time some lone Republican nut from Hooterville makes a jackass statement about rape or evolution, it’s immediately ascribed as a doctrinal belief of the entire GOP and conservatives in general.

In addition to the obvious victims, there are many more hidden ones, including the contract workers involved in the dirty clean up work at Dai-ichi and the surrounding area. There have been multiple scandals related to them not receiving all the pay they are entitled to, not being trained properly or being given all the safety equipment, and many reported cases of yakuza involvement. The Dai-ichi disaster has exposed the extent to which the nuclear industry in Japan was built upon exploiting vulnerable individuals and communities. The Fukushima region continues to suffer greatly from the stigma and fear attached to the nuclear accident. Previously one of Japan's bread-baskets, its agriculture and fishing industries have suffered considerably, as has tourism. Fear of radiation has become more damaging than radiation itself. Some farmers have committed suicide following the loss of their livelihoods, and families have been broken up with mothers taking children away from the region due to radiation fears. The Japanese people have also lost faith and trust in their politicians and bureaucrats, due to the way the crisis was handled, including the manner in which information was withheld and the public mislead. Even the fact that a meltdown occurred at Fukushima was denied for months.

Israel, I fear, is on a suicidal path: It could cease to be the democratic home of the Jewish people. This is why I greatly appreciate President Obama's decision to come to Israel despite all the serious issues he faces in America. His visit could mark the beginning of a new era in the struggle to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Because it is crucial to make the most of it, I am taking the liberty of offering four suggestions to the president as he prepares for his trip.

The downsides of extracting hydrocarbons by high-powered fracturing of petroleum-rich shale rock are well known.

A Hillary Rodham Clinton book deal is in place.

Simon & Schuster announced Thursday that it will publish the former secretary of State's memoir next year.

The tentative publication date is June 2014, and will likely inspire a book tour that will be filled with speculation about whether Clinton will seek the presidency in 2016.

Financial terms were not disclosed; Clinton received $8 million for her 2003 memoir Living History, also published by Simon & Schuster.

From Simon & Schuster:

""The yet-to-be titled book will use a number of dramatic moments during Secretary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State to frame her thoughts about the recent history of U.S. foreign policy and the urgent, ongoing need for American leadership in a changing world.

""She will write about her role in, and reflections on, such recent events as the killing of Osama Bin Laden; the overthrow of the Qaddafi regime in Libya; the transitions in Iraq and Afghanistan; the Arab Spring; the pivot to the Asia-Pacific; the rise of new powers like China, Brazil, Turkey, and India; building diplomatic coalitions to deal with Iran and North Korea; and our relations with important allies around the world.

""The book will also address many of the major trends reshaping the global landscape of the 21st century – trends in economics, energy and climate change, democracy and human rights, the critical role of women and girls, technology and innovation, health and human development, and more.""

Washington (CNN) - Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said she would be ""disappointed"" in the American electorate if Hillary Clinton becomes a serious candidate for president in 2016.

The 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee argued Clinton would not be right for the role as commander in chief after four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya, died last year in a terrorist attack against a U.S. consulate in Benghazi.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

""If (Benghazi) doesn't have an impact on the 2016 presidential election, if she is a candidate, then America, I am very disappointed in our electorate,"" Palin said Sunday on Fox News, where she's a contributor.

She said ""anyone who would just throw away 200 years of military ethos and leave our men behind to be murdered"" should ""never be considered as a commander in chief.""

The lack of security at the consulate and the September 11, 2012 attack are poised to be a major point of contention by Republicans if Clinton decides to run for president. Clinton ultimately took responsibility for diplomats' safety, and was grilled before two congressional committees in January.

At one point she lost her temper while responding to questions from Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin. He was asking her about the erroneous, initial talking points that claimed the attack stemmed from a spontaneous protest against an anti-Islam video, though the administration later defined it as a terrorist attack and said a protest never happened.

""What difference at this point does it make?"" Clinton responded. ""It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, senator.""

The attack on Benghazi is still a matter of congressional investigation by House Republicans.

""That's why I'm so grateful for Congress to be pursuing what happened in Benghazi,"" Palin said. ""Because at this point, it still makes a difference what happens in Benghazi.""

""Anyone who doesn't understand that and dismisses it as being indifferent, they should not be our commander in chief,"" she continued.

For her part, Clinton said in a recent interview with New York Magazine that she is in no hurry to decide about a potential 2016 bid for the White House, saying it is a decision ""not to be made lightly.""

Asked how she plans to combat any conflicts she may face related to her political legacy, she said the best course is to ""find common ground.""

""I have a lot of reason to believe, as we saw in the 2012 election, most Americans don't agree with the extremists on any side of an issue,"" Clinton said in the interview. ""But there needs to continue to be an effort to find common ground, or even take it to higher ground on behalf of the future.""

Palin's comments mark a stark contrast to high praise Clinton received Sunday from House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who said if Clinton decides to run, ""she will win.""

""And when she becomes president, she'll be one of the best-equipped, best-prepared people to enter the White House in a very long time,"" Pelosi said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

Noting Clinton's experience as secretary of state, as a U.S. senator from New York and as a first lady, Pelosi said Clinton would be ""more prepared than President Obama; certainly more prepared than President Bush; certainly more prepared than President Clinton I might admit."""

Story highlights During the 2012 race, Mitt Romney was criticized for calling Russia the United States' top ""geopolitical foe"" Romney was also haunted by an op-ed about the auto industry entitled ""Let Detroit Go Bankrupt"" Now, Russia has granted temporary asylum to NSA leaker Edward Snowden and the City of Detroit is bankrupt But Romney was also hurt in his 2012 White House bid by other controversies like his ""47 percent"" comments

(CNN) —

If Mitt Romney were to write a bumper sticker slogan for the past month, it would probably be, “Detroit DID go bankrupt. Russia IS a geopolitical foe.”

Reality isn’t quite so simple as to perfectly apply recent developments on Detroit and Russia to the American debate in 2012, but neither were Romney’s arguments on the car industry and on Russia. That didn’t stop Democrats and pundits from using them to beat Romney down.

And it would be a good retort to Joe Biden’s often-repeated 2012 bumper sticker slogan: “Osama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive!”

Biden used the phrase to simultaneously flaunt what the Obama administration accomplished in the war on terror and hit Romney for his position against the auto bailout.

Romney had different ideas than the president about the war on terror, and he also had outspoken ideas on Russia, which he told Wolf Blitzer on CNN in March of 2012 was “without question our number one geopolitical foe.”

His statement drew snickers in Washington and complaints in foreign policy circles that he was stuck in the Cold War.

Archives: Hillary Clinton criticizes Romney’s remarks on Russia

“You don’t call Russia our No. 1 enemy – not al Qaeda, Russia – unless you’re still stuck in a Cold War mind warp,” President Barack Obama said at the Democratic National Convention last September.

The president probably still wouldn’t call Russia this country’s top foe. But now that Russia has given NSA leaker Edward Snowden a year of asylum, and the two countries can’t find accord on Syria or Iran, he might choose not to put the line in his convention speech.

Snowden asylum could cancel planned Obama-Putin talks

“Now is the time to fundamentally rethink our relationship with Putin’s Russia,” Sen. John McCain said upon hearing news of Snowden’s asylum. “We need to deal with the Russia that is, not the Russia we might wish for. We cannot allow today’s action by [Russian President Vladimir Putin] to stand without serious repercussions.”

“Russia has stabbed us in the back,” said Sen. Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat. He called on Obama to protest by demanding the upcoming G-20 summit for world economic powers be moved away from Russia.

Biden’s slogan, “General Motors is alive!” drew a direct contrast between the candidates on the auto bailout that Obama engineered after initial action by President George W. Bush.

Romney’s much-cited New York Times op-ed argued the car industry should be shepherded into a managed bankruptcy and not propped up with taxpayer dollars.

The headline of Romney’s op-ed in November 2008 was “Let Detroit Go Bankrupt.” That headline followed him all the way to November of 2012 when he lost the election.

Romney’s argument in the opinion piece was directed at the car industry, but it foreshadowed last month’s news that the Detroit the city, once the powerhouse of the American economy, was going bankrupt.

“[W]e refused to throw in the towel and do nothing,” Obama said in a video message in October of 2012. “We refused to let Detroit go bankrupt, I bet on American workers, and American ingenuity and three years later that bet is paying off in a big way.”

A conservative might apply the high labor costs Romney cited as part of the downfall for the auto industry to the cost of government worker pension plans that have helped put the city in trouble.

How to deal with promises made to public employees is an issue Americans will face in the coming decades in places far flung from the Motor City.

Hatch: After Detroit, replace public pensions

The federal government has made pretty clear there won’t be any sort of bailout for the city of Detroit like there was for the auto industry that lives there.

CNNMoney: Why Obama won’t bail out Detroit

Campaigns are full of little moments like the Detroit and Russia storylines that may have worked against Romney. They add up. More damaging for Romney than either the Detroit op-ed or the Russia as a foe storyline was his statement to fundraisers about giving up on the 47% of Americans who would not vote for him no matter what.

This week we also got the most in-depth explanation from Romney on those comments in the form of a book excerpt from Washington Post writer Dan Balz. Romney said he was misunderstood.

In politics, eight months is an eternity. It’s enough time for the Romneys to welcome four new grandchildren into the world. How Detroit and Russia and the 47% factored into 2012 are interesting historical questions, but the national dialogue has moved on. Romney is retired from national politics and the pundits and press have moved on to the 2016 parlor game.

The president was surrounded by his immediate family and was sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts on a bible belonging to the family of his wife, first lady Michelle Obama.

The first lady stood to the president's left and held the Robinson family bible as daughters Sasha and Malia stood beside her, inside the White House's Blue Room.

The oath took about two minutes and was administered shortly before noon.

Obama hugged his wife and said, ""Thank you Sweetie,"" after the oath was administered.

He then hugged his daughters and told Sasha, ""I did it.""

Earlier in the day, Obama joined Vice President Biden, after he was sworn in, at Arlington National Cemetery for a wreath-laying ceremony on a crisp, sun-splashed January day.

Obama and Biden jointly placed a large wreath, adorned with red, white and blue ribbon, in front of Arlington's Tomb of the Unknowns. Placing their hands over their hearts, the two leaders stood solemnly as a bugle played ""Taps.""

Biden was surrounded by family and friends for his brief swearing-in at the Naval Observatory, his official residence in northwest Washington.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, appointed by Obama as the first Hispanic to serve on the Supreme Court, administered the oath of office to Biden, who placed his hand on a Bible his family has used since 1893.

""I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States,"" Biden said as he recited the oath.

Among the 120 guests on hand to witness the vice president's second swearing-in were Attorney General Eric Holder, departing Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and several Democratic lawmakers.

Sunday's subdued ceremonies are a function of the calendar and the Constitution, which says presidents automatically begin their new terms at noon on Jan. 20. Because that date fell this year on a Sunday -- a day on which inaugural ceremonies historically are not held -- organizers scheduled a second, public swearing-in for Monday.

A crowd of up to 800,000 people is expected to gather on the National Mall to witness that event, which will take place on the Capitol's red, white and blue bunting-draped west front. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who famously flubbed the oath of office that Obama took in 2009, was to swear the president in both days.

Once the celebrations are over, Obama will plunge into a second-term agenda still dominated by the economy, which slowly churned out of recession during his first four years in office. The president will also try to cement his legacy with sweeping domestic changes, pledging to achieve both an immigration overhaul and stricter gun laws despite opposition from a divided Congress.

But for one weekend at least, Washington was putting politics aside. Obama called the nation's inaugural traditions ""a symbol of how our democracy works and how we peacefully transfer power.""

""But it should also be an affirmation that we're all in this together,"" he said Saturday, as he opened a weekend of inaugural activities at a Washington elementary school.

The Blue Room is an oval space with majestic views of the South Lawn and the Washington Monument.

The room, named for the color of the drapes, upholstery and carpet, primarily has been a reception room as well as the site of the only presidential wedding in the White House, when President Grover Cleveland married Frances Folsum in 1886.

Obama and Biden were to address supporters Sunday evening at an inaugural reception.

The president planned to save his most expansive remarks for Monday's inaugural address to the crowd gathered on the Mall and millions more watching across the country and the world. Obama started working on the speech in early December and was still tinkering with it into the weekend, aides said.

The president's address will set the stage for the policy objectives he seeks to achieve in his second term, including speeding up the economic recovery, passing comprehensive immigration and gun control measures and ending the war in Afghanistan. Aides said Obama would save the specifics of those agenda items for his Feb. 12 State of the Union address.

The president launched a weekend of inaugural activities Saturday by heading up a National Day of Service. Along with his family, Obama helped hundreds of volunteers spruce up a Washington area elementary school.

Obama wore rubber gloves, picked up a paint brush and helped volunteers stain a bookshelf.

Obama added the service event to the inaugural schedule in 2009 and is hoping it becomes a tradition followed for future presidents.

Mrs. Obama, speaking to volunteers Sunday, espoused the importance of giving back in the midst of the weekend of pomp, circumstance and celebration.

Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) is the unsung heroine of the foreign policy debates of the past few months. A Tea Party candidate who was elected in the 2010 wave, Ayotte has been one of the most reliable voices on the Benghazi attacks, the Hagel nomination, and the prosecution of terrorists. She has worked with Sens. John McCain (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC)–without joining their withering attacks on the party’s libertarian wing.

In the Hagel confirmation process, though much of the mainstream media’s attention focused on the aggressive questioning by McCain, Graham, and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), it was Ayotte’s line of questioning that was most effective in exposing Hagel’s position on Iran, which is the most pressing national security challenge the nation faces at the moment. Ayotte eschewed theatrics and flash for patient and yet penetrating questions.

In one particularly revealing exchange, Ayotte pinned Hagel down on his opposition to a “military option” on Iran:

Ayotte: Can you help me understand, when you went to Islamabad, Pakistan in 2006, you said at that time that a military strike against Iran, an military option, is not a “viable, feasible or responsible option.” And it strikes me that what you’re saying about the military option now and even–it seems inconsistent with that statement. And why would you make that statement in Pakistan that it’s not a “viable, feasible or responsible option” in light of your statement today that you do, I have, and I strongly agree that a military option should be on the table? Hagel : That statement was made in a context of all options regarding Iran. And Pakistan was where I was at the time. And the larger context of that was nuclear powers, which certainly Pakistan is part of that club. And not unlike what Secretary Gates said about a strike on Iran, my point was that this would not be a preferable option. There would be consequences to this option. Things would happen as a result of it. If we could find a better option, a better way to deal with Iran to assure they do not get nuclear weapons, then we’re far better off. That was the context of that statement. Ayotte: Senator Hagel, I know that my time is up and I know we’ll have an opportunity for a second round of questions, but as I see your quote it didn’t say “preferable option;” it said, was not a responsible option.

During the debate over UN Ambassador Susan Rice’s potential candidacy as Secretary of State, Ayotte joined McCain and Graham in stressing their objections to Rice over her role in spreading the story that the Benghazi terror attack on Sep. 11, 2012 had been a protest over an anti-Islam video. In an effort to characterize opposition to Rice as racist and sexist, the president and his party pointedly ignored Ayotte’s role in the debate.

Ayotte refused to take the bait, remaining focused on the issues at hand. Her remarks after a meeting with Rice–“I want to say that I’m more troubled today”–marked a turning point, after which Democrats knew that Rice’s candidacy would be a losing proposition.

In her remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference this morning, Ayotte touched on foreign policy but returned to the domestic issues that were the theme of her election campaign in 2010:

Let me tell you about some of the things that keep me up at night. Too many Americans are out of work. Federal regulations are strangling businesses. Obamacare is increasing health care costs and stopping so many of those businesses from hiring. And I come from a small business family. I know what that’s like. How hard the small businesses work. We have a broken tax code and the president and Senate Democrats, they just want to keep increasing taxes, making it harder and harder, for our small businesses to hire and grow and put people to work in this country. Our nation is drowning in debt. We have had four straight years of trillion dollar deficits.

In 2012, Ayotte was considered a long-shot contender to be Mitt Romney’s running mate. While that may have been premature, it likely portends Ayotte’s future. She is one of the few conservatives who is fluent in both the Tea Party’s constitutionalism and the hawkish policy prescriptions of the national security wing of the Republican Party."

On%20the%20country%27s%20independence%20day%2C%20Martelly%20called%20for%20unity

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Thousands of critics of Haiti's President Michel Martelly staged protest marches Monday that turned violent as people threw rocks and shots were fired in the air.

It appeared at least one person was shot. An Associated Press reporter heard several gunshots, and then a crowd loaded a man onto a motorcycle and took him to an ambulance. The ambulance driver said the man was shot in the back. His condition wasn't immediately clear.

The marches were among the biggest demonstrations against Martelly since he took office in 2011, and the crowd in the capital swelled as protesters passed each neighborhood. Their complaints ranged from the cost of living to high levels of corruption.

Protesters lit fiery barricades of discarded tires on one of the busiest streets as they called for Martelly's departure from office. Demonstrators also smashed car windows and tore down posters and billboards bearing the leader's face and burned those too. Pro-Martelly groups held separate marches, and the two sides took turns throwing rocks at each other as riot police dispensed canisters of tear gas.

""We are moving forward to removing him from power and won't stop until he leaves,"" said demonstrator Jean Daniel.

Martelly, his prime minister, Laurent Lamothe, and the first lady attended a church ceremony in the northern city of Cap-Haitien, the site of another, smaller protest Monday, a national holiday that commemorates Haiti's final battle before it secured independence from France in 1804.

In a speech that followed at a historic site where the fight apparently took place, Martelly appealed for unity. ""If we didn't put our heads together, we wouldn't have had the Battle of Vertieres,"" he said. ""If we didn't have our heads together, we wouldn't have a Haitian state.""

The U.N. peacekeeping mission in Haiti on Saturday urged Martelly and opposition parties to sort out their differences in a peaceful manner. The world body also dispatched armed troops for the demonstration to join riot police with shields and helmets.

The mounting tension between Martelly and his opponents stems in part from the government's failure to hold legislative and local elections that are two years overdue. The U.N., U.S. and others have been overly supportive of the Martelly administration but relations seemed to be straining in recent months because of the delayed vote. The election was supposed to have been held before year's end, but it most likely won't happen until next year.

""The international community should take notes,"" said Moise Jean-Charles, a senator and vocal critic of the government. ""The people are rising for a change. Martelly and Lamothe aren't doing anything for the country but stealing money."""

Some Republicans want a delay on Chuck Hagel vote until more information is provided

Obama spokesman calls delaying tactics %22unconscionable%22

White House attorney sends letter to three senators about Benghazi events

Senate Republicans blocked a confirmation vote Thursday on Defense Secretary nominee Chuck Hagel, even as Democrats and the White House blasted the prospect of a historic filibuster.

""These delaying tactics are unconscionable and they should end right away,"" said White House spokesman Josh Earnest, adding that the nation and the world need a leader in the Pentagon as soon as possible.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., called a procedural vote Thursday to end debate and allow a vote on the nomination, but GOP opposition prevented him from getting the 60 votes necessary.

Republicans want to delay Hagel's nomination until after the President's Day recess but leading senators have pledged to allow an up or down vote when the Senate returns the week of Feb. 25.

""I will vote in favor of cloture on the day we get back,"" said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who echoed the majority view of GOP senators Thursday who said they would oppose any effort to end debate and vote on the nomination this week.

""Senators have questions -- we have a right to have answers,"" said Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn. ""I think in the end you should vote up or down on cabinet nominees, but I don't think you should prematurely cut off debate of the United States Secretary of Defense nomination two days after it comes out of committee.""

In protesting the delay, Reid noted there has never been a filibuster of a Defense secretary nominee, and he called the potential development ""shocking"" and ""tragic.""

Republicans senators said they have a variety of concerns and requests for more information.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., cited reports that Hagel said in a 2007 speech that the State Department was controlled by Israel. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has sought more information on Hagel's financial records.

Republicans have also sought more specific information from President Obama about the deadly Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya.

""We voted for Sen. Kerry on the same day because we were comfortable,"" Graham said. ""We are not all comfortable here. This is a controversial nominee and a party line vote. There is a desire to not end debate now.""

Hoping to coax some Republicans, the White House counsel's office sent a letter on Benghazi to three key Republican critics, Sens. Graham, John McCain of Arizona and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire.

The letter said that President Obama did not call Libyan President Mohamed Magariaf on the day of the Benghazi attack, Sept. 11, but had Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton call the Libyan leader; Obama spoke to Magariaf the next day, Sept. 12.

Throughout the confirmation process, some Republicans have criticized Hagel -- a former GOP senator from Nebraska -- by saying he has been too critical of Israel and too soft on Iran and its nuclear ambitions. Some also cited what they called Hagel's poor performance during his confirmation hearing.

That said, Graham predicted Hagel's eventual confirmation unless some ""bombshell"" emerges.

During his confirmation hearing, Hagel -- who would replace retiring Defense Secretary Leon Panetta -- said he supports Israel's national security, and would work to block Iran from obtaining the means to make a nuclear weapon.

Hagel clearly has the votes to be confirmed, Reid said, but Republicans are seeking excuses to delay this and other Obama initiatives. ""The pattern has been clear for months,"" Reid said, ""as soon as President Obama's administration responds to one request, Republicans devise another, more outlandish request.""

At the White House, officials said the Pentagon faces challenges that require a new Defense secretary.

Earnest noted that the military faces massive budget cuts as part of the $85 billion budget sequester set to take effect March 1 unless the White House and Congress reach a new debt reduction deal.

Global defense ministers are scheduled to meet in Brussels next week to discuss the Afghanistan withdrawal, Earnest said, and ""we need our new defense secretary to be there.""

The administration has consulted closely with senators from both parties on the Hagel nomination, Earnest said, including more than 10,000 pages of documents. ""Ten different congressional hearings on Benghazi in particular have been held,"" he said.

White House officials said Republicans are only re-litigating the debate over the Iraq War, which Hagel initially supported and then turned against.

Earnest pointed out that Hagel is a Republican now being blocked by Republicans, and that does not send ""a favorable signal"" to the world.

""It's difficult to explain to our allies exactly what's happening,"" Earnest said.

His top aide is one of the candidates

Ex-president and Ahmadinejad critic Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani also registered to run

The Guardian Council vets candidates and decides who can run

Hundreds of candidates are vying to become Iran's next president, with hopefuls ranging from friends to foes of current President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

A total of 686 candidates have registered for the June election, Iran's state-run Press TV reported.

Ahmadinejad is term-limited and cannot run for a third straight term.

But other big names are in the mix, including Ahmadinejad's top aide Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei and former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.

Ahmadinejad has been grooming Mashaei to take over for years, and the two are like-minded in their nationalism and shared disdain for the clerical establishment, according to Geneive Abdo , a fellow at the Stimson Center's Middle East Program and a nonresident fellow at the Brookings Institution.

But the Guardian Council, which is controlled by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, vets candidates and decides who is allowed to run for president, Abdo said. She said the council is not expected to allow anyone from the so-called ""deviant faction"" of Ahmadinejad's supporters to run.

Rafsanjani, on the other hand, has long been a staunch critic and bitter political rival of Ahmadinejad's. He served two terms as president from 1989 to 1997.

Weeks after the 2009 elections, Rafsanjani condemned the regime's violent crackdown against the opposition movement and spoke out for the people's right to peacefully protest.

He later toned down the attacks and made statements of apparent support of the regime and the supreme leader, Khamenei."

Washington (CNN) - It was a sideshow, but a compelling sideshow nonetheless.

The main act was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's at times angry, at times emotional testimony on Wednesday at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's hearing on the September terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

But presidential politics was another storyline, thanks to three of the participants who might be harboring 2016 ambitions.

Clinton, the outgoing secretary of state, faces constant pressure from fellow Democrats to make another bid for her party's presidential nomination, even though she's said over and over that another run for the White House is not in the cards for her.

The other two were Republican Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky. Both were elected in 2010 with strong support from the tea party. Paul has publicly stated that he's considering a bid for the 2016 GOP nomination. Rubio has not been as expressive, but is considered someone who also has White House ambitions.

The two senators were polar opposites in their questioning of Clinton during the hearing, which may say something about both men's possible strategies towards 2016.

Rubio went first, stating, ""We all wish that this had never happened so this hearing would never have to happen. But we're glad to see you here and wish you all the best,"" before asking, ""One of the things that I'm interested in exploring with you is how information flows within the State Department and in particular in hindsight looking forward how we can prevent some of this happening.""

Clinton was gracious in her answer, saying up front that, ""I appreciate your kind words. And I reiterate my taking responsibility.""

While understated, Rubio's three questions probed whether Clinton had inquired into security for U.S. diplomats in Libya in the year leading up to the attacks.

Paul didn't so much question Clinton as confront her.

""I'm glad that you're accepting responsibility. I think ultimately with your leaving you accept the culpability for the worst tragedy since 9/11. And I really mean that,"" declared Paul, adding that, ""Had I been president at the time and I found that you did not read the cables from Benghazi, you did not read the cables from Ambassador Stevens, I would have relieved you from your post. I think it's inexcusable.""

While Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin asked tough questions, Paul's comments stood out.

But when he finally asked a question, it was whether the U.S. was involved in the transfer of weapons from Libya to Turkey.

Clinton appeared almost bemused by the question, saying: ""To Turkey? I'll have to take the question to the record. No one ever raised that with me.""

So which strategy was more effective?

""Rand Paul will never have to worry about winning a general election for president of the United States,"" said Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos. ""Even though it might make the entire party look unreasonable, he can attack Democrats until the libertarians in the GOP base foam at the mouth and it is all to his advantage.""

""Marco Rubio has a different and more serious hand of cards to play. He may not only compete in a general election, he may lead the nation someday. He has to demonstrate that he is a potential president and not a partisan politician. If you want to be president, you have to act like someone who could represent the entire nation,"" added Castellanos, who served as a media strategist for seven presidential campaigns and who co-founded Purple Strategies, a bipartisan public affairs firm.

Another GOP strategist, who asked to remain anonymous so he could speak more freely, said that each senator had a different mission: ""This is a classic case of the tortoise and the hare, with Marco Rubio more concerned about gaining traction than garnering headlines, as Paul's questioning is sure to do.""

Republican strategist Ron Bonjean says that Clinton's poll numbers may be behind Rubio's strategy.

""Senator Rubio understands that Hillary Clinton has very high ratings and the Benghazi crisis has not damaged her image or credibility among American voters. For a 2016 general election, Rubio must get back the lost share of female voters from the last election, so why not let other Senators such as Rand Paul and John McCain go after her?"" asks Bonjean, who served as a top adviser to Republican leaders in the House and Senate before co-founding a public affairs firm.

Clinton did come to the hearing equipped with some very high public opinion numbers.

According to a new ABC News/Washington Post poll released Wednesday morning, just a few hours before the outgoing secretary of state testified in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the morning and before the House Foreign Affairs Committee in the afternoon, two-thirds of Americans said they have a favorable impression of Clinton, while just over one in four saying they have a unfavorable impression.

An NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey released last week indicated that nearly seven in ten approved of the job Clinton was doing as America's top diplomat, with just a quarter of the public saying they disapproved.

But both surveys pointed to a partisan divide, with nearly all Democrats and two thirds of independents, but only a minority of Republicans, giving Clinton a thumbs up. But that partisan divide is not nearly as wide as it is in polling of President Barack Obama.

In the end, all three possible 2016 candidates got something out of this hearing.

Could this 2013 hearing about a terrorist attack in 2012 be one of the opening acts in the 2016 election? And will we see clips from the hearing in 2016 campaign commercials?

Ted Cruz, a leading opponent of Obama’s plan for military action in Syria, had shifted his position on the conflict with an eye towards running for President in 2016. The article, by Alexandra Jaffe, insinuates that Cruz has abandoned his previous hawkish views for one that better positions him to contest the GOP nomination. It is a complete misreading of Cruz’s consistent views on the issue.

To build her argument, Jaffe points to a line Sen. Cruz said on the Senate floor back in June:

“We need to be developing right now a clear, practical plan to go in, locate the weapons, secure or destroy them, and then get out. The United States should be firmly in the lead to make sure the job is done right,” Cruz said.

That is not what President Obama is proposing. Obama has called for a “limited,” or in the words of John Kerry “unbelievably small”, military strike with the intention of “punishing” Syrian strong-man Bashar Assad to deter him from using chemical weapons again. Obama’s planned strike would try to “degrade” Assad’s ability to use chemical weapons in the future.



If Obama’s strike were executed, the Syrian regime would still possess stockpiles of chemical weapons. They would still be vulnerable to seizure by the al-Qaeda-backed terrorists who make up the bulk of Syrian rebels opposing Assad. Obama’s action could even weaken the Assad regime to the point that terrorists in the rebel forces had easier access to these weapons.

Cruz’s position on Syria has always been predicated on keeping these weapons out of the hands of terrorists. In an interview on the Sean Hannity show in late August, Cruz said:

With 9 major rebel groups, 7 of them may well have some significant ties to Al Qaida. If Assad is toppled and replaced by a radical Islamist regime, what would be truly dangerous for the United States, for our allies like Israel and Jordan, is for a radical Islamic government to seize control of those chemical weapons and to deploy them against us or our allies. That should be the focus of the President, and as we’ve seen throughout the Middle East that has not been the focus of the President.

And:

[O]ur concern should be those chemical weapons, preventing them from falling into the hands of Hezbollah, preventing them from falling into the hands of Al Qaida, that should be guiding our actions, not expressing some moral outrage from a university facility lounge.

This week, in The Washington Post, Cruz spelled out a situation wherein he would support military action:

Should we in the future have intelligence that al-Qaeda or Hezbollah is on the verge of acquiring chemical weapons or that Iran is nearing a nuclear breakout, I would support aggressive military action to prevent them from acquiring those weapons because the alternative is unacceptable.

The Hill article would have been more correct if it had detailed Cruz’s consistency on Syria, notwithstanding the political calculus of a potential run for President in 2016. That story, however, would hardly be worth Jaffe hitting her keyboard. While Obama’s foreign policy lies tattered, more useful for her to parse the words of Republicans and pull things out of context."
http://news.yahoo.com/morris-cat-runs-mayor-mexican-city-170928886.html,,[],Morris the cat runs for mayor of Mexican city,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — This mayoral hopeful in Mexico promises to eat, sleep most of the day and donate his leftover litter to fill potholes.

Morris, a black-and-white kitten with orange eyes, is running for mayor of Xalapa in eastern Mexico with the campaign slogan ""Tired of Voting for Rats? Vote for a Cat."" And he is attracting tens of thousands of politician-weary, two-legged supporters on social media.

""He sleeps almost all day and does nothing, and that fits the profile of a politician,"" said 35-year-old office worker Sergio Chamorro, who adopted the 10-month-old feline last year.

Put forth as a candidate by Chamorro and a group of friends after they became disillusioned with the empty promises of politicians, Morris' candidacy has resonated across Mexico, where citizens frustrated with human candidates are nominating their pets and farm animals to run in July 7 elections being held in 14 states.

Also running for mayor are ""Chon the Donkey"" in the border city of Ciudad Juarez, ""Tina the Chicken"" in Tepic, the capital of the Pacific coast state of Nayarit, ""Maya the Cat"" in the city of Puebla and ""Tintan the Dog"" in Oaxaca City, though their campaigns are not as well organized as that of Morris.

Politicians repeatedly rank at the bottom of polls about citizens' trust in institutions. A survey last year by Mitofsky polling agency ranking Mexicans' trust in 15 institutions put politicians and government officials among the bottom five. Universities and the Catholic Church were the top two, respectively.

Morris' cuteness, the clever campaign and promises to donate money collected from the sales of campaign stickers and T-shirts to an animal shelter has attracted cat lovers, but Chamorro said most of his supporters are citizens tired of corrupt politicians and fraudulent elections.

""Morris has been a catalyst to show the discontent that exists in our society,"" Chamorro said. ""Our message from the beginning has been 'if none of the candidates represent you, vote for the cat' and it seems people are responding to that.""

Xalapa, a university city of 450,000 people, is the capital of the Gulf coast state of Veracruz, where residents have in last two years been beleaguered by drug violence, corruption scandals and the killings of at least nine reporters and photojournalists.

During last year's presidential election, a video posted on social networks showed a massive warehouse in Veracruz stuffed with election give-away groceries. Authorities also seized $1.9 million in wads of cash found when police decided to search passengers of a private plane arriving from Veracruz to Toluca, the capital of the home state of now-President Enrique Pena Nieto. Officials later said they had found no wrongdoing and the money was returned.

Giovanna Mazzotti, a 48-year-old university professor from the city of bright colonial buildings and steep streets, said she supports Morris' campaign and plans to go to a party for him being held Friday. The candidate is not expected to attend.

""In this state there is no rule of law, there is no respect for human rights, there are no institutions,"" Mazzotti said. ""It's great that this campaign is showing the fiction in our elections. Every three years politicians laugh at us, it's good to laugh at them a bit, too.""

Morris has a website, a Twitter account and a Facebook page with more than 115,000 'likes,' that makes him more popular in social networks than the five human mayoral contenders. Americo Zuniga, the candidate for the ruling party who is leading in election polls, had 33,000 Facebook 'likes' as of Friday.

His website has a collection of memes that picture Morris yawning while describing his ""ample legislative experience,"" an image that mirrors photographs of lawmakers sleeping during congressional sessions.

Morris' campaign managers are asking supporters to write-in 'Morris' or draw a cat's face on the ballot to send a message to authorities, who are not taking the cat's growing popularity lightly.

Members of the Electoral Institute of Veracruz this week called on voters not to waste their vote on a cat.

""We are asking for people to participate by voting for those citizens registered on the ballots,"" electoral institute president Carolina Viveros told local media this week. ""Everything else is part of expressions happening in social media and I respect that, but you have to vote for the registered candidates, please.""

Morris also has international supporters.

On Friday, the animal-welfare group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals wrote Morris congratulating him for his campaign.

Stubbs, a cat that has been the honorary mayor for more than 15 years of the sleepy Alaska town of Talkeetna, has shown support for Morris by posting his fellow feline candidate's spot campaign on its Facebook page.

http://news.yahoo.com/irans-presidential-race-gets-underway-123818635.html,,[],Iran's presidential race gets underway,"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran's presidential race got underway Tuesday as authorities officially opened the registration process for candidates in next month's election that will pick a successor to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and offer a critical test for reformists battered after years of crackdowns.

The campaign is also taking shape as open season on Ahmadinejad's legacy and his combative style that bolstered his stature among supporters but brought increasing alarm from critics. Ahmadinejad is barred by law from seeking a third term due to term limits under Iran's constitution.

Many of the expected front-runners have promised to seek more measured diplomacy with the West and work to end Iran's nuclear standoff with world powers — although such major policies are ultimately decided by the country's ruling clerics.

In his first comments after filing his candidacy, former nuclear negotiator Hasan Rowhani, pledged ""constructive interaction with the world"" to try to address concerns that Iran could move toward an atomic weapon — a charge Tehran denies.

Meanwhile, the leaders of the reform movement four years ago are now under house arrests and liberal groups have faced relentless pressures since major unrest to protest Ahmadinejad's disputed re-election in 2009.

Prominent pro-reform figures, such as former President Mohammad Khatami, will not seek spots on the June 14 ballot. The news website nasimonline.ir quoted Khatami on Tuesday as saying he won't run, which fits with his previous hints of staying out.

That leaves opposition and liberal groups the option of boycotting the election or falling behind one of the candidates cleared by the ruling clerics, who will vet all hopefuls who submit their names during the five-day registration period. Only a handful of candidates are expected to be approved when the final list is unveiled later this month by the Guardian Council, the group that supervises the election.

The slate is almost certainly to be heavily stacked with candidates considered loyal to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has been angered by challenges to his authority by Ahmadinejad and the president's allies. Among the presumed front-runners is senior Khamenei adviser Ali Akbar Velayati, Tehran Mayor Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf and Rowhani, who registered his candidacy in the first hours as the process got underway Tuesday.

Rowhani also said he wants a ""government of prudence and hope"" that will seek ""reconciliation"" with the West and ease sanctions that targeted Iran's vital oil exports.

He added that he wants to put Iran's nuclear ""case on the right track"" through more active contacts with the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency to bolster Tehran's claims that it only has peaceful objectives.

""Therefore, it shouldn't remain in the Security Council, and the continuation of sanctions doesn't make sense,"" he said.

Inside Iran, the ruling clerics seek an end to the political battles opened by Ahmadinejad and more coordination with the presidency in strategies on nuclear talks and efforts to confront international sanctions over Tehran's nuclear program.

All key policies are made by the theocracy and its inner circle, including the powerful Revolutionary Guard. But the president is the international face of the country and is responsible for increasingly important sectors, such as the nation's stumbling economy.

Most of the main candidates have vowed to shun Ahmadinejad's bombastic style and seek to reduce tensions with the West and its allies. But all strongly support Iran's ability to maintain a full-scale nuclear program, including uranium enrichment. The U.S. and others fear Iran could eventually develop nuclear weapons, but Iran insists it only seeks reactors for energy and medical research.

Another major subplot in the election is the fate of Ahmadinejad's top political protege, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, who is expected to seek a spot on the ballot. Ahmadinejad has endorsed Mashaei as his personally groomed heir. But Mashaei's reputation has faced severe blows in the backlash over Ahmadinejad's failed attempts to encroach on the Khamenei's powers.

Mashaei has been denounced as part of a ""deviant current"" opposing Islamic rule and some critics even claimed he used magic spells to cloud Ahmadinejad's mind. It's possible Mashaei would be rejected for the ballot and force Ahmadinejad — who still has considerable support around the country — to align himself with another candidate.

In a live TV broadcast, Interior Minister Mostafa Mohammad Najjar urged presidential hopefuls to register quickly and not wait until the last moment. Leading candidates usually wait until the last days of the registration period, which ends Saturday evening.

Some presidential hopefuls, mostly little known, rushed to register Tuesday morning. Among them were former housing minister Mohammad Saeedikia, former health minister Kamran Bagheri Lankarani and former Vice President Sadegh Vaezadeh.

Reformists in Iran remain in disarray after the relentless crackdowns in the wake of the 2009 protests over claims their victory was stolen by vote rigging. In recent weeks, controls and blocks on Internet traffic appeared to be boosted in possible attempts to limit opposition voices during the election period.

Opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mahdi Karroubi have been under house arrest since early 2011. Along with Khatami, another former president, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, is not expected to seek comeback bids.

The main liberal-leaning candidate considered by the Guardian Council could be former Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref, who served in Khatami's administration.

Another pro-reform hopeful, former parliament member Mostafa Kavakebian, said he picked his campaign color as green in a clear link to the now-crushed Green Movement of Mousavi."

Talking to Mr. Cutler in his deep headmaster's monotone, Mr. Cheney dispenses with the fig leaf of ""we."" He no longer feigns deference to W., whom he now disdains for favoring Condi over him in the second term and for not pardoning ""Cheney's Cheney,"" Scooter Libby. ""I had a job to do,"" he said. Continuing: ""I got on the telephone with the president, who was in Florida, and told him not to be at one location where we could both be taken out."" Mr. Cheney kept W. flying aimlessly in the air on 9/11 while he and Lynn left on a helicopter for a secure undisclosed location, leaving Washington in a bleak, scared silence, with no one reassuring the nation in those first terrifying hours. ""I gave the instructions that we'd authorize our pilots to take [the Pennsylvania flight] out... After I'd given the order, it was pretty quiet. Everybody had heard it, and it was obviously a significant moment.""

In his memoir, W. described feeling ""blindsided"" again and again. In this film, the blindsider is the eminence grise who was supposed to shore up the untested president. The documentary reveals the Iago lengths that Mr. Cheney went to in order to manipulate the unprepared Junior Bush... ...He filled W.'s head with stories about conflicts between presidents and vice presidents sparked by the vice president's ambition, while protesting that he himself did not want the job. ...He was always goosing up W.'s insecurities so he could take advantage of them. To make his crazy and appallingly costly detour from Osama to Saddam by cherry-picking his fake case for invading Iraq, he played on W.'s fear of being lampooned as a wimp, as his father had been.

This is a matter of justice and responsibility. This failure does not hang solely on President Obama's head or Nancy Pelosi's, although she sure deserves a lot of the blame. It hangs on the whole Democratic Party, and the whole nation, including the rotten state of the Republican Party."

The president nominated former Sen. Chuck Hagel for defense secretary and White House counterterrorism adviser John Brennan for CIA director. The president touted the credentials and years of service each would bring to their respective posts.

On Hagel, Obama said the troops would ""see one of their own"" at the helm of the Pentagon. Hagel is a Vietnam combat veteran, and the president stressed that Hagel would be the first Vietnam vet to lead the department if confirmed.

""Chuck Hagel is the leader that our troops deserve. He is an American patriot,"" the president said.

Yet each nominee is poised to attract tough bipartisan criticism -- and perhaps opposition -- during the confirmation process. While Obama went the relatively safe route with his pick for secretary of state, tapping Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry, his choices for his national security team could cause a ruckus on Capitol Hill.

On Sunday, several Republican senators suggested they would have problems with Hagel, while Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said he is reserving judgment. Republicans question Hagel's commitment to Israel and his toughness when it comes to Iran. But Hagel also has come under fire from gay rights groups for saying in 1998 that a nominee for an ambassador post was ""openly, aggressively gay.""

He has since apologized for those comments. Gay rights group GetEQUAL, though, panned the apology as ""hollow"" and ""politically expedient.""

Texas Sen. John Cornyn had the most strident remarks, saying Obama nominating Hagel sends ""the worst possible message"" to Israel and other U.S. allies in the Middle East, citing in part Hagel's views on Israel and his opposition to Iranian sanctions. He did not say whether he would try to block Hagel's potential nomination during a Senate confirmation hearing.

Hagel would replace Pentagon chief Leon Panetta in Obama's second-term Cabinet.

Newly-elected Texas Sen. Ted Cruz also told ""Fox News Sunday"" that ""it is very difficult to imagine the circumstance in which I could support his confirmation.""

Other lawmakers and groups, though, described Hagel as a solid pick. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., described him as a ""strong advocate for the men and women of our military.""

Veterans of Foreign Wars, without recommending whether he should be confirmed, called him ""uniquely qualified.""

Hagel, a 66-year-old moderate Nebraska Republican, has criticized discussion of a military strike by either the U.S. or Israel against Iran. He also irritated some Israel backers with his reference to the ""Jewish lobby"" in the United States. And he has backed efforts to bring Iran to the table for future peace talks in Afghanistan.

McConnell told ABC's ""This Week"" that Hagel has ""certainly been outspoken in foreign policy and defense over the years. The question we will be answering, if he's the nominee, is do his views make sense for that particular job?""

""This is a controversial pick,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told CNN. ""He is an antagonistic figure when it comes to the state of Israel. It's a signal you're sending to Iran at the worst possible time and to our allies.""

Officials close to the White House have talked up Hagel as a patriot who served in the military with distinction during Vietnam and someone who shares the president's skepticism about potential conflict with Iran and a large U.S. footprint in Afghanistan.

Brennan, meanwhile, is a 25-year CIA veteran who, during the George W. Bush administration, served as director of the National Counterterrorism Center. Despite his credentials, Brennan has faced criticism from both sides of the aisle, as well.

In 2008, he removed his name from consideration for the CIA's top job amid concerns on the left about his connection to enhanced interrogation techniques.

In a letter to Obama at the time, Brennan said he was ""a strong opponent of many of the policies of the Bush administration, such as the preemptive war in Iraq and coercive interrogation tactics, to include waterboarding."" White House officials say they don't expect Brennan to face similar trouble this time around given his four years of service in the Obama administration.

""The issue has been removed from the debate because the president and John Brennan, as his top counterterrorism adviser, brought those techniques to an end,"" Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser, said.

Brennan, though, also has defended the legality of the U.S. drone program, another issue that could come up during confirmation. And following the 2009 Christmas Day bombing attempt, Brennan agitated Republican lawmakers by defending the decision to read the bombing suspect his Miranda rights.

If confirmed, Brennan will succeed David Petraeus, who resigned in November after admitting to an affair with his biographer.

The Obama administration defends Brennan as a candidate with deep knowledge of the CIA's inner workings, and notes he has been on the front lines for more than a decade in the fight against Al Qaeda -- including involvement in the decision to launch the raid against Usama bin Laden.

http://news.yahoo.com/early-vote-count-iran-gives-rowhani-wide-lead-013630646.html,,[],Early vote count in Iran gives Rowhani wide lead,"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran's reformist-backed presidential candidate surged to a wide lead in early vote counting Saturday, a top official said, suggesting a flurry of late support could have swayed a race that once appeared solidly in the hands of Tehran's ruling clerics.

The strong margin for former nuclear negotiator Hasan Rowhani may be enough to give him an outright victory and avoid a two-person runoff next Friday.

Rowhani had just over 50 percent of the nearly 17 million votes tallied, the Interior Ministry reported, well ahead of Tehran Mayor Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf with about 15.3 percent. Conservative Mohsen Rezaei was third with about 12.6 percent.

Minister Mostafa Mohammad Najjar said the final result would be announced by late Saturday. Iran has more than 50 million eligible voters, and turnout in Friday's election was believed to be high.

Many reform-minded Iranians who have faced years of crackdowns looked to Rowhani's rising fortunes as a chance to claw back a bit of ground.

While Iran's presidential elections offer a window into the political pecking orders and security grip inside the country — particularly since the chaos from a disputed outcome in 2009 — they lack the drama of truly high stakes as the country's ruling clerics and their military guardians remain the ultimate powers.

Election officials began the ballot count after voters waited on line for hours in wilting heat at some polling stations in downtown Tehran and other cities, while others cast ballots across the vast country from desert outposts to Gulf seaports and nomad pastures. Voting was extended by five hours to meet demand, but also as possible political stagecraft to showcase the participation.

The apparent strong turnout — estimated at 75 percent by the hardline newspaper Kayhan — suggested liberals and others abandoned a planned boycott as the election was transformed into a showdown across the Islamic Republic's political divide.

On one side were hard-liners looking to cement their control behind candidates such as Jalili, who says he is ""100 percent"" against detente with Iran's foes, or Qalibaf.

Story continues

Opposing them were reformists and others rallying behind the ""purple wave"" campaign of Rowhani, the lone relative moderate left in the race.

The Interior Ministry said Rowhani had 8,439,530 million votes from the 16,716,937 counted so far. Qalibaf trailed with than 2,560,383, and Rezaei had 2,101,330. The other three candidates were further back.

Officials did not say in which parts of the country the ballots were counted. Counts tend to come in first from provincial towns, and Rowhani is thought to be particularly strong in the capital, giving him the prospect of surging further ahead later in the day.

But even if the last-moment surge around Rowhani brings him to the presidency, it would be more of a limited victory than a deep shake-up. Iran's establishment — a tight alliance of the ruling clerics and the ultra-powerful Revolutionary Guard — still holds all the effective power and sets the agenda on all major decisions such as Iran's nuclear program and its dealings with the West.

Security forces also are in firm control after waves of arrests and relentless pressures since the last presidential election in 2009, which unleashed massive protests over claims the outcome was rigged to keep the combative Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in power for a second and final term. He is barred from seeking a third consecutive run.

The greater comfort level by the theocracy and Revolutionary Guard sets a different tone this time. Opposition groups appear too intimidated and fragmented to revive street demonstrations, and even a win by Rowhani — the only cleric in the race — would not likely be perceived as a threat to the ruling structure.

Rowhani led the influential Supreme National Security Council and was given the highly sensitive nuclear envoy role in 2003, a year after Iran's 20-year-old atomic program was revealed.

""Rowhani is not an outsider and any gains by him do not mean the system is weak or that there are serious cracks,"" said Rasool Nafisi, an Iranian affairs analyst at Strayer University in Virginia. ""The ruling system has made sure that no one on the ballot is going to shake things up.""

Yet a Rowhani victory would not be entirely without significance either. It would make room for more moderate voices in Iranian political dialogue and display their resilience. It also would bring onto the world stage an Iranian president who has publicly endorsed more outreach rather than bombast toward the West.

The last campaign events for Rowhani carried chants that had been bottled up for years.

Some supporters called for the release of political prisoners including opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mahdi Karroubi, both candidates in 2009 and now under house arrest. ""Long live reforms,"" some cried at Rowhani's last rally. The rally was awash in purple banners and scarves — the campaign's signature hue in a nod to the single-color identity of Mousavi's now-crushed Green Movement.

""My mother and I both voted for Rowhani,"" said Saeed Joorabchi, a university student in geography, after casting ballots at a mosque in west Tehran.

In the Persian Gulf city of Bandar Abbas, local journalist Ali Reza Khorshidzadeh said many polling stations had significant lines and many voters appeared to back Rowhani.

Just a week ago, Rowhani was seen as overshadowed by candidates with far deeper ties to the current power structure: Jalili and Qalibaf, who was boosted by a reputation as a steady hand for Iran's sanctions-wracked economy.

Then a moderate rival of Rowhani bowed out of the presidential race to consolidate the pro-reform camp. That opened the way for high-profile endorsements including his political mentor, former President Akbar Heshmi Rafsanjani, who won admiration from opposition forces for denouncing the postelection crackdowns in 2009. This, too, may have led to Rafsanjani's being blackballed from the ballot this year by Iran's election overseers, which allowed just eight candidates among more than 680 hopefuls.

Iran has no credible political polling to serve as harder metrics for the street buzz around candidates, who need more than 50 percent of the vote to seal victory and avoid a runoff. Journalists face limits on reporting such as requiring permission to travel around the country. Iran does not allow outside election observers.

Yet it's clear that fervor remains strong for Rowhani's rivals as well.

Qalibaf is riding on his image as a capable fiscal manager who can deal with the deepening problems of Iran's economy and sinking currency.

Jalili draws support from hard-line factions such as the Revolutionary Guard's paramilitary corps, the Basij. His reputation is further enhanced by a battlefield injury that cost him the lower part of his right leg during Iran's 1980-88 war with Saddam Hussein's Iraq, which at the time was backed by the United States.

""We should resist the West,"" said Tehran taxi driver Hasan Ghasemi, who supported Jalili.

Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has not publicly endorsed a successor for Ahmadinejad following their falling out over the president's attempts to challenge Khamenei's near-absolute powers.

Ahmadinejad leaves office weakened and outcast by his political battles with Khamenei — yet another sign of where real power rests in Iran. The election overseers also rejected Ahmadinejad's protege Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei in apparent payback. The usually talkative Ahmadinejad gave only a brief statement to reporters as he voted and refused to discuss the election.

Khamenei remained mum on his own choice even as he cast his ballot. He added that his children don't know whom he backs.

Instead, he blasted the U.S. for its repeated criticism of Iran's clampdowns on the opposition and the rejection of Rafsanjani and other moderates from the ballot.

""Recently I have heard that a U.S. security official has said they do not accept this election,"" Khamenei was quoted by state TV after casting his vote. ""OK, the hell with you.""

Iran's state media hailed the apparently high turnout as a boost for the Islamic Republic's political system.

""A great political epic has shocked the world,"" read a front-page headline in the hardline daily Kayhan Saturday. Khamenei had called for a ""political epic"" on June 14, saying a high turnout would protect Iran against its enemies.

By many measures, this election is far removed from the backdrop four years ago.

Iran's security networks have consolidated near-blanket control, ranging from swift crackdowns on any public dissent to cyberpolice blocking opposition Internet websites and social media. Hackers calling themselves the Iranian Cyber Army disrupted at least a half dozen reform-oriented websites, including one run by well-known political cartoonist Nikahang Kosar.

Prominent reformist politician Mostafa Tajzadeh, who was jailed after the 2009 disputed election, voted from his cell in Tehran's Evin Prison, the semiofficial ISNA news agency reported.

The economy, too, is under far more pressures than in 2009.

Western sanctions over Iran's nuclear program have shrunk vital oil sales and are leaving the country isolated from international banking systems. New U.S. measures taking effect July 1 further target Iran's currency, the rial, which has lost half its foreign exchange value in the past year, driving prices of food and consumer goods sharply higher.

Outside Iran, votes were casts by the country's huge diaspora including Dubai, London and points across the United States.

""I hope we take a step toward democracy,"" said Behza Khajavi, a 29-year-old doctoral candidate in physics from Boca Raton, Florida, as he voted in Tampa for Rowhani.

In Paris, a 25-year-old Iranian student, Sohrab Labib, voted at his nation's consulate while a small group of protesters gathered across the street.

""It's our country. It's our future,"" he said. ""In any case, even a little change could influence our future.""

In the final moments before the five-day registration period expired, Rafsanjani and Mashaei arrived via separate entrances at the Interior Ministry, where all would-be candidates were required to sign up by 6 p.m. Saturday.

Their cinematic entrance prompted cheers from rival groups of supporters who had gathered outside. Scuffles then erupted between the two groups, and order was not restored until police responded.

Ahmadinejad accompanied Mashaei, and the longtime friends held their hands aloft in a show of mutual support. Mashaei thanked the departing president, barred by law from seeking a third four-year term, for encouraging him to run.

Despite the theatrics, neither of the two candidates is guaranteed a place on the June 14 ballot. The Guardian Council, composed of senior clerics and jurists, vets candidates to determine who is qualified to run based on a series of criteria.

Also among the those registering Saturday was Saeed Jalili, Iran’s top nuclear negotiator, who is seen as a hard-liner close to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Other loyalists seeking the presidency include former Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and Tehran’s mayor, Mohammed Baqer Qalibaf.

More than 400 other would-be candidates filed to run, but most are unknown and destined to be disqualified. Fewer than half a dozen candidates are expected to appear on the ballot.

Still, the presence of either Rafsanjani or Mashaei could significantly heighten interest in the election among a population now more focused on paying bills and finding work than on voting, a sentiment clearly evident in interviews here.

“I feel powerless to change anything,” said Mohammad, a chemical engineer and onetime political activist who now drives a taxi. He asked that only his first name be used to avoid problems with authorities. “I have to think of earning a living.”

Iran for weeks has seen speculation and intrigue about the prospective candidacies of Rafsanjani and Mashaei. Both had maintained suspense about their plans until Saturday. Neither is seen as popular with the conservative ruling Shiite Muslim clerical establishment led by Khamenei, who has the last word on policy issues in Iran.

Mashaei has been vilified in hard-line circles as the leader of a “deviant” current that seeks to undermine clerical authority. He has also been accused of exercising excessive influence on Ahmadinejad. Some critics have even likened Mashaei to Rasputin, the Russian mystic who a century ago developed a powerful hold over the family of the last Russian czar.

Apart from their close political associations, Ahmadinejad and Mashaei are also in-laws; the president’s son is married to his aide’s daughter. The two have known each other for 28 years, Ahmadinejad said Saturday.

Rafsanjani, 78, who served as president from 1989 to 1997, has been viewed as a possible voice of reform against the hard-line clerical establishment. He is generally seen as a moderate, despite crackdowns against intellectuals and dissidents during his presidency.

The June vote is the first since the disputed 2009 balloting, when Ahmadinejad was reelected amid allegations of vote-rigging that triggered street protests considered the nation’s most serious unrest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Authorities launched a systematic crackdown against the so-called Green Movement.

(Evan Vucci/AP)

The story line for this coming week is set: President Obama, facing a critical test of strength, will go before the nation to try to rally public opinion and persuade a reluctant Congress to give him the authority to launch military strikes against Syria.

The construct is familiar and appealing. It puts the focus almost singularly on the president as the decisive actor in a drama that has Washington and much of the world in suspense. It speaks directly to the stakes for Obama’s presidency if Congress rejects his appeal. And it renews questions about the president’s leadership skills that have followed him at other crucial moments.

But this narrative, of a commander in chief dependent on using the bully pulpit to save his presidency from a potentially crippling defeat, is only one way to think about the coming showdown in Congress. In fact, it might mischaracterize the way presidential power is exercised while overlooking other factors that ultimately will determine whether Obama succeeds in winning lawmakers’ support.

That, at least, is the implication of a paper written by George C. Edwards III, a political science professor at Texas A&M University. The paper, “Persuasion Is Not Power,” was presented at the American Political Science Association meeting last weekend in Chicago. Written before Obama announced that he would go to Congress ahead of taking military action, it nonetheless offers insight into what powers of persuasion presidents do and do not have.

Edwards begins his analysis with a useful reminder. He quotes a line from presidential historian James MacGregor Burns, “Leadership is one of the most observed and least understood phenomena on earth.” Taking action, for example, is not necessarily leading.

“At its core,” Edwards wrote, “decision making represents a different dimension of the job of the chief executive than obtaining the support of others.” Obama has decided that action is needed in Syria. Having chosen not to move on his own, although he said he has the power to do so, he must try to bring others around to his position.

Edwards also points to the seminal work on presidential leadership of the late Richard Neustadt. It was Neustadt who said that “presidential power is the power to persuade,” and he offered some caveats about how checks and balances inhibit that power.

But, as Edwards argues, many scholars and commentators nonetheless “have fallen prey to the personalization of politics” and therefore have “an exaggerated concept” of the potential for a president to sway public opinion or bend lawmakers to his will. “Faith in the persuasive presidency also simplifies the evaluation of the problems of governing,” he adds.

It is against that backdrop that Obama will be speaking Tuesday.

Reagan, LBJ and FDR

Through much of his presidency, Obama has suffered from criticism that he lacks the power to persuade, especially on Capitol Hill. During his 2012 reelection campaign, his own focus groups reported criticism from sympathetic voters, who wondered why he couldn’t be more like Lyndon B. Johnson, who was famous for his ability to twist arms in Congress.

Edwards looks at three presidents who are viewed as having had exceptional persuasive skills, in part because of major shifts in public policy during their presidencies: Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s, Johnson in the 1960s and Ronald Reagan in the 1980s.

All three produced historic policy successes. Roosevelt launched the New Deal in a flurry of action during his first 100 days as president. Johnson, after his landslide election victory in 1964, created the architecture of the Great Society and engineered the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965. Reagan, after winning the presidency in 1980 by a margin that suggested a resounding popular mandate for conservative governance, pushed a Democratic Congress to pass significant tax cuts.

View Graphic As of Sept. 4, lawmakers appear to be tentatively dividing into four camps over military action in Syria.

But, as Edwards notes, all of them ran into significant resistance to their policy initiatives later in their presidencies. He argues that their early successes owed more to their ability to take advantage of favorable conditions than to their powers of persuasion. Of Roosevelt’s later years, he writes, “Either Roosevelt had lost his persuasive skills, which is not a reasonable proposition, or other factors were more significant in determining congressional support.”

Edwards writes that “we must not assume the power to persuade” and at one point states flatly, “There is not a single systematic study that demonstrates that presidents can reliably persuade others to support them.”

Instead, he writes, “The most effective presidents do not create opportunities by reshaping the political landscape. Instead, they exploit opportunities already present in their environments to facilitate significant changes in public policy. . . . Effective facilitators are skilled leaders who must recognize the opportunities that exist in their environments, choose which opportunities to pursue, when and in what order, and exploit them with skill, energy, perseverance, and will.”

When I talked to Edwards about this on Friday in the context of Obama’s coming speech, he said, “There’s a broad, fundamental point, which is that presidents rarely move public opinion.” He also noted that the default position among the public is to do nothing. “The default position doesn’t advantage the president,” he said.

Swaying public opinion

The Gallup organization put out an analysis Friday that said support for taking military action against Syria for its alleged use of chemical weapons “is on track to be among the lowest for any intervention Gallup has asked about in the last 20 years.”

If anything, Obama’s task looks more difficult today than it did when he announced that he would seek congressional authorization. Obama has been effective in making the moral case for responding to Syria’s use of chemical weapons. He has been far less effective in making the case that military strikes represent the best response.

A week of presidential rhetoric and closed-door meetings with world leaders has produced no demonstrable rise in support for his position. Public opinion, backing from other countries and congressional whip counts have not moved in his direction. Based on Edwards’s analysis, the president’s speech Tuesday will produce minimal changes overall in public opinion.

The president will talk to ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, CNN and Fox News Channel for interviews that will air Monday night, White House officials said.

With the Republican rank and file generally opposed to Obama’s position, despite support from GOP congressional leaders, the president must hope he can sway members of his own party to overcome their doubts and back the resolution for the use of force. The situation is not static, and Obama’s skills as a leader will be important between now and when Congress votes.

Still, if presidents have far less power to persuade than is popularly assumed, and if the default position of a war-weary nation is to oppose what is seen as a potentially risky intervention in Syria, and if many Republican lawmakers are steadfastly against almost anything Obama proposes, the larger question about presidential leadership in this case is why Obama chose the course he took.

Certainly his argument that there are constitutional reasons to seek congressional approval for military action is valid. But if the key to leadership is less the power to persuade and more the capacity to understand the conditions that exist and to exploit them when they are favorable, then Obama’s sudden move to throw the decision to Congress appears all the more risky.

In the end, presidents often get their way on these matters. For Obama, falling short would come at an enormously high cost.

But fears remain about another possible shutdown — and, even worse, a possible default — early next year.

At the same time, experts and foreign officials warned that Washington's credibility had been damaged — a point President Barack Obama echoed.

The deal may assure only a few months of financial order, and the prospect of another possible crisis early in January when the agreement lapses leaves many wondering about U.S. government stability. The short-term nature of the deal makes many uneasy.

""It's a huge threat to the leadership of an indispensable power,"" Klaus Scharioth, Germany's ambassador to Washington from 2006 until 2011, told The Associated Press. ""That's bad news for all of us. It's bad news for Europeans because we're the closest partners of the U.S., but it's bad news for the rest of the world too if they don't exercise the power that they have.""

He expressed the hope that American democracy can right itself in time to prevent another disaster once the current deal expires in January.

""The answer has to come from within,"" he said. ""I hope the current situation is bad enough that people realize it cannot continue.""

International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde said the shaky American economy needs more stable long-term solutions.

""It will be essential to reduce uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt limit in a more durable manner,"" she said in a statement.

The stopgap nature of the solution that avoided a default left some experts warning that repeated dramas could sap confidence in the U.S., causing market problems with global implications.

Standard Chartered economist Samiran Chakraborty in Mumbai said American financial markets may over time lose faith.

""In three months' time, this could be back again,"" said Chakraborty. ""If this kind of pushing it back happens several times, then this comfort that the markets had over the last 20 days that a deal will be reached, that comfort may now be dead.""

Story continues

Also, the congressional cliffhanger might dent longer-term confidence in American government debt, a cornerstone of global credit markets, prompting creditors to demand higher interest.

Xenia Dormandy, director of the Americas program at London's Chatham House, said the U.S. image had suffered a double blow, with both its economic and political credentials called into question

""There is a sense that the U.S. as a reliable ally is not necessarily the case anymore,"" she said, warning that both American allies and adversaries have reached this conclusion. But she, like others, said the damage is most likely short term.

Dormandy and other experts warned that the crisis isn't over and that it is too early to feel relief. Instead, those outside the U.S. must accept that confusion is an integral part of the American democratic system, she said.

Even if the current debate is resolved something else would likely come up and divide the country again, Dormandy added.

""If it's not the debt ceiling, it'd be something else,"" she said.

There are signs that the world is becoming weary of the repeated threats and counter threats that have become a regular feature of U.S. politics. The budget crisis has made many outside the U.S. question the way the world's leading power conducts its business at home even as it seeks to exert influence overseas.

Peter Trubowitz, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics, said the U.S. system is so dysfunctional that it is sending confusing signals abroad.

""It's just gotten to the point now that it's having lots of negative side effects,"" he said. ""The effect is especially felt in Asia, where countries were already concerned about America's commitment to the region.""

Many in Europe enjoyed poking fun at the apparently broken U.S. political system, but the pleasure of laughing at America's troubles seemed to fade as default neared.

The Tea Party movement got short shrift in many quarters, with the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper in Munich, Germany suggesting that Obama was lucky to have such feeble adversaries. But the paper said Obama had also fallen short of expectations.

""It is easy to remain the reasonable, serene statesman if you are dealing with concrete-headed , self-righteous nihilists like the Tea Party lawmakers,"" the influential newspaper said in a commentary. ""It is easy to reject all negotiations if the other side acts like a crazy extortionist gang. Obama played the PR -game of guilt and innocence very cleverly. According to the polls, he wins hands down. But that is not the primary task of the president.""

The newspaper said Obama had not handled his responsibility as president well despite his apparent victory over the Tea Party.

In Israel, a key American ally in the Middle East, commentators said the fight hurt America's overall image even though a deal had been reached before it was too late.

""There is no doubt that damage was done here to the image of American economic stability,"" Israel's economic envoy to Washington, Eli Groner, told Israel's Army Radio. ""It's not good for the financial markets, not in the United States and not around the world.""

In Brazil, a large holder of U.S. debt, there was certainly relief, but also concerns that it's just a temporary fix and more turbulence is ahead. Finance Minister Guido Mantega said the U.S. must come to a lasting answer to the ""temporary solution"" that was found. He added that as long as the threat of another shutdown exists, there will be ""a sensation of insecurity, distrust and therefore damage to business in general.""

Brazil's biggest newspapers carried headlines like O Globo's ""Temporary Relief"" and leading economic columnist Miriam Leitao summed up the mood in the daily.

""Nobody won. Everybody lost. The Obama government was held prisoner by blackmail. The Republican party allowed itself to be controlled by a radical minority and no longer represents the average American's way of thinking,"" Leitao wrote. ""The government as a whole lost credibility and today there is more uncertainty surrounding the world economy.""

Australia%27s conservative opposition has swept to power in a national election

Prime Minister Kevin Rudd conceded defeat Saturday

The win comes despite the relative unpopularity of party leader Tony Abbott

CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australia's conservative opposition swept to power Saturday, ending six years of Labor Party rule and winning over a disenchanted public by promising to end a hated tax on carbon emissions, boost a flagging economy and bring about political stability after years of Labor infighting.

""I know that Labor hearts are heavy across the nation tonight, and as your prime minister and as your parliamentary leader of the great Australian Labor Party, I accept responsibility,"" Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said in a speech to supporters, after calling opposition leader Tony Abbott to concede defeat. ""I gave it my all, but it was not enough for us to win.""

A victory for the conservative Liberal Party-led coalition comes despite the relative unpopularity of Abbott, a 55-year-old former Roman Catholic seminarian and Rhodes scholar who has struggled to connect with women voters and was once dubbed ""unelectable"" by opponents and even some supporters.

But voters were largely fed up with Labor and Rudd, after a years-long power struggle between him and his former deputy, Julia Gillard. Gillard, who became the nation's first female prime minister after ousting Rudd in a party vote in 2010, ended up losing her job to Rudd three years later in a similar internal party coup.

The drama, combined with Labor reneging on an election promise by imposing a deeply unpopular tax on the nation's biggest carbon polluters, proved deadly for Labor's re-election chances.

In his concession speech, Rudd said he would be stepping down as party leader.

""The Australian people, I believe, deserve a fresh start with our leadership,"" he said.

Former Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke blamed the party's loss on its inability to unite. ""This is an election lost by the government rather than won by Tony Abbott,"" he told Sky News.

With more than 90 percent of votes counted late Saturday night, official figures from the Australian Electoral Commission showed the Liberals ahead 53 percent to Labor's 47 percent. The coalition was on track to win 91 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives, and Labor 54.

Abbott, who becomes Australia's third prime minister in three months, will aim to end a period of extraordinary political instability in Australia.

The swing away from Labor was a resounding rejection of Australia's first minority government since World War II. Voters disliked the deals and compromises struck between Labor, the minor Greens party and independent lawmakers to keep their fragile, disparate and sometime chaotic coalition together for the past three years, including the carbon tax.

Abbott has vowed to scrap the carbon from July 2014 — two years after it was implemented — and instead introduce taxpayer-funded incentives for polluters to operate cleaner.

It is unclear whether Abbott will be able to pass the necessary law changes through Parliament, but he has threatened to hold early elections if the Senate thwarts him.

Abbott's popularity seems to have peaked at the right time. Two polls published this past week by Sydney-based market researcher Newspoll are the only ones in which Abbott beat Rudd as preferred prime minister since Newspoll first began comparing the two leaders in 2010.

There is unlikely to be any honeymoon period for Abbott, as he inherits a slowing economy, hurt by the cooling of a mining boom that kept the resource-rich nation out of recession during the global financial crisis.

Australia's new government has promised to slash foreign aid spending as it concentrates on returning the budget to surplus. Labor spent billions of dollars on stimulus projects to avoid recession. But declining corporate tax revenues from the mining slowdown forced Labor to break a promise to return the budget to surplus in the last fiscal year.

Abbott has also promised to repeal a tax on coal and iron ore mining companies, which he blames in part for the downturn in the mining boom. The 30 percent tax on the profits of iron ore and coal miners was designed to cash in on burgeoning profits from a mineral boom fueled by Chinese industrial demand. But the boom was easing before the tax took effect. The tax was initially forecast to earn the government 3 billion Australian dollars ($2.7 billion) in its first year, but collected only AU$126 million after six months.

Abbott was a senior minister in the government of Prime Minister John Howard, who ruled for 11 years until Rudd first took office in 2007.

Under Howard, Australia — one of the world's worst greenhouse gas polluters on a per capita basis — and the United States had been the only wealthy countries to refuse to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on reducing global warming.

One of Rudd's first acts as prime minister was to ratify the Protocol, and he became Australia's most popular prime minister of the past three decades with his promise to introduce a carbon emissions trading scheme. His popularity fell after he failed to persuade the Senate to deliver the scheme.

Saturday's election likely brought Australia's first Aboriginal woman to Parliament. Former Olympian Nova Peris is almost certain to win a Senate seat for Labor in the Northern Territory, but the final results will not be known for days. Less likely is WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's bid for a Senate seat in Victorian state."

Every shot missed.

Republican senators and congressmen on the foreign affairs committees of both houses had insisted that the departing secretary of State come in for a full day of hearings about the deadly terrorist attack on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Some of them must have thought this was a great chance to do preemptive damage to the most popular choice for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. Instead, she made them look like the clumsy bad guys in an Aaron Sorkin political drama.

The State Department’s own independent investigative board has already answered most of the serious questions about the Benghazi tragedy in which four Americans were killed, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. The panel cited the failures of mid-level officials and suggested 29 ways to improve the system. Clinton said implementation of those steps was already 85% complete.

A productive hearing would have concentrated on what else can be done to prevent similar tragedies in the future -- a discussion that would have also included examining why Congress not only consistently underfunds the State Department, but has blocked expenditure of money that has already been appropriated to shore up American diplomatic efforts in several international trouble spots.

Instead, too many of the Republican committee members had been coached to dredge up old questions about the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice. Last September, on the weekend following the attack, Rice went on the Sunday TV news shows and underplayed the terrorist connection, instead suggesting that the incident may have been connected with riots in other Muslim countries that were set off by an online preview of a never-made movie defaming the prophet Muhammad. Questions about why Rice said what she said have been answered repeatedly: She was parroting talking points provided by U.S. intelligence services.

A useful line of questions would have followed up on that answer. An L.A. Times Op-Ed article by former Joint Chiefs of Staff aide Sarah Chayes suggests where such an inquiry would lead: “One lesson to be drawn from the Benghazi snafu is that powerful bureaucratic filters prevent crucial information from reaching senior U.S. government leaders. Whether the client at the top is the U.N. ambassador, the director of Central Intelligence or the president, bureaucracies consistently massage and filter information before passing it up the chain.”

But the Republicans did not want to explore the tendency for bad information to emerge from the intelligence bureaucracy, they wanted to resurrect a specious political attack that got them nowhere in the final days of the presidential campaign. In their wild imaginings, Rice’s ill-informed comments were not just the result of bad information, they were part of an Obama administration effort to dupe the American people.

Clinton easily slapped back this and other equally off-the-wall lines of inquiry. Unlike most of her inquisitors who seemed to be working from Fox News talking points, Clinton was working from fact-based briefings. With their cranky theatrics, Kentucky’s freshman Sen. Rand Paul and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson proved to be perfect foils for Clinton’s virtuoso performance.

At the end of the day, Clinton left the stage looking stronger than ever. The only people who may feel worse about that than the Republicans are the ambitious Democrats who are contemplating a run for the Democratic presidential nomination next time around. On Wednesday, Clinton did not look too old, too tired or too vulnerable. She looked like she could beat anyone."

President Obama is weighing appointments for campaign fundraisers%2C political allies

About 30%25 of ambassadorship selected during the president%27s first term went to political friends and donors

It%27s a time-honored tradition to reward political friends and campaign contributors with plum ambassadorship

WASHINGTON – Visit the U.S. Embassy in Albania, Bangladesh, Chad or most of sub-Saharan Africa or central Asia and you'll find a career diplomat representing the government's interests.

The picture is starkly different, however, in Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the Bahamas – all countries where 90% or more of the ambassadors in recent decades have been political appointees, according to the American Foreign Service Association, which represents career officers. Its data track all appointments since 1960.

It's a time-honored presidential tradition to reward political friends and campaign contributors with plum ambassadorships to Caribbean islands and glittering European capitals. The practice is getting fresh attention as President Obama weighs second-term appointments for the donors and fundraisers who help collect more than a $1 billion for his re-election.

In the 2012 campaign, 773 individuals and couples raised at least $50,000 for Obama, who is expected to fill about 30 political positions in his second term.

""It's a very competitive scene to get one of these jobs,"" said John Podesta, a former chief of staff to President Clinton who oversaw Obama's 2009 transition to the White House. Strong ambassadors have come from both the career and political ranks, he said.

Among the names in circulation: Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of late President John F. Kennedy, as a possible ambassador to Japan. Kennedy was an early Obama supporter, endorsing him in January 2008 over his better-established rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Matthew Barzun, an ex- tech company executive who chaired Obama's 2012 fundraising operation, is viewed as the top contender for England. He served as U.S. ambassador to Sweden during Obama's first term. Neither he nor Kennedy returned phone calls, and administration officials have not answered questions about specific appointments.

White House spokesman Eric Schultz said the administration is seeking qualified candidates from ""all walks of life.""

""Being a donor does not get you a job in this administration,"" Schultz said in a statement. ""Nor does it preclude you from getting one.""

Nearly 30% of Obama's ambassadors have been political appointees – in line with his predecessors. Even so, Susan Johnson, the president of the American Foreign Service Association, said there is too much patronage. She said the system hurts the morale and professional development of career diplomats.

""You are reserving ambassadorships for the moneyed elite,"" she said.

""Anybody who criticizes political appointees on a generalized basis doesn't know what they are talking about,"" said Louis Susman, a top fundraiser during Obama's 2008 campaign. He returned to the United States last week after serving nearly four years as the United States' top envoy to England, a position he called ""the best job in the world.""

The appointments are ""not only based on what they have done for President Obama, but on qualifications and expertise,"" said Susman, a former Citigroup executive.

Not all political appointees have worked out. Cynthia Stroum, a Seattle venture capitalist and Democratic fundraiser, resigned her ambassadorship to Luxembourg in 2011 ahead of a scathing report by the State Department's inspector general that said her ""confrontational management style"" and and ""bullying"" had led to low morale at the embassy.

Stroum said the embassy had morale and financial troubles long before she arrived, and no senior career foreign service officers were sent along to help during her tenure. ""In retrospect, I was ill-equipped and unprepared to manage the challenging situation I had inherited without a backup team in place,"" she said in an e-mail.

Two years later, the ""resignation still stings,"" Stroum added. But, given the chance, ""I would do it all over again.""

Much of the recent attention has focused on Kennedy, who would join a long tradition of high-profile American envoys in Japan.

Previous ambassadors have included former vice president Walter Mondale and former Senate majority leader Howard Baker. Talk of her appointment comes as North Korea escalates its threatening rhetoric and as China and Japan feud over control of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea.

Podesta said Kennedy, 55, is well qualified for the post. A lawyer by training, she serves as president of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum and co-chaired Obama's vice presidential search committee in 2008.

""She's a well-known commodity, who is quite close to the president, and that counts for a lot,"" Podesta said. ""That direct channel to the secretary of State, the national security adviser and the president himself is extremely valuable."""

As well as being Iranian, all the candidates for president are expected to be devoted to Islamic Republic of Iran and keen to make sacrifices for it. According to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, you will need to be 'tenacious and resistant to pressures from enemies.'

As with most states, the president of Iran must be Iranian. If you're really serious about this, you could try changing your passport.

Gender

Women have been elected to the parliament in Iran but the rules say that presidential candidates must be 'statesmen'. What's not clear is if this requirement is intended to exclude women. Thirty women registered to run for president this year but they were all disqualified. Whether this was because they weren't men is not known.

Are you sure you wouldn't rather run as a male candidate? Iran is one of the very few Muslim countries where gender reassignment is recognised by the state.

Religion

Which religion do you follow?

Sunni

The population of Iran is more than 90% Shia and its elected leaders ultimately have to follow the Shia interpretations of Islamic law handed down by the Supreme Leader. There are very few Sunni public officials in office, even in regions where Sunnis are in the majority.

People are going to want to know which form of Islam you practice.

That's going to be a problem. Let's assume that you're willing to convert to Islam. Which form of Islam would it be?

There is little tolerance of views that criticise the Islamic Republic or its institutions. Public officials need to demonstrate their belief in the central values of the republic as established by Ayatollah Khomeini - who remains a key figure in Iranian politics even 20 years after his death.

The Guardian Council is probably looking for a slightly more committed stance.

The results of 2009 election was disputed by all three of Mr Ahmadinejad's opponents and led to violent protest. Two opposition leaders were placed under house arrest and remain there today. Ruling conservatives reject any candidates who have indicated support for those protests, which may be the reason for disqualifying former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani from this election.

President Ahmadinejad has said that his re-election was 'a great victory' and 'completely free'. I'm sure, on second thoughts, you agree.

President Ahmadinejad's close ally, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, was banned from running this year in a move that may have been aimed at preventing a challenge to the power of the Supreme Leader. The list of candidates that have been approved suggests the establishment is determined to find an obedient president who won't stray off-message.

After the election Mr Ahmadinejad will be the former president. The Supreme Leader will still be the Supreme Leader. Does that help with your decision?

Congratulations!

Your views should endear you to the establishment. You can run for president. You are one of the lucky few: 686 candidates registered this year with only 8 approved.

The White House has yet to settle on specific measures, but “we’re hearing that existing power plants are definitely in the mix,” said a person with knowledge of the deliberations, who, like others, asked not to be identified to talk about White House discussions. An announcement could come by mid-July.

Power plants account for about a third of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions, with most of the carbon dioxide coming from coal-fired plants and, to a lesser extent, natural gas generation. Issuing rules to curtail their pollution would almost certainly touch off a battle in the courts and Congress.

“There are only a few substantive, meaningful actions the administration can take short of dealing with existing power plants,” said S. William Becker, executive director of the National Assn. of Clean Air Agencies, a group of local and state air pollution regulators. “So I’d be extremely surprised if existing power plants weren’t one of the top priorities the administration is pursuing.”

The White House declined to comment on the deliberations, instead citing President Obama’s past comments on climate change. The Edison Electric Institute, the power industry’s trade group, also declined to comment.

Still, Heather Zichal, White House deputy assistant for energy and climate change, said at an environmental conference in Washington last week that “in the coming weeks and months, you can expect to hear more from the president on this issue.”

At the start of his second term, Obama identified climate change as one of his top priorities, along with immigration and the federal deficit. But then the administration appeared to pull back. Long-awaited final rules to limit greenhouse gases from new power plants have been delayed, and the White House has been silent on any plan to control emissions from existing power plants.

But in recent weeks, the administration has begun to move on its climate agenda. Most notably, Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced recently that the countries would phase down and eventually halt the production and use of hydrofluorocarbons, potent heat-trapping gases used as chemical refrigerants in air conditioners and other appliances. The United States and China now plan to work to get other countries, in particular India, to join the effort.

Three years ago, Obama pledged that the U.S. would lower its greenhouse gas emissions to 17% less than 2005 levels by 2020. The administration’s fuel economy rules for motor vehicles have helped rein in emissions. Carbon dioxide output has also fallen because the economy slowed and cleaner-burning natural gas plants are replacing coal-fired plants. Yet the U.S. cannot meet that target without enacting new regulations or laws, according to analysts and regulators.

Republican lawmakers have largely rejected the idea that human activity has caused climate change, precluding the chance of passing new legislation. As a result, the administration has to act on its own.

Rep. Edward Whitfield (R-Ky.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on energy and power, could not be reached for comment.

But to make a deep dent in carbon dioxide emissions, the administration would have to tackle the politically touchy subject of power plants. Any rule issued by the Environmental Protection Agency would no doubt trigger a lawsuit by opponents. Congress could also try to attach riders to spending bills that would stop funding for greenhouse gas standards, said Daniel J. Weiss, director of climate strategy at the Center for American Progress Action Fund.

The EPA could make new power plant rules more palatable if it avoided a one-size-fits-all approach, Becker said. The states would have to enforce the standards. The EPA could work with states to set up target reductions of greenhouse gases for each state. A state with many coal plants, such as Ohio, might not be able to meet its target as fast as a state such as Washington, which relies greatly on hydroelectricity.

Environmentalists and regulators said a new climate initiative might contain energy efficiency programs and efforts to eliminate leaks of methane, another potent greenhouse gas, from oil and gas drilling operations and pipelines.

“This is an important issue to the president. It’s a question of his legacy,” said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Beverly Hills), ranking member on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. “Five years from now, people will be talking about what the Obama administration did on climate change, not entitlements or the deficit or whatever they are talking about now. Because climate change is here and real, and we have to address it.”

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/14/New-Report-Scales-Back-Global-Warming,2013-09-14 00:00:00,['Mary Chastain'],New Report Scales Back Global Warming,"Matt Ridley at The Wall Street Journal viewed a few leaks from the 31-page document and talked to one of the senior climate scientists. The temperature rise due to man-made carbon dioxide is lower than their prediction in 2007. Originally a three degrees Celsius increase was predicted, but that number is now expected to be between 1-2.5 degrees Celsius.

Specifically, the draft report says that “equilibrium climate sensitivity” (ECS)–eventual warming induced by a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which takes hundreds of years to occur–is “extremely likely” to be above 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit), “likely” to be above 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and “very likely” to be below 6 degrees Celsius (10.8 Fahrenheit). In 2007, the IPPC said it was “likely” to be above 2 degrees Celsius and “very likely” to be above 1.5 degrees, with no upper limit. Since “extremely” and “very” have specific and different statistical meanings here, comparison is difficult.

Most experts believe that warming of less than 2 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels will result in no net economic and ecological damage. Therefore, the new report is effectively saying (based on the middle of the range of the IPCC’s emissions scenarios) that there is a better than 50-50 chance that by 2083, the benefits of climate change will still outweigh the harm.

Warming of up to 1.2 degrees Celsius over the next 70 years (0.8 degrees have already occurred), most of which is predicted to happen in cold areas in winter and at night, would extend the range of farming further north, improve crop yields, slightly increase rainfall (especially in arid areas), enhance forest growth and cut winter deaths (which far exceed summer deaths in most places). Increased carbon dioxide levels also have caused and will continue to cause an increase in the growth rates of crops and the greening of the Earth–because plants grow faster and need less water when carbon dioxide concentrations are higher."

Millions of dollars' worth of intricately carved figurines, bracelets and other trinkets were all fed into a rock-crushing machine Thursday at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge, rendering the pieces worthless. In as little as 10 years, experts who watched the ivory crushed said, trinkets like those could bring about the extinction of elephants.

""What was once a local or regional problem has become a global crisis,"" said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service director Daniel Ashe. ""How will we answer the question when our grandchildren ask why there are no elephants remaining in the wild? Will they be proud of us when we say it was more important to own beautiful things than for beautiful things to roam in spectacular places?""

The condemnation of ""blood ivory"" supports an executive order by President Barack Obama to fight wildlife trafficking. The event also marked the first time in U.S. history that such a large quantity of ivory, stockpiled over 25 years, was destroyed, although selling ivory within the U.S. remains legal.

""We hear a lot about China, and concerns about the trade there are warranted, but the fact is, the United States is the second-largest market for ivory in the world,"" President and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States Wayne Pacelle said in a statement. ""Ivory trade laws in the U.S. are riddled with loopholes ... and smugglers take advantage of this deficiency.""

A September report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence says the illicit ivory trade has grown to $10 billion and is now a major resource to fund crime and terrorism. Reports said activists claim elephant poaching helped finance al-Shabaab, the Somali terrorist group that recently attacked Kenya's Westgate mall.

Poaching also has grown increasingly brutal. Earlier this year, poachers reportedly used cyanide to kill 300 African elephants for their tusks, and some have used night-vision goggles and AK-47s.

African elephants have returned to the brink of extinction after an increase in poaching. According to a recent report by the National Intelligence Council, wildlife trafficking has doubled since 2007 and just last year, about 30,000 African elephants were slaughtered -- the most since the United Nations-backed Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) issued an ivory ban in 1989.

CITES relaxed the ban in 1997, however, to allow limited sales of ivory in Zimbabwe and later China. According to Peter Knights, the executive director of WildAid, relaxing the ban resulted in ""disaster"" and destroying the ivory is the best thing to do.

""People need to understand that this is as heinous a crime as consumption of heroin,"" Knights said. ""We don’t put heroin back on the market after we seize it, so this [crush] is the right thing to do. I think people who say otherwise are people who [support] this theory of legal supply, which we tried for 20 years, they fiddled with it and it was a disaster and we tried it with another release into China and that was a disaster, too, so you have to look at history and you have to learn its lesson."""

Instead of uniting the environmental movement in renewed opposition to nuclear power, the Fukushima disaster in Japan has divided it still further. An increasing number of green advocates, including some very prominent voices, have declared their support for nuclear power as a clean energy option, even as radioactive water accumulates and the timeline for cleaning up the contaminated areas extends by decades. Can they be serious?

They can. The irony of Fukushima is that in forcing us all to confront our deepest fears about the dangers of nuclear power, we find many of them to be wildly irrational -- based on scare stories propagated through years of unchallenged mythology and the repeated exaggerations of self-proclaimed “experts” in the anti-nuclear movement. As the British environmental writer George Monbiot has pointed out, if we took the scientific consensus on nuclear energy as seriously as we take the scientific consensus on climate change, we environmentalists would be telling a very different story.

The science on radiation tells us that the effects of Fukushima are serious but so far much less so than some of the more hyperbolic media coverage might suggest. The power plant operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., has been releasing enormous quantities of radioactive water into the sea, for example. It sounds scary, but a member of the public would have to eat seaweed and seafood harvested just one mile from the discharge pipe for a year to receive an effective dose of 0.6 millisieverts. To put this in context, every American receives on average 3 millisieverts each year from natural background radiation, and a hundred times more than this in some naturally radioactive areas. As for the Tokyo tap water that was declared unsafe for babies, the highest measured levels of radioactivity were 210 becquerels per liter, less than a quarter of the European legal limit of 1,000 becquerels per liter. Those leaving Tokyo because of this threat will have received more radiation on the airplane flight out than if they had been more rational and stayed put.

For the green movement, which is often justifiably accused of making the perfect the enemy of the good, having to confront real-world choices about energy technologies is painful. Most environmentalists assert that a combination of renewables and efficiency can decarbonize our energy supply and save us both from global warming and the presumed dangers of nuclear power. This is technically possible but extremely unlikely in practice. In the messy real world, countries that decide to rely less on nuclear will almost certainly dig themselves even deeper into a dependence on dirty fossil fuels, especially coal.

In the short term, this is already happening. In Germany -- whose government tried to curry favor with a strongly anti-nuclear population by rashly closing seven perfectly safe nuclear plants after the Fukushima crisis began -- coal has already become the dominant factor in electricity prices once again. Regarding carbon dioxide emissions, you can do the math: Just add about 11 million tons per year for each nuclear plant replaced by a coal plant newly built or brought back onto the grid.

In China the numbers become even starker. Coal is cheap there (as are the thousands of human lives lost in extracting it each year), and if the hundred or so new nuclear plants previously proposed in China up to 2030 are not built, it is a fair bet that more than a billion tons can be added to annual global carbon dioxide emissions as a result.

Japan is also heavily dependent on coal, so it is a fair bet that less nuclear power there will add substantially to the country’s emissions. No wonder the Japanese are insisting on backing off from the Kyoto climate treaty. Looking at the entire global picture, I estimate that turning away from nuclear power could make the difference between whether the world warms by 2 degrees Celsius (bad but manageable) and 3 degrees Celsius (disastrous) in the next century.

We have already made this mistake once. In the 1970s it looked as if nuclear power was going to play a much bigger role than eventually turned out to be the case. What happened was Three Mile Island, and the birth of an anti-nuclear movement that stopped dozens of half-built or proposed reactors; coal plants were substituted instead. It is therefore fair to say that the environmental movement played a substantial role in causing global warming, surely an ecological error it should learn from in years ahead.

Don’t get me wrong: I am an enthusiastic proponent of replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources. I strongly support wind, solar and other clean-tech options. But all energy technologies come with an ecological price tag. Wind turbines kill and injure birds and bats. Solar thermal plants proposed in the Mojave Desert have conservationists up in arms. If we are serious about taking biodiversity into consideration as well as climate change, these concerns cannot be idly dismissed. In terms of land use, nuclear scores very well, because the comparatively small quantities of fuel required means less land disturbed or ruined by mines, processing and related uses.

Take Japan again. According to some recent number crunching by the Breakthrough Institute, a centrist environmental think tank, phasing out Japan’s current nuclear generation capacity and replacing it with wind would require a 1.3-billion-acre wind farm, covering more than half the country’s total land mass. Going for solar instead would require a similar land area, and would in economic terms cost the country more than a trillion dollars.

Those debating the future of nuclear power also tend to focus on out-of-date technology. No one proposes to build boiling-water reactors of 1960s-era Fukushima vintage in the 21st century. Newer designs have a much greater reliance on passive safety, as well as a host of other improvements. Fourth-generation options, such as the “integral fast reactor” reportedly being considered by Russia, could be even better. Fast-breeders like the IFR will allow us to power whole countries cleanly by burning existing stockpiles of nuclear waste, depleted uranium and military-issue plutonium. And the waste left over at the end would become safe after a mere 300 years, so no Yucca Mountains needed there. IFRs exist only on paper, however; we need to urgently research prototypes before moving on to large-scale deployment.

What is needed is perspective. Nuclear energy is not entirely safe, as Fukushima clearly shows, even if the current radiation-related death toll is zero and will likely remain so. But coal and other fossil fuels are far, far worse. And insisting only on renewables risks worsening global warming as an unintended consequence. We need a portfolio of clean energy technologies, deployed in the most environmentally responsible way. Above all, let us base our energy policy on a scientifically valid appreciation of real-world risk, and not on scare stories from the past."
http://news.yahoo.com/no-2-us-nuke-commander-suspended-amid-probe-152501323--politics.html,,[],No. 2 US nuke commander suspended amid probe,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The No. 2 officer at the military command in charge of all U.S. nuclear war-fighting forces has been suspended and is under investigation by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service for issues related to gambling, officials said Saturday.

The highly unusual action against a high-ranking officer at U.S. Strategic Command was made more than three weeks ago but not publicly announced.

Air Force Gen. Robert Kehler, who heads Strategic Command, suspended the deputy commander, Navy Vice Adm. Tim Giardina, from his duties on Sept. 3, according to the command's top spokeswoman, Navy Capt. Pamela Kunze. Giardina is still assigned to the command but is prohibited from performing duties related to nuclear weapons and other issues requiring a security clearance, she said.

Kehler has recommended to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel that Giardina be reassigned, Kunze said. Giardina has been the deputy commander of Strategic Command since December 2011. He is a career submarine officer and prior to starting his assignment there was the deputy commander and chief of staff at U.S. Pacific Fleet.

Two senior U.S. officials familiar with the investigation said it is related to gambling issues. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the probe in incomplete.

Strategic Command oversees the military's nuclear fighter units, including the Navy's nuclear-armed submarines and the Air Force's nuclear bombers and nuclear land-based missiles. It is located near Omaha, Neb.

Kunze said Strategic Command did not announce the Sept. 3 suspension because Giardina remains under investigation and action on Kehler's recommendation that Giardina be reassigned is pending. The suspension was first reported by the Omaha World-Herald.

The spokeswoman said a law enforcement agency, which she would not identify, began an investigation of Giardina on June 16. Kehler became aware of this on July 16, and the following day he asked the Naval Criminal Investigative Service to begin a probe.

The suspension is yet another blow to the military's nuclear establishment. Last spring the nuclear missile unit at Minot Air Force Base, N.D., pulled 17 launch control officers off duty after a problematic inspection and later relieved of duty the officer in charge of training and proficiency. In August a nuclear missile unit at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Mont., failed a nuclear safety and security inspection; nine days later an officer in charge of the unit's security forces was relieved of duty."

Think again.,"For many environmentally conscious Americans, there’s a deep satisfaction to chucking anything and everything plasticky into the recycling bin—from shampoo bottles to butter tubs—the types of plastics in the plastic categories #3 through #7. Little do they know that, even if their local trash collector says it recycles that waste, they might as well be chucking those plastics in the trash bin. “[Plastics] 3-7 are absolutely going to a landfill—[China's] not taking that any more… because of Green Fence,” David Kaplan, CEO of Maine Plastics, a post-industrial recycler, tells Quartz. “This will continue until we can do it in the United States economically.”

China's demand for low-cost recycled raw materials has meant waste shipments from Europe, the US, Japan and Hong Kong have arrived thick and fast, with scrap becoming the top US export to China by value ($11.3bn) in 2011. China controls a large portion of the recycling market, importing about 70% of the world's 500m tonnes of electronic waste and 12m tonnes of plastic waste each year. Sudden Chinese policy changes therefore have a significant impact on the global recycling trade, which puts pressure on western countries to reconsider their reliance on the cost-effective practice of exporting waste, a habit that's reinforced by a lack of domestic recycling infrastructure and a lower demand for secondary raw materials.

Historically, higher labor costs and environmental safety standards made processing scrap into raw materials much more expensive in the US than in China. So the US never developed much capacity or technology to sort and process harder-to-break down plastics like #3 through #7. Green Fence might be a chance to change that, says Mike Biddle, CEO of California-based recycling company MBA Polymers. “China’s Green Fence offers a real opportunity to the US government and recycling industry to step up its efforts on recycling and catalyze a strong domestic recycling market in the US,” Biddle said at a recent webinar on Green Fence.

The policy also has leveled the playing field by allowing large-scale companies that have invested additional money in pollution control and recycling services to operate at a more equal and fair-cost level, according to Kathy Xuan, CEO of full-service recycler Parc Corp. of Romeoville, Ill. With China taking a harder look at the plastic waste it imports, U.S.-based recyclers are looking for opportunities in the changing global market. Parc has doubled production in the last six months, Xuan said in a July 2 webinar hosted by the Society of the Plastics Industry Inc. of Washington.

Think those plastic items you carefully separate from the rest of your trash are being responsibly recycled? Think again. U.S. recycling companies have largely stayed away from recycling plastic and most of it has been shipped to China where it can be processed cheaper. Not anymore. This year China announced a Green Fence Policy, prohibiting much of the plastic recycling they once imported: U.S. recyclers are scrambling to come up with a solution now that China is drastically cutting back on their top import from the U.S.: China's Green Fence policy just might spur the U.S. government and recyclers into much-needed innovation: Some U.S. recycling companies are applauding the news: The opportunity for big change (and big profits) is there. Let's hope the U.S. government and recycling companies don't throw away the opportunity to lead the way."

With the announcement of the U.S. delegation to the 2014 Olympics in Russia, President Obama is sending a strong political message. (Thomas LeGro/The Washington Post)

The White House announced Tuesday that President Obama, Vice President Biden and the first lady will not attend the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, in February, a pointed snub by an administration that is feuding with Russian leaders on a range of foreign policy and human rights issues.

The U.S. delegation will be led by a former Cabinet secretary and a deputy secretary of state, and it will include two openly gay athletes — tennis legend Billie Jean King and ice hockey player Caitlin Cahow — in an apparent bid to highlight opposition to Russia’s anti-gay laws.

This will mark the first time since the Summer Games in Sydney in 2000 that a U.S. Olympic delegation did not include a president, first lady or vice president. The White House made the announcement in a news release late Tuesday.

Officials said Obama’s schedule would not permit him to attend the Games during a two-week period beginning Feb. 7, although they did not specify what the president would be doing instead. Obama, a major sports fan, is “extremely proud” of the U.S. team and “looks forward to cheering them on from Washington,” White House spokesman Shin Inouye said in a statement.

The U.S. delegation “represents the diversity that is the United States,” Inouye said. “All our delegation members are distinguished by their accomplishments in government service, civic activism, and sports.”

Mikhail Mordasov/For The Washington Post Wait 1 second to continue.

In keeping top officials away from Sochi, the United States joins France and Germany among the nations whose senior government leaders will not attend. The Human Rights Campaign, a leading gay rights group, hailed the announcement and called Russia’s anti-gay laws “heinous.”

“The inclusion of gay athletes is incredibly important and sends a potent message about the inclusive nature of our democracy,” said Fred Sainz, a spokesman for the group.

The Obama administration’s relationship with Russian President Vladi­mir Putin has deteriorated this year as the two countries have clashed on several issues. The United States blamed Russia, along with China, for blocking a United Nations resolution authorizing potential military intervention in Syria in the summer, and the two countries have failed to agree on a pact for broader nuclear disarmament.

The White House also was angered by Russia’s decision to grant temporary political asylum to Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who leaked thousands of classified documents detailing the United States’ broad spying apparatus.

In September, Obama canceled a planned bilateral meeting with Putin ahead of an economic summit in St. Petersburg. Among other things, he cited Russian laws, passed in June, that ban the distribution of any materials to minors that suggest homosexual relationships are normal or attractive.

The president met at the summit with civil rights activists instead.

During a news conference in August, Obama said he did not believe it was appropriate for the United States to boycott the Winter Games altogether, as it did in 1980 by staying away from the Summer Games in Moscow after the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan.

“We’ve got a bunch of Americans out there who are training hard, who are doing everything they can to succeed,” he said. “Nobody is more offended than me by some of the anti-gay and lesbian legislation that you’ve been seeing in Russia.”

Obama added that he hoped some openly gay or lesbian athletes would win a medal, which would “go a long way in rejecting the kind of attitudes that we’re seeing there. And if Russia doesn’t have gay or lesbian athletes, then it probably makes their team weaker.”

Cahow, a two-time Olympian, said in an interview with Go Athletes that she believed it made sense for United States to compete in the Sochi Games, comparing it to the example of Jesse Owens, the black track and field star who competed in the 1936 Berlin Olympics in Nazi Germany.

“He demonstrated the greatness of who he was as an African-American athlete,” she said.” It’s precisely the same philosophy we should be taking to Russia. I don’t think any athletes are going to go over there just to protest Russian policy. That makes no sense. They’re going to go over there because they want to compete.”

Janet Napolitano, the former secretary of homeland security who is now the president of the University of California system, will head the U.S. delegation to the opening ceremonies, while Deputy Secretary of State William J. Burns will head the delegation for the closing ceremonies.

U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul and Obama aide Rob Nabors are also scheduled to attend, along with Olympic medalists Bonnie Blair, Brian Boitano and Eric Heiden."

According to a press release, protestors gathered outside of the Ford Foundation on Sept. 26 in an effort to raise awareness of the institutionalized mistreatment and disenfranchisement of LGBT Jamaicans and Simpson-Miller's blind eye to their situation.

In 2011, Simpson-Miller promised LGBT Jamaicans a concise vote in Parliament surrounding the country's LGBT laws. However, this has yet to happen.

Jamaica Anti-Homophobia Stand reportedly wants Jamaica to legalize homosexuality.

Protestors shouted “Gay rights are human rights!” and “Portia, shame on you!” as the Prime Minister came out of the building, blew a kiss at the group, and returned inside.

Since its branding as the ""most homophobic place on earth"" in 2006 by Time magazine, Jamaica has gained international media attention surrounding its treatment of LGBT citizens. The country still operates under an ""abominable crime"" law of buggery that punishes sex between two men or two women with up to ten years of hard labor. As a result, LGBT Jamaicans live enshrouded within a culture of fear and violence, largely driven by the homophobic attitudes their friends and neighbors are raised to embody.

Earlier this summer, five gay men were trapped and barricaded in their home by members of their village after an ""alleged homosexual man... made statements that made them gravely concerned."" Additionally, a mob attempted to attack two men following a minor car accident because they perceived them to be gay, forcing the men to take refuge in a police station.

Increasingly violent instances of anti-LGBT sentiment have also plagued Jamaica, with an openly gay man having allegedly been stabbed to death and his house burned with his body inside late one evening.

The anti-LGBT violence pervading the country has sparked not only international outrage, put protests against Jamaica's homophobic climate. Though coverage of anti-LGBT violence in the country is sparse and limited, smaller news outlets have sprung up, enabling those outside of the nation to gain a perspective surrounding the lives of LGBT Jamaicans.

""The same rights for each and every citizen of Puerto Rico, that's what we are asking for, and that's what we hope to achieve, the country of justice and peace we want. Puerto Rico has to join all the countries of the world that are at the forefront in human rights and equality,"" said Martin in a press release published in his website.

The star is specifically asking the island’s government to support the projects of the Senate 238, and House of Representatives 488 and 437. The initiatives seek to promote equality and prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in any governmental, public or private workplace.

They would also amend the 54 Law of domestic violence in order to include provisions that apply to same-sex couples, and eliminate any provision of gender as a barrier to adoption.

It is not the first time Ricky Martin gets involved in Puerto Rico’s social and political movements. The new “The Voice Australia” judge, has been very vocal in the past supporting the cancellation of polemic TV show “SuperXclusivo” and La Comay, as well as asking for a new and “serious statehood plebiscite.”

He has also turned to social media repeatedly to express his concern regarding Puerto Rico’s decision to deny gay couples the right to adopt children.

Russian opposition to American intervention in Syria has been a major factor in Obama’s decision to seek approval from Congress for military action in Syria. On Saturday, Obama blasted the UN Security Council, a veiled reference to Russia, by calling it “completely paralyzed and unwilling to hold [Syrian President Bashar] Assad accountable.”

While in Moscow, Obama plans to meet with human rights activists Lev Ponomarev and Lyudmila Alexeyeva, legal aid non-governmental-organization director Pavel Chikov, and Coming Out.

Russia and the United States have been at odds over myriad issues over the past few months, including Russia’s grant of asylum to NSA leaker Edward Snowden, Russia’s law against “gay propaganda,” and Russia’s Middle Eastern policy in support of Iran and Syria.

President Obama’s language has become markedly dismissive of Putin and Russia; in a recent press conference, Obama characterized Putin as demonstrating the body language of a “bored kid in the back of a classroom.” That language was said to have infuriated the notoriously prickly Putin. During that same press conference, Obama said, “One of the things I’m really looking forward to is maybe some gay and lesbian athletes bringing home the gold or silver or bronze, which I think would go a long way in rejecting the kind of attitudes that we’re seeing there.”

The White House website brags about Obama’s stellar relationship with Russian leadership: “In one of his earliest new foreign policy initiatives, President Obama sought to reset relations with Russia and reverse what he called a ‘dangerous drift’ in this important bilateral relationship.”

Former Olympian wants Americans to dedicate their performances in Sochi to gay friends and relatives

He appears before Congressional briefing on LGBT equality

Louganis says he has been criticized for stance against boycotting Games

WASHINGTON --- Greg Louganis urged American Olympians on Friday to dedicate their performances at February's Sochi Games to their gay friends and relatives as a means of public but personal protest against Russian anti-gay laws.

Louganis, the former diver and Olympic gold medalist, reaffirmed his position against a boycott of the Sochi Games at a Capitol Hill briefing of the House LGBT Equality Caucus hosted by U.S. Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) and Human Rights First, an international human rights organization based in New York and Washington.

Louganis, who was a member of the 1980 U.S. Olympic team that boycotted the Moscow Games, said his position on a boycott has angered some in the LGBT community but that he believes boycotts ""hurt the wrong people,"" meaning elite athletes who have dedicated their lives to this moment.

Russia's so-called anti-propaganda law, passed by its parliament in June, bars ""propaganda"" about ""nontraditional sexual relations"" as a means of protecting children.

Louganis, who is openly gay, said gay children are born in Russia every day. ""Every child needs to be protected,"" he said.

Human Rights First urged the Obama administration last month to include prominent LGBT people in the official U.S. delegation to Sochi. Louganis said he is open to going, if selected.

""If it would be helpful, I would be there in a heartbeat,"" he told USA TODAY Sports after the briefing. ""If I would be a distraction, that's my concern. I don't want to be a distraction. But if there's any way I can be of benefit, focusing a light on injustice, then I'll be there. I just heard today that my name is in the mix for potentially going. I was like, really? I'm a Summer Olympian. But I think I am pretty level-headed. I have not heard from anyone officially, so it was news to me.""

Louganis said as he understands the law, Olympic athletes in Sochi could potentially be in trouble for wearing rainbow pins in support of the LGBT movement. That, he said, is why he thinks athletes should publicly thank gay friends and relatives who have supported them in their road to the Olympics.

""I don't see how the IOC can say anything about that, because it's personal, not political,"" Louganis said. ""If you have a supportive aunt, uncle, cousin, friend who is gay, you don't win a gold medal by yourself. There is a team of people behind you. And to recognize those people is a way athletes can show their support of the LGBT community and what's going on in Russia.""

Louganis said he got sharply critical pushback when he first said that he is not in favor of boycotting the Sochi Games.

""I got hate mail,"" he said. ""I was told, 'How can I call myself a gay man?' Or that I was a horrible homosexual. I had one really graphic and hateful one and actually reached out to him and we became friends. I was able to express why. I come from the perspective of an athlete.

""I commended the guy who was critical of me. All I'm trying to do is incite action. That's all he's trying to do. We're all on the same side. If you say boycott, that's how you address the issue. I am saying no boycott, but maybe there is another way.""

Louganis said the shelf life of an Olympic athlete is short and that many members of the 1980 U.S. Olympic team lost their opportunities to the sands of time. Louganis came back and won gold medals at the 1984 Los Angeles Games, which were boycotted by Eastern bloc countries, and the 1988 Seoul Games. He also competed in the 1976 Moscow Games.

""I competed on two sides of two boycotts,"" he said. ""We have a full Olympic team from 1980 that was never fully recognized by the world. We wanted to send just one person to carry the flag at opening ceremonies and one to closing ceremonies but to go to Russia and kick ass. That's an athlete's mentality.""

Other speakers at the briefing included Anastasia Smirnova, coordinator of the coalition of LGBT organizations in the Olympics advocacy campaign; Maria Kozlovskaya, legal program coordinator of the Council of Russian LGBT network; and Elvina Yuvakaeva and Konstantin Iablotckii, co-presidents of the Russian LGBT Sport Federation. They described a climate of fear for sexual minorities in Russia and a permissive environment for violence against them.

""What's disturbing is how vague the law is,"" Louganis said. ""These vigilante groups are emerging, basically gangs, targeting LGBT people, especially youth. It's so disturbing that these abuses are happening and there is no one to go to. There is only fear.""

LZ Granderson: The 2014 Olympics taking place in Russia with its extreme anti-gay laws

In Russia, LGBT teens reportedly being kidnapped, bullied, even killed, he says

All of Congress should sign letter for Russia to ensure LGBT Americans' safety, he says

Usually when we talk about the 1936 Olympics in Berlin we focus on two men -- Adolf Hitler and Jesse Owens -- and rightfully so. They are the two with an undeniable impact on history, albeit in vastly different ways.

But in light of President Barack Obama's recent remarks on ""The Tonight Show"" denouncing Russia's new anti-gay laws, laws that have led to bloodshed in the streets, it is important that we remember Marty Glickman and Sam Stoller.

They too were at those games. They too left a mark.

You see, the day before they were scheduled to run in the 400-meter relay, their coach, Dean Cromwell, replaced them.

They were not injured.

LZ Granderson

They did not break any team rules nor were they disqualified for any violations.

They were, however, Jewish, and this was Nazi Germany, which had adopted the Nuremberg laws limiting Jewish citizens' rights a year earlier. Apparently, Cromwell, along with leaders from the U.S. Olympic Committee, decided it would be best if Glickman and Stoller did not compete.

At the time I'm sure it seemed like a decision that would only hurt the two men. After all, the 400, led by Owens, still won gold.

Today we know better.

Today we look at that decision and lower our heads in shame, understanding that it made us complicit with something that evolved into a far worse crime than unjustly replacing a pair of sprinters. In the moment when we should have spoken up, we remained silent.

And so here we are again: an Olympics on the horizon, another host country with recently legislated laws persecuting a group of people, and for a while, we were silent. And then Tuesday happened.

""I've been very clear that when it comes to universal rights, when it comes to people's basic freedoms, that whether you are discriminating on the basis of race, religion, gender or sexual orientation, you are violating the basic morality that I think should transcend every country,"" Obama said, going on to talk about how Russia's treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people goes against the spirit of the Olympics.

He did not call for a boycott.

But on Wednesday he canceled a one-on-one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin planned for September. The White House cited Russia's decision to grant asylum to National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden and ""lack of progress on issues such as missile defense and arms control"" among other reasons. But it also mentioned human rights issues.

Recently, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry received a letter from 88 members of Congress -- Republicans and Democrats -- urging him to do something to guarantee the safety of LGBT Americans visiting Russia during that time. That leaves 447 lawmakers we should be asking why they did not sign that letter.

Last month Buzzfeed provided the world photos of LGBT people being violently beaten by anti-gay protesters and police in Russia.

Russian officials have said they don't condone the attacks, but police have stood by while they happened and then arrested the battered victims for being gay. And because it is unclear whether or not the anti-gay laws will be enforced during the Olympics, the safety of all Americans -- because you can be arrested if police think you look gay or even if you support gays -- is in question.

Which brings me to: Why aren't the names of all 535 members of Congress on that letter?

In talking about the 1936 Olympics, I do not equate what is happening in Russia to what happened to Jewish people during World War II. I just want to remind you that the Holocaust did not happen overnight. It was subtle.

Surgical.

In silence.

These new anti-gay laws are disturbingly similar to the anti-Semitic Nuremberg laws Hitler passed before the 1936 Olympics. And with the Pew Institute finding 84% of Russians believe society should reject gay people, perhaps some saying they object to gays for fear of arrest, the world should question how far Russia intends to go.

We should question how far Russia, our lukewarm ally, intends to go and what our participation in the 2014 Olympic Games will look like generations from now.

In one of his final interviews before passing away in 2001, Glickman told the San Diego Jewish Press-Heritage that there had been some talk of boycotting the 1936 Olympics because of Hitler, but no one foresaw what would happen to the Jews a short time later.

""There is no way in the world that I would think of going to Nazi Germany,"" he said. ""The Holocaust and those things around Nazi Germany which we all loathe weren't in existence in 1936.""

No one can predict the future. But this week Obama showed he learned an important lesson from our Olympic past -- offering silence to appease evil is a senseless endeavor because evil will never be satisfied. Now it's our turn to speak up. There are 447 members of Congress who have yet to sign that letter to Kerry -- we need to be asking why.

The signers are “highly concerned about the heavy attacks that the Russian Federation is facing due to its recent Federal Law…that protects innocence and moral formation of children…”

The signers cite the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that the family is the fundamental unit of society and “is entitled to protection by society and State.”

They assert the new Russian law “protects the innocence of children and the basic rights of their parents recognized in international legislation and treaties.” They also note that the concepts of “sexual orientation and gender identity” are not outlined in the existing binding international treaties and agreements.

Organizations signing the statement come mostly from Europe, but also from the United States and Latin America. Most consider themselves human rights organizations focused on the rights of children and the family.

The statement and large number of signatories challenges the assertion made by gay activists in the United States that the West stands united against the new Russian law.

At the same time that the new statement was released, the Washington Post reports on how the “Russian law isolates gay teenagers.”

Reporter Kathy Lally tells the story of 16-year-old Maxim of Moscow who came out publically as gay at 13-years-old. He says his classmates called him names and that a teacher tried to cut his “longish hair.” A 15 year-old-girl who says she is a lesbian was picked on in her class and then berated when she came out to her mother.

Advocates claim the new law puts these children in further danger since they cannot seek help from adults who could be fined for helping them. Advocates define help in only one way, helping these children continue with the notion they are gay and always will be. But is that the case?

The boy Maxim tells the reporter that he “didn’t become gay. I was born gay.” Someone must have taught him that. An adult taught him that. A child does not come to such a dubious conclusion by himself.

Dr. Paul McHugh, former long-time chief of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University and an emeritus professor there now, tells a different story in an important friend-of-the-court brief he submitted in the Proposition 8/DOMA cases before the US Supreme Court.

From his own professional experience and from the scientific literature he concludes that “sexual orientation is not immutable” and is “not solely an accident of birth.” Further he says that “sexual orientation can and often does change over time.” He also makes the case that “social science experts raise serious doubts about the definability of sexual orientation.”

McHugh’s brief quotes academics friendly to gay rights. Lisa Diamond, writing in Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, says, “There is currently no scientific or popular consensus…that definitively ‘qualify’ an individual as lesbian, gay or bisexual.”

Gail S. Bernstein, who has clinical faculty appointments at the University of Denver School of Professional Psychology and the University of Colorado School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry, writes, “Much of the confusion about sexual orientation occurs because there is no single agreed upon definition of the term…there is not one universally accepted definition of sexual orientation, nor who is bisexual, lesbian or gay.”

What about immutability, the thought that someone put in Maxim’s head that he was born gay?

Letitia Anne Peplau and Linda D. Garnets, writing in the Journal of Social Issues, “Although additional research will fill in gaps in our knowledge, there is no reason to expect that biological factors play anything other than a minor and probably indirect role in women’s sexual orientation.” Rather there is “substantial indirect evidence in support of socialization model at the individual level.”

McHugh and others point out that if genetics were the cause of homosexuality then identical twins would always share the same sexual orientation as they always share the same eye color. In fact, only roughly 30% of identical twins share a gay orientation, according to Kenneth Kendler’s paper in the American Journal of Psychiatry.

McHugh cites a plethora of academic research concluding that, “…sexual orientation is influenced by a variety of factors beyond genetics or biology alone.”

And the most recent statement from the American Psychiatric Association concludes, “Currently there is renewed interest in searching for biological etiologies for homosexuality. However, to date there are no replicated studies supporting any specific biological etiology for homosexuality.”

And what about permanence? Is homosexuality life-long? Once you discover your same-sex desire, does it never change? I am not talking here about therapy to alleviate unwanted same-sex attraction. Rather, academic research shows that quite separate from any such outside influence, that homosexuality is remarkably plastic.

Writing in the Journal of Social Issues, Lisa Diamond and Ritch Savin-Williams write, “Contrary to the notion that most sexual minorities undergo a one time discovery of their true identities, 50% of respondents had changed their identity label more than once since first relinquishing their heterosexual identity.”

Writing in Developmental Psychology Lisa Diamond found “Half of the young women…relinquished the first sexual-minority they adopted.” In fact, a “10-year study of 79 non-heterosexual women reported that 67% changed their identity at least once and 36% changed their identity more than once.”

So, who is supposed to be talking to Maxim about such a complicated and thorny issue? Should it be gay advocates who have an ax to grind? Certainly, they would like to increase their tribe. And often they do this using phony science that says homosexuality is inborn and never changing.

The Russian people, supported by 100 human rights and other groups from around the world, have determined that such unscientific ideologues should be kept out of schools and out of sight of school children, and that the proper teacher for Maxim and others like him are those who love him most, his family.

Finally there is the question of the certitude of 16-year-olds. They are absolutely certain about a great many things. All of us were certain of things at 16 that seem crazy to us now. But, we grow and we change a great many things in our lives.

No doubt buoyed by sketchy adult advice, young Maxim is certain he wants to be with men and that he always will. But science shows that this question is vastly more complicated than that. Like all young people, Maxim deserves space to grow and learn and change and to be free from ideologies that may not have his best interests in mind."

Accordingly, more and more people are starting to acknowledge the flawed nature of all arguments which oppose the legalization of same-sex marriage. This article discusses 10 of the most common positions presented by opponents of marriage equality and outlines why each deserves a failing grade.

1. Nature: ""It's Not Natural"" (FAIL)

The most basic argument presented by gay marriage opponents purports that marriage between two people of the same sex is ""not natural"" and is in violation of the ""natural order."" At this level of the debate there is very little exploration of the inherent validity (or otherwise) of same-sex marriage but rather a fixation on the notion that homosexuality is unnatural: ""It's Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve,"" the opponents quip. In reality, marriage is a societal institution. The natural world didn't create marriage, humans did. Nature-themed arguments against gay marriage say little about the societal institution of marriage but reveal a lot about the homophobia and heterosexism of those who present such arguments. In this regard, the disapproval isn't about gay marriage per se -- it's more about discomfort with homosexuality, period.

2. Procreation: ""Marriage is for Procreation"" (FAIL)

With the procreation argument, opponents of equality argue that the institution of marriage is essentially in place to assist with procreation and the raising of children. They reason that because two people of the same sex cannot procreate that they should not be allowed to marry. While the production of children may indeed be a feature of many heterosexual marriages the capacity to procreate does not determine the legal validity of such marriages. There are many married straight couples who cannot biologically have children or who choose not to. The procreation argument ignores the fact that people marry for a wide range of reasons unrelated to procreation including love, friendship and companionship.

3. Religion: ""It's Against My Religion"" (FAIL)



Christianity-based arguments lead the way in efforts to oppose the legalization of same-sex marriage in America. References to the Bible, the ""sinful"" nature of homosexuality, and ""religious beliefs"" are regularly made by those who seek to rationalize their support of discrimination via religion. Marriage is a religious institution, they argue, and not one for society to tamper with. Given that the U.S.A. is a secular nation, religion should play no role in any discussion about civil and societal laws. In order to legally marry there is absolutely no requirement for a religious ceremony to be held. In this sense, marriage is not a religious institution but a socio-legal one governed by the state. Religious beliefs about marriage should never be enshrined in laws in ways that restrict the freedom of others who do not share those beliefs.

4. Redefinition: ""You're Trying to Redefine the Institution"" (FAIL)

Opponents argue that marriage has always been between a man and a woman and that it should stay that way. They say that efforts to legalize same-sex marriage will fundamentally alter the institution for the worse. History reveals, however, that marriage laws in the U.S.A. and in countries across the globe have been modified repeatedly in response to evolving cultural norms. There was a time when women were the legal property of their husbands. There was a time when a man and a woman of different races couldn't marry each other. There was even a time when not one country in the world had legalized same-sex marriage! Removing discrimination from the institution of marriage does not redefine ""marriage"" -- it simply makes the institution more accessible and reflects the evolution of society.

5. Sanctity: ""It's a Threat to the Sanctity of (Opposite-Sex) Marriage"" (FAIL)

With roots in religion, the sanctity argument posits that marriage is a ""sacred"" institution that only heterosexual couples should have access to. Allowing same-sex couples to marry apparently poses a ""threat"" to ""traditional marriage"" as though somehow heterosexual married couples will all be at risk of divorcing when two people of the same sex marry each other. If those who use the ""sanctity"" argument were genuinely concerned about the institution of marriage they'd focus their efforts on helping those straight married couples who are at risk of divorcing. If marriage was so ""sacred"" they'd also be pursuing the outlawing of heterosexual divorce. They do neither of these things. The only married straight couples impacted by the legalization of gay marriage are those in which one of the parties is a closet-case gay person who dreams of coming out and marrying someone of the same sex!

6. Children: ""It Will Harm the Children"" (FAIL)

Opponents of equality frequently make use of flawed research studies to insinuate that allowing same-sex couples to marry will somehow harm children. They argue that children need a ""mom and a dad"" in order to flourish in life and that legalizing same-sex marriage denies children this opportunity of ""normalcy."" Multiple studies across the social sciences have repeatedly demonstrated that there is no difference in psychosocial outcomes between children raised by opposite-sex couples and those raised by same-sex couples. There is no evidence that children are psychologically harmed by having two dads or two moms. The American Psychological Association (APA), the American Sociological Association (ASA), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has each endorsed the legalization of same-sex marriage and its capacity to provide a stable familial framework for children.

7. Reverse Discrimination: ""Religious People Will Be Discriminated Against"" (FAIL)

Some opponents of marriage equality describe a future in which religious people become the new ""victims"" of oppression. They talk of charity-based religious organizations being ""forced out of business"" for ""sticking to their beliefs"" about marriage. In this reverse scenario, gay people are apparently ""hateful"" for wanting to be treated equally in society. How dare we demand equal rights and criticize those who discriminate against us! In no state of the U.S.A. in which gay marriage is legal is a church legally required to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies. Religious groups and churches are still free to pick and choose who they will and won't marry. Organizations that receive public money, however, and which must adhere to anti-discrimination laws, should rightly be challenged if they engage in discrimination against a protected class of people.

8. Slippery Slope: ""It Will Lead to Marriage Involving Animals, Siblings, Children, or Groups of People!"" (FAIL)

Slippery slopes arguments suggest that legalizing gay marriage will serve as a ""gateway"" for the legalization of marriage involving animals, siblings, children, or groups of people. People who present these scenarios portray a catastrophic future with society crumbling under the weight of rampant immorality and social discord. Efforts to legalize same-sex marriage, however, simply aim to provide same-sex couples with equal access to marriage laws -- there is no intention to change the fundamental definition of marriage as the legal union between two adult human beings who have no direct biological connection with each other. Facts are useful in this regard: of the fifteen countries and 12 U.S. states that have legalized same-sex marriage, none of them has subsequently legalized marriage involving animals, children, siblings, or groups of people.

9. Civil Unions: ""Civil Unions Are Good Enough"" (FAIL)

Some opponents of same-sex marriage support the creation of a ""separate but equal"" platform in which straight couples and gay couples receive the same relationship rights and benefits, but from within different institutional frameworks. They argue that ""marriage"" should be left exclusively for opposite-sex couples and that same-sex couples should be granted ""civil unions."" History has demonstrated that this ""separate but equal"" approach doesn't work. Various countries and American states which initially permitted ""civil unions"" for same-sex couples have subsequently enacted marriage equality legislation. These jurisdictions have pursued such changes because civil union legislation, no matter how valiant the effort, is not able to provide the same rights and benefits as legal marriage. In essence, having a two-class system continues to maintain the erroneous notion that one group (straight people) is more superior to another group (LGBT people).

10. States' Rights: ""States Have the Right to Oppose It"" (FAIL)

This position stresses that states have a constitutional right to make their own decisions about the legalization of same-sex marriage which may include banning it. Ironically, most advocates of this argument also support the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a law which allows the federal government to deny more than one thousand federal rights and benefits to same-sex couples legally married at the state level. The maintenance of a system which allows some states to recognize same-sex marriage and others not to, and which allows the federal government to ignore legal same-sex marriages performed at the state level, sets up a cumbersome and extremely complicated national map of unequal rights and legal nightmares. Those who support a ""states' rights"" approach to same-sex marriage should at least be consistent and drop their support of a federal government act (DOMA) which essentially tramples states' rights.

Conclusion: Marriage Equality is the Future -- Embrace it!

There is no logical or reasonable basis for denying same-sex couples access to secular marriage laws. Opposing the inevitable (marriage equality) is a waste of time, money and energy. I urge all of those who oppose gay marriage to start focusing on their own lives, to accept that they don't need to marry a person of the same sex, and to recognize the right of all Americans to be treated equally under the law: ""liberty and justice for all"" should not come with a disclaimer.

America's right place is at the vanguard of the quest for freedom and equality. The country was founded on that principle, as a nation whose very identity is built on equal rights and true freedom for its citizens. Wednesday's twin decisions by the Supreme Court in favor of gay equality allowed the country to move closer to its founding ideals.

That is not just good news for gay Americans, for their families and for the United States. It is excellent news for the cause of freedom and equality around the globe, and not just for gay people.

What happens in the U.S. matters. It influences views everywhere. That's why when the high court ruled that the federal law perversely named the ""Defense of Marriage Act"" or DOMA is unconstitutional and allowed the anti-gay marriage Proposition 8 in California to be struck down, the news rippled to all corners of the world.

You can be sure the news brought smiles to faces in the Middle East, in Africa and elsewhere.

Frida Ghitis

The U.S. is hardly the first country to have laws and court rulings in favor of equality for gays. In fact, America has fallen far behind in what is now a worldwide movement -- and there is a very long way to go before gays in America can claim they are treated equally, if only by the law.

The Netherlands was the first country to fully legalize gay marriage. It did it without much fanfare in 2000. Since then, more than a dozen countries have followed suit. Gay couples have marriage equality in all corners of the world, not just in liberal Scandinavian nations such as Denmark and Norway, but also in Latin America -- in Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay -- and as far away as South Africa and New Zealand.

Most of the world, however, is not as open to equality. As recently as last year, Iran executed young men by public hanging. It is one of several countries where homosexuality is punishable by death. In many other places, the punishment is prison. In many more, there are intense legal and social restrictions.

In Russia, just this month the Russian parliament passed a law banning ""propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations."" Gay rights demonstrators have been brutally beaten in what has almost become a ritual in Russia and elsewhere.

Despite intense and often well-founded criticism of the United States and complaints that its rhetoric doesn't match its behavior, America wields enormous social, cultural and political sway around the planet.

The court ruling on same sex marriage will be read carefully by some jurists in some countries. Its words may find their way to other rulings.

Other people will read just a few key words.

The DOMA decision by Justice Anthony Kennedy centered on one of the most fundamental concepts of democracy: the notion of equal protection. The ruling articulates an idea that will resonate in the many nations struggling with internal divisions and just learning the meaning of democracy and freedom. Kennedy spelled it out. A government cannot simply deny equality; it cannot treat one group of people differently without a legitimate purpose.

Most people will only see a headline. They will see pictures of celebrations in the United States. They will hear that in the United States gay couples can now marry. That is not quite correct. In most U.S. states same-sex couples cannot marry, although some experts believe the language of the Kennedy decision provides the arguments that will soon make that possible.

Kennedy, the court, the activists and lawyers who brought these decisions may not have thought much about the rest of the world when working on this case. But the whole world was indeed watching.

The whole world started watching a long time ago. More than 300 years ago, Thomas Jefferson appealed to an international audience when he wrote the Declaration of Independence. In the very first paragraph he said ""respect to the opinions of mankind"" was the reason why Americans had to spell out their decision to break free from the British.

""We hold these truths to be self-evident,"" he explained ""that all men are created equal."" And he added that government is created for the purpose of securing unalienable rights, including ""Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.""

That is the essence of America, and it is the reason why the country has exerted such a powerful appeal to those seeking freedom over the centuries.

The U.S. has very plainly strayed on many occasions from that path it so highly charted for itself. But the country has also shown a remarkable ability to correct course because its people have never become so jaded as to forget those founding ideals.

One reason America has succeeded for centuries in staying at the forefront of history is that history, as Georg Hegel said, is the unfolding of an awareness of freedom. A country that stands on the side of freedom and equality is inevitably a country on the right side of history.

With the two Supreme Court rulings, the U.S. edges closer to the vanguard. That's good for America, and it's a very good thing for the world.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/athletics/23722954,,[],Yelena Isinbayeva says anti-gay remarks were 'misunderstood',"Russian athlete Yelena Isinbayeva says she may have been ""misunderstood"" over comments condemning homosexuality and insists she is against discrimination.

On Thursday, the 31-year-old world pole vault champion backed new anti-gay laws brought in by her country.

But in a statement on Friday, she said: ""English is not my first language and I think I may have been misunderstood.

quote What I wanted to say was that people should respect the laws of other countries, particularly when they are guests Yelena Isinbayeva

""I am opposed to any discrimination against gay people on the grounds of their sexuality.""

Isinbayeva's initial comments attracted widespread criticism, with British Commonwealth Games heptathlon gold medallist Louise Hazel saying Isinbayeva's role as a Youth Olympics ambassador should be reviewed.

A sporting icon in Russia who has set 28 world records, Isinbayeva was appointed in the role in 2010 by International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Jacques Rogge.

She added on Friday: ""What I wanted to say was that people should respect the laws of other countries, particularly when they are guests,"" in a statement released via athletics' world governing body the IAAF.

Russia's president Vladimir Putin signed a law in June making it illegal to give under-18s information about homosexuality.

The move has been widely condemned and has led to calls for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi - where Isinbayeva will be the mayor of the main athletes' village.

Pundits critical of Isinbayeva comments

In response, earlier this week, United States runner Nick Symmonds dedicated his world 800m silver medal to his gay and lesbian friends, while Swedish high jumper Emma Green-Tregaro painted her fingernails in the colours of the rainbow flag.

Speaking in English at a news conference on Thursday, Isinbayeva had said of Green-Tregaro's actions: ""It's disrespectful to our country, disrespectful to our citizens because we are Russians.

""Maybe we are different than European people and people from different lands. We have our law which everyone has to respect. When we go to different countries, we try to follow their rules.

quote We can only reiterate that the Olympic Games should be open to all, free of discrimination The International Olympic Committee

""We are not trying to set our rules over there. We are just trying to be respectful.

""We consider ourselves, like normal, standard people, we just live boys with women, girls with boys. It comes from the history.

""I hope the problem won't ruin our Olympic Games in Sochi.""

The IOC said in a statement: ""Clearly English is not her mother tongue and she has now clarified that she was misunderstood and that she is 'opposed to any kind of discrimination against gay people'.

""We can only reiterate that the Olympic Games should be open to all, free of discrimination, and that applies to spectators, officials, media and of course athletes.""

The IAAF's secretary general, Essar Gabriel, welcomed Yelena Isinbayeva's latest statement.

""I think Yelena is very genuine about this,"" he told the BBC. ""I know Yelena very well myself, it is correct her English and her understanding of English is not the best and it's great that she sought to explain exactly what she meant.

""She is somebody who has a great heart, and if she has a lack of English language which we know of she certainly should be careful. When I saw them [Thursday's comments] I thought that doesn't respond to the character and what we know of Yelena."""

Army sergeant accused of killing 16 Afghan civilians

Army says Sgt. Bales shot or stabbed 16 people%2C including women and children

By pleading guilty%2C Bales avoids death penalty

JOINT BASE LEWIS-McCHORD, Wash. — Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales pleaded guilty Wednesday to the slaying of 16 Afghan civilians in 2012, telling a military judge, ""Sir, as far as why: I've asked that question a million times since then. There's not a good reason in this world for why I did the horrible things I did.""

The judge, Col. Jeffery Nance, accepted the plea, ensuring that Bales will avoid the death penalty.

A jury will decide in August whether he will be sentenced to life in prison with or without the possibility of parole.

Bales, 39, entered the plea to premeditated murder and other charges. Nance explained Bales' rights and asked if he understood them. Bales stood and answered, ""Yes, sir, I do.""

Bales, dressed in full uniform, was alert and spoke in a confident voice as he answered the judge's questions, surrounded by six friends and family.

Defense attorneys John Henry Browne and Emma Scanlan said after the hearing that Bales is seeking a sentence of life in prison with the possibility of parole after 10 years.

""There is no death penalty on the table, and there is the opportunity for life with parole,'' Browne said. ""We never thought we'd get there.''

Bales told the judge he had been drinking contraband alcohol, snorting Valium and taking steroids before the attack. He was serving his fourth tour in a combat zone. The allegations against him raised questions about the toll multiple deployments take on U.S. servicemembers.

Bales told the court that he had been taking the steroids to improve his fitness and that they ""definitely increased my irritability and anger.''

The steroid, stanozolol, is a class three controlled substance. Bales was taking it without a prescription or authorization.

The Ohio native and father of two from Lake Tapps, Wash., was charged with 16 counts of premeditated murder in the shootings or stabbings of mostly women and children. He was accused of slipping away from his remote southern Afghanistan outpost at Camp Belambay early March 11, 2012, and attacking mud-walled compounds in two nearby villages.

Bales described one of the killings, saying he ""went to the nearby village of Alkozai. While inside a compound in Alkozai, I observed a female I now know to be Na'ikmarga. I formed the intent to kill Na'ikmarga, and I did kill Na'ikmarga by shooting her with a firearm. This act was without legal justification, sir.""

Nine of the victims, five women and four men, were shot first, and their bodies were burned.

""I remember there being a lantern in the room,'' Bales told the judge. ""I remember there being a fire after that situation, and I remember coming back ... with matches in my pocket."" He said he did not remember throwing the lantern on the bodies, but ""I have seen the pictures, and it's the only thing that makes sense. ""

After killing four people in the first village, he returned to his base, then went out again, he said. When the judge asked him what he expected to do, he said he expected to find people and, ""Sir, I expected to kill them. ""

Bales is with the Army's 2nd Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment, 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team.

Joint Base Lewis-McChord is an amalgamation of the Army's Fort Lewis and the Air Force's McChord Air Force Base. It supports more than 40,000 active-duty Guard and Reserve servicemembers. Bales worked on the base and lived about 30 miles west of it.

A national tide of grief had prompted new attacks on his group and a White House push for more gun control measures, while Mr. LaPierre — who had called for armed guards in every school — was pilloried as a “gun nut” on the cover of The New York Post.

“I don’t know why the N.R.A. or the Second Amendment and lawful gun owners have to somehow end up in a story every time some crazy person goes off and kills children,” he complained to Cleta Mitchell, a board member, who says Mr. LaPierre was “horrified” by the deaths and “insanely angry” that he and the N.R.A. were being blamed.

“These people are out to get us and the Second Amendment,” she recalls him telling the board, “and we’re not going to let them.”

Now, as the Senate takes up gun control measures, the no-compromise strategy Mr. LaPierre has honed over his 35 years with the association is facing its most difficult test in decades. Lawmakers may defy Mr. LaPierre by extending background checks on some gun purchases, which the N.R.A. opposes. But since that grim January planning meeting, Mr. LaPierre has prevented what he and his group feared most: bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines."

And heading into the August 30 Gilberton Borough Council meeting–where he is expected to learn his professional fate–Kessler makes it clear he is willing to lose his job for the Second Amendment.

As time draws closer to the council meeting that could end his police career, Kessler says: “The support has been overwhelming, both national and international. I find it truly amazing how many people finally say, ‘You know what? This guy’s right.'”

In one of the video’s Kessler posted, he stands with an ‘assault rifle’ slung over his shoulder and reads a few pre-scripted words about Secretary of State John Kerry’s support of the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty–the treaty which undermines the Second Amendment by giving the international body ruling authority over small arms in the U.S.

Here’s what Kessler says in the video: “They’re at it again. They just don’t know when to quit. …Kerry says, ‘U.S. will sign U.N. treaty on arms regulations despite lawmaker’s opposition.'” Kessler then looks right into the camera and says, “Secretary of State of John Kerry, that piece of shit…who is he to decide what we can and can’t own? And fuck the U.N. Who are they to decide what we, the American people, can own?”

Kessler then adds: “I have a message to Kerry and to these $%#@suckers in the U.N., ….sign anything you want to sign, it’s not going to mean shit. It [doesn’t] mean shit to me.”

Kessler then screams the Gonzales battle cry, “Come and take it!” and turns away from the camera and opens full-auto fire into the hillside right behind him.

The man loves freedom and he does not want an international body taking it away by degrees. He says that if he loses his job for standing up for the Second Amendment he is “willing to pay that price.”

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/24/bloomberg-mayor-group-tout-big-gun-control-push/,2013-03-24 00:00:00,[],NRA chief says Bloomberg can't 'buy America' amid $12M gun control ad blitz,"NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre on Sunday challenged New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's plan to spend $12 million on ads meant to pressure senators into backing strict new gun control measures, saying Bloomberg ""can't buy America.""

Bloomberg's pro-gun control group Mayors Against Illegal Guns is launching the campaign in states where senators may be on the fence regarding a package of firearms proposals making its way to the Senate floor. As the push for that legislation appears to falter, President Obama plans to soon tour the country to talk about the need to reduce gun violence, a senior administration official confirmed to Fox News. Bloomberg also confirmed Sunday that he plans to spend $12 million to run ads in at least 10 states, suggesting there could be a political price to pay for opposing the measures.

Making clear he intends to be a counterweight to the NRA, Bloomberg said he wants to make sure the powerful gun lobby is not ""the only voice"" in this debate. If he can achieve that, Bloomberg said, ""then I think my money would be well spent.""

LaPierre bristled at Bloomberg's comments.

""He can't spend enough of his $27 billion to try to impose his will on the American public,"" LaPierre said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""He can't buy America.""

Part of the purpose of the ad buy will be to rally support for comprehensive background checks.

LaPierre, though, said the existing system only serves as a ""speed bump for the law-abiding"" without catching the bad actors. LaPierre stressed that the NRA will continue to push for enhanced security in schools, better enforcement of existing federal gun laws, stricter penalties for straw purchases and illegal trafficking, and a system for making sure dealers can check gun purchases against a record of the mentally incompetent and dangerous.

""We're 5 million families. We're 80,000 law enforcement families. ... We want to make people safe. That's what the NRA does every day,"" LaPierre said.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid plans to include a universal background check provision in a gun control package he's preparing for the Senate floor. However, Republicans have so far been reluctant to back universal checks. Reid's office is leaving the door open for substituting the Democrat-backed measure with a compromise proposal, should one emerge.

At the same time, Reid announced this past week that a renewed ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines would not be in the main bill, though it would be voted on as an amendment.

Amid these hurdles, Bloomberg announced the ad buy Saturday. He said they were meant to bring the ""voices of Americans -- who overwhelmingly support comprehensive and enforceable background checks -- into the discussion to move senators to immediately take action to prevent gun violence.""

Bloomberg defended the ad buy Sunday , speaking on the same program as LaPierre, saying it would be a ""great tragedy"" if the momentum for gun control generated after the Newtown mass shooting withered. At the same time, Bloomberg said ""I think we are going to win this.""

We was blunt about the purpose of the ad buys. ""We're trying to do everything we can to press upon the senators this is what the survivors want.""

The two ads posted on the group's website, called ""Responsible"" and ""Family,"" show a gun owner holding a rifle while sitting on the back of a pickup truck.

In one ad, the man says he'll defend the Second Amendment but adds ""with rights come responsibilities."" The ad then urges viewers to tell Congress to support background checks.

In the other ad, the man, a hunter, is shown with the rifle and children playing in the background.

""I believe in the Second Amendment, and I'll fight to protect it. But with rights come responsibilities,"" he says. ""That's why I support comprehensive background checks.""

The Senate is scheduled to debate federal gun control legislation next month. On March 28, the group plans for more than 100 events nationwide in support of passing gun control legislation that includes background checks.

Mayors Against Illegal Guns and other gun-control advocates frequently cite a mid-1990s study that suggests about 40 percent of U.S. gun transfers were conducted by private sellers not subject to federal background checks. Based on 2011 FBI data, the group estimates 6.6 million firearms transfers are made without a background check for the receiver.

A spokesman for Bloomberg could not immediately say if the $12 million was coming from Bloomberg or the mayor's political action committee, Independence USA. The New York Times, which first reported the ad campaign Saturday night, said Bloomberg was bankrolling the ad buy.

A spokesman for the National Rifle Association blasted Bloomberg and the new ads, saying NRA members and supporters would be calling senators directly and urging them to vote against proposed gun control legislation.

""What Michael Bloomberg is trying to do is ... intimidate senators into not listening to constituents and instead pledge their allegiance to him and his money,"" said spokesman Andrew Arulanandam.

Bloomberg has long supported efforts to curb gun violence, including sending New York City undercover investigators into other states to conduct straw purchases from dealers. Last month, Bloomberg's PAC poured more than $2 million into ads supporting Illinois state Rep. Robin Kelly, who won a special primary and ran partly on a platform of supporting tougher gun restrictions.

The new ads will air in states the group believes are divided on gun control. The ad campaign begins on Monday, sources told the New York Post.

The Senate is scheduled to debate federal gun control legislation next month after returning from the Easter Recess, which lasts from March 25 through April 5. On March 28, the group plans for more than 100 events nationwide in support of passing gun control legislation that includes background checks.

Gun-grabbers around the globe believe they have it made.

You see, only hours after re-election, Barack Obama immediately made a move for gun control...

On November 7th, his administration gleefully voted at the UN for a renewed effort to pass the ""Small Arms Treaty .""

But after the tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut -- and anti-gun hysteria in the national media reaching a fever pitch -- there’s no doubt President Obama and his anti-gun pals believe the timing has never been better to ram through the U.N.’s global gun control crown jewel.

I don't know about you, but watching anti-American globalists plot against our Constitution makes me sick.

This Spring, the United Nations went back into session to finalize their radical so-called “Small Arms Treaty.”

With the treaty finalized, a full U.S. Senate ratification showdown could come any time President Obama chooses and there will be very little time to fight back.

If we’re to succeed, we must fight back now .

That's why I’m helping lead the fight to defeat the UN ""Small Arms Treaty"" in the United States Senate.

And it's why I need your help today.

Will you join me by taking a public stand against the UN ""Small Arms Treaty"" and sign the Official Firearms Sovereignty Survey right away?

Ultimately, UN bureaucrats will stop at nothing to register, ban and CONFISCATE firearms owned by private citizens like YOU.

So far, the gun-grabbers have successfully kept many of their schemes under wraps.

But looking at previous attempts by the UN to pass global gun control, you and I can get a good idea of what’s likely in the works .

You can bet the UN is working to FORCE the U.S. to implement every single one of these anti-gun policies:*** Enact tougher licensing requirements , making law-abiding Americans cut through even more bureaucratic red tape just to own a firearm legally;

*** CONFISCATE and DESTROY ALL ""unauthorized"" civilian firearms (all firearms owned by the government are excluded, of course);

*** BAN the trade, sale and private ownership of ALL semi-automatic weapons ;

*** Create an INTERNATIONAL gun registry , setting the stage for full-scale gun CONFISCATION.

I'm sure I don't have to tell you this is NOT a fight we can afford to lose.

Ever since its founding 65 years ago, the United Nations has been hell-bent on bringing the United States to its knees .

To the petty dictators and one-world socialists who control the UN, the United States of America isn’t a ""shining city on a hill"" -- it’s an affront to their grand designs for the globe.

These anti-gun globalists know that as long as Americans remain free to make our own decisions without being bossed around by big government bureaucrats, they’ll NEVER be able to seize the worldwide power they crave.

And the UN’s apologists also know the most effective way to finally strip you and me of ALL our freedoms would be to DESTROY our gun rights.

That’s why I was so excited to see the National Association for Gun Rights leading the fight to stop the UN ""Small Arms Treaty!""

Will you join them by going on record AGAINST global gun control and sign the Official Firearms Sovereignty Survey today?

The truth is there’s no time to waste.

You and I have to be prepared for this fight to move FAST .

The fact is the last thing the gun-grabbers at the UN and in Washington, D.C. want is for you and me to have time to mobilize gun owners to defeat this radical agenda.

They’ve made that mistake before, and we’ve made them pay, defeating EVERY attempt to ram the UN Small Arms Treaty into law since the mid-1990s.

But now time may not be on our side.

And worse ... the UN Small Arms Treaty is no longer the only UN scheme threatening our gun rights.

More and more of the UN's radical agenda is slipping through covertly, under the cover of domestic legislation.

Not long ago, Obama told Sarah Brady from the anti-gun Brady Campaign, ""I just want you to know that we are working on [gun control]. We have to go through a few processes, but under the radar.""

In fact, Hillary Clinton’s State Department recently bragged that Project Gunrunner and Operation Fast and Furious are implementations of the UN's anti-gun agenda!

And I'd place a wager that Obama's M1 Rifle Re-importation Ban was also the UN's agenda dutifully executed by his administration.

Anti-gun UN policy that NEVER received a single vote in the United States Congress !

The UN met recently to pass a final version of the ""Small Arms Treaty"" to be sent for ratification by the Senate.

So if you and I are going to defeat them, we have to turn the heat up on Washington now before it’s too late!

1. Do you believe the U.S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Second Amendment are the supreme law of the land?

2. Do you believe any attempt by the United Nations to subvert or supersede your Constitutional rights must be opposed?

""Yes!"" to these questions, please If you saidto these questions, please sign the survey the National Association for Gun Rights has prepared for you.

But I hope you'll do more than just sign your survey today .

With your help, the National Association for Gun Rights will continue to turn up the heat on targeted Senators who are working to implement the UN ""Small Arms Treaty.""

Direct mail. Phones. E-mail. Blogs. Guest editorials. Press conferences. Hard-hitting internet, newspaper, radio and even TV ads if funding permits. The whole nine yards.

Of course, a program of this scale is only possible if the National Association for Gun Rights can raise the money .

But that’s not easy, and we may not have much time.

In fact, if gun owners are going to defeat the UN's schemes, pro-gun Americans like you and me have to get involved NOW!

So please put yourself on record AGAINST the UN Gun Ban by signing NAGR’s Firearms Sovereignty Survey

And every dollar counts in this fight so even if you can only chip in $10 or $20 , it will make a difference.

Thank you in advance for your time and money devoted to defending our Second Amendment rights.

For Freedom,

Rand Paul

United States Senator

P.S. Only hours after re-election Barack Obama immediately made a move for gun control...

On November 7th, his administration gleefully voted at the UN for a renewed effort to pass the ""Small Arms Treaty.""

What’s worse, the UN met in March to pass the final version of the treaty that will be sent to the Senate for ratification.

If we’re going to defeat the UN ""Small Arms Treaty,"" gun owners have to turn the heat up now before it’s too late !

Please return your Firearms Sovereignty Survey and put yourself squarely on the record AGAINST the UN ""Small Arms Treaty."""

(CNN) – Students in other countries assessing where to study abroad are increasingly scared of coming to the United States because of gun violence, the nation's top diplomat said Monday.

Speaking with CNN foreign affairs correspondent Jill Dougherty in Tokyo, Secretary of State John Kerry said he'd discussed the situation with officials there who said students felt unsafe in the United States.



""We had an interesting discussion about why fewer students are coming to, particularly from Japan, to study in the United States, and one of the responses I got from our officials from conversations with parents here is that they're actually scared. They think they're not safe in the United States and so they don't come,"" Kerry said.

He noted Japan's restrictive gun laws – which prevent private ownership of nearly all firearms, including handguns – and said the country was safer ""where people are not running around with guns.""

In 2011, Japan sent 21,290 students to study in the United States, making it the seventh largest country of origin for international scholars. That was down 14% from the previous year, according to numbers from the Institute of International Education.

Figures have shown international study is down markedly among Japanese students to all destinations, including the United States. Experts have attributed the decline to Japan's low birthrate, the expense of foreign study in a poor economy, and a desire among Japanese young people to remain at home rather than venture to other countries.

Unlike the United States, the right to private gun ownership in Japan is not guaranteed in law. Individuals wishing to possess any firearm must obtain a license and demonstrate a reason for owning the gun.

Out of a total 582 homicides in Japan in 2008, 11 were by guns.

Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), initially signed on as a sponsor of the NRA-supported background check bill. Blumenthal said he had no direct contact with the NRA when he signed on to the measure but had been drawn by the idea of a bipartisan initiative to improve background checks. On Friday, Blumenthal withdrew his support, saying in an interview that he was no longer comfortable with the bill because of “serious unintended consequences” related to provisions governing the mentally ill.

Don't confuse this with what the public wants. That the NRA may win some of this battle doesn't mean they win everything everywhere. They fought and lost in CT, NY, MD and CO. But there are plenty of places where they will win, for now.

David Ignatius:

“I can’t adequately describe how unwilling the American people are to get involved in another war in the Middle East,” said one representative. “We’re almost unable to respond,” given what the United States has spent in Iraq and Afghanistan, said another. He described intervention proposals as “half-baked” and argued that “the last thing we need is something ineffective.” A third member summed up the public mood this way: “We are not just war-weary, we are war-wary.”

And that's a bad thing?

NY Times:

China, which has been deeply suspicious of the American desire to reassert itself in Asia, has not protested publicly or privately as the United States has deployed ships and warplanes to the Korean Peninsula. That silence, American officials say, attests to both Beijing’s mounting frustration with the North and the recognition that its reflexive support for Pyongyang could strain its ties with Washington.

read in tandem with above. While there's no appetite for war in Syria, Asia is saber-rattling country.

Obama said people should be encouraged to sign up for ObamaCare in person, on the phone or through the mail, saying the HealthCare.gov website can't be the only way for people to purchase insurance through new exchanges.

He said it turns out that purchasing insurance is complicated and not everyone will use the website, but he's still confident the website will work for most Americans by Nov. 30.

More On This...

""Effectively, in a month, you've already got half a million Americans who will likely have the security of health care for the first time, in some cases in their lives, as soon as January 1st,"" Obama said. ""And that is life-changing.""

Obama also urged his supporters to continue to fight to promote the law in the midst of criticism surrounding it, saying the law's foes are spreading misinformation.

The call on Monday night represented one of the few remaining environments he can control; unlike last week's press conference in the White House briefing room where he faced tough, at times aggressive, questions from reporters. Though Obama is no longer campaigning for office, he's still pushing several major pieces of legislation in his remaining three years -- and trying to convince his base to keep the faith on ObamaCare.

The president apologized last week for the problem-plagued rollout, and specifically for the millions of cancellation notices that have gone out from insurance companies due to ObamaCare rules, despite his own promise that people could keep their plans if they wanted. Obama, in a sudden about-face, announced that his administration would allow insurance companies to continue offering out-of-compliance plans for another year.

That decision, coupled with the ongoing problems with the ObamaCare website, has stirred concern about the future health of the program. Many insurance companies and commissioners are loath to try and claw back the cancellation notices they've sent out. And while moderate Democrats had pressed the administration to make the change, others suggested the move was unnecessary.

On the president's left flank, the concern is that Obama went too far in caving to the pressure from cancellation notices.

House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that the president is being ""gracious"" but ""that doesn't mean that there was anything in the law that said if you like what you had before 2010 you couldn't keep it.""

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., on ABC's ""This Week,"" also suggested lawmakers knew all along that people could lose their plans -- because they wouldn't meet the minimum standards under the law.

""[Obama] should have just been specific,"" Gillibrand said. ""No, we all knew, the whole point of the plan is to cover things people need, like preventive care, birth control, pregnancy.""

In an email to supporters on Friday, Obama said: ""I want to cut through the noise and talk with you directly about where we're headed in the fight for change.""

Strategist David Axelrod, in another message on Sunday, urged backers to reserve their spot on the call, saying ""OFA has a big role to play here.""

But even some of the president's most trusted hands are starting to raise questions about the administration. Former Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, speaking Monday on NBC's ""Today,"" reiterated his call for firings over the botched rollout of the website.

He said the president is likely frustrated that nobody told him of the problems.

Former White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card Jr., who served under George W. Bush, though, told Fox News that it's ""not credible"" to think the White House didn't know what was going on.

""I suspect the president even knew,"" Card said. ""I think it's time for strong new leadership to come in.""

http://news.yahoo.com/seymour-hersh-alleges-obama-administration-lied-syria-gas-204437397.html,,[],Seymour Hersh Alleges Obama Administration Lied on Syria Gas Attack,"Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh has dropped yet another bombshell allegation: President Obama wasn't honest with the American people when he blamed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for a sarin-gas attack in that killed hundreds of civilians.

In early September, Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States had proof that the nerve-gas attack was made on Assad's orders. ""We know the Assad regime was responsible,"" President Obama told the nation in an address days after this revelation, which he said pushed him over the ""red line"" in considering military intervention.

But in a long story published Sunday for the London Review of Books, Hersh — best known for his exposés on the cover-ups of the My Lai Massacre and of Abu Ghraib – said the administration ""cherry-picked intelligence,"" citing conversations with intelligence and military officials.

A former senior intelligence official told me that the Obama administration had altered the available information – in terms of its timing and sequence – to enable the president and his advisers to make intelligence retrieved days after the attack look as if it had been picked up and analysed in real time, as the attack was happening. The distortion, he said, reminded him of the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, when the Johnson administration reversed the sequence of National Security Agency intercepts to justify one of the early bombings of North Vietnam. The same official said there was immense frustration inside the military and intelligence bureaucracy: ‘The guys are throwing their hands in the air and saying, “How can we help this guy” – Obama – “when he and his cronies in the White House make up the intelligence as they go along?”’

Here's what Hersh alleges:

The administration buried intelligence on the fundamentalist group/rebel group al-Nusra. It was seen, Hersh says, as an alarming threat by May, with the U.S. being aware of al-Nusra member able to make and use sarin, and yet the group – associated with the rebel opposition in Syria – was never considered a suspect in the sarin attacks. Hersh refers to a top-secret June cable sent to the deputy director of the Defense Intelligence Agency that said al-Nusra could acquire and use sarin. But the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Office of the Defense Intelligence Agency could not find the document in question, even when given its specific codes.

Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, told a press conference: ‘It’s very important to note that only the [Assad] regime possesses sarin, and we have no evidence that the opposition possesses sarin.’ It is not known whether the highly classified reporting on al-Nusra was made available to Power’s office, but her comment was a reflection of the attitude that swept through the administration.

The administration was learning about the attack at roughly the same speed civilians were. Hersh says the thorough daily intelligence briefings in the days surrounding the gas attack did not make a single mention of Syria, even as videos and photos of the attack went viral across the Internet. He added that there was revealed a sensor system in Syria that had, in December 2012, shown sarin production at a chemical weapons depot arranged by the Syrian army. Though it was unclear whether this was a simulation or not – all militaries, Hersh says, practice simulations of such things – Obama promptly warned Syria that use of sarin gas would be ""unacceptable.""

‘If what the sensors saw last December was so important that the president had to call and say, “Knock it off,” why didn’t the president issue the same warning three days before the gas attack in August?’

The media succumbed to confirmation bias in response to a UN report on the attack. That report, which is less than certain in its terms, said that the spent weapon ""indicatively matches"" the specifics of a 330mm calibre artillery rocket. MIT professor Theodore Postol and other munitions experts later reviewed the photos and said that it was improvised, likely made locally, didn't match anything in the Syrian arsenal and would not have been able to travel the nine kilometres from the Syrian army base that the media presumed it was fired from.

Postol and a colleague, Richard M. Lloyd, published an analysis two weeks after 21 August in which they correctly assessed that the rockets involved carried a far greater payload of sarin than previously estimated. The Times reported on that analysis at length, describing Postol and Lloyd as ‘leading weapons experts’. The pair’s later study about the rockets’ flight paths and range, which contradicted previous Times reporting, was emailed to the newspaper last week; it has so far gone unreported.

Though a UN resolution nullified the chances of American military intervention, the impact would be significant if the allegations hold up; recall that President George W. Bush's legacy was deeply tainted by charges that the U.S. had no proof of nuclear weapons in Iraq when they said they did. Hersh hints at the seriousness of the charges himself: ""The cherry-picking was similar to the process used to justify the Iraq war.""

At least Mitt Romney won something in 2012.

According to the Tyndall Report, the most covered news story of 2012 on evening news programs was the former Republican presidential candidate's campaign. Romney campaigned for 11 out of the 12 months of 2012.

The second most-covered news story of 2012 was the ongoing conflict in Syria. The violent uprising has become the most dangerous conflict zone for reporters to cover with 28 journalists killed in 2012, including famed war correspondent Marie Colvin and the New York Times' Anthony Shadid. Of the three broadcast networks, CBS aired the most stories on the uprising.

Major news events including Hurricane Sandy, Trayvon Martin's death, the movie theater massacre in Aurora, Colorado, and the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School also made the list. Major political stories including the unemployment rate falling below 8 percent and the contentious negotiations about the federal budget also made the top 20 news stories of 2012.

The list demonstrated evening news broadcasts' focus on domestic stories. Five out of the top 20 stories focused on international topics including the uprising in Syria, the war in Afghanistan, the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, the 2012 London Olympics, and the British royal family.

ABC News' David Muir was the most used reporter of 2012, appearing on air for a total of 426 minutes. NBC News' Andrea Mitchell was second, with a total of 269 on air minutes.

Iran's foreign minister says the meetings are ""something that we can build on""

EU official: ""Concrete progress has been achieved, but ... differences remain""

This marks the latest movement after years of stalemate on Iran's nuclear program

Three days of intensive talks about Iran's nuclear program concluded early Sunday without an agreement, though key players insisted they believed the process is moving in the right direction.

""A lot of concrete progress has been achieved, but some differences remain,"" European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland.

Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif echoed that sentiment, saying ""hopefully we will be able to reach an agreement when we meet again.""

""I think we are all on the same wavelength, and that's important,"" Zarif said. ""And that gives us the impetus to go forward.""

The inclusion of top diplomats such as Zarif, Ashton and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry left some thinking that this latest meeting could lead to a breakthrough to satisfy the international community's desire that Iran not develop a nuclear weapon and, with that, a relaxation of crippling sanctions on the Middle Eastern nation.

That didn't prove to be the case this time, though the parties -- including Zarif and Ashton -- will meet again November 20.

Both Ashton and Zarif fielded questions posited on the assumption France blocked a resolution this time around. But neither singled out any one party, with the Iranian foreign minister saying differences among the countries are only ""natural ... when we start dealing with the detail.""

""We had a very good three days, a very productive three days,"" Zarif said. ""And it's something that we can build on.""

Kerry also voiced optimism, saying, ""I can tell you, without any exaggeration, we not only narrowed differences but we made significant progress. ...There's no question in my mind that we are closer now.""

At the same, the top U.S. diplomat cautioned against jumping into any agreement that everyone is not comfortable with -- especially given the complicated, technical details to deal with and the need to ""build confidence between countries that have really been at odds with each other for a long time now.""

""Diplomacy takes time, and all the parties here need time to fully consider the issues,"" Kerry said.

Iranian president: West shouldn't miss 'unique opportunity'

It is widely believed that Iran harbors aspirations to produce nuclear weapons. Repeated findings by U.N. weapons inspectors indicate that the country appeared to be conducting nuclear weapons research.

Iran has always maintained that its nuclear program is for purely peaceful purposes. Even though Iran has denied working toward nuclear weapons, it has said it will not submit to any plan that would totally eliminate its nuclear program.

For years, international leaders have been fearful of the instability a nuclear-armed Iran could bring to the Middle East.

Those fears, for example, include the possibility of a pre-emptive Israeli strike that could spark a broader conflict. In the past, Iran has threatened Israel with military attack.

Iran has been under crippling U.N. sanctions related to its nuclear program since 2006, and those sanctions have hobbled the nation's economy. The United States first sanctioned Iran over its nuclear program in 2000.

The relatively sudden progress in recent meetings -- after years of stalemate -- follows a slight thaw in relations between Iran and the West under the newly elected President Hassan Rouhani.

Rouhani, himself, weighed in Saturday from afar, taking to Twitter to say ""the West should not miss this unique opportunity.""

Saying the Iranian delegation was participating in Geneva ""with strong will & determination,"" Rouhani tweeted that ""one of the slogans the Iranian nation has embraced is that of 'constructive interaction with the world.'""

The Iranian president also spoke at a meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida, contending that resolving the nuclear issue will ""help restore stability and tranquility to the entire region.""

""The negotiating parties should bear in their mind that this opportunity was created following recent presidential election in Iran as the Iranian peopled called for establishing a constructive interaction with the world,"" Rouhani said, the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported.

Israel: 'Bad deal'

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is not involved in the talks, warned that an agreement is ""the deal of a century for Iran"" but a ""very dangerous and bad deal for peace.""

""It's a very bad deal,"" he said. ""Iran is not required to take apart even one centrifuge. But the international community is relieving sanctions on Iran for the first time after many years. Iran gets everything that it wanted at this stage and pays nothing.""

A senior Israeli government official says Israel backs a diplomatic solution that would dismantle Iran's military nuclear program, ""dismantling all the centrifuges, the removal of the enriched uranium and the closure of the heavy water reactor.""

If Iran wants nuclear power ""for civilian purposes, as it claims, it has no need for centrifuges and heavy water. These are only required to produce nuclear weapons. Like 17 other countries in the world (e.g. Canada and Indonesia), she can do this without a centrifuge and without a heavy water reactor,"" the Israeli official said.

A heavy water reactor at Arak, which weapons experts warn could be used to process weapons-grade plutonium, is under construction and could be activated early next year. Once the reactor is activated, it could be dangerous to incapacitate.

Responding to Netanyahu's remarks, British Foreign Secretary William Hague asked for trust and understanding.

""We haven't done the deal yet. We haven't made this deal yet. So I think everybody will have to comment on it if and when we reach a successful conclusion, and make their judgment about it then. So I'd ask everyone to be patient and to wait for us to arrive at that conclusion if we can.""

Hague stressed that any agreement would ""require some flexibility on all sides."" He is cautiously optimistic, citing the mood among diplomats.

""The atmosphere of these negotiations, as others have told you before, is completely different from the atmosphere of a few months ago. Clearly, dealing with these ministers from Iran is a different experience from the recent past. So a lot of progress has been made, but it's too early to say that we will reach a successful conclusion today,"" Hague said.

U.S. officials outline possible deal

Two senior U.S. administration officials said that, under the potential deal, Iran would agree:

• to stop enriching nuclear fuel to 20% purity.

• to render unusable most of its existing stockpile of such fuel.

• not to use advanced IR-2 centrifuges, which can enrich nuclear fuel five times faster than older centrifuges.

• not to activate a plutonium reactor at Arak.

In turn, the P5+1 would agree:

• to unfreeze some Iranian assets held in banks overseas.

• to consider easing sanctions banning trade in gold, precious metals and petrochemicals.

Other sweeteners were also under consideration, they said.

One of the officials said the deal is designed to ""stop Iran's progress by stopping the shortening of time by which they could build a nuclear weapon"" while providing temporary, reversible sanctions relief to Iran.

That official cautioned that the deal is not done but said it could happen if the Iranians agree to the P5+1's demands.

The P5+1 or EU3+3 -- comprises the United States, France, Britain, Russia, China and Germany"

Editor’s note: Jane Harman is director, president and chief executive officer of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. She was a nine-term congresswoman from California and the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee from 2002 to 2006. The views expressed are her own.

Israel’s surprising election result gives its wing-clipped prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, an opportunity to shift to the center. This option was available to him four years ago when he outmaneuvered Tzipi Livni to form a majority in the Knesset. But he chose instead to move to the right.

Now comes a reset moment. Israel’s economy is fragile, with housing prices soaring and the middle class squeezed. A majority of the mostly secular Jewish population also resents special deals cut with the ultra-Orthodox to shield them from compulsory service in the military and to provide them with benefits not available to others.

The candidates that focused on those issues – the centrist Yesh Atid’s Yair Lapid and the pro-settlement Jewish Home’s Naftali Bennett – received the enthusiastic support of the public. Indeed, the mandate was clear: share the burden.

But it’s not just the economy, stupid. This is in fact a double reset opportunity. Although the Israeli-Palestinian peace process wasn’t the focal point of this campaign (only 18 percent of voters cited negotiations with the Palestinians as the most important issue), most Israelis do still favor a two-state solution. Indeed, a poll last month found that 67 percent of Israelis would support an agreement based on the 1967 borders, including a divided Jerusalem between the two states, with only 21 percent opposed. Even 57 percent of supporters of the Likud and Jewish Home parties said they would support such a deal.

More from GPS: Six things to watch in 2013

Unfortunately, many Israelis no longer believe peace is achievable – at least in the immediate future. But help may be on the way if Israel’s new coalition includes parties open to a deal.

That help comes in two forms. First, the expected confirmation of Senator John Kerry as secretary of state provides an experienced hand with deep personal connections in the Middle East. He has known Netanyahu for 25 years, and their relationship is solid. He also knows and regularly visits Israel’s Arab neighbors. A trip to the region by him shortly after his confirmation could rekindle the focus on negotiations. It could also set up an overdue follow-on trip by President Obama to Israel and her neighbors.

A second source of help is the reported efforts by Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy to reconcile Hamas and Fatah. Notwithstanding muscular street demonstrations by the Hamas leadership in Gaza recently, Hamas is weakened by the loss of its safe haven in Syria. Egypt wants to reassert leadership in the region and got serious respect for brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Gaza late last year. Bringing a unified Palestinian delegation to the peace table would be a major achievement – and a blunt prod to Israel, which worries that Egypt could abandon their peace treaty.

Without a two state solution, both sides lose. Israel loses its legitimacy as a Jewish democracy once the youth bulge in the Palestinian population within its borders becomes a majority. And Palestinians – who have made bad leadership choices but have also been pawns in a local and regional power game – lose out, once again, on the opportunity for peace and prosperity.

As Woodrow Wilson once said, “There are many voices of counsel, but few voices of vision.” As Bibi puts together his new coalition, he would be wise to remember that advice and create a team with the foresight to make sure Israel isn’t one day the biggest loser.

Will Bibi seize the mantle of peacemaker that eluded his predecessors like Rabin, Sharon, and Barak? Only he knows."

The U.S. servicemembers were killed on Saturday by a roadside bomb

It%27s the latest attack against NATO troops since Taliban announced spring offensive

The coalition did not disclose the location of the blast

KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — Seven U.S. service members were killed on Saturday in one of the deadliest days for Americans in Afghanistan in recent months, as the Taliban continued attacks against foreign troops as part of their spring offensive.

The renewed violence came as Afghan President Hamid Karzai acknowledged at a news conference that regular payments his government has received from the CIA for more than a decade would continue. Karzai also said that talks on a U.S.-Afghan bilateral security agreement to govern future American military presence in the country had been delayed because of conditions the Afghans were placing on the deal.

The U.S.-led coalition reported that five international troops were killed by a roadside bomb in southern Afghanistan, and coalition spokesman Capt. Luca Carniel confirmed that all five were American.

The coalition did not disclose the location of the roadside bombing. However, Javeed Faisal, a spokesman for the governor of Kandahar province, said the coalition patrol hit the bomb in the Maiwand district of the province, the spiritual birthplace of the Taliban.

Later, the coalition reported that a soldier with the Afghan National Army turned his weapon on coalition troops in the west, killing two in the most recent of so-called insider attacks. Such attacks by members of the Afghan security forces against their fellow colleagues or international troops have eroded confidence in the Afghan forces as they work to take over from foreign forces.

Both killed were American, according to two U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose the nationalities ahead of an official announcement.

It was the fourth time since last summer that seven Americans have been killed on a single day in the war.

On March 12, a Black Hawk helicopter crashed outside Kandahar, killing five U.S. troops. Two more U.S. troops were killed that day by an insider attack.

And on April 6, Afghan militants killed six Americans, including a young female diplomat, and an Afghan doctor in a pair of attacks in southern Afghanistan. The three U.S. service members, two U.S. civilians and the doctor were killed when the group was struck by an explosion while traveling to donate books to a school. A seventh American, a civilian, was killed in a separate insurgent attack in the east.

On Aug. 16, 2012, seven American service members were killed in two attacks in Kandahar province. Six were killed when their helicopter was shot down by insurgents and one soldier died in a roadside bomb explosion.

At the news conference, Karzai said he had met earlier in the day with the Kabul station chief of the CIA and was reassured that the agency's payments to the Afghan government would continue. The New York Times had reported that for more than a decade, the CIA had given the Afghan National Security Council tens of millions of dollars in monthly payments delivered in suitcases, backpacks and plastic shopping bags.

Karzai said he told the station chief: ""'Because of all these rumors in the media, please do not cut all this money because we really need it. We want to continue this sort of assistance.' And he promised that they are not going to cut this money.""

Karzai described the payments as a form of ""government-to-government"" assistance, and while he wouldn't say how much the CIA gave to the National Directorate of Security, which is the Afghan intelligence service, he said the financial help was very useful. He claimed that much of the money was used to care for wounded employees of the NDS, Afghanistan's intelligence service, and operational expenses.

""We have spent it in different areas (and) solved lots of our problems,"" Karzai said.

He said the CIA payments were made in cash and that ""all the money which we have spent, receipts have been sent back to the intelligence service of the United States monthly.""

The CIA declined to comment on Saturday.

During the news conference at the presidential palace, Karzai also discussed ongoing negotiations on a U.S.-Afghan bilateral security agreement. He said talks had been delayed because of certain conditions that Afghanistan was insisting be included in the pact, which will govern a U.S. military presence after 2014 when nearly all foreign combat troops are to have finished their withdrawal from Afghanistan. The talks, which started in late 2012, are set to last up to a year.

President Barack Obama has not said how many troops will remain, although there have been estimates ranging from 8,000 to 12,000. It is unlikely such an announcement will be made until the security agreement is signed. Those troops would help train Afghan forces and also carry out operations against al-Qaida and other militant groups.

Karzai said Afghanistan was ready to sign a deal as long as the American government in exchange for being able to stay on bases in the country agrees to terms of Afghan security, funding assistance and help with training and equipping Afghan security forces. It is thought that the contentious issue of providing U.S. troops immunity from Afghan law is a low priority for the Afghan government in the negotiations.

The Afghan government has not said how much rent it would want for three or four U.S. bases, but it is believed to be in the billions. Afghanistan is also thought to be seeking security guarantees to protect its porous borders, including the frontier with Pakistan that is the main infiltration route for insurgents who retain sanctuary in Pakistan's lawless tribal areas.

It was unclear how Karzai expected the United States or any of its allies to guarantee Afghanistan's borders against attack."

http://news.yahoo.com/petraeus-email-objected-benghazi-talking-points-220924269.html,,[],Petraeus email objected to Benghazi talking points,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Then CIA-Director David Petraeus objected to the final talking points the Obama administration used after the deadly assault on a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, because he wanted to see more details revealed to the public, according to emails released Wednesday by the White House.

Under pressure in the investigation that continues eight months after the attacks, the White House on Wednesday released 99 pages of emails and a single page of hand-written notes made by Petraeus' deputy, Mike Morell, after a meeting at the White House on Saturday, Sept. 15. On that page, Morell scratched out from the CIA's early drafts of talking points mentions of al-Qaida, the experience of fighters in Libya, Islamic extremists and a warning to the Cairo embassy on the eve of the attacks of calls for a demonstration and break-in by jihadists.

Petraeus apparently was displeased by the removal of so much of the material his analysts initially had proposed for release. The talking points were sent to U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice to prepare her for an appearance on news shows on Sunday, Sept. 16, and also to members of the House Intelligence Committee.

""No mention of the cable to Cairo, either?"" Petraeus wrote after receiving Morell's edited version, developed after an intense back-and-forth among Obama administration officials. ""Frankly, I'd just as soon not use this, then.""

Petreaus' email comes at the end of extensive back-and-forth between officials at the CIA, White House, State Department and other agencies weighing in on a public explanation for the Sept. 11, 2012, attack that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans

The emails were partially blacked out, including removal of names of senders and recipients who are career employees at the CIA and elsewhere.

The emails show only minor edits were requested by the White House, and most of the objections came from the State Department. ""The White House cleared quickly, but State has major concerns,"" read an email that a CIA official sent to Petraeus on Friday, Sept. 14.

Story continues

Critics have highlighted an email by then-State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland that expressed concern that any mention of prior warnings or the involvement of al-Qaida would give congressional Republicans ammunition to attack the administration in the weeks before the presidential election. Fighting terror was one of President Barack Obama's re-election strong points

That email was among those released by the White House, sent by Nuland on Sept. 14 at 7:39 p.m. to officials in the White House, State Department and CIA. She wrote she was concerned they could prejudice the investigation and be ""abused by members to beat the State Department for not paying attention to agency warnings so why do we want to feed that either? Concerned.""

After Nuland sent several more emails throughout that Friday evening expressing further concerns, Jake Sullivan, then-deputy chief of staff at the State Department, said the issues would be worked out at a meeting at the White House on Saturday morning.

A senior U.S. intelligence official told reporters Wednesday that Morell made the changes to the talking points after that meeting because of his own concerns that they could prejudge an FBI investigation into who was responsible for the attacks.

The official said Morell also didn't think it was fair to disclose the CIA's advance warning without giving the State Department a chance to explain how it responded. The official spoke on a condition of anonymity without authorization to speak about the emails on the record. Petraeus declined to be interviewed Wednesday.

The intelligence official said Morell was aware of Nuland's objections but did not make the changes under pressure from the State Department but because he independently shared the concerns.

That is contradicted in an email sent to Rice on Saturday, Sept. 15, at 1:23 p.m. by a member of her staff whose name was blacked out. The email said Morell indicated he would work with Sullivan and Ben Rhodes, the White House deputy national security adviser, to revise the talking points. The intelligence official disputed that assertion and insisted Morell acted alone.

An email from Morell also says he spoke to Petraeus ""about State's deep concerns about mentioning the warnings and the other work done on this.""

The emails were shared with Congress earlier this year as a condition for allowing the nomination of John Brennan for CIA director to move forward. An interim report last month from the Republicans on five House committees criticized the Obama administration and mentioned the emails, but the issue exploded last Friday when new details emerged.

Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee read some of the emails aloud last Wednesday at a hearing with State Department officials. The next day, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, called on the White House to release the emails.

A Boehner spokesman said Wednesday the emails released by the White House only confirm the interim report.

""They contradict statements made by the White House that it and the State Department only changed one word in the talking points,"" Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said in a statement. ""The seemingly political nature of the State Department's concerns raises questions about the motivations behind these changes and who at the State Department was seeking them.""

The White House released the full set of emails sent to Congress under the pressure in hopes of putting an end to the controversy that has dogged the administration for months. White House spokesman Eric Schultz said Wednesday that ""these e-mails have been selectively and inaccurately read out to the media.""

""To make clear what is and is not in these e-mails, today the White House took the extraordinary step of releasing these e-mails,"" Schultz said in a statement. ""You can now see what the Congress has seen — collectively these e-mails make clear that the interagency process, including the White House's interactions, were focused on providing the facts as we knew them based on the best information available at the time and protecting an ongoing investigation.""

An official with the CIA's office of congressional affairs whose name was blacked out sent the final version to Petraeus on Saturday, Sept. 15, at 12:51 p.m. Petraeus responded at 2:27 saying he'd prefer not to even use them in that form.

But he said the decision was up to the White House's national security staff.

""NSS's call, to be sure; however, this is certainly not what Vice Chairman (Dutch) Ruppersberger was hoping to get for unclas use. Regardless, thanks for the great work.""

Ruppersberger is the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.

At a Capitol Hill hearing Wednesday, Attorney General Eric Holder said there has been ""very, very substantial progress"" in the investigation into who was responsible for the twin nighttime attacks in Benghazi. Earlier this month, the FBI said it was seeking information on three people who were on the grounds of the diplomatic mission when it was attacked. The FBI posted photographs of the three people and said they may be able to provide information to help in the investigation.

Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, who sits on the Intelligence Committee, said, ""I didn't find anything that looked like a smoking gun in terms of political cooking of the talking points. There is very little input from the White House.""

But he added, ""There are some things to criticize in here. The State Department looks like it is trying to avoid blame.""

USA TODAY

Afghan president walks away from proposed peace talks with Taliban

U.S. troops poised to leave Afghanistan in 2014

Obama administration%27s optimism already was loaded with skepticism

Afghan President Hamid Karzai has established a consistent record in one way: He never seems to miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity.

Over the course of the last 12 years, Karzai has proved to be a less than reliable ally. U.S. officials have been regularly confounded by his erratic behavior, as well as his willingness to turn a blind eye to drug trafficking by allies and excuse corruption in his government.

He proved to be his consistently unreliable self again on Wednesday.

Less than 24 hours after pledging to send envoys to Doha, Qatar, for peace talks with the Taliban, Karzai changed course and said he's not having anything to do with the event unless the United States steps away from the process and the Taliban stops its violent attacks on the ground.

Karzai says his beef is that the Taliban, in opening its office in Doha, is using the name Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and flying the group's white flag, raising concerns that it is acting like an embassy parallel with the Afghan government.

In more than two years of talks with Karzai, the Obama administration has underscored that wars rarely conclude on the battlefield and that negotiating with your enemy — even as distasteful and dishonorable as the Taliban may be — will be necessary to finding any semblance of peace.

As the Taliban announced a willingness to come to a negotiating table, aides to Obama expressed optimism while stressing caution. Senior administration officials said they had no expectation Taliban attacks would ebb anytime soon, and there was skepticism that the Taliban was willing to cut its ties to al-Qaeda or respect minority and women's rights that are now enshrined in the Afghan constitution.

Left unsaid was that managing Karzai's expectations will also be incredibly daunting.

The Afghan president's greatest fault — and the one that could make any chance of constructive peace talks ever happening a pipe dream — is a disconnect with his reality on the ground.

Former U.S. ambassador Karl Eikenberry relayed his concerns in a cable, which was subsequently made public by WikiLeaks, about this disconnect.

Eikenberry wrote with some disbelief in the 2009 cable — which coincided with one of the most violent months of the war — about Karzai nostalgically wanting to return to a ""golden age"" in the U.S.-Afghan relationship that he felt existed at the start of the war.

Nearly four years later, with the U.S. withdrawal in sight, American diplomats in Kabul are certainly doing some hand-wringing as they fail yet again to convince Karzai that time is running out to find an endgame in America's longest war."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/02/12/Remember-When-Obama-Promised-to-Eliminate-North-Korea-s-Nuclear-Weapons-Programs,2013-02-12 00:00:00,['Joel B. Pollak'],Remember When Obama Promised to 'Eliminate North Korea's Nuclear Weapons Programs'?,"In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama promised that he would “eliminate North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.” His campaign manifesto, Change We Can Believe In, described Obama’s North Korea policy, and the philosophy behind it, in great detail:

North Korea is an example where direct, tough diplomacy that lays out clear choices to rogue regimes for good and bad behavior can lead to change. When the United States was engaged, the pace of Pyongyang’s development of nuclear weapons was slowed; when we were not, it quickened. While there has been some promising progress, it’s important that all of North Korea’s claims are verified. If they are not, we should move quickly to reimpose sanctions that have been waived, and consider new restrictions going forward. As President, Barack Obama will work with diligence and determination with our friends and allied to end the threat of North Korea and to secure a lasting peace on the Korean peninsula.

Obama’s pledge to use “tough diplomacy” to “end the threat of North Korea” followed his infamous pledge during a Democratic presidential primary debate in 2007 that he would meet the leaders of rogue regimes like North Korea “without preconditions.”

That thinking matches the pseudo-realist view expressed repeatedly by Obama’s new nominee for Secretary of Defense, former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE)–that the danger of regimes such as Iran and North Korea is amplified by, or even caused by, U.S. failure to “engage.” Obama’s extreme self-confidence emboldened his campaign promise not just to contain North Korea, but to convince it to abandon nuclear weapons entirely.

Obama did not just leave such talk on the campaign trail. In his 2010 State of the Union address, Obama boasted of the success of his policy on North Korea:

Now, these diplomatic efforts have also strengthened our hand in dealing with those nations that insist on violating international agreements in pursuit of nuclear weapons. That’s why North Korea now faces increased isolation, and stronger sanctions–sanctions that are being vigorously enforced.

He repeated the North Korea boast in his 2011 State of the Union address:

Because of a diplomatic effort to insist that Iran meet its obligations, the Iranian government now faces tougher sanctions, tighter sanctions than ever before. And on the Korean Peninsula, we stand with our ally South Korea, and insist that North Korea keeps its commitment to abandon nuclear weapons. (Applause.)

Yet today, on the day he is to give the first State of the Union address of his second term, North Korea has tested a nuclear bomb. Not only has Obama failed to “eliminate” the North Korean nuclear weapons program; he has also failed to discourage or deter it.

So much for “tough diplomacy” from the Obama administration."

“Just today, before coming in here, I read an e-mail to me about a general, the minister of defense, former minister or assistant minister, I forget which, who has just defected and is now in Turkey,” the secretary of state testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “And there are other defections that we are hearing about because of the potential that we might take action.”

A few minutes later, Kerry revised his account: This official-sounding “e-mail” was actually a Reuters news account about a former defense minister based on a claim by the Syrian opposition. “Reuters has now said the Syrian government is saying the defection has not taken place,” Kerry said. “So who knows whether it has or hasn’t?”

Who knows?

This is the problem with the case the Obama administration is making for attacking Syria.

Officials say the evidence is incontrovertible that Assad used sarin gas against his people. Lawmakers emerging from secret, classified briefings seem to agree. But while members of Congress are coming around to an attack on Syria, the American public remains skeptical. Why? Maybe it’s because the government won’t let them in on the secret.

The public heard about another “slam dunk” case a decade ago and, then as now, Democratic and Republican lawmakers agreed that the secret evidence was compelling. And it turned out to be wrong. Now, administration officials are telling Americans to trust their assurances that the secret evidence is convincing and that their war planning is solid. But they won’t provide details.

Estimates of collateral damage? “Lower than a certain number which I would rather share with you in a classified setting,” Joint Chiefs Chairman Martin Dempsey told lawmakers.

Response of the Arab and Muslim countries? “This is something I’d be happier discussing in greater detail with you in the closed session,” Kerry said.

Safeguards to keep military action limited? “We can talk about that in a closed session,” Dempsey said.

How would Russia and other Syrian allies respond to a U.S. strike? “We all agree that that would be best handled in a classified session,” Kerry said.

No, we don’t all agree.

The administration’s case against Assad may well be airtight. Walter Pincus, The Post’s longtime intelligence correspondent, tells me he hasn’t heard the sort of doubts from the intelligence community that he heard during the run-up to the Iraq war. The problem is that the refusal to declassify evidence helps opponents such as Russia’s Vladimir Putin cast doubt on the intelligence. The administration is hiding behind the protection of “sources and methods,” but is any foe still unaware of the National Security Agency’s satellite and intercept capabilities?

Pincus argues for releasing the intercepts that describe the Syrian regime using the weapons and then ending the barrage, and the satellite imagery showing preparations for an attack and the firing of rockets from Assad-controlled territory. But instead of declassifying, administration officials are being ostentatious about their secrecy, as if protecting their club’s secret handshake.

“TOP SECRET/CLOSED,” said the Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s notice for Wednesday’s hearing. “CLOSED,” said the Senate Armed Services Committee’s notice. In “open” testimony Tuesday and Wednesday, the officials encouraged lawmakers to save their questions for secret sessions.

Arming the Syrian opposition? That “would require a closed or classified hearing.” The broad effects of the military strike? “I would prefer to speak out in a classified setting.” Could Hezbollah have chemical weapons? “We need to talk about that in our classified session.” Would allies join an attack? It “would not be appropriate to speak about in an unclassified setting.” Could an attack make Assad use chemical weapons again? “I urge you to go to the classified briefing.”

At Wednesday’s hearing, Kerry said that “beyond a reasonable doubt, the evidence proves that the Assad regime prepared this attack.” He then dangled this: “In an appropriate setting, you will learn additional evidence which came to us even today.”

But isn’t it “appropriate” for the American public to see some hard evidence? During Tuesday’s Senate hearing, Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) asked for the administration to “declassify a higher percentage of the information that we have so the American people and the international community can see it.”

Kerry said that the amount declassified is “unprecedented” and that what’s out there now is “sufficient.”

He may think so. But it’s not sufficient until the American public believes it.

(CNN) —

President Barack Obama said Wednesday that the world set a red line against chemical weapons use that he now seeks to apply to Syria, while a Senate committee approved a resolution authorizing the U.S. military attack that he is planning.

By a 10-7 vote, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed the resolution that authorizes a limited military response, giving Obama an initial victory in his push to win congressional approval.

The measure now goes to the full Senate for debate next week. The Democratic-led chamber is expected to pass it, but the outcome is less clear in the Republican-led House where top diplomatic and military officials made their case on Wednesday for action.

Liberal Democrats, tea party libertarians and moderates from both sides questioned Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey about whether limited military attacks can change anything and if they will lead to U.S. involvement in another war.

“What are the chances of escalation? Are different scenarios accounted for? If our credibility is on the line now as is argued what about if Assad retaliates?” asked GOP Rep. Ed Royce of California, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

In Sweden on the first of a three-day overseas trip that includes the G-20 summit in Russia, Obama told reporters that the red line he spoke of last year regarding Syria’s use of chemical weapons came from international treaties and past congressional action, rather than something he “made up.”

Obama also insisted he had the authority to order attacks – expected to be cruise missile strikes on Syrian military command targets – even if Congress rejects his request for authorization.

America “recognizes that if the international community fails to maintain certain norms, standards, laws, governing how countries interact and how people are treated, that over time this world becomes less safe,” Obama said. “It becomes more dangerous not only for those people who are subjected to these horrible crimes, but to all of humanity.”

He cited World War II as an example, saying “the people of Europe are certainly familiar with what happens when the international community finds excuses not to act.” At the same time, “as commander in chief, I always preserve the right and the responsibility to act on behalf of America’s national security,” Obama said.

Conservative critics have said Obama painted himself into a corner with his statement last year that Syria’s use of chemical weapons was a red line that would change his approach to its civil war.

Obama: It is the world’s red line

“A red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized,” Obama said in August 2012. “That would change my calculus.”

Now, critics on the right say, he must respond to an alleged chemical weapons attack outside Damascus by the Syrian regime that Kerry said killed more than 1,400 people or lose credibility.

The administration and top congressional leaders attempted to blunt that criticism on Tuesday during debate on Capitol Hill. Even House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, the chamber’s No. 2 Republican, said any president would have drawn that red line based on international norms.

Obama made that same argument on Wednesday, saying: “I didn’t set a red line. The world set a red line.”

“The world set a red line when governments representing 98 percent of the world’s population said the use of chemical weapons are abhorrent and passed a treaty forbidding their use, even when countries are engaged in war,” he said at a joint news conference with Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt on the first day of a four-day trip that includes the G-20 summit in Russia.

“Congress set a red line when it ratified that treaty,” Obama continued. “Congress set a red line when it indicated that in a piece of legislation entitled the ‘Syria Accountability Act’ that some of the horrendous things that are happening on the ground there need to be answered for.”

Sounding exasperated, Obama added: “That wasn’t something I just kind of made up. I didn’t pluck it out of thin air. There’s a reason for it.”

Obama prods international community to act

Asked about whether he was seeking to save face, Obama insisted that “my credibility is not on the line – the international community’s credibility is on the line.”

He framed the question for the United Nations and the global community at large as: “Are we going to try to find a reason not to act? And if that’s the case, then I think the (world) community should admit it.”

Opposition by Russia, a Syrian ally, has scuttled U.S. and British efforts to get the U.N. Security Council to authorize a military response against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.

U.N. inspectors returned from Syria last week from their mission to confirm if chemical weapons were used, but Kerry said Wednesday it would take three weeks for samples collected to analyzed and results announced.

“I respect the U.N. process,” Obama said while standing next to Reinfeldt, who opposes military intervention without U.N. approval.

“We agree that the international community cannot be silent,” Obama added, saying also that the U.N. investigators had done “heroic work.”

Noting the U.N. team’s mandate was only to determine the use of chemical weapons, and not identify who used them, Obama repeated past statements that U.S. intelligence has confirmed chemical weapons use beyond any reasonable doubt and has further confirmed that al-Assad’s regime “was the source.”

“I do think that we have to act, because if we don’t, we are effectively saying that even though we may condemn it and issue resolutions and so forth and so on, somebody who is not shamed by resolutions can continue to act with impunity,” Obama said.

International norms then “begin to erode,” he added, and “other despots and authoritarian regimes can start looking and say, ‘that’s something we can get away with.’”

He described the intended U.S. response as “limited in time and in scope, targeted at the specific task of degrading (al-Assad’s) capabilities, and deterring the use of those weapons, again.”

More than 100,000 killed in Syrian conflict

The United Nations has said more than 100,000 people – including many civilians – have been killed since the popular uprising spiraled into a civil war in 2011.

In Washington, the resolution passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee set a 60-day deadline for use of force in Syria, with an option for an additional 30 days.

An amendment accepted by the panel from Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Christopher Coons of Delaware added language to say the military response was intended to reverse Assad’s battlefield momentum, a stronger objective than degrading the Syrian regime’s chemical weapons capabilities as Hagel told the committee on Tuesday.

If Assad “remains in an advantageous position, he will never leave Syria,” said McCain, who has been pushing for a more robust U.S. response. “He has to know that he is losing and that way you get a negotiated settlement for his departure.”

The resolution also makes clear there would be no U.S. boots on the ground as part of a response in Syria.

A White House statement welcomed the panel’s vote, saying “the military action authorized in the resolution would uphold America’s national security interests by degrading Assad’s chemical weapons capability and deterring the future use of these weapons, even as we pursue a broader strategy of strengthening the opposition to hasten a political transition in Syria.”

After the vote, senators on the panel made statements that explained their thinking, with some calling for more efforts to build an international coalition before any attack takes place.

“Vietnam started with U.S. advisers and a limited Naval presence. It led to an all-out war,” noted Democratic Sen. Tom Udall of New Mexico, who opposed the resolution.

Kerry, Hagel and Dempsey appeared before the Senate panel on Tuesday to press for approval of authorization.

Tough questioning by House panel

The same trio then faced questions on Wednesday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, with Royce saying the administration’s Syria policy had been adrift for two years.

At the same time, Royce acknowledged there were “no easy answers” on Syria, and attempting to deter chemical weapons use was worth considering despite public skepticism for U.S. military involvement.

Kerry said Obama sought authorization for a response to the use of banned weapons, not a full military intervention.

“We are not asking America to go to war,” he said. “We all agree, there will be no American boots on the ground.”

In response to a question, Hagel put the cost of the limited response under consideration at “tens of millions” of dollars.

Most of the focus of administration lobbying has been on the House, where opposition by liberal Democrats and libertarian conservatives, as well as the bitterly partisan political environment of the Republican-led chamber, make passage of Obama’s authorization proposal uncertain.

House Speaker John Boehner and Cantor, the No. 2 Republican, both have endorsed a U.S. military response, but Wednesday’s hearing showed widespread concerns and outside opposition from across the political spectrum.

Polls also show that a majority of Americans oppose a U.S. military strike on Syria.

In the Senate, a Democratic source familiar with Majority Leader Harry Reid’s thinking told CNN that Reid is confident any authorization measure will pass his chamber. The source said it is likely 60 votes will be needed to overcome a filibuster, and Reid thinks the votes are there.

Before that, however, lawmakers will hear from the Russian government, which is moving ahead with its efforts to lobby Congress in an attempt to undercut Obama on Syria. Moscow has sent an official request to congressional leaders to meet with them.

“We’re planning the visit,” a Russian Embassy spokesman told CNN, “We can’t tell you the exact time but it will be next week.”

Boehner will not meet with the Russians, his spokesman said.

What you need to know about the president's revamped team.

President Obama on Thursday nominated longtime fundraiser and hotel magnate Penny Pritzker as commerce secretary and veteran aide Michael Froman as the U.S. trade representative.

He made the announcement before embarking on a three-day economic and security trip to Mexico and Costa Rica.

If confirmed, Pritzker, an investor and daughter of the co-founder of the Hyatt hotel chain, would be the richest secretary in Obama’s Cabinet and potentially the wealthiest Cabinet secretary in U.S. history. She has a net worth of $1.85 billion, according to Forbes magazine, making her the 277th richest person on the Forbes 400 list.

The chief executive of PSP Capital Partners and its affiliate, Pritzker Realty Group, Pritzker has been a major presence in Chicago business and philanthropic circles. She was national finance chairman of Obama’s 2008 campaign and co-chairman of his 2012 reelection campaign.

The two nominations make it unlikely that Obama will move ahead with his plan to combine the government’s trade, investment and commerce functions into one department. The proposal, which he announced in January 2012 and included in his fiscal 2014 budget proposal, would combine the elements of several agencies including commerce, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Small Business Administration.

House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (Calif.) said in a statement Thursday that he and other Republicans are “still waiting” to reorganize the government. “I’m disappointed the president has not proposed a detailed plan, but if he does, a restructuring could still happen.”

After Obama was elected in 2008, Pritzker was considered a front-runner for the commerce position. But she withdrew from consideration, reportedly because of potential controversy over her net worth and complex business relationships.

In announcing the nomination on Thursday, Obama called Pritzker “one of the country’s most distinguished business leaders,” and cited her many years of experience in industries including real estate, hospitality, senior living and financial services.

“She’s built companies from the ground up. She knows from experience that no government program alone can take the place of a great entrepreneur,” Obama said. “And Penny understands that just as great companies strengthen the community around them, strong communities and skilled workers also help companies thrive.”

Pritzker has served on the President’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness and helped develop Skills for America’s Future, which the White House described as “an innovative program that brings together businesses, community colleges and others to prepare workers for 21st century jobs and connects them with employment.”

Pritzker attended Harvard University and received law and business degrees from Stanford.

Froman, Obama’s nominee for U.S. trade representative, is the deputy national security adviser for international economics. Previously at the investment bank Citigroup, he has been an aggressive free-trade advocate inside the White House but also a major supporter of policies to ensure that Americans have equal access to markets compared with workers from other countries.

“He has won the respect of our trading partners around the world,” Obama said. “He has also won a reputation as being an extraordinarily tough negotiator while doing it. He does not rest until he’s delivered the best possible deal for American businesses and American workers.”

Noting that Froman was a classmate of his at Harvard Law School, the president quipped: “He was much smarter than me then. He continues to be smarter than me now.”

Froman was the lead White House adviser on free trade deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama, the trade centerpieces of Obama’s first term. He also has been the president’s main emissary at major economic summits and has overseen economic engagement with all parts of the world, including China and the European Union. He will maintain a significant White House presence in his new role, the official said.

Froman served in the Clinton administration and in the Treasury Department. He attended Princeton, and in addition to his law degree from Harvard, he received a doctorate from Oxford.

American military forces are long gone, and Iraqi officials say Washington’s political influence in Baghdad is now virtually nonexistent. Hussein is dead. But Iran has become an indispensable broker among Baghdad’s new Shiite elite, and its influence continues to grow.

The signs are evident in the prominence of pro-Iran militias on the streets, at public celebrations and in the faces of some of those now in the halls of power, men such as Abu Mehdi Mohandis, an Iraqi with a long history of anti-American activity and deep ties to Iran.

During the occupation, U.S. officials accused Mohandis of arranging a supply of Iranian-made bombs to be used against U.S. troops. But now Iraqi officials say Mohandis speaks for Iran here, and Prime Minister Nouri Maliki recently entrusted him with a sensitive domestic political mission.

Iran’s role reinforces its strategic position at a time when the world looks increasingly hostile to Tehran, the capital. It faces tough international sanctions for its disputed nuclear program and fears losing longtime ally Syria to an insurgency backed by regional Sunni Muslim rivals.

Western diplomats and Iraqi politicians say they are concerned that the Islamic Republic will be tempted to use proxies in Iraq to strike at its enemies, as it has done with Lebanon-based Hezbollah.

American officials say they remain vital players in Iraq and have worked to defuse tension between Maliki and his foes.

During a visit to Baghdad on Sunday, however, Secretary of State John F. Kerry was unable to persuade Maliki to stop Iranian flights crossing Iraqi airspace to Syria. The U.S. charges that Iranian weapons shipments are key to propping up Syrian President Bashar Assad; Maliki says there is no proof that Tehran is sending anything besides humanitarian aid. Kerry’s visit was the first by a U.S. Cabinet official in more than a year.

Overall, Iraqi officials and analysts say, Washington has pursued a policy of near-total disengagement, with policy decisions largely relegated to the embassy in Baghdad. Some tribal leaders complain that the Americans have not contacted them since U.S. troops left in late 2011.

Iraq’s political atmosphere has deteriorated. Maliki has ordered the arrest of his former finance minister, a Sunni. Disputes in the north between the central government and leaders of the semiautonomous Kurdish region are unresolved.

“The Americans have no role. Nobody listens to them. They lost their power in this country,” said Deputy Prime Minister Saleh Mutlaq, a Sunni, commenting on the disappearance of the Americans as a broker for most of Iraq’s disputes.

The vacuum has been filled in large part by Iran and by Iraq’s Sunni neighbors, each intent on wielding maximum influence in a country that stands as a buffer between Shiite Iran and the largely Sunni Middle East.

“At the moment, Iran has something akin to veto power in Iraq, in that Maliki is careful not to take decisions that might alienate Iran,” said Karim Sadjadpour, an expert on Iran with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

An Iraqi Shiite politician who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject, described Iran’s objectives this way: “Controlled instability in Iraq and a submissive or sympathetic Islamist Shia government in accord with Iran’s regional interests, most importantly regarding Syria.”

Maliki turned to Shiite Islamist parties and figures tied to Iran to stay in power after a close election in 2010. He has fended off challenges since then with the support of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who fears the expansion of Sunni power if Syria or Iraq collapses. Maliki has convinced the Iranians that he is the only one who can hold his country together, according to Iraqi politicians.

Iran has forcefully backed quasi-political and military groups in Iraq such as the Badr Organization, Khitab Hezbollah and Asaib al Haq, and encouraged them to support Maliki.

The Badr Organization was funded and trained by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard in the 1980s to fight Hussein. Both Khitab Hezbollah and Asaib al Haq have professed their admiration for Khamenei while declaring their ambition to transform themselves into political and social movements.

Leading Iraqi Shiite officials describe the emergence of such overtly pro-Iran groups as a healthy development after the U.S. military withdrawal.

“These imitators of Khamenei and before that [Ayatollah Ruhollah] Khomeini were in hiding. Now they have become public and known,” said Sheik Hamam Hamoudi, a Shiite member of parliament and a longtime resident of Iran before the U.S. toppled Hussein.

At a gathering last month at a sports club, members of Khitab Hezbollah greeted enthusiastic visitors under a portrait of Khamenei and banners showing a fist clenching a black Kalashnikov rifle rising from a map of the Middle East. Guests received a book, graced by a portrait of Khamenei, that describes a war pitting Iran and its allies against the West.

Mohandis, said to secretly head the militia, first rose up against Hussein in the late 1970s. Facing arrest, he moved to Kuwait. A court there later convicted him in absentia of taking part in the bombing of the U.S. and French embassies in 1983.

Mohandis fled to Iran, where he joined the Badr Organization, and he now heads its political bureau in Baghdad. He returned to Iraq after the U.S.-led invasion and was elected to parliament under his birth name, Jamal Jaffar. He fled again when the Americans were alerted to his true identity. In 2009, the Treasury Department labeled him a threat to Iraq’s security.

But after the last U.S. troops withdrew in December 2011, he came back.

During the interim, Iraqi officials say, he cultivated a close relationship with Qassem Suleimani, the head of Iran’s Quds Force, which is responsible for Iran’s relations with Iraq. For any Iraqi official or politician visiting Tehran, Mohandis accompanied Iran’s spy chief to the meetings.

Advertisement

In a show of his new prominence, Mohandis was dispatched by Maliki with three senior members of his Dawa Party members to Iraqi Kurdistan last month.

According to those with knowledge of the meeting, Mohandis was sent to try to smooth over a dispute regarding rights to oil-rich Kirkuk and other territory in the north. Mohandis argued for an alliance between the Kurds and Shiites, given regional instability and ongoing Sunni protests in Iraq.

“Mohandis is Iran’s Iraqi emissary or messenger,” said a senior Iraqi official, who insisted on anonymity because of the topic’s delicacy. “When he is in a meeting, people know he speaks for the Quds Force and Suleimani. He speaks for them more than the Iranian Embassy.”

Another enforcer of Iranian interests has been Hadi Amri, a hardened militia veteran whom Maliki appointed to the post of transportation minister. In the dispute over Iranian overflights to Syria, Amri and Maliki have ignored U.S. requests to inspect Iranian planes.

The Asaib al Haq militia was blamed for the killing of five U.S. soldiers in 2007 and the abduction of five Britons, four of whom were killed. Sunni Arabs also blame it for some of the worst attacks on their community during Iraq’s sectarian warfare.

The Americans jailed the militia’s leader, Qais Khazali, but Maliki pushed for him to be transferred to Iraqi custody and join the political process as an alternative to more fundamentalist Shiite groups.

Since his release, Khazali has emerged as a Shiite fundamentalist political force funded, according to his foes and other Iraqi politicians, by Iran. He has organized offices across the country with the aim of recruiting prominent individuals and communities to his cause.

http://news.yahoo.com/us-military-evacuates-embassy-personnel-yemen-122432888.html,,[],US military evacuates embassy personnel from Yemen,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. military evacuated non-essential U.S. government personnel from Yemen on Tuesday due to the high risk of attack by al-Qaida that has triggered temporary shutdowns of 19 American diplomatic posts across the Middle East and Africa.

The State Department said in a travel warning that it ordered the evacuation ""due to the continued potential for terrorist attacks"" and said U.S. citizens in Yemen should leave immediately because of an ""extremely high"" security threat level.

""As staff levels at the Embassy are restricted, our ability to assist U.S. citizens in an emergency and provide routine consular services remains limited and may be further constrained by the fluid security situation,"" the travel warning said. The U.S. Embassy is located in Sanaa, the capital of Yemen.

Yemeni security officials said a suspected U.S. drone strike at about 2 a.m. local time Tuesday killed four alleged al-Qaida members in a volatile eastern province of the country. The drone fired a missile at a car carrying the four men, setting it on fire and killing all of them, the officials said. It wasn't immediately clear if the decision to evacuate the embassy, made earlier, was connected to the drone strike.

The Yemeni officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they are not allowed to talk to the media, said they believe one of the dead is Saleh Jouti, a senior al-Qaida member. It's the fourth drone attack in the past two weeks to hit a car believed to be carrying al-Qaida members.

Pentagon Press Secretary George Little said the U.S. Air Force transported State Department personnel out of Sanaa early Tuesday. ""The U.S. Department of Defense continues to have personnel on the ground in Yemen to support the U.S. State Department and monitor the security situation,"" Little added.

A senior defense official said Tuesday that between 50 and 100 diplomatic personnel were flown out of Sanaa in a C-17 military transport as dawn broke and were taken to Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The official was not authorized to discuss the information publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said dozens of military troops remain in the country, including those who were doing security at the embassy and others conducting training with Yemeni troops.

Story continues

Britain's Foreign Office also announced that it had evacuated all staff from its embassy in Yemen due to security concerns. The office said the British embassy staff were ""temporarily withdrawn to the U.K."" on Tuesday, but declined further comment. Previously, the U.K. had said the embassy would be closed until the end of the Muslim festival of Eid later this week.

A U.S. intelligence official and a Mideast diplomat told The Associated Press that the current shutdown of embassies in the Middle East and Africa was instigated by an intercepted secret message between al-Qaida chief Ayman al-Zawahri and Nasser al-Wahishi, the leader of the Yemen-based al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, about plans for a major terror attack. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

The State Department on Sunday closed a total of 19 diplomatic posts until next Saturday. They include posts in Bangladesh and across North Africa and the Middle East as well as East Africa, including Madagascar, Burundi, Rwanda and Mauritius.

Jen Psaki, spokeswoman for the State Department, said in a separate statement issued early Tuesday that the department issued the order for Yemen because of concern about a ""threat stream indicating the potential for terrorist attacks against U.S. persons or facilities overseas, especially emanating from the Arabian Peninsula.""

The statement said U.S. citizens who choose to stay in Yemen despite the travel warning should limit nonessential travel within the country and make their own contingency emergency plans.

AQAP, gathered in small cells scattered across Yemen's vast under-governed regions, has proven to be a tenacious enemy.

Officials say al-Zawahri, who took over for Osama bin Laden and works from Pakistan, has reached out to the Yemeni branch, cementing their ties and further signaling the AQAP is once again looking to target U.S. and Western interests after a sustained period of more local and regional focus.

For puzzled Americans who've been told that al-Qaida is on the decline, the latest warnings raise questions about how successful America's war on terror has been and whether the terror group has been able to reorganize and reconstitute itself since bin Laden's death in May 2011.

And, although U.S. officials agreed a year ago to restart military aid to Yemen, it's unclear how much of the new aircraft and weapons have arrived. After aid to Yemen was frozen for some time, the U.S. military is once again on the ground there training Yemeni special operations forces and has delivered more than a dozen helicopters to the Yemeni military and provided training for them, U.S. defense officials said.

But other weapons and equipment are still in the pipeline, according to a Mideast official.

The latest terror alert was triggered in part when the secret message between al-Zawahri and al-Wahishi was intercepted several weeks ago.

There long has been movement of fighters between Pakistan and Yemen, and discussions between the two groups, but the latest communication triggered worries and prompted the U.S. to take steps to boost security. The embassy closures came one day after a meeting between President Barack Obama and Yemeni President Abdo Rabu Mansour Hadi.

AQAP has been widely considered al-Qaida's most dangerous affiliate for several years. Even though the group lost Anwar al-Awlaki — one of its key inspirational leaders — to a U.S. drone strike in 2011, al-Wahishi and the group's master bomb maker, Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, remain on the loose and determined to target the U.S. and other Western interests.

The group is linked to the botched Christmas Day 2009 bombing of an airliner bound for Detroit and explosives-laden parcels intercepted aboard cargo flights a year later — both incidents involving al-Asiri's expertise.

In recent years, however, AQAP has been focused more on making gains at home, taking advantage of an unstable government and overstretched military that was forced to concentrate on protecting the political center in Sanaa. As a result, said a senior defense official, AQAP was able to expand its foothold in the south, capture more weapons and gain control of additional territory.

The hawkish intellectuals who spin the geopolitical theories that lead to young Americans being sent to war cannot abide President Obama’s penchant for talking with adversaries and avoiding conflict.

That preference for peace over war threatens to take away from the neocons their top candidate for a future battlefield -- Iran. After years of sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy, and after an election that brought a more moderate leader to power in Tehran, the Obama administration decided to seek a diplomatic solution to the challenge of Iran’s drive toward building nuclear weapons. With the deal forged in talks involving the U.S., Russia, France, Britain, China, Germany and Iran, a significant step has been taken toward bringing Iran back into the circle of rational actors on the world stage.

Of course the neocons and many members of Congress do not believe rationality is an attribute of which Iranians are capable. Given the history of the last 30 years, the extremism of Islamic militants and the theocratic dictatorship that rules the country, skepticism is not unreasonable.

But it is also true that Iran is a complex nation with a large class of educated, sophisticated citizens and an advanced economy. Even Iran’s mullahs cannot forever ignore political pressure from within and economic pressure from without. The election of President Hassan Rouhani marked a sharp shift away from the wacky radicalism of his predecessor. Both Rouhani and the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have given clear signals they want to end the debilitating standoff with the international community.

The tough sanctions were meant to soften Iran’s hard line. With that goal apparently achieved, there is nothing unwise about exploring the possibility of real change. The provisional deal drops some sanctions in exchange for measures that will curtail the Iranian nuclear program and open it up to inspections. In the six months to come, a tougher task has yet to be accomplished: a permanent agreement to end Iran’s quest for the bomb.

It is entirely possible it may not work, but giving diplomacy a try is certainly preferable to a mad march to war.

“We cannot rule out peaceful solutions to the world’s problems,” Obama said as he spoke about the deal with Iran. With the Iraq war over, the war in Afghanistan terminating, negotiations in the works in Syria and now a potential ratcheting down of antagonism with Iran, the president has moved far from the neoconservative militarism that dominated American foreign policy in the George W. Bush years.

If the Iran deal pays off, not only will the president finally earn the Nobel Peace Prize he won so prematurely in 2009, but the neocons will find themselves bereft of any new battlefields."

Military seeks to give President Obama a range of options, depending on his response to crisis

Target lists for possible air strikes have been updated as have plans for possible cruise missiles

U.N. attempting to investigate claims of fresh chemical weapons use by Syrian regime

The U.S. military has updated options for a forceful intervention in Syria to give President Barack Obama a range of choices should he decide to deepen American involvement in a civil war where new claims surfaced this week about possible chemical weapons use by the regime.

A senior Defense Department official told CNN on Friday that target lists for possible air strikes have been updated. The planning also included updates on the potential use of cruise missiles, which would not require fighter pilots to enter Syrian airspace.

But the official cautioned the steps were taken ""to give the president a current and comprehensive range of choices"" and that no decisions were made at a national security meeting on Thursday at the White House.

The official said there are certain static targets, like government buildings and military installations, but that forces and equipment of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad ""continue to move"" and thus require flexibility in planning.

A U.N. team is in Syria attempting to investigate the latest claim of chemical weapons use outside Damascus that killed more than 1,300 people, according to the opposition.

Obama told CNN in an interview broadcast on Friday the United States is working with the United Nations to gather information on the alleged attack, but noted that preliminary signs point to a ""big event of grave concern.""

""It is very troublesome,"" he said. ""That starts getting to some core national interests that the United States has, both in terms of us making sure that weapons of mass destruction are not proliferating, as well as needing to protect our allies, our bases in the region.""

Obama said there was an abbreviated time frame for making decisions about Syria.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Friday ""a very quick assessment"" of the allegations is important because if the Assad government did use chemical weapons, ""there may be another attack coming,"" Reuters reported from aboard the military aircraft carrying Hagel to Malaysia.

Hagel told reporters on the plane that the military was responsible for ""positioning our assets to be able to carry out different options,"" but he said that did not necessarily mean forces or assets had been moved, according to Reuters.

Speaking with ""New Day"" anchor Chris Cuomo, Obama defended his administration's decision to not intervene militarily in the conflict so far, but predicted that American focus on the country's strife would be necessary for the fighting to come to an end.

""I think it is fair to say that, as difficult as the problem is, this is something that is going to require America's attention and hopefully the entire international community's attention,"" Obama said.

If the United States affirmed evidence that indicated Syrian government responsibility, the U.S. military options would include targeting al-Assad's capability to deliver chemical weapons, the official added.

A White House spokesman said on Friday that the administration has long maintained that ""all options remain on the table"" regarding Syria. But Obama has previously indicated no plans to place American ""boots on the ground.""

Military planners last conducted a major update of options for Syria in April, in response to bipartisan pressure from members of Congress.

""The plans are constantly being reviewed and tweaked,"" the official said, adding that the latest update represented a more comprehensive review of airstrike target lists.

Sen. John McCain, an advocate for a more forceful U.S. response to the Syrian conflict, has suggested that American air power could take out runways and planes used by al-Assad's forces that he said are ""dominating the battlefields and the towns and the cities.""

He also said the administration could ""supply the right kind of weapons to rebels to establish a 'no fly' zone"" and utilize Patriot missile batteries elsewhere in the region.

So far, Obama has authorized a limited amount of military hardware for the rebels in addition to logistical and humanitarian assistance.

A chief problem has been identifying those rebels the United States would happily deal with vs elements said to be militants, including some with ties to al Qaeda.

""Syria today is not about choosing between two sides but rather about choosing one among many sides,"" Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey wrote this week to a member of Congress.

""It is my belief that the side we choose must be ready to promote their interests and ours when the balance shifts in their favor. Today, they are not,"" he said in the August 19 letter.

Dempsey also warned that even limited military action in Syria could lead to deeper involvement.

Late on Friday, a defense official said the United States had added a Navy destroyer to the eastern Mediterranean fleet.

The USS Ramage arrived to replace the USS Mahan, but the Mahan is going to stay around a bit longer, so temporarily there will be four. The USS Gravelly and USS Barry remain.

These ships are all equipped with the Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles, a long-range subsonic cruise missile used to attack land targets."

Pollak'],"Schumer Defects from Pro-Israel Cause, Backs Hagel for Defense; Confirmation Likely","Partisan loyalty trumped pro-Israel policy as Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) announced, over the objection of many of his constituents, that he would support the nomination of former Sen Chuck Hagel (R-NE) as Secretary of Defense today. Pro-Israel Democrats in the Senate majority who might have voted against Hagel, are now likely to support him in the wake of Schumer’s decision, making Hagel’s confirmation all but certain.

Even as pro-Israel advocates mobilized against Hagel’s appointment, the White House has worked hard behind the scenes to shore up his support. Yesterday, Hagel delivered a letter to Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) in which he expressed regret for his controversial comments about a “Jewish lobby” (though, as with an anti-gay remark in 1998, Hagel made the apologetic gesture to a third party, not to the target of his offensive comment).

Schumer’s announcement coincides with a long essay by Arianna Huffington in today’s Huffington Post in which she describes Hagel as a “neoconservative nightmare” and attempts to debunk criticisms of his candidacy. As with other defenses of Hagel, the Huffington post article does not make the case for Hagel–whose focus was foreign affairs, not defense, in his Senate days–but rather argues against Hagel’s opponents.

For example, Huffington attempts to dismiss concerns about Hagel’s temperament, calling them a “modern-day male version of the old dig that used to be directed at women.” Yet President Barack Obama himself made John McCain’s “temperament” an issue in the 2008 campaign–even mentioning it in his nomination acceptance speech–and Democrats rejected UN Ambassador John Bolton based on “temperament” concerns.

Huffington makes clear that the primary reason that President Obama nominated Hagel, and that Democrats are willing to overlook his anti-abortion, anti-climate change views, is that Hagel emerged as a potent critic of the Iraq War. Like many on the left, Hagel also has expressed the view that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the “core” of Middle East turmoil, and now supports defense cuts that he once warned strongly against.

Hagel’s supporters have been at great pains (even to the point of concocting outright lies) to defend him against charges of antisemitism–charges prompted by his poor record on Israel and his statement that members of Congress were “intimidated” by the so-called “Jewish lobby.” More than a poor choice of words, his critics argue, Hagel’s statement reflects a particular animus towards Israel and its political supporters.

The 2006 speech on the Senate floor in which Hagel called for a more even-handed approach to Israel and the Arab world is a case in point. Hagel’s words came at a time when Israeli civilians were under attack by Iranian-backed Hebollah, and Israel was isolated at the United Nations. Hagel’s premature call for an immediate cease-fire would have prevented Israel from responding to the threat–and sent a message of opposition.

Other critics, such as Alan Dershowitz, have focused less on Hagel’s position on Israel or his statement about a “Jewish lobby” and have instead questioned his policy towards Iran. Hagel has not only opposed military action to stop the Iranian nuclear program; he has also, at times, opposed sanctions. His appointment as Secretary of Defense sends a signal that the United States is not serious about countering the Iranian nuclear threat.

Huffington’s article barely mentions Iran, but does attempt to deal with another serious problem in Hagel’s record: namely, his staunch opposition to the surge in Iraq, which Hagel predicted would fail. Not only does Huffington defend Hagel’s position, but she even attempts to claim he was right: “Since then it’s become accepted gospel in Washington that the surge was successful. Accepted gospel that is, once again, wrong.”

Hagel’s supporters are not concerned about the facts of the surge, or whether Hagel is qualified for the job. What they want is a weakened Department of Defense, and with the appointment of an anti-war war veteran, they have one. Hagel’s opponents have not given up, but Schumer’s defection from the pro-Israel cause, and the willingness of gay advocates and green activists to overlook Hagel’s contrary past, have virtually sealed the win."
http://news.yahoo.com/questions-surround-medal-of-honor-recipient-william-swensons-delayed-recognition-115930795.html,,[],"As hero finally gets Medal of Honor, some question the delay","At a stately White House ceremony on Tuesday, President Barack Obama will extol former Army Capt. William Swenson's courage and award him the country's highest military decoration.

But beyond the pageantry is a convoluted tale not told in the official Army narrative detailing Swenson’s heroics when he and his troops were ambushed in Afghanistan more than four years ago.

Even as Swenson receives his Medal of Honor, a Pentagon investigation is unfolding into why the former Army officer’s award nomination once vanished. It has been alleged that military brass may have derailed the approval process because Swenson pointed blame at superiors in the aftermath of the costly battle.

“It’s crazy,” said Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.), who pushed for the investigation. “The last thing you should have is a politicized Medal of Honor process.”

Being candid about the battle put Swenson’s nomination in the cross hairs, Hunter said.

“He came out and was honest about what happened,” Hunter told Yahoo News. “He was critical as an officer in the Army should be. You’re not supposed to be a robot; you’re supposed to voice your opinions, especially when things go tactically wrong.”

2009 Battle of Ganjgal

Swenson, a Seattle native on his second tour in eastern Afghanistan, was an embedded adviser mentoring members of the Afghan National Security Forces. On the morning of Sept. 8, 2009, he and other U.S. trainers were leading a team of Afghan soldiers and police on foot for a peacekeeping mission into the rural community of Ganjgal when they were surprised by 60 well-armed Taliban insurgents.

A fierce firefight ensued, but the coalition task force was outgunned and quickly surrounded. The battle ultimately claimed the lives of five Americans and 10 of their Afghan counterparts. Seventeen others were wounded. The Army says the bloodshed would have been worse if not for Swenson’s gallantry.

“In seven hours of continuous fighting, Swenson braved intense enemy fire, and willfully put his life in danger against the enemy’s main effort, multiple times in service of his fallen and wounded comrades, his unit, his country, and his endangered Afghan partners,” according to a written Army account.

Story continues

But during the battle, Swenson also repeatedly radioed superiors at a nearby base to request air and artillery support to rescue pinned-down troops. Subsequent investigations determined that three Army officers rejected many of Swenson’s pleas and failed to notify higher commands that troops were under fire.

Swenson didn’t hold back when interviewed by military investigators. According to stories by McClatchy Newspapers and the Military Times, he blasted the U.S. commanders in Afghanistan for their rules of engagement, charging that they put political reasons of trying to minimize civilian casualties ahead of U.S. concerns.

According to documents reviewed by the Military Times, Swenson asked why he was “being second-guessed by [higher-ups] or somebody that's sitting in an air-conditioned” tactical operations center. “Why [the] hell am I even out there in the first place?” he said. “Let’s sit back and play Nintendo.”

“I’m not a politician. I’m just the guy on the ground asking for that ammunition to be dropped because it is going to save lives,” he said, according to a transcript obtained by McClatchy Newspapers.

According to reports, two Army officers were given written reprimands for their “negligent” leadership, which contributed “directly to the loss of life which ensued.”

Swenson, now 34, left the Army in February 2011 and is back living in Seattle. “My forced early retirement,” he recently told the Washington Post. But Swenson hasn’t spoken publicly about the battle of Ganjgal or the delay with his Medal of Honor nomination. He did not return a message from Yahoo News.

The Lost Nomination

Shortly after Ganjgal, Swenson and Marine Cpl. Dakota Meyer were both nominated for their valiant acts during the battle. Suspicion grew when Obama awarded Meyer the Medal of Honor on Sept. 15, 2011, but there was no mention of Swenson’s nomination, which Rep. Hunter says was nowhere to be found for 19 months.

Even Meyer spoke out. According to the Military Times, Meyer wrote the senior officer on the White House National Security Council and described Swenson as “the centerpiece for command and control in a raging firefight that never died down.""

The Army says approving a nomination packet – which includes dozens of supporting documents that must be vetted by top commanders, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the secretary of defense before submission to the president for a final decision – can take up to three years.

“In Swenson's case, an official investigation determined his packet was lost as a result of high turnover within the organization recommending the award,” Army spokesperson Tatjana Christian told Yahoo News by email last week. “The nomination packet was subsequently re-created and forwarded for review. The Army is reviewing ways to ensure this type of injustice does not happen again.”

[SLIDESHOW: Photos of Capt. Swenson in Afghanistan]

But stories by McClatchy Newspapers’ Jonathan Landay cast doubt on the Army’s explanation that the Swenson nomination was merely misplaced.

McClatchy, which obtained memos from the Army’s internal probe, reported that investigators discovered there was an attempt to reduce Swenson’s original nomination to a lesser award before it vanished. That would have been in violation of Army and Defense Department regulations, since only the president has the authority to downgrade a Medal of Honor nomination.

Retired Army Gen. David Petraeus, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan in the summer of 2010, told a McClatchy reporter in August 2012 that he had “no recollection of seeing” Swenson’s packet. But the Army found Petraeus signed Swenson’s Medal of Honor packet on July 28, 2010, McClatchy reported. Yahoo News emailed Petraeus, who did not answer questions about the alleged discrepancy.

Army investigators also discovered that Swenson’s original nomination was one of two Medal of Honor packets received at U.S. command headquarters in Afghanistan on May 19, 2010. The separate packet (unrelated to Ganjgal) was logged and tracked concurrently with Swenson’s, but didn’t disappear.

The Army’s now-closed internal investigation “did not reveal any suspected criminal activity,” McClatchy reported.

Still Seeking Answers

“A Medal of Honor packet doesn’t get lost unless somebody wants it to get lost,” war historian Doug Sterner told Yahoo News.

Sterner, a longtime curator of a military valor awards database, said the Swenson Medal of Honor wouldn’t have happened without the McClatchy reporting, and pressure from Rep. Hunter’s office.



“It’s one that could have gotten tragically swept under the carpet of our broken awards system,” Sterner said.

An inspector general’s office that handles cases involving top military and civilian defense officials is now investigating the alleged mishandling of the Swenson nomination. The Department of Defense did not reply to messages from Yahoo News seeking comment.

Hunter, a Marine officer before entering politics, wants the inspector general investigation to go beyond Swenson’s case. Like Sterner, he believes the process has become bureaucratic, and that too few awards have been issued during the global war on terror.

“I shouldn’t have to write letters,” said Hunter, who has never met Swenson. “The IG shouldn’t have to investigate. This process should be aboveboard and transparent. It shouldn’t take four years. That’s absolutely ridiculous.”

Swenson will be the 13th service member awarded the Medal of Honor from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He is the first Army officer to earn the medal since the end of the Vietnam War.

On hand to witness the occasion will be the family of Army Sgt. 1st Class Kenneth Westbrook, Swenson’s close friend and battle buddy.

Westbrook was shot several times at Ganjgal. He was bleeding on the battlefield until Swenson charged through enemy fire to render him first aid. Helmet cameras worn by incoming pilots captured video of Swenson helping Westbrook aboard a medevac helicopter and stopping to kiss his friend’s forehead before returning to the battle. Sgt. Westbrook made it to Walter Reed military hospital in Maryland, where he died 29 days later.

“I thank him for that time that I got to spend with my husband,” his widow, Charlene Westbrook, said. “I thank Will for that.”

Westbrook said her husband would have been proud of Swenson’s Medal of Honor, but not the process it took to finally get invited to the White House.

“I sincerely don’t believe that the Department of the Army lost, misplaced, or whatever they want to call it,” she said. “They didn’t want it to come out or what? That’s what happened. That’s the truth. They ignored their calls.”"

Beginning next spring, the Air Force will fly several drones near North Korean borders to gather intelligence data on the reclusive country, where an estimated 24 million people live under oppression, sealed off from the rest of the world.

The unarmed Global Hawk drones will fly out of an undetermined base in Japan, according to The Washington Post.

U.S. government officials, including Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, met with Japanese representatives this week to finalize the military agreement. Both sides hope the surveillance missions will enhance understanding of the threat posed by North Korea. [7 Strange Cultural Facts About North Korea]

Despite repeated warnings and tough U.N. sanctions, North Korea continues to pursue its nuclear weapons and long-range missile programs. Earlier this year, North Korea conducted its third nuclear test, and recent intelligence analyses suggest the country has restarted its main nuclear complex, a Soviet-era reactor used to produce plutonium for atomic bombs.

Global Hawk drones are capable of flying at altitudes of more than 60,000 feet (18,300 meters), and are the Air Force's most advanced surveillance vehicles. The drones also boast impressive aerial endurance, and can perform flights that last more than 28 hours.

The planes are equipped with a range of instruments, including infrared sensors and satellite communications systems. The RQ-4 Global Hawk, the biggest drone in the U.S. Air Force fleet, is capable of surveying 40,000 square miles (103,000 square kilometers) of ground in one day.

The Air Force currently has Global Hawk drones stationed in Guam, in the western Pacific Ocean, and in the Persian Gulf. This week's agreement is the first time the Pentagon has obtained rights to operate drones from bases in Northeast Asia, reported the Post.

American drones previously conducted flights over Japan in 2011 to monitor the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, which suffered a partial meltdown following the region's devastating earthquake and tsunami that claimed nearly 16,000 lives.

http://news.yahoo.com/campaign-raising-funds-to-help-edward-snowden-fly-to-venezuela-142529437.html,,[],Campaign raising money to help Edward Snowden fly to Venezuela,"An online campaign is hoping to raise money to pay for NSA leaker Edward Snowden’s travel to Venezuela.

Snowden, who applied for temporary asylum in Russia and has been living in limbo at the Moscow international airport for nearly a month, hopes to be granted a certificate for temporary asylum on Wedesday, Snowden's lawyer announced on Monday.

Venezuela, Bolivia and Nicaragua have offered Snowden asylum. None can be reached by direct commercial flight from Moscow, so taking a commercial flight could make Snowden vulnerable to arrest during a stopover and he could be returned to the United States, where he faces espionage charges.

The campaign Fly Edward Snowden Fly, which surfaced on Mashable.com, was set up by Christian Honey, a neuroscientist at the University of Oxford. Honey hopes to raise $200,000 to fund Snowden’s travel—with no stops—by private jet to Venezuela.

Beyond travel expenses, Honey explains on the Indiegogo site, “all scenarios for Edward Snowden involve substantial legal costs: asylum applications, legal advice, defense.

""All funds,” Honey says, “will go directly to the bank account set up for Mr. Snowden by Rothera and Company LLT in London, the accountants that also take care of the Wikileaks' Julian Assange's support fund.""

The campaign, which has nine days left, has a long way to go toward its goal. So far, only a little over $1,600 has been raised.

The former NSA contractor, who leaked classified documents to the media about U.S. government surveillance programs, is hoping to avoid prosecution by fleeing to a friendly country that has offered asylum.

Although Snowden has not made his travel plans public, Honey concludes that he is most likely to eventually go to Venezuela.

""Edward Snowden deserves to be free,"" Honey told Yahoo News by email. ""He revealed that the US and UK governments have secretly created spying programs that no one ever voted for.""

Honey also includes a list of famous supporters, from filmmaker Oliver Stone to Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.

“If you agree with Edward’s actions, if you agree he’s a whistle-blower and did the world good, then maybe you want to contribute to this campaign,” Honey says in a YouTube video made for the campaign.

Not everyone seems to agree. The controversy continues on Honey's YouTube page. YouTube user denisasitis posted, ""I sent money and will do all I can to spread the word, thank you for your effort."" But Ben Kotowicz writes, ""As any US Citizen, Snowden will be given a trial. If he leaves the country, chances are that he will never see his family again. I would say that is a sentence in itself."""
http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/22/politics/nsa-leaks/index.html,2013-06-22 00:00:00,"['Melissa Gray', 'Dan Lothian']",U.S. seeks Snowden extradition in NSA leaks case,"Story highlights NEW: Hong Kong authorities say they'll examine the charges against Snowden U.S. contacts Hong Kong to seek Edward Snowden's extradition Snowden has said he plan to fight any extradition attempt Snowden tells paper that U.S. government is hacking Chinese mobile phone firms

(CNN) —

This new treaty established an agreement under Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” that allows Hong Kong autonomy from Beijing in all matters apart from defense and foreign policy.

Federal prosecutors charged Snowden with espionage and theft of government property, according to a criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in Virginia on Friday.

The United States based the extradition request on the criminal complaint and a treaty between the United States and Hong Kong that covers the surrender of “fugitive offenders” and their extradition.

Washington already asked Hong Kong, where Snowden is believed to be in hiding, to detain the former National Security Agency contract analyst on a provisional arrest warrant, The Washington Post reported, citing unnamed U.S. officials.

“If Hong Kong doesn’t act soon, it will complicate our bilateral relations and raise questions about Hong Kong’s commitment to the rule of law,” the administration official said.

The complaint charges Snowden with theft of government property, unauthorized communication of national defense information, and willful communication of classified communications intelligence to an unauthorized person. The latter two allegations amount to espionage under the federal Espionage Act.

Snowden, 30, has admitted in interviews he was the source behind the leaking of classified documents about the NSA’s surveillance programs. Those leaks were the basis of reports in Britain’s Guardian newspaper and The Washington Post this month. The Guardian revealed Snowden’s identify at his request.

The documents revealed the existence of top-secret surveillance programs that collect records of domestic telephone calls in the United States and monitor the Internet activity of overseas residents.

There is a question about whether the espionage charges will be considered political offenses. The U.S. agreement with Hong Kong makes an exception for political offenses, in which case the treaty would not apply to Snowden.

Hong Kong Executive Council member Regina Ip said authorities can arrest Snowden if his actions qualify as a crime under Hong Kong law, China’s state-run Xinhua news agency reported early Sunday.

But if his actions are deemed to be political charges, she told Xinhua, then Snowden will not be extradited.

“We will work under the framework of Hong Kong law, and won’t allow any illegal or unfair judgment,” Hong Kong Secretary of Justice Rimsky Yuen told Xinhua.

Prominent U.S. lawyer Alan Dershowitz, a professor at Harvard Law School, said the espionage charge complicates the case.

“I think it’s a dumb decision by the Justice Department to charge him with espionage,” Dershowitz told CNN. “That’s a political crime under the extradition we have with Hong Kong. It gives Hong Kong an excuse to say we don’t have to extradite him.

“They should have indicted him only for theft and conversion of property. Then Hong Kong would have to comply with the extradition treaty and turn him over.”

The revelation of the leaks rocked the Obama administration and U.S. intelligence community, raising questions about secret operations of the NSA and whether the agency was infringing on American civil liberties.

Obama, top legislators and national security officials defend the surveillance programs as necessary to combat terrorism and argue that some privacy must be sacrificed in a balanced approach.

They say the law allows collection of metadata, such as the time and numbers of phone calls, and that a special federal court must approve accessing the content – listening to the call itself.

In interviews earlier this month, Snowden said he fled with the classified documents after taking a leave of absence from his job as an intelligence analyst for NSA contractor Booz Allen Hamiliton. The company has since fired him.

A series of blog posts this week purportedly by Snowden said he leaked classified details about U.S. surveillance programs because President Barack Obama worsened “abusive” practices, instead of curtailing them as he promised as a candidate.

However, Obama “closed the door on investigating systemic violations of law, deepened and expanded several abusive programs, and refused to spend the political capital to end the kind of human rights violations like we see in Guantanamo, where men still sit without charge,” a blog post said. The Guardian newspaper and website identified the author as Snowden.

Snowden said that he had to get out of the United States before the leaks were published by the Guardian and The Washington Post to avoid being targeted by the government.

In an interview with the South China Morning Post, he said he plans to stay in Hong Kong to fight any attempt to force him to return to the United States because he has “faith in Hong Kong’s rule of law.”

The U.S. signed the extradition treaty with Hong Kong in 1996, seven months before the British colony was handed back to China. Hong Kong’s extradition laws had previously been governed by the United States-United Kingdom extradition treaty.

This new treaty established an agreement under what is known as “one country, two systems”: Hong Kong has autonomy from Beijing in all matters apart from defense and foreign policy.

Snowden told the South China Morning Post, in an interview published Sunday, that the U.S. government is hacking Chinese mobile phone companies to steal millions of text messages. The Guardian also reported Snowden’s latest claims.

Last week, Snowden told the Post that U.S. intelligence agents have been hacking computer networks around the world, including in China, for years.

http://news.yahoo.com/us-commandos-hand-over-troubled-area-afghans-085617778.html,,[],US commandos hand over troubled area to Afghans,"KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — U.S. special operations forces handed over their base in a strategic district of eastern Afghanistan to local Afghan special forces on Saturday, senior U.S. commanders said. The withdrawal satisfies a demand by Afghan President Hamid Karzai that U.S. forces leave the area after allegations that the Americans' Afghan counterparts committed human rights abuses there on U.S. orders.

The transfer of authority ends a particularly rocky episode in the strained relations between the U.S. and Karzai. He had insisted that U.S. forces leave Nirkh district in Wardak province over the alleged torture, kidnapping and summary execution of militant suspects there — charges U.S. officials firmly denied.

The incident shows the larger struggle of Karzai's government to assert its authority over security matters, even as its green security forces try to assume control of much of the country from coalition forces on a rushed timeline, ahead of the scheduled withdrawal of most of coalition forces by December 2014.

""As we pledged, our forces have transitioned Nirkh district to Afghan national security forces and they have now assumed full responsibility for security in this key district,"" Gen. Joseph Dunford, the top commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, said in a statement released Saturday.

""The rest of Wardak will continue to transition over time as Afghan forces continue to grow in capability and capacity,"" he added.

Maj. Gen. Tony Thomas, the top U.S. special operations commander in Afghanistan, told The Associated Press in an interview that the transition of authority took place Saturday. ""What it means is we brought in an Afghan special forces team to take the place of ours,"" Thomas said.

Attaullah Khogyani, spokesman for the governor of Wardak province outside Kabul, confirmed that U.S. special operations forces withdrew and were replaced by a joint Afghan security forces team.

Karzai had originally demanded the U.S. special operations forces pull out from the entire province, a gateway and staging area for Taliban and other militants for attacks on the capital Kabul. But he scaled down his demands to just the single district after negotiations with Dunford and other U.S. officials.

Story continues

""President Karzai was specific, it's only for Nirkh, that was a provocative point,"" Thomas said. ""American special operations forces are integral in the defense of Wardak from now until the foreseeable future.""

U.S. commandos will also continue to visit the Afghan team in Nirkh.

""We're going to support them from a distance,"" Thomas said. ""The reality is there was such a groundswell of support (from locals) in Wardak after the initial allegations that we're keeping several teams down there to work with the Afghan security forces for the future, with an idea that we'll transition over time.""

The American special operations troops are paired with and live alongside locally recruited and trained teams known as Afghan local police. Thomas said most of the local police will be paired with Afghan security forces by the end of the summer, with the Americans making occasional visits as they will do in Nirkh, to assess whether they need logistic or other support.

One Wardak government official expressed relief that the agreement crafted with Karzai did not mean the complete pullout of U.S. forces from the province, saying that local officials were worried their new forces would not yet be able to keep hardcore insurgents out of the area.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because his comments run counter to public statements made by Karzai that the Afghan security forces are ready for complete independence in Wardak.

Meanwhile, Taliban militants attacked a police convoy Saturday morning in Ghazni province in eastern Afghanistan, kicking off a fierce gunbattle, according to deputy provincial police chief Col. Mohammad Hussain.

The police requested a coalition air strike, which hit the militants' position and killed 15 fighters but also wounded nine civilians including a woman and child, Hussain said. He did not report any police casualties.

North Korea vows to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike against the U.S.

North Korea has now conducted three nuclear tests

U.N. approves new sanctions against North Korea

WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. is fully capable of defending itself against a North Korean ballistic missile attack, the White House said Thursday, after Pyongyang threatened a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the United States.

The threat from Pyongyang came ahead of a unanimous vote in the U.N. Security Council approving its toughest sanctions yet on North Korea in response to an atomic test last month.

North Korea has escalated its bellicose statements this week as the tightening of U.N. sanctions loomed. It has also threatened to scrap the cease-fire that ended the 1950-53 Korean War.

""I can tell you that the United States is fully capable of defending against any North Korean ballistic missile attack,"" said White House spokesman Jay Carney.

North Korea has now conducted three nuclear tests, although experts doubt it has mastered how to mount a nuclear warhead on a ballistic missile capable of reaching the mainland United States.

The top U.S. envoy on North Korea, Glyn Davies, cautioned Pyongyang not to miscalculate, saying the U.S. will take necessary steps to defend itself and its allies, including South Korea, where it bases over 30,000 U.S. forces.

The U.S. also provides what it calls a ""nuclear umbrella"" security guarantee to both South Korea and Japan, neighbors of North Korea which do not have atomic weapons, and missile defense capabilities.

""We take all North Korean threats seriously enough to ensure that we have the correct defense posture to deal with any contingencies that might arise,"" Davies told reporters after testifying to a Senate foreign relations panel.

Thursday's statement out of Pyongyang appeared to be the most specific open threat of a nuclear strike by any country against another, but the Senate panel's chairman, Democrat Robert Menendez of New Jersey, said the threat was ""absurd"" and one that if carried out would be suicide.

Davies reiterated that the U.S. will not accept North Korea as a nuclear-armed state — although after conducting three nuclear tests it is already assumed to have at least the capability to make at least a crude atomic bomb.

Davies, however, had to defend against Republican skepticism of the effectiveness of Obama administration's policy toward North Korea, which has taken strides in the past year toward its goal of having a nuclear weapon that can target the U.S. In December, it conducted its first successful launch of a three-stage, long-range rocket.

Ranking Republican Sen. Bob Corker, drew a comparison to U.S. policy on Iran, where the U.S. has warned it could resort to military action to prevent Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.

North Korea is ""equally nutty"" and with a worse human rights record, and ""way past any red line we would accept in Iran,"" he said.

Corker concluded that Davies' hope that the dual-track U.S. policy of pressure and engagement would eventually work in getting Pyongyang to change its ways was a ""highly aspirational statement that does not seem to be based on reality.""

The new U.N. sanctions, supported by the North's chief ally and source of economic aid, China, should make it more difficult for Pyongyang to finance and obtain material for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and for the reclusive nation's ruling elite to acquire luxury goods.

Davies said the growing international condemnation of North Korea's actions and the new U.N. sanctions showed ""the world is beginning to wake up"" to the problem the North poses.

But U.S. lawmakers remain skeptical of Beijing's commitment to implementing the sanctions, which will be critical for their effectiveness as most of the companies and banks that North Korea is believed to work with are based in China."

They would also be punishing and “consequential” and would so scare Assad that he would never use chemical weapons again.

U.S. airstrikes would change the momentum on the battlefield of the Syrian civil war. But the war will grind on, unchanged, perhaps for years.

As administration officials lay out their case in favor of a punitive attack on Syria, they have been making all of these seemingly contradictory contentions, confusing supporters and providing rhetorical weapons to their opponents.

The contradictions stem from the basic challenge the White House faces: how to reassure the large anti-war contingent in the Democratic Party, as well as conservative opponents of overseas intervention, that strikes won’t open the way to another war, while convincing hawks and more militant internationalists that the strikes will do enough to make the mission worthwhile.

It’s possible to square most of the administration’s arguments – if one believes that a military strike can be so precisely calibrated as to harm the Assad government just enough, but not too much. But as a political case, the effort has so far proven hard to sell.

If officials lean too far in one direction, they risk losing supporters on one side or the other. But when they voice both sides of their case, they risk presenting an argument that is incoherent.

Former House Speaker New Gingrich said on “Meet the Press” that Obama was promising to punch Assad a little bit, but not too much, and such a goal was too nebulous to sell to the public.

When the administration is talking to Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a leader of the hawks, “the emphasis is on degrade. When talking to Democrats, the emphasis is on limited,” said Michael Doran, a White House official in the Bush administration and a supporter of strikes.

“And it leave us with a big question: What is our overall strategy on Syria, and how does this fit into it?” asked Doran, now with the Brookings Institution.

The sometimes-tortured quality of the argument was apparent over the weekend as some officials claimed that the strikes would shift the momentum of the Syrian war, and others said it would largely be unchanged.

Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, said on “Meet the Press” that “there is no doubt that momentum on the battlefield will be changed by a targeted, limited effort.”

But the day before, a senior administration official briefing reporters on Secretary of State John Kerry’s airplane predicted the war will “grind on” after the strikes.

“I think it will grind on without the use of chemical weapons, but I think it will grind on,” said the official, who the State Department insisted must remain unidentified because of the sensitivity of the subject.

At the same time, the official said other U.S. efforts to help the rebels – presumably U.S. overt and covert training, military supplies and medical help – did have the objective of changing the “balance on the ground.”

“This is an objective the administration has long supported,” the official said.

As administration officials make their arguments, different members of the audience are taking away different points.

McCain came away from a private meeting with Obama on Tuesday convinced that the president had shifted his goals and now intended to do more to “degrade” the Syrian military machine. He offered an amendment to a proposed Senate resolution authorizing a strike to say that the strike’s objective was to “change the momentum on the battlefield.”

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee accepted the language. But that change alarmed Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who warned it could drive away House lawmakers.

It is difficult for the administration to argue that the strikes would help topple Assad because officials have been arguing for some time – and Obama repeated Friday -- that only a massive military intervention could force an end to the 2 ½-year-old civil war.

The White House wants to stay clear from suggestions that it is seeking “regime change” with the strikes, because that phrase, associated with the Bush administration, will alarm foreign allies as well as many Americans.

Officials have insisted all along that there is no military solution to the civil war and that eventually, the Assad government and the disparate rebel forces will have to reach a negotiated settlement.

At the same time, the administration wants to deflect accusations that it is preparing to launch only “pinprick” strikes with a symbolic value.

The Clinton administration was battered by accusations in 1998 that it had turned to strategically meaningless cruise missile strikes against Saddam Hussein and against Osama bin Laden’s Afghan training camps, which were largely empty when they were hit.

One more complication for the White House arguments is that the mission appears to be becoming more ambitious as time passes.

U.S. military officials say the military is expanding the target list, and may use aircraft, as well as unmanned missiles, over what could be a three-day period. ABC News reported that an unidentified U.S. official was boasting that the strikes could do more damage in 48 hours than the rebels have done in the entire civil war.

The senior administration official speaking on Kerry’s plane insisted the addition of new targets did not represent “mission creep” because the objective was the same even if the Pentagon has decided to use more force.

“I define ‘mission creep’ as shifting the objective, not the means,” the official said.
