http://news.yahoo.com/decision-day-njs-accelerated-us-senate-race-050236056.html,,[],Decision day in NJ's accelerated US Senate race,"TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — New Jersey's abbreviated U.S. Senate race went to the populace Wednesday with candidates characterizing the contest as a referendum on the partisan gridlock that has paralyzed Washington in recent weeks.

Democrat Cory Booker and Republican Steve Lonegan each cast a ballot early in the morning in the special election to fill the seat of the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg, who died in June.

The election is the first since the partial federal government shutdown began more than two weeks ago. It came the same day Senate leaders announced a deal had been struck to reopen the government and avert a Treasury default.

""This is the only election in America right now where we will get a chance to make a statement about what is going on in Washington,"" Booker said after voting in downtown Newark. ""This is a chance for us to send a message about the shutdown, about the gridlock, about all those forces that my opponent represents — the tea party — that says we shouldn't compromise, we shouldn't work together.""

Booker, the high-profile mayor of New Jersey's largest city, had circulated a petition to end the shutdown and accused Congress of failing voters by not finding a way to work together.

Lonegan supported the shutdown, arguing the Affordable Care Act should be delayed a year and objecting to the concept of government-directed health insurance. In recent days, he has accused Booker of not even living in Newark.

After voting in Bogota, the city he led as mayor for three terms, Lonegan said he has been able to unite Republicans of all stripes.

""We've unified and I'm proud of that,"" he said. ""The entire Republican party, from the tea party to the moderate wing to pro-life and not so pro-life. Everybody who cares about individual liberty.""

In the shore town of Point Pleasant, nurse Mary Martin said she voted for Lonegan, a decision that wasn't influenced by the government shutdown.

""I'm a longtime Republican and I just think with the way we're headed, we need more conservative people in there,"" she said.

Story continues

Polls closed at 8 p.m.

The two-month campaign played out under a compressed schedule and was the subject of controversy even before the two candidates were chosen.

Republican Gov. Chris Christie appointed a GOP caretaker and ordered the election held Oct. 16, the soonest date the law allowed following an unprecedented August primary.

Critics accused the governor of keeping the race off the Nov. 5 ballot, when he is up for re-election, to make it easier for him to win big as a Republican in a Democratic-leaning state and aid his potential national ambitions. During his first debate, he refused to rule out a run for president in 2016.

Public opinion polls showed Booker, 44, the second-term mayor of Newark, with a double-digit-percentage advantage heading into the election, where he hoped to secure a seat as the second African-American in the Senate along with Republican Tim Scott of South Carolina.

Booker on Wednesday called the opportunity to serve as senator ""one of the greatest privileges any Jersey boy could have.""

Marcy Phillips, a 30-year resident of Newark, covered her car in Booker signs and was driving around the city Wednesday urging people to vote.

""He's the best out of the candidates right now, and he's the one we need,"" she said. ""As the mayor of Newark, he did his best and right now the whole city has changed.""

Lonegan, 57, the former state director of Americans for Prosperity, a group advocating limited government that was founded by the billionaire Koch brothers, ran an aggressive, in-your-face campaign.

""We want a leader, not a tweeter,"" he said at one point, referring to Booker's prolific use of Twitter, where he has 1.4 million followers.

Both candidates drew on some big names for support — Oprah Winfrey helped raise funds for Booker, while the nation's largest tea party political action committee brought former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in to campaign for the GOP nominee.

The campaign took odd twists and turns for both candidates.

Booker was forced off-message to explain G-rated correspondence with a stripper he met while filming a social media documentary. Lonegan was forced to dump a longtime strategist after a lengthy, profanity-laced interview with a political website in which he claimed Booker's banter with the stripper ""was like what a gay guy would say.""

While in Newark, Booker has worked with Christie on common education goals, such as ending lifetime teacher tenure and increasing the number of charter schools. Newark schools remain under state control.

Lonegan repeatedly knocked Booker for the city's high crime rate and unemployment. At one point in the campaign, Booker announced a new crime-fighting strategy to cope with a string of 10 homicides in 10 days.

Lonegan said that as a mayor, he also has reached across the aisle in working with a Democratic borough council.

But Booker painted him as a tea party extremist, one who would — if sent to Washington — make the capital's gridlock worse.

Obama, said Romney, has been traveling around the country ""berating Republicans and blaming and pointing"" over the sequester. The former Massachusetts governor, who along with his wife, Ann Romney, was interviewed by ""Fox News Sunday"" host Chris Wallace, said Obama's tactic ""causes Republicans to retrench and they put up a wall and fight back—it's a very natural, human emotion.""

It doesn't appear as if Congress will pass a budget before the March 1 midnight deadline. The White House claims the across-the-board spending cuts set to go into effect will be devastating, and that its negative impact is already rippling through the country.

Romney also criticized the government for deciding this week to release select noncriminal immigration detainees for budget reasons ahead of sequester cuts, and cast the decision as a political ploy.

""I think if there are people who are incarcerated, [Obama] should make sure that we're able to keep them in jail. Look, again, it's politics. It's, OK, how do we do something that will get a headline that will make it look like those terrible Republicans aren't willing to come together?” Romney said.

Romney has avoided the press since his loss to Obama. In his interview with Fox, he likened the election and its aftermath to an amusement park ride.

""We were on a roller coaster, exciting and thrilling, ups and downs. But the ride ends,"" Romney said. ""And then you get off. And it's not like, oh, can't we be on a roller coaster the rest of our life? It's like, no, the ride's over.""

Ann Romney said they were suddenly ""nobody."" She noted: ""In our church, we're used to serving, and you know, you can be in a very high position, but you recognize you're serving. And now all of a sudden, you're released and you're nobody. And we're used to that. It's like we came and stepped forward to serve. And you know, the other part of it was an amazing thing, and it was really quite a lot of energy and a lot of passion and a lot of—a lot of people around us and all of a sudden, it was nothing.""

The complete interview is set to air March 3 on ""Fox News Sunday."""

According to the new poll, only 22 percent of Americans think the member of Congress from their district deserves reelection, while 48 percent do not. Another 31 percent said they weren't sure.

Anger runs even higher against the rest of Congress, as only 7 percent of respondents said most members of Congress deserve reelection and 73 percent said they don't.

In an earlier HuffPost/YouGov poll -- conducted Oct. 9-10, during the government shutdown -- 25 percent said their own member of Congress deserved reelection, while 11 percent said they think most members of Congress deserve reelection.

Disdain for Congress crossed party lines in the latest survey: Only 27 percent of Republicans, 25 percent of Democrats and a mere 17 percent of independents said their own member of Congress deserves reelection.

Americans who identified their representative as a Republican said that lawmaker did not deserve reelection by a 56 percent to 29 percent margin. Those who identified their representative as a Democrat agreed by a 49 percent to 29 percent margin.

Notably, 27 percent weren't sure whether their representative was a Republican or a Democrat, and another 6 percent said they believed they were represented by ""something else.""

Respondents who weren't sure whether their member of Congress was a Democrat or a Republican tended also to be unsure whether he or she deserved reelection. But a 30 percent to 7 percent plurality said they wanted their mystery congressperson replaced.

The HuffPost/YouGov poll was conducted Nov. 1-2 among 1,000 U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. Factors considered include age, race, gender, education, employment, income, marital status, number of children, voter registration, time and location of Internet access, interest in politics, religion and church attendance.

http://news.yahoo.com/ex-sc-gov-sanford-announces-run-congress-145136581.html,,[],Ex-SC Gov. Sanford announces run for Congress,"CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — Former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, whose political career was derailed because of his affair with an Argentine woman, announced Wednesday he will seek his old seat in Congress, saying voters are more concerned about their finances than his past indiscretions.

""I think what they are most focused on is not the fact I have made a mistake and apologized and have tried to do right in my life since. What they are focused on is their pocketbook and their wallet,"" Sanford told The Associated Press.

The 52-year-old Republican was a strong fiscal conservative long before the advent of the Tea Party and said he wants to go back to Washington to restore what he calls ""fiscal sanity"" to the nation's finances.

Sanford was considered a possible contender for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012 before his affair was revealed. He disappeared from the state for five days, with his aides telling the press he was hiking on the Appalachian Trail.

All along, he was in Argentina. When he returned, Sanford confessed to the affair in a tearful news conference. He later called Maria Belen Chapur his ""soul mate."" The couple got engaged last summer and plan to marry this summer.

Sanford spent much of his final days in office traveling around the state apologizing and asking for forgiveness. Now, it's time to stop saying he's sorry and move on, he said.

""I spent more than a year of my life going around apologizing,"" he said. ""The obvious is the obvious. I let myself down and a lot of other people down.""

But he added, ""The apology tour, if you want to call it that, is over. All you can do is say I'm sorry. But at some point you have to lift up your head and start moving and I'm at that point.""

Sanford is seeking his old 1st District seat along the state's coast that became vacant when Gov. Nikki Haley appointed U.S. Rep. Tim Scott to fill the unexpired Senate term of Jim DeMint, who resigned.

Sanford, who served in Congress for three terms in the 1990s, ran his first congressional race calling for financial restraint in Washington and warning the nation could not continue its free-spending ways.

""All the things I was talking about when it wasn't in vogue have indeed come about,"" he said. ""Now we seem to have a fiscal crisis every couple of months.""

As when he did when he earlier served in Congress, Sanford said he will limit his terms in Washington, but hasn't yet decided on a number."

This case could also set an important precedent for lawsuits recently filed against similar laws in Texas and North Carolina.

The Wisconsin law, which is now on hold, is among the strictest in the country. It requires a voter to show poll workers government-issued photo identification, like a driver’s license or passport.

The law’s challengers, which include the A.C.L.U., the League of United Latin American Citizens, the League of Young Voters and several private citizens, sued under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. That section, which survived the Supreme Court’s ruling, prohibits state and local governments from imposing any “voting qualification or prerequisite to voting” that has a racially discriminatory effect. The test is whether a law causes minority voters to have “less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process.”

The plaintiffs presented substantial evidence that the Wisconsin statute had precisely that effect.

For example, a political scientist testified that it is likely that more than 63,000 residents of Milwaukee do not have the required photo ID, and that black residents are 40 percent more likely than whites not to have such ID. In addition, one-third of those without a photo ID do not have the underlying documents, like a birth certificate, needed to get one. The court heard testimony from several such witnesses, including Lorene Hutchins, a 93-year-old black woman who was born at home in Mississippi at a time when the state’s hospitals refused to accept black patients."

SC-01 (in green)

Today's the big day for the special election in South Carolina's 1st congressional district, which, thanks to the presence of two candidates with much higher profiles than your usual House race contestants, is one of the most attention-grabbing House specials we've seen in years. The candidates, of course, are Republican Mark Sanford—who represented a predecessor to this district in the 1990s before becoming governor in 2002 and then going on to even greater celebrity for his Appalachian Trail-hiking exloits—and Democrat Elizabeth Colbert Busch, who benefits from having a famous brother, Stephen Colbert, in her corner.

After a spate of initial polls giving Colbert Busch the lead against the badly damaged Sanford (with leads as high as 9, in Public Policy Polling's late-April poll of the race), things have settled down into a dead heat in the last few weeks. That's seen in not only a poll from conservative blog Red Racing Horses, which found a 46-46 tie, but also PPP's most recent poll from this weekend, which gives Sanford a 47-46 lead. If anything, these results show Sanford with a perceptible advantage heading into today: PPP found that the remaining undecided voters broke in favor of Mitt Romney in the 2012 election by a 59-25 margin.

While that's disappointing given the previous ECB-friendly polls, it shouldn't be too surprising. That kind of reversion to the mean is usually what happens in strongly partisan districts like this one (it went 40 percent Obama, 58 percent Romney in 2012; only three House Democrats represent districts redder than this one, and they're all entrenched veterans).

That may be particularly pronounced with PPP's previous poll; the one that showed a 9-point lead was taken right after the news about Sanford's trespassing at his ex-wife's property came out, and it seemed like Republican responses to the poll were particularly muted at that point. With that incident already sliding down the memory hole, enough Republican partisans have swallowed their pride and re-activated, to put Sanford within reach of a win. (Also not helpful: the presence of a Green Party candidate, who's pulling 4 percent in the most recent PPP poll, potentially enough to tip the balance of the race in Sanford's direction.)

Let's take a look at the counties that will be involved in tonight's election, below the fold."
http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/12/08/ed-gillespie-considering-virginia-senate-run/,2013-12-08 00:00:00,"['Aaron Blake', 'Senior Political Reporter', 'Writing For The Fix', 'Senior Reporter']",Ed Gillespie considering Virginia Senate run,"Gillespie's flirtation with a Senate bid was first reported by Politico.

Gillespie said that, for now, the state party's focus should be on the looming recount in the razor-thin 2013 state attorney general's race. But the fields are largely set in the most competitive Senate races, and most major candidates tend to get in before the new year.

The filing deadline is Feb. 1.

Warner, despite coming from a swing state, doesn't rank among the GOP's top targets in 2014. Part of that is because Republicans are pursuing seven states that went for Mitt Romney in last year's presidential election, and part of it is because Warner is a very popular former governor with a moderate reputation.

A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in August showed Warner had a 61 percent approval rating, with just 25 percent of Virginians disapproving of him.

But Gillespie, 52, said Warner's record isn't as centrist as most people think.

""They thought he’d be an independent voice, but he’s voted with President Obama 97 percent of the time since he got elected with him in 2008,"" Gillespie said. ""They thought he’d be fiscally responsible, but he voted for a trillion dollar stimulus bill that borrowed from future generations to waste on pork barrel spending. And he promised he’d never vote for a bill that would mean people losing the insurance they like if they wanted to keep it, then cast the deciding vote in favor of Obamacare.""

Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II, who lost the state's 2013 governor's race last month, said over the weekend that he wouldn't challenge Warner in 2014. Other potential candidates include state Sen. Jeff McWaters.

If Gillespie were to win the seat, both of Virginia's senators would be former national party chairmen (Gillespie and former Democratic National Committee chairman Timothy M. Kaine), as well as its governor-elect, Terry McAuliffe, a former DNC chairman who will assume office in the coming weeks."

A Once in a Generation Opportunity for the Democratic Party in Red States in 2014.,"First of all, look at this map.



It shows which states are participating in the Obamacare and which have opted out. The red and purple states aren't any surprise.

But I'll bet this will be:



But a poll conducted in March and April by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies found that 62 percent of the people in those states support the expansion, one of the key instruments in the Obama administration’s strategy to reduce the number of uninsured Americans.

This is a study conducted by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies that interviewed 2500 residents in the states of Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia and South Carolina - some the most ""southern"" and ""conservative"" states in the country.This is an opportunity for Democrats to get ahead on this issue in states where people will see changes in coverage and where the GOP will continue to try to blame Obama and the Democratic health reform initiative. Wefight back.

Bold Blue Media Alliance has formed a coalition with several other groups and individuals in these states, including some state-level and county-level Democratic officials. We are prepared to create 60-second and 30-second television, radio ads and internet videos for their use as well as print-ready materials - to help our party get the TRUTH out; that the GOP in these states hates Obama more than they care about health and the lives of their own constituents. They are sabotaging the health care law and costing people their lives. They are saboteurs and I call these states are Sabotage States.

We plan to create clear, targeted, easy-to-understand (and hard to refute) messages for each state with numbers and information people can actually relate to. We plan, as is our Mission at Bold Blue Media, to give Democrats and Progressives at the state and local levels the tools they need to fight back and win.

It's time to empower Team Blue no matter where they are in the country. I believe that the proper framing of this issue can aid 2014 party recruitment in these tough-to-win states and localities and that we can force an open debate about the real motivations of the Republican party in states where they have been blindly followed for too long. It's time for us to rally 'round our side in these tough states where they often feel all is futile.

Open enrollment for ACA starts in October. There are 21 states that will need this media. We'd like to have the videos and infographics available to them by late July. I need your help.

HOW CAN YOU HELP?

If you have any connection with your state or local Democratic party, particularly if you live in one of the Sabotage States, please message me here or email me at m.paige at bold blue media dot com.

ANOTHER WAY TO HELP:

Like this page, share it on twitter or facebook; Especially if you have friends or followers from Sabotage States. They need to know we're all fighting for their access to health care. That we are one in the fight to make it available to EVERY American and that we won't stop until they have the same access as those participating states.

ANOTHER WAY TO HELP:

You can help by subscribing to Bold Blue Magazine. No, seriously. I can't make all these videos and infographics on my own in time. I'm busy planning our Netroots Nation booth and creating the premier issue of Bold Blue Magazine. But I feel this issue is so important and that we have a limited window of time in which to act. Although I plan to do the groundwork on the videos by laying the basic structure for them, I'll need to engage our Alliance Team Network, many of whom are Kossacks, to help complete this monumental task in time by adding state-specific imagery and information to the media. We haven't enough revenue coming in yet for me to pay them properly at this time, but I have to offer them at least something. Your subscription would help me to that and help us meet the deadline.

I know many state and county parties, particularly in these red states, are strapped. I'm presently building a partnership with a major progressive organization here in DC. I'm hoping that by the end of July they can help facilitate fundraising for media buys and work with Sabotage State Democrats to educate, expose and put pressure on recalcitrant republican state legislators.

Subscribe here. It would help a lot. PLUS, hell. You'll get a GREAT magazine in the process! (I have to tell you, I'm putting together the premier issue and it's going to be amazing!). You can choose your subscription rate. If you manage $3/month, we'd love that. There are options all the way up to $100/month (for those of you who want to treat this more like state/local campaign support). There's even some special pricing that will disappear on June 1st so take advantage of it now, while you can.

This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make progress in tough states. Let's do it.

UPDATE: Iowa has decided to go WITH the expansion. 150,000 Iowans will benefit. Imagine that. This sh*t is not hard. Really. It's not.

(CNN) – U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said she has regretted calling then-Sen. Hillary Clinton a ""monster"" nearly every day since she made the comment in the 2008 primary battle when Power worked as an adviser to then-Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaign.

""There is a fair amount of negativity heaped upon her that I find massively unfair. And the idea that I could have contributed in some way to that narrative...that was terrible. So yeah, I have regretted it pretty much every day since,"" she said in an interview that aired Thursday on NBC's ""Today.""



Power apologized for her comments in March 2008 after they were published in a Scottish newspaper.

""She is a monster, too – that is off the record – she is stooping to anything,"" Power was quoted as saying.

""You just look at her and think, 'Ergh,' "" Power also said. ""But if you are poor and she is telling you some story about how Obama is going to take your job away, maybe it will be more effective. The amount of deceit she has put forward is really unattractive.""

Power resigned from the Obama campaign after apologizing for the comments, and she apologized to Clinton personally. In the Thursday interview, she said ""it was very emotional for me.""

""To be able to say that in person was something that I'm immensely grateful to her to have given me that opportunity to do,"" she said.

Power went on to become the special assistant to the president and senior director for multilateral affairs and human rights at the National Security Council during Obama's first term. She left the administration in February and was nominated for the ambassadorship in June.

In the Thursday interview, Power said she and Clinton have ""worked together very effectively on issues of common concern the last four years."""

Not even articles breathlessly titled and subtitled:

Go for the Throat! Why if he wants to transform American politics, Obama must declare war on the Republican Party.

Not even articles that read:

The president who came into office speaking in lofty terms about bipartisanship and cooperation can only cement his legacy if he destroys the GOP. If he wants to transform American politics, he must go for the throat. …

Obama’s only remaining option is to pulverize. Whether he succeeds in passing legislation or not, given his ambitions, his goal should be to delegitimize his opponents. Through a series of clarifying fights over controversial issues, he can force Republicans to either side with their coalition’s most extreme elements or cause a rift in the party that will leave it, at least temporarily, in disarray.

Slate is what it is and some bloodthirsty Slate writer orgasmic over the prospect of Obama permanently pulverizing and destroying the GOP is as noteworthy as green on grass.

Oh, except after someone like Brit Hume connects the dots.

The author of this outrageous left-wing fever dream is John Dickerson, whom Slate describes as “Slate’s chief political correspondent”. What Slate leaves out of its little bio, though, is that Dickerson is also the political director at CBS News.

Dickerson is merely being Dickerson, and there’s no doubt he speaks for legions upon legions of those in the media today.

What is worthy of note, though, is that a CBS News’ political director is now comfortable openly calling for the destruction of the Republican Party. He obviously fears no admonitions from his colleagues or his employer. And why should he? Earlier this week, Bob Schieffer, a CBS News “living legend,” was perfectly comfortable publicly comparing the NRA to Nazis.

You lump all of this with CNN chief Jeff Zucker applauding Piers Morgan’s shameless feasting off the dead children of Sandy Hook for ratings and attention, and what you have is a media that’s finally … coming out.

And yet, even as they do, even as they openly celebrate their left-wing biases out of one side of their mouth, out the other, they will claim they remain objective and unbiased.

The Big Lie has officially arrived.

All 45 Republican senators filed a brief with the Supreme Court on Tuesday which argued Obama went too far in appointing members to the National Labor Relations Board in January 2012. That board has been behind a host of union-friendly decisions, and the dispute over Obama's appointees threatens to upend those rulings -- as well as stall the board itself.

Republicans, in their brief, urged the high court to rule on the validity of the 2012 appointments, while arguing that Obama overstepped his bounds.

""The president's decision to circumvent the American people by installing his appointees at a powerful federal agency while the Senate was continuing to hold sessions, and without obtaining the advice and consent of the Senate, is an unprecedented power grab,"" Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said in a written statement. ""We will demonstrate to the Court how the president's unconstitutional actions fundamentally endanger the Congress' role in providing a check on the excesses of the executive branch.""

The brief itself was submitted by attorney Miguel Estrada, whom the Republicans retained for work on this case.

Estrada wrote that Obama's actions ""would radically reshape the constitutional structure"" if allowed to stand.

""If he can override Senate procedures and second-guess its account of its actions, there is no telling what mischief he can achieve,"" he wrote.

At issue are so-called recess appointments, a tactic used by presidents of both parties in the past. Obama has made 32 of them to date, while his predecessor, George W. Bush, made 171 over his two terms. Bill Clinton logged 139 recess appointments.

But a federal appeals court ruled earlier this year that the president made appointments to the NLRB when the Senate was not technically in recess, and therefore the appointments were invalid.

A second appeals court ruled in May that another NLRB appointment from 2010 was also made when the Senate was merely adjourned. The court again ruled that the appointment was invalid.

The administration argues that invalidating these appointments would invalidate recess appointments going back 100 years.

But Republicans, and the business battling the NLRB in the prior case, argue that Obama has stretched his authority.

The Obama administration had earlier appealed the January decision to the Supreme Court."

Kelly Ayotte, a conservative Republican, announced her support Sunday for a bipartisan immigration overhaul plan, lending momentum to the comprehensive measure being debated in the Senate.

“Our immigration system is completely broken,” the New Hampshire lawmaker said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “This is a thoughtful, bipartisan solution to a tough problem.”

Ayotte, who was elected in 2010, is the first Republican to endorse the measure apart from the four in the Senate’s so-called Gang of Eight: Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Marco Rubio of Florida and Jeff Flake of Arizona.

U.S. immigration law: Decades of debate

Ayotte, a former prosecutor and New Hampshire attorney general, said the U.S. has 11 million people living “illegally in the shadows” while the legal immigration system is not “meeting the needs to grow our economy.”

She wants more high-tech workers admitted to ensure the U.S. has the “best and brightest here … to grow our economy.”

She praised the bill’s pathway to citizenship for immigrants who are here without legal status as “tough but fair,” saying they would “go to the back of the line, pay taxes, pass a criminal background check, learn English.”

The bill faces a key test vote Tuesday. Several amendments are on tap before a vote on a final bill, which could come at month’s end.

With 60 votes needed for passage to avert a filibuster, Ayotte’s support puts backers closer to the threshold.

Still, some Republicans continue to push for enhanced border security. Among them is Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who cautioned on “Fox News Sunday” that the Senate’s bipartisan plan “has zero chances of passing in the House.”

Paul said he dislikes the plan’s cap on agricultural workers. He also wants people who are in the U.S. on work visas to stand in line for U.S. citizenship in their country of origin, and he would not create a new path to citizenship.

“I’m really trying to make immigration work,” he said. But other senators are “going to have to come to me and they’re going to have to work with me to make the bill stronger if they want me to vote for it.”

Mark Sanford, left, and Elizabeth Colbert Busch, are running for Congress in the South Carolina.

Story highlights John Avlon: Media emphasizing Jenny Sanford and Stephen Colbert in special election In reality, the story is the race between Mark Sanford and Elizabeth Colbert Busch He says there's reason Democrats can hope to capture the seat Avlon: Changing demographics make victory for centrist Democrats possible

Editor’s Note: John Avlon, a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast, is the author of “Independent Nation” and “Wingnuts.” He won the National Society of Newspaper Columnists’ award for best online column in 2012.

(CNN) —

The fiery South Carolina congressional special election between former Gov. Mark Sanford and Elizabeth Colbert Busch is attracting national attention – but not for the reasons it should.

Listening to much of the national coverage, it can sound like a race between Jenny Sanford – the ex-wife of the ex-governor – and comedian Stephen Colbert, the brother of the Democratic candidate.

But the real news is that a Democrat could win the 1st Congressional District in South Carolina, reversing Republican control of the seat since 1981. Polls show Colbert Busch ahead and her confident debate performance on Monday night helped solidify the sense that momentum is behind her campaign.

Newsweek John Avlon

Subsequent endorsements of Sanford by Hustler publisher Larry Flynt, who unhelpfully praised him as a “sexual pioneer,” and a billboard put up by the odious adultery website Ashley Madison did nothing to help this would-be comeback kid.

It is too early to count Sanford out, despite some liberal pundits declaring the race all but over. The coastal 1st District still has a 20% Republican registration advantage, and Sanford has never lost an election. But if Colbert Busch does win, it should shake up the lazy partisan assumptions that underlie our politics. That’s because the result will not just be a referendum on Sanford but would also be a reflection of changing demographics in South Carolina and throughout the South.

The idea that Texas, rich in Electoral College votes, could turn into a swing state has preoccupied pundits in recent weeks because it would upend presidential electoral math. A win by Colbert Busch in South Carolina wouldn’t have equal implications, but it could be a canary in the coalmine. And a close analysis of how her campaign defied the odds would be required reading for any Southern Democrats.

First, consider that Charleston County – the heart of the 1st Congressional District – voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012. Urban centers in the South have been trending more Democratic in recent years, buoyed not just by the black vote but younger voters – including students and Northern transplants who move South for the improved quality of life.

In fact, the 1st District of South Carolina is only 21% rural, according to U.S. Census statistics published in the Almanac of American Politics. Most significantly, the population has grown 28% since 2000. This because of a Southern resurgence and a growth in local businesses, especially manufacturing – thanks largely to the fact that South Carolina is a right-to-work state. (Colbert-Busch, who is also running on the Working Families Party line, proclaimed herself “proud to live in a right to work state during the debate).

The takeaway here is that the old assumptions about a monochrome conservative electorate don’t apply in coastal areas of South Carolina. This creates an opening for a centrist Democrat to win, especially against a polarizing Republican.

And that is precisely the card that Colbert Busch has tried to play throughout the campaign, presenting herself as a “tough, independent businesswoman” who will try to find common ground in Congress.

During the contentious debate at the Citadel on Monday, a well-coached Colbert Busch repeatedly tried to distance herself from liberal positions and then seize the center.

“Obamacare is extremely problematic” she declared, expressing concerns about unintended costs and then pivoting to praise popular provisions such as an end to the exclusion of people with pre-existing conditions and the allowance for children to stay on their parents’ health care plans until 26.

She proclaimed herself “a really proud defender of the Second Amendment” and then worked her way to saying she would have voted for the universal background check bill. Likewise, when she endorsed immigration reform, she framed it as a plan backed by the Chamber of Commerce and the state’s senior senator, Lindsey Graham.

Even her most forthrightly liberal position, support for marriage equality, was explained by a quote from Dick Cheney – “freedom means freedom for everyone.” And when she was asked about abortion, she responded with a classic poll-tested Bill Clinton formulation – it is a difficult personal choice that should be made between “a woman, her family, her doctor and her God.”

Sanford’s repeated tactic was to try and essentially deny her attempt at seizing the center by connecting her to Nancy Pelosi and labor unions. (Full disclosure: I hosted the debate, which was sponsored by Patch.com and South Carolina Radio Network.)

But there are a few lessons.

First, centrist Democrats can get elected in South. This has been made more difficult in recent years because the Blue Dog tribe has been hunted into near-extinction, thanks largely to the rigged system of redistricting. In the case of South Carolina’s 1st District, that meant that the largely African-American neighborhood of North Charleston was added to the neighboring district of James Clyburn, the state’s sole Democratic congressional representative, who won re-election in 2012, virtually unchallenged.

Democrats increase their competitiveness not by simply playing to the base, but reaching out to the center – showing that they are committed to solving problems as well as being guided by core principles. Throughout the debate, Colbert Busch stuck studiously to that script, presenting herself an a independent-minded moderate who can help change the tone in Washington, contrasting with Republicans’ increasing reputation for being too inflexible and uncompromising.

“We have got to come to the middle;” she pleaded. “We have got to be reasonable”

Second, demographics are destiny and even the Solid South is subject to change.

Diversity is on the increase, but almost more significantly is the population growth – families moving to the South from other parts of the country in search of an improved quality of life and job opportunities. The growth of Southern cities also changes the political calculus because cities usually are less conservative than rural areas.

Finally, the competitiveness of this race even in a district with a 20-point Republican registration advantage shows that citizens are willing to vote for the person and not the party if they are given a compelling candidate and contrast. All of which is to say that Republicans who believe that they will inevitably win back the seat in 2014 might be mistaken.

Regardless of who wins the May 7 special election – and, again, Sanford shouldn’t be counted out – the real winners are already the residents of the coastal South Carolina.

Competitive congressional elections are increasingly rare in an age of redistricting-enforced one-party rule. But when everyone’s vote matters in a general election, it is a win for democracy.

Groups Offering Cover for Lawmakers on Immigration,"His words have been turned into television commercials by groups on both sides of the issue. And no one has taken on more friendly fire. Mr. Rubio has been attacked at Tea Party rallies (his name elicits boos), on conservative radio (“a piece of garbage,” Glenn Beck called him) and in National Review (“Rubio’s Folly,” declared a recent cover).

Still, running interference on Mr. Rubio’s behalf is fraught with risk for conservative groups, who are going against many in their own base.

“We know that there’s a lot of folks on both sides,” said Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity. “But I think the vast majority of people appreciate the fact that Senator Rubio is doing what he thinks is best for the country. And that he’s doing it in an open and honest way.”

Mr. Phillips declined to discuss any implications for Mr. Rubio and 2016, but said, “We think that he’s got a bright future within the movement, and in whatever he chooses to do down the road.”

Many other big players in the conservative movement would like to keep that future bright as well.

Ralph Reed, president of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, invited Mr. Rubio to speak to several hundred of his members at a conference in Washington last month. Mr. Reed, who has made clear that he believes the Senate immigration bill that Mr. Rubio helped write is too lenient, described the crowd as right-leaning, by Republican standards. “Not the Chamber of Commerce variety,” he noted wryly in an interview.

But when he introduced Mr. Rubio, he offered nothing but effusive praise. “We’re proud to count him as our friend because he has not forgotten who got him here,” Mr. Reed told the crowd, which applauded politely. “He has not forgotten who he is.”

Weighing heavily on conservative leaders is a reminder of how immigration policy bedeviled Mitt Romney last year. His “self-deport” comments about what should happen with the 11 million immigrants living illegally in the United States became an easy punch line for Democrats and helped drive Latinos even farther away from the Republican Party."

(CNN) —

Rep. Darrell Issa must be ruing his bad luck. The hearing he carefully orchestrated to pick at the scab of Benghazi was stepped on by the verdict in the Jodi Arias murder trial and by the story of three women held captive and brutalized for a decade in Cleveland. He was out-sensationalized and out-tawdried this week despite his own best efforts and those of his committee colleagues and staff members.

That is not to say that the tragic events that unfolded last year in Benghazi are not worthy of serious investigation. They just didn’t get them from Issa’s committee. As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in her passionate testimony in December, we need to know what went wrong to prevent future tragedies. That’s why she began an investigation immediately after the attacks. But Issa and his co-inquisitors were more interested in the arithmetic of 2016 presidential politics than with the events of last September 11 in Libya.

David Rothkopf

The testimony of Gregory Hicks, the former Libya deputy chief of mission, was striking and at times moving, and offered useful additional perspectives. He said he had suffered negative repercussions because he challenged the State Department line on what happened in Benghazi. But even while some of what he said was new and resonant, the Republicans on the committee weren’t listening. They focused less on learning what could have been done differently than on trying to establish that Clinton and her closest associates had tried to cover up the tragedy.

John King: Benghazi investigation both legitimate and partisan

On this point, very little was revealed that was either material or new. Hicks said a Clinton aide had been angry at him over how he conducted himself with investigators after the incident. He disputed the way the attack and its origins were depicted by senior officials on television. He deplored the losses that took place. But to say that any of this points at a cover-up “has all the elements of Pulitzer Prize-class fiction attached to it,” as former Ambassador Thomas Pickering, co-chairman of the committee that first investigated the attacks suggested.

That Clinton’s team might want to have a clear sense of how what was clearly a politically motivated congressional investigation was being conducted seems only logical and responsible. That the origins of the attack were framed as related to an inflammatory amateur video that appeared on the Internet has long ago been established as wrong and misguided.

That the losses were terrible and that U.S. diplomatic outposts in dangerous places need more security is absolutely true, and if they really cared about such things, Issa and his team would devote more of their attention to reaching consensus on how to find the funding needed to ensure that security is available

Nothing spoken of in the hearing suggested a cover-up by a Cabinet secretary, who instantly took personal responsibility for the attacks and swiftly appointed an independent commission led by two of the most distinguished, nonpartisan career civil servants in recent American history to investigate them. To say otherwise is more than a reach. It’s an effort by the Republican Party to damage the person most likely to be the next Democratic presidential candidate.

In the calculus of Washington today, Clinton is a bigger and more valuable target even than her former boss, the president. Having said that, it is almost certainly the case that the reason the initial focus in these hearings was not on the White House or elsewhere in the executive branch was that there was no evidence of a cover-up or of a politically spinning of the post-Benghazi message there either. Indeed, even Republican Sen. Bob Corker said that having reviewed all the evidence he felt there was nothing new to be revealed by these latest hearings.

No, this is just the latest example of the fine Washington art of promoting an enduring scandal out of not very much, demonstrating the ability of microphones in congressional hearings to turn scattered inconclusive facts and emotion into innuendo and blips in opinion polls. That the process also debases and, perversely, distracts from the very serious issues associated with protecting our diplomats and our interests overseas is hardly important, it seems, to the political attack dogs whose appetites are so insatiable that any nutrition-free scrap of half-truth looks like a meal.

(CNN) - As Ted Cruz's profile has skyrocketed in the last year–thanks to his election to the U.S. Senate and an attention-grabbing itinerary to early presidential voting states–the Texas Republican's eligibility for president has come under question.

Born in Canada to a U.S. mother and a Cuban father, most legal experts have said Cruz qualifies as a ""natural-born citizen,"" a requirement for the White House job, as stated in the Constitution.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

And Cruz seems to agree. He told ABC News in July that he's not ""going to engage in a legal debate.""

""The facts are clear,"" he continued. ""I can tell you where I was born and who my parents were. And then as a legal matter, others can worry about that. I'm not going to engage.""

But he will release his birth certificate. In fact, he already has.

The Dallas Morning News ran a story late Sunday analyzing Cruz's documents, which he released to the newspaper on Friday.

Legal experts told the paper that Cruz is not only eligible for president in the United States, he's also technically a Canadian citizen and can even run for Parliament. Unless he renounces his citizenship there, he could also obtain a Canadian passport, according to the Dallas Morning News.

The senator's office, however, said Cruz has never embraced his legal rights in Canada, a country that he left when he was four.

""Senator Cruz became a U.S. citizen at birth, and he never had to go through a naturalization process after birth to become a U.S. citizen,"" spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told the newspaper. ""To our knowledge, he never had Canadian citizenship, so there is nothing to renounce.""

The recent debate has invoked the controversial ""birther"" movement that questioned President Barack Obama's eligibility for president. He put the issue to rest in 2011 when he released his long-form birth certificate proving he was born in Hawaii–though a small amount of conspiracists still maintain doubt about the president's place of birth.

Cruz will attend a GOP fundraiser in New Hampshire on Friday. Earlier this summer, he traveled to Iowa twice and stopped in South Carolina in May. All three states typically hold the first three contests in the presidential primary process.

http://news.yahoo.com/post-election-vacuum-rubio-rise-within-gop-100304866--politics.html,,[],"In post-election vacuum, Rubio on rise within GOP","WASHINGTON (AP) — Marco Rubio is taking center stage as Republicans search for a new leader.

In the nearly 100 days since President Barack Obama won a second term, the Florida senator has made calculated, concrete steps to emerge as a next-generation leader of a rudderless party, put a 21st-century stamp on the conservative movement and potentially position himself for a presidential run.

The bilingual Cuban-American lawmaker has become Republicans' point person on immigration and he pitches economic solutions for middle-class workers. He is an evangelist for a modern, inclusive party that welcomes more Hispanics and minorities, but says Republicans must stay true to their principles.

""In a way, he's trying to save us from ourselves,"" says Al Cardenas, the chairman of the American Conservative Union who gave Rubio his first job in politics, as a South Florida field staffer during Kansas Sen. Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign. ""He gives us comfort against the naysayers who say we need to change our basic beliefs to attract a wider audience.""

Rubio will give the Republican response to Obama's State of the Union address Tuesday. Rubio advisers say his rebuttal will offer economic prescriptions for a sluggish economy and try to counter what they call Obama's government-centered economic approach.

The speech comes as demand for the 41-year-old son of immigrants has soared and the party has tried to recover from significant electoral losses and map out a path ahead.

Call it the ""it"" factor. Time magazine just splashed Rubio on its cover, anointing him ""The Republican Savior."" Rubio, a Catholic, responded on Twitter: ""There is only one savior, and it is not me. (hash)Jesus"". He shrugged off the label during an interview with The Associated Press: ""I didn't write the cover. I wouldn't have said it if I wrote it.""

""There are no saviors in politics,"" he said.

The former Florida House speaker has been on a Republican rocket ship since 2010, when he knocked off Gov. Charlie Crist in a Senate race that showed the tea party's clout. He introduced presidential nominee Mitt Romney at the Republican National Convention last year and attended dozens of rallies and fundraisers for the GOP ticket during the campaign.

Story continues

His rise draws comparisons to Obama, who moved from Illinois senator-elect to Democratic presidential nominee within four years. Both win accolades for their oratory skills and sought a lower profile at the start of their Senate careers.

Like Obama did for the Democrats, Rubio evokes a new generation for Republicans, as comfortable talking about hip-hop music as health care. In a recent interview with the online news organization BuzzFeed, he discussed at length the rap music of Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G., something that would have been unimaginable coming from Romney.

Since November's pummeling, Rubio has taken a series of public and private steps to raise his already high profile and create the political, organizational and message framework he'd need should he decide to seek the White House.

On election night, Rubio promoted ""upward mobility policies"" and counseled Republicans to renew their pitch to people from minority and immigrant communities. He made a quick trip to Iowa in mid-November for GOP Gov. Terry Branstad's birthday party, which placed him before influential party activists in the important electoral state. Branstad lauded Rubio as the ""kind of inspirational leader that's going to help point us in the right direction.""

In December, Rubio said Republicans needed to attract voters from all economic backgrounds, invoking his late father, who worked as a hotel bartender. People like that are not ""looking for a handout"" but conditions to help them reach the middle class, Rubio said at the Jack Kemp Foundation dinner.

Behind the scenes, Rubio has bolstered his political action committee, Reclaim America PAC, to help him raise money, elect fellow Republicans and essentially create a campaign-in-waiting. Terry Sullivan, a trusted aide with deep ties to the early primary state of South Carolina, has moved over to work full time at the organization, and Rubio hired Dorinda Moss, a leading GOP fundraiser, to be its finance director.

Rubio, who took hard-line positions on immigration policy such as branding Sen. John McCain's proposal in 2010 a form of amnesty, has shifted gears on the issue. He spent months meeting with different groups in the debate before releasing a set of principles with fellow senators that pairs increased border security with a possible path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants.

Mindful that ""amnesty"" remains a dirty word in the GOP and that many still flinch at immigration changes approved under President Ronald Reagan, Rubio courted conservative talk-radio hosts and news outlets to head off criticism. Early on, he won positive reviews from powerful conservative media personalities.

Fox News' Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity offered praise for his approach. Conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh called Rubio's ideas ""admirable and noteworthy,"" a tag line that could turn into a handy defense in a Republican primary.

Rubio has had detractors, too.

Conservative commentator Ann Coulter said Rubio's plan would allow illegal immigrants to live and work in the U.S., essentially jumping ahead of those who have waited in their own countries to immigrate to the U.S. legally. Louisiana Sen. David Vitter, a Republican, called Rubio ""naive.""

Indeed, the focus on immigration could be a boon or a bust for Rubio. If he rallies Republicans behind a plan that offers some resolution, he could be connected to a big legislative victory. But if the plan draws the wrath of Republican activists, it could hinder his ability to seek the big prize in 2016.

""I really believe that if I do the best job I can in the Senate,"" Rubio told BuzzFeed, ""then in a couple of years I'll be in a position to make a decision about whether I want to run for re-election, leave politics and give someone else a shot or run for some other position.""

They like Homeland Security more.

They like federal bureaucrats more.

They like the IRS more. Far, far more.

A newly released Pew Research Center poll gives Congress credit for a rare miracle: uniting Democrats and Republicans. With a sense of agreement rarely seen in recent weeks, all political groups have come to the same conclusion: They dislike Congress overwhelmingly. And all sides agree that the system isn’t the problem — the actual members are.

Only 19% say they trust government to do right either always or most of the time, which matches the low last seen in August 2011, during the last congressional dispute over the debt ceiling. No coincidence there.

Yet it’s not everything in Washington that Americans dislike — despite the impression one sometimes gets of a nation rising up with pitchforks in hand. Views of governmental agencies and actions are varied and mostly positive.

Three-fourths of Americans have a favorable view of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for example, a figure almost matched by NASA and the Department of Defense. Of 13 government entities measured, nine had favorability ratings above 60%. Only one, the IRS, had a negative profile, with 51% disapproving and 44% approving of it.

Still — far better than Congress. Only 23% of Americans had a favorable view of that institution (unanimity: 23% among Republicans, 25% among Democrats and 20% among independents). Federal workers, often decried as exemplars of inefficiency and worthy of the furlough they just got, were almost three times as popular, with 62% of Americans feeling favorable toward them.

Incumbents tend to shrug away such results, since these polls take a national measurement and their elections are local or regional, at most. As has been written endlessly, most members reside in safe districts where their views are largely in sync with the populace, if not with the representative from across the aisle. And voters historically have tended to hate Congress as an institution but appreciate, at least, their own member of Congress.

But if numbers in the poll hold — and that is a big if, with even primary elections months away — at least some of those incumbents have cause to be more concerned.

According to Pew, almost 4 in 10 voters said they did not want their own representative reelected, a sobering percentage. Before the last two non-presidential elections, both “change” elections that altered the makeup of Congress, the percentage of Americans wanting to upend their member of Congress was in the 20s."

In an interview with The New York Times published Saturday, Obama was asked whether he was worried about being cast as a ""standing pat"" president, thanks to Congressional gridlock that has affected his agenda.

""But do you worry, Mr. President, that that description of that sort of standing pat, what happens if you stand pat and the sort of slower than expected -- do you worry that that could end up being your legacy simply because of the obstruction that -- and the gridlock that doesn’t seem to end?,"" the newspaper asked.

Obama appeared to argue that if the results were spurred by Congressional inaction, that would not stand as a lasting impression on the presidency.

""Well, let’s separate it from me for a second, because I think if I’m arguing for entirely different policies and Congress ends up pursuing policies that I think don’t make sense and we get a bad result, it’s hard to argue that’d be my legacy,"" Obama replied. ""And so I’ll worry about my legacy later or I’ll let historians worry about my legacy.""

According to HuffPost Pollster's compilation of data, Obama's second-term numbers have dipped in terms approval rating. Right after securing reelection in November 2012, Obama job approval stood at 50.2 percent. As of July 25, 2013, that number had dipped to 44.8 percent.

In the two decades since that long-shot campaign, the petite, no-nonsense lawmaker has quietly ascended to the top levels of Senate power.

As chairwoman of the Budget Committee, Murray negotiated a breakthrough $85-billion accord in one-on-one talks with Rep. Paul D. Ryan, the former GOP vice presidential contender from Wisconsin who is known for his austere approach to the federal budget.

FOR THE RECORD:

Patty Murray: In the Dec. 15 Section A, an article profiling Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and her leading role in negotiating a budget accord in Congress said that she had previously led the Senate’s Democratic majority to approve the chamber’s first budget without dissenting votes in four years. Four Democrats voted no. —



The deal she and Ryan sealed with a private handshake — after President Obama, Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and others all failed — adds a significant achievement to what has become a formidable political career. The House resoundingly approved it Thursday, and the Senate is expected to pass it in the coming week, greatly reducing the risk of a federal government shutdown next year.

Her role also provides a reminder of the growing clout of women in the Senate, who numbered three when she first ran for office. There are now 20. Murray is the first woman to head the Senate Budget Committee, and almost half of the chamber’s committee chairmen are, in fact, now women.

“She is now 9 feet tall, not 5 feet tall,” said Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), who is inclined to support the package. “She never lost her cool through all of it — pretty amazing.”

Murray’s success in crafting the budget deal was not without early stumbles.

She was tapped by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) two years ago to head a “supercommittee” of senators and representatives to forge a budget accord, but her team was unable to do so. Republicans refused to raise taxes; Democrats resisted cuts to safety net programs.

Drawing on those lessons, Murray, a determined politician, pushed on. She earned the trust of skeptical Democrats who were wary of dealing with the new class of tea party Republicans. Her history of taking jobs no one wanted helped. She headed her party’s Senate campaign committee in 2012, when Reid couldn’t find anyone else to do the work, and Democrats bolstered their majority against long odds.

This year, Murray corralled the Senate’s Democratic majority to approve the chamber’s first budget in four years without dissenting votes, setting the stage for her deal with Ryan.

Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), the dean among the Senate’s women, has watched what she called Murray’s “unique negotiating style” of sticking to her goals but building consensus among her peers.

“She carried the football from one first down after another to get it across the goal,” Mikulski said.

Murray and Ryan met for breakfast with other budget committee lawmakers in the Capitol the morning after the government reopened in October following the 16-day shutdown.

Over pastries and coffee, the two agreed not to seek the kind of far-reaching deal that had eluded Obama and Boehner. Instead, they would focus on reversing some automatic cuts under the so-called sequester. GOP defense hawks wanted to preserve Pentagon spending and Democratic champions of social programs sought to protect them.

For seven weeks, Murray and Ryan tangled, almost always amicably. They made an early bond, largely by building trust. In initial meetings they agreed not to publicly air what they were negotiating behind closed doors, as often happens in politics, where information has a currency of its own and can undermine deal-making.

They also put their most partisan views aside and focused on reaching a pragmatic solution.

Late last Tuesday, Ryan and Murray met one final time in her private office off the Capitol Rotunda. There, they shook hands and sealed the deal. Moments later, the two stood side by side to announce the accord.

“He and I do have some major differences,” Murray said. “We cheer for a different football team, clearly. We catch different fish. We have some differences on policies. But we agree that our country needs some certainty.”

Ryan, towering over Murray, said, “She’s a tough and honest negotiator.”

Reid said later that they were an “unconventional pair.”

“I have such faith in her integrity, her temperament, her wisdom and her ability to get things done,” he said.

Murray never appears too far removed from that mom who bundled her kids in the car and drove to Washington’s statehouse two decades ago to protest a reduction in funds that would close their preschool.

“I thought if I just explained to them how important this was — and told them about all the kids it helped — they would certainly change their minds,” she recalled in a speech years ago.

“But when I got there, the legislators told me there was nothing someone like me could do to save our preschool program — that I was just a mom in tennis shoes. Well, I heard what they had to say, but I didn’t listen.”

In Seattle, political observers are not surprised by her accomplishment.

“In the old show-horse-and-workhorse model, she’s been a workhorse,” said Stuart Elway, a pollster in Seattle, who said that even after Murray won that first election, “a lot of people were underestimating her: ‘This isn’t going to last.’ Here we are and she’s one of the leaders in the Senate.”

Some Democrats see Murray as a possible heir to the majority leader spot after Reid retires. But that’s the kind of conversation she shuns. A lawmaker who wears sensible suits and shoes and favors a low-maintenance pageboy haircut, she isn’t prone to such airy chatter.

After the House approved the deal late Thursday, Murray was on a plane back to her home state — the 2,300-plus-mile trip she makes most weekends.

USA TODAY

Both candidates say current Virginia governor should consider calls to resign

Democrat McAuliffe says Republican has radical agena

Republican Cuccinelli calls Democrat an influence peddler

HOT SPRINGS, Va. — Both Republican gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli and Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe said the Virginia officeholder they are battling to succeed, Gov. Bob McDonnell, should consider calls to resign in the wake of federal and state investigations into his ethics.

But both tread carefully on the scandal that has shadowed their contest, declining to say that they personally believed he should resign. Cuccinelli said it wouldn't be appropriate for him as the state's sitting attorney general to make such a call, and McAuliffe said McDonnell ""shouldn't be tried in the newspapers.""

""He should consider it, but he knows the facts,"" McAuliffe said, adding, ""Let's not prejudge.""

Cuccinelli said: ""It is appropriate to ask him to think about it.""

At their first debate, the two men were wearing gray suits, starched white shirts and subdued ties, but they might as well have pulled on boxing gloves for a combative 90-minute encounter that signals the TV ads they will run and the attacks they are likely to make for the next three months of the campaign.

McAuliffe hammered Cuccinelli as a rigid right-wing ideologue with a radical agenda on social issues including abortion and homosexuality. Cuccinelli portrayed McAuliffe as an unprincipled influence peddler with no experience in state government.

The debate, held at the Omni Homestead resort in southwest Virginia, was moderated by Judy Woodruff of PBS' NewsHour and hosted by the Virginia Bar Association.

Nearly an hour had passed before McAuliffe raised the name of Jonnie Williams, businessman at the heart of the McDonnell scandal. Williams, the CEO of a nutritional supplement company called Star Scientific, gave $145,000 in gifts to McDonnell, his wife and sister. He also gave $18,000 in gifts to Cuccinelli.

""Instead of taking him to court, he was taking you to New York City,"" McAuliffe said to scattered laughter. ""He was buying you $1,500 turkey dinners. You know, that's a lot of turkey.""

Cuccinelli blasted McAuliffe for choosing to locate a manufacturing plant for his company, GreenTech Automotive, in Mississippi rather than Virginia. ""So you picked Mississippi. So run for governor of Mississippi,"" he said, adding, ""Terry isn't about principles or good policy. He's about deals, influence-peddling deals.""

Cuccinelli, who has gotten headlines as attorney general for his fervent opposition to abortion, said he wouldn't make that issue a priority as governor. ""I do not expect to use the political capital of the governor's office to be moving those pieces of legislation,"" he said.

When asked directly whether he continued to believe, as he once said, that homosexuality was ""against nature"" and ""harmful to society,"" Cuccinelli said, ""My personal beliefs about the personal challenge of homosexuality haven't changed."""

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/03/27/SarahPAC-Video-Rallies-Independents-and-Tea-Partiers-For-2014-Elections,2013-03-27 00:00:00,['Tony Lee'],Palin Reloads for 2014 Elections with SarahPAC Video,"In a sign of how active Sarah Palin intends to be in influencing the 2014 elections, SarahPAC, Sarah Palin’s Political Action Committee, released a video on Wednesday meant to ignite independents, conservatives, and Tea Partiers for the 2014 midterm elections. These voters propelled Republican candidates in the historic 2010 midterm elections that saw Republicans take back the House of Representatives on the backs of Tea Party voters.

Titled “Loaded for Bear,” the video shows footage and headlines from mainstream media outlets like Politico referring to Palin as a “kingmaker” and conservative outlets like Fox News acknowledging how successfully Palin has used her star-power to help elect conservative candidates to office.

The video also features Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) praising Palin for her fearlessness and being instrumental in electing senators such as Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Pat Toomey, Jeff Flake, Deb Fischer, Cruz and governors like Nikki Haley of South Carolina.

In 2012, former South Carolina Senator and current president of the Heritage Foundation Jim DeMint said Palin’s endorsement “has more influence in primaries than any other endorsement right now.”

“Sarah Palin picks winners,” Cruz says in the video.

And by all measures, that dynamic will not change in the next two years for Palin is often a one-woman clearinghouse for conservative and Tea Party candidates.

The video, which the group PassCodeCreative made, features Palin at Tea Party rallies in places like Nevada and at the Iowa State Fair in 2011, where she impressed Iowans, liberals and the mainstream media by answering nearly every question asked of her and engaging comfortably with nearly everyone who approached her for nearly six hours.

In the video, footage of Palin’s 2013 CPAC speech is shown where Palin says, “Don’t let the the big consultants, the big money men and the big bad media scare you off” from running for office.

She urges Republicans to focus more on “rebuilding the middle class” than rebranding the party and says “it is time to furlough the consultants.”

Palin also speaks about her signature issue of dismantling the permanent political class and fighting crony capitalism. She urges Republicans look for candidates from Main Street communities, PTA meetings, small businesses and Tea Party rallies.

“SarahPAC supporters – the 2014 elections are just twenty months away. We appreciate your support, together we have elected many great commonsense conservatives over the past four years,” SarahPAC Treasurer Tim Crawford says in a statement posted with the video. “Together, we will keep fighting to support these bold candidates.”

Reporters in the video note only “Sarah Palin will hold Congress to account,” that Palin “plays by her own rules,” and Palin “doesn’t care about old dogs” in the GOP. These are the qualities that make Tea Partiers, conservatives, and independents trust Palin.

The video notes that there are 35 Senate and 36 Governors races in 2014 and ends with a clip of Ted Cruz saying at CPAC, “I would not be in the U.S. Senate today if it were not for Gov. Sarah Palin.”

The words “We Haven’t Yet Begun to Fight” splash across the screen as SarahPAC’s signature bear roars at the end of the video."

THE Supreme Court’s momentous decisions last week on affirmative action, voting rights and same-sex marriage overshadowed a disturbing trend: in the final two weeks of its term, the court ruled in favor of big business and closed the courthouse doors to employees, consumers and small businesses seeking remedy for serious injuries. A majority of the justices seem to believe that it is too easy to sue corporations, so they narrowly construed federal laws to limit such suits. These decisions lack the emotional resonance of the cases involving race and sexuality, but they could have a devastating effect on people who have been wronged by companies.

Long-term unemployment and long-term unemployment benefits both hit record lengths during this Lesser Depression. The average length of unemployment hit a postwar high of 40 weeks, and unemployment insurance did too, getting extended to 99 weeks (though it's fallen significantly the past two years). But there's no evidence that long-term unemployment benefits have discouraged the long-term unemployed from taking jobs -- because they can't get jobs to begin with. They can't even get interviews. As Ghayad showed before in a field experiment, employers largely ignore the resumes of people who have been out of work for six months or longer. Firms assume there must be something wrong with people who have unemployed that long, and don't want to spend time finding out what it is, not when they have a stack full of resumes to get through. But the long-term unemployed have kept looking, at least in part because of benefits.

The Senate is currently considering five nominees for the National Labor Relations Board. All five are experienced, highly qualified candidates, and last month the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee approved their nominations. But Senate Republicans are refusing to allow a floor vote on the nominees. By blocking the confirmation of new board members, Republicans have rendered the NLRB dysfunctional. It now lacks the quorum necessary to issue decisions.

This is an unprecedented attack on the NLRB, which has long been an area of bipartisan agreement. As Senate Republicans block these nominees, it is worth considering the history of the NLRB and the crucial role in our country it has played over the past three-quarters of a century.

Climate change is surely the looming disaster of our time. Scientists say it’s inevitable that sea levels will rise 2 1/2-6 1/2 feet — sufficient to endanger or wipe out many cities. One scientist believes that in the long-term, 69 feet of sea level rise is inescapable. And the source of the swelling oceans — rising temperatures — will stress the nation’s food system, while the increasing number of devastating storms will place an economic burden on a nation reeling from disaster to disaster, patching its wounds without effecting meaningful change. It’s tempting to dismiss these projections as hysterical. That life as we know it could change so dramatically, so quickly, seems impossible. But on this topic, the scientific community (if not the political one) speaks with one voice.

What does it look like when seven men ignore seventeen thousand of their constituents?

It looks like this: Ohio’s Republican Governor John Kasich, flanked by six other men, signing the state’s new budget into law and, by doing so, catapulting the Buckeye State to the number one spot on the Nation’s Most Restrictive Abortion Laws list.

The budget strips funding from Planned Parenthood, the nation’s leading provider of reproductive healthcare, and gives that money to Crisis Pregnancy Centers, the pseudo-clinics that lure pregnant women with the promise of free ultrasounds and can then misinform them about abortions. That’s just the beginning.

A Kaiser poll found that just one in five Americans are aware of the health insurance exchanges. And, in a larger sense, the new system falls apart if too few healthy Americans (like, young, football-watching men, for instance) are brought in to offset the increased cost of covering all of those who have pre-existing conditions. And that, in fact, seems to be the point of what the GOP is doing. The more dysfunctional the health care law is, the more Republicans can claim to have been right about it all along. It's the same strategy that is at work in GOP efforts to underfund the financial reform law or a host of federal agencies: render government ineffective by not giving it adequate resources to do its job, then argue for more cuts on the grounds that government is ineffective.

Last month, I pleaded for an end to the breathless comparisons between Edward Snowden and Daniel Ellsberg. News that the present-day intelligence leaker has asked the Russians for asylum should put it to rest. Sure, Snowden made the same request of other nations. But flirting with Moscow is a credibility killer. I’m all for whistleblowers revealing what government is doing, especially if it stretches the bounds of legality or if it’s flat-out illegal. What we know of what Snowden has released of interest to the American public has been known for a while. But what has stuck in my craw from the outset was Snowden fleeing the country.

But we can’t hear ourselves think here this summer over the roar of the Clinton machine — and the buzzing back to life of old Clinton enemies. Meanwhile, Obama’s vaunted campaign machine, which has morphed into a political group called Organizing for Action, has sputtered in its attempt to tear down Republican obstacles and push through his agenda.

While President Obama seems drained and disgusted at the idea of punching through the Republican blockade that awaits him on his return from Martha’s Vineyard, he told Jay Leno that Hillary “had that post-administration glow” when they met for lunch recently.

As the president was getting ready for his news conference, his former secretary of state was dominating the news with an event she didn’t even attend. Emily’s List held what was, in essence, Hillary’s first Iowa campaign event, titled “Madam President” and featuring Claire McCaskill, the Missouri senator who famously broke away from Clinton Inc. to join the Obama revolution in 2008. Now McCaskill, who once said she wouldn’t trust Bill Clinton near her daughter, is presciently back in the fold, on board with Ready for Hillary, the super PAC supporting Clinton for 2016.

As ABC News’s Michael Falcone reported from Iowa, the state that allowed Obama to vault over Hillary, McCaskill said she’s dreaming of “that moment in 2017 when we can say ‘Madam President’ to Hillary Rodham Clinton.’ ”

In a funny echo of Hillary’s defense of Bill during the Gennifer Flowers scandal, when she said she wasn’t home baking cookies and having teas, McCaskill told the forum it’s hard for women to run for office because it’s “not sitting down to tea and crumpets.”"

But over the past couple of days, as the prospect of a government shutdown looms closer, the media have completely abandoned those principles.

In the name of civility, I’m old enough to remember (because it was just last week) when the media made politicians pay a heavy political price for harsh rhetoric and name-calling. Again and again, we have seen the media turn away from the issue at hand and make the “rhetoric” used to push the issue the issue.

For example, when running for president last year, Newt Gingrich wanted to talk about the explosion of food stamp recipients under President Obama. But the media just wanted to talk about whether he was racist for using the words “food stamps.”

Think about how many times some local Republican politician, or some conservative private citizen, at a town hall meeting, has made national headlines because of what the media described as “extremist political rhetoric.” Good heavens, how many times has some straggler’s Tea Party sign made NBC’s Chuck Todd tut-tut with disgust.

Think about how many times the media have used how a conservative made a political point as a way to gang up on and relentlessly pummel him or her — all while ignoring the issue.

Remember that whole fashion season of the media collectively wringing its hands over “eliminationist rhetoric?” Remember how the following fashion season was devoted to the scourge of “bullying.”

But that was then; this is now — and now the media have officially ended their opposition to over-the-top political rhetoric. We don’t know this because the media sent out a memo or made an official announcement; we know this because President Obama and Democrats have been accusing Republicans of being arsonists, anarchists, terrorists, extremists — and this is all Chuck Todd has to say about it…

—

“Hobby horse” “shenanigans” “extremists” and “burn the house down”. How POTUS described Congress today. GOP getting a taste of bully pulpit — Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) September 27, 2013

—

And the rest of the media have been just as shoulder-shrugging and silent in the face of all this harsh, partisan, eliminationist rhetoric.

But that is not the only change in media policy that happened this past week. The media are also no longer concerned with making Washington work or the value of bipartisanship and working across the aisle. President Obama, Harry Reid, and Nancy Pelosi have made it absolutely clear that they will not negotiate in budget battles that could result in a government shutdown, and the media are absolutely okay with this.

In the past, when Republicans dug in their heels or didn’t seem willing to compromise enough to satisfy Obama, the media were outraged over DC dysfunction and the lack of bipartisan compromise.

So it is finally over — the era of the media placing the highest value on bipartisan compromise and civility has finally ended. The media are now for harsh rhetoric, gridlock, and extremism. Or…

…maybe the media are just a bunch of hypocritical, lying, left-wing hacks who despise the GOP and are willing to sell their honor in order to help Obama to a political win?

Either way.

At least temporarily, the move effectively left the most significant aspect of Greuel’s communication with voters -- TV advertising -- to an independent effort largely funded by a union that represents many workers at the Department of Water and Power, just as Garcetti is making that union’s support for her candidacy his main argument against her.

Garcetti renewed that line of attack on Tuesday during an education debate, prompting Greuel to reply, “There he goes again,” a play on a retort made famous by Ronald Reagan during his 1980 debate with Jimmy Carter.

Democrats need to gain 17 House seats to win control%2C a high bar for a president%27s 2nd midterm

One big Democratic target%2C Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann%2C locked in a close race

Republican hurdles and natural growing pains could make %22Obamacare%22 an issue for Democrats

WASHINGTON — Could Democrats regain the House of Representatives in 2014?

History says no, but New York Rep. Steve Israel, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, says the combination of an improving economy and a Republican Party focused on investigating President Obama just might make it possible.

""It's going to be hard, no question about it,"" Israel said in an interview in his Capitol Hill office on ""Capital Download,"" USA TODAY's weekly newsmaker video series. But ""this country has an unquenchable thirst for less ideology and more solutions. ... As long as our candidates are running as problem-solvers and solution-ists and a strategy of solutions, I think we have a good chance of winning the House.""

Over the past century, the party that has held the White House for two terms has lost House seats, sometimes dozens of them, in every midterm election except one. However, the exception was in 1998, during Bill Clinton's second term — and that anomaly is fueling Democratic hopes of defying the political norm again next year.

""It was very similar to the climate that we have now,"" Israel said. ""The president gets elected, re-elected, in 1996. The Republicans in the House of Representatives make a decision to do everything they can to bring him down. ... They launched 35 separate, partisan, witch-hunt investigations — and the Democrats won seats in the second midterm election of the Clinton presidency; won five seats.""

Democrats need to pick up 17 House seats to regain the control they lost to Republicans in 2010. Israel says there are 52 House seats ""in play."" The non-partisan Cook Political Report now identifies 37 Democratic-held seats and 30 Republican-held seats as competitive or potentially competitive.

One big target for Democrats: Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, who for a time sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 but only narrowly held on to her House seat in November. She faces a rematch against businessman Jim Graves. Israel said a campaign poll taken last week by the firm PPP for the Graves campaign put him ahead of Bachmann, 47%-45% — within the margin of error of 4.4 percentage points but a sign of a close contest.

The biggest boost for Democrats would be an improving economy, Israel said. ""If the economy shows signs of health, then I think we have a much better climate in which to win the House.""

And he acknowledged concerns about the political impact of the Affordable Care Act as major provisions to cover the uninsured go into effect in January. Most states have declined to set up the exchanges where the uninsured will shop for coverage — defaulting instead to a federal marketplace — and close to half have raised questions about whether they will participate in the expansion of Medicaid to cover low-income Americans.

""There's no question in my mind that many Republicans have made the calculation that they want the programs to fail in order say 'I told you so,' even though they're responsible for the failure,"" Israel said. ""Where there are problems, whether they are inflicted by Republicans or they're created by the natural growing pains of any new endeavor, we need to make sure those problems are solved, that people understand the benefits of this act."""

Now they pay the price.

Republicans gave us the Cheneys. Now they pay the price.

Rep. Cynthia Lummis, a two-term Republican lawmaker, called Cheney “the shiny new pony” in Wyoming politics, but slammed Cheney for a lack of etiquette in making her intentions known to her opponent, Sen. Mike Enzi. “I don’t think she’s going about it the right way,” Lummis, R-Wyo., told a scrum of reporters in the Speaker’s Lobby during votes on Tuesday night. [...] “There’s a great history of intraparty decorum in Wyoming, especially when it comes to these higher-profile offices, and certainly that decorum has been broken here,” she added. “I think it’s problematic. I think it’s bad form.”

This sort of stuff is what makes Liz Cheney's decision to move from Virginia to Wyoming in order to run for U.S. Senate against Mike Enzi so much fun:Of course Lummis is also annoyed because until Cheney entered the scene, she was the heir apparent to Enzi. In fact, if Enzi does bow out (which is still possible), she'll run in his place.

Like Lummis, Enzi himself (not surprisingly) is also whining about Cheney's entrance:



“She said that if I ran she wasn’t going to run, but obviously that wasn’t correct,” Enzi said, speaking to reporters as he left the Senate floor. “I thought we were friends. [...] It’s kind of interesting that about 30 minutes after I put out a release saying that I intend to run, she put out one saying she was running,” Enzi told reporters. “She’s watching pretty closely what I’m doing. This is different than what she was saying before — that if I didn’t run, she would run.”

Enzi sounds like he's offended by Cheney's decision to run, but he shouldn't be taking this personally. There are two reasons why she's running, and neither of them have anything to do with him.

First, Liz Cheney thinks she's entitled to whatever she wants because she's Dick Cheney's daughter.

Second, Wyoming has about ten thousand times as many tumbleweeds as it does actual people, so Cheney doesn't think victory will be hard.

In Wyoming, winning the Republican primary is pretty much a guarantee that you'll win the general—and it doesn't take much to win the primary. In 2010, which was the highest turnout Republican primary in recent years, just 110,000 people turned out to vote. In other words, Cheney realizes that even if 2014 is also a high-turnout primary, she only needs to win about 55,000 votes to become a U.S. Senator.

So while Liz Cheney running isn't good news for Mike Enzi and isn't good news for Republicans who want to avoid intraparty fights, it wouldn't take much for her to win. And that's good news for Liz Cheney—and for those of us who are easily amused by the sight of Republicans eating their own."

USATODAY

Obama revels in his role as head of state%2C but it increasingly seems the only aspect of his job he relishes.

Rather than negotiating key aspects of his health care law%2C he outsourced that task to Nancy Pelosi.

Obama needs someone else to coordinate practical responses to mounting challenges.

During the early stages of the Obama administration, some of the president's harshest critics denounced him as a power-hungry autocrat: ""King Barack I."" Today, America's commander in chief resembles a very different sort of royalty: the elegant but irrelevant figurehead typical of modern constitutional monarchies.

Queen Elizabeth II enjoys considerable popularity as a symbol of the nation, but she exercises scant power over the direction of public affairs. She is merely head of state; it is Prime Minister David Cameron who runs the country as head of government. Many other nations, even those without traditional royal households, similarly divide the nation's two most significant roles between an above-the-fray head of state and an in-the-thick-of-things head of government. From Germany to Israel to Canada, a non-political eminence presides over patriotic occasions and draws bipartisan affection while tough political brawlers run the government.

Two leaders in one

In the United States, our Constitution fully merges the two functions. The most successful presidents, beginning with George Washington himself, excelled at both roles. Franklin Roosevelt completed three terms as an inspiring head of state with resonant voice and noble profile, while simultaneously dominating the scene as a wily party leader and head of government. FDR's protégé Lyndon Johnson certainly lived up to his hero's standards as a hands-on political operator, but as head of state LBJ struck many Americans as crass, a failing that helped doom his chances for another term in 1968.

In many ways, Barack Obama represents Johnson's polar opposite — cool rather than corny, glamorous rather than gauche, aloof rather than earthy. It's impossible to imagine Obama startling reporters as Johnson once did by lifting his shirt after surgery to expose the scar on his belly. But Obama is also unlikely to employ the famous ""Johnson treatment"" to force recalcitrant congressmen into line. LBJ reveled in twisting arms and cutting deals; Obama so much loathes that process, he seems to regard get-togethers with Capitol Hill leadership as onerous chores.

The current incumbent revels in his role as head of state, but it increasingly seems the only aspect of his job he relishes. Obama escapes Washington at every opportunity for worshipful crowds in campaign-style events and shines at big ceremonial occasions, but then mumbles and bumbles his way through news conferences with ill-disguised contempt for reporters' questions. His Tuesday speech in Tennessee on jobs is a perfect example of putting the grand gesture over the gritty details.

Big speeches over details

Rather than immersing himself in the grubby business of negotiating key aspects of his health care law, he outsourced that task to House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. On controversies regarding Benghazi, the IRS and Justice Department snooping, administration responses suggest that the disengaged president had no role in detailed implementation of his own policies.

Such reactions suggest the response of a reigning monarch far more than an embattled prime minister. When Cabinet ministers run into trouble in London, no one thinks to blame Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, even though those ministers may govern in her name. Applying the same logic to this president, why fault his Serene Highness, King Barack, when senior administration officials look inept and dishonest?

In the months remaining to his reign, the chief executive might rescue his presidency by continuing to emphasize the aspects of his job he performs well and foisting on someone else governmental responsibilities for which he has shown neither appetite nor aptitude.

The president, in other words, needs a prime minister.

In 1861, Secretary of State William Henry Seward offered to play that role for his less experienced boss, Abraham Lincoln, but Honest Abe quickly displayed his peerless ability to manage governmental details on his own.

Obama possesses no comparable skills and therefore needs someone else to coordinate practical responses to mounting challenges. During his first term, he employed chiefs of staff (Rahm Emanuel and Bill Daley) with Washington clout. His new top aide, Denis McDonough, counts as a lightweight who has had little impact.

As Obama jets around the country, disassociating himself from the hot mess of legislative logjam and administrative apocalypse, a powerful, well-publicized replacement as chief of staff might generate the needed ""energy in the executive"" to dissipate the atmosphere of drift and decay.

Republican Ken Cuccinelli has garnered 45.5%. The Wenzel Strategies poll has proven an accurate measure of the final days of the campaign, with Cuccinelli losing by a much smaller margin than other polling firms predicted. RealClearPolitics’s average of various polls predicted a McAuliffe win by +6.7. The Washington Post’s final poll predicted a +12 McAuliffe win.

A new poll, provided exclusively to Breitbart News, finds the Virginia Governor’s race a virtual dead-heat, with Democrat Terry McAuliffe leading Republican Ken Cuccinelli 41%-40%. Libertarian Robert Sarvis garners 10% and 9% of likely voters who remain undecided. With less than two weeks to go, the race is a toss-up that will likely be decided by turnout, a critical factor in an off-year election.

The poll comes from Wenzel Strategies, which accurately predicted closing momentum for Sens. Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Deb Fischer, among others. The slight edge McAuliffe holds is due mostly to stronger support within his partisan base. 81% of Democrats support McAuliffe, against just 68% of Republicans who support Cuccinelli.

Cuccinelli’s support seems be building, however, as public attention moves away from the recent government shutdown to the failing implementation of ObamaCare. Cuccinelli was a leading national figure suing to overturn the health care law.

The closeness of the race is apparent in the millions spent by left-wing groups to support McAuliffe in the closing days. In addition, Hillary and Bill Clinton, close allies of McAuliffe, have made themselves permanent fixtures in the Commonwealth, campaigning on his behalf.

“There’s a reason the Clintons have been called in to spend a week campaigning for McAuliffe and that Bloomberg is pouring in millions with 2 weeks to go,” Brian Baker, President of Ending Spending Action Fund, which commissioned the poll, told Breitbart News. “Their internals must be showing what our poll indicates — that his unfavorables are high and they must try to suppress Cuccinelli turnout to prevail. All indications are that the numbers are closing, especially post shutdown. The focus will be where the undecideds go and what will Sarvis draw? With the race this close, the poll indicates a vote for Sarvis is a vote for McAuliffe.”

History also is on Cuccinelli’s side. Since the 1980s, the winner of the Virginia Governor’s race has always been from the opposite party of that occupying the White House."

• HI-Sen, HI-01: The Hawaii State Teachers Association has endorsed Democratic Rep. Colleen Hanabusa in her bid for Senate. The HSTA, as well as the National Education Association, is also giving its support to state Rep. Mark Takai in the wide-open Democratic primary to replace Hanabusa in the 1st District.

• LA-Sen: State Rep. Paul Hollis, who first said he was considering a bid for Senate in October, has filed paperwork with the FEC. He's the third Republican to enter the race against Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu, along with Rep. Bill Cassidy and Air Force vet Rob Maness.

• MT-Sen: Montana's largest union, the 18,000-strong MEA-MFT, has endorsed Lt. Gov. John Walsh for Senate. MEA-MFT represents teachers and other state employees. Walsh faces ex-Lt. Gov. John Bohlinger in the Democratic primary.

• SD-Sen: As expected, former Republican Sen. Larry Pressler has launched his comeback bid as an independent.

Gubernatorial:

• HI-Gov: Barack Obama has endorsed Gov. Neil Abercrombie, who is seeking re-election but faces a challenge in the Democratic primary from state Sen. David Ige.

House:

• GA-01, -10, -11: Emily Cahn offers a helpful rundown on the GOP primary fields for Georgia's three open House seats.

• MN-08, NH-02: Americans for Prosperity is spending $600,000 to air ads attacking two Democrats over Obamacare, Rep. Rick Nolan of Minnesota and Rep. Annie Kuster of New Hampshire.

• NC-07: State Sen. David Rouzer was a natural to seek a rematch against Rep. Mike McIntyre after he lost the closest House race in the country in 2012, but he may have company in the GOP primary. New Hanover County Commissioner Woody White says he's considering a bid and expects to decide by the end of January.

• NE-02: It's very thin, but Joe Jordan at the Nebraska Watchdog says that unnamed sources have told him that attorney David Domina, who had been looking at Nebraska's open Senate seat, is considering a run against GOP Rep. Lee Terry in the state's 2nd Congressional District instead. This would actually be a winnable race for Domina, and he'd also really help Democrats, who lost their only candidate when Omaha City Councilman Pete Festersen dropped out earlier this month. Domina, however, missed a self-imposed mid-November deadline to decide on a Senate bid.

• VA-10: Former Democratic Rep. Artur Davis of Alabama has declined a comeback bid under the Republican banner for the open seat of retiring GOP Rep. Frank Wolf. Meanwhile, another dweebus—reality TV clown Tareq Salahi—says he will seek the GOP nomination in Virginia's 10th. (James L & David Nir)

• TX-04: GOP Rep. Ralph Hall, at age 90 the oldest member of the House in U.S. history, says that next year's campaign will be his last.

• House: On behalf of Americans United for Change, PPP has new polls of five House districts, mostly focused on extending unemployment insurance protection. (It's broadly supported.) There are no horserace numbers, but we do have job approvals for four potentially vulnerable Republicans: Gary Miller (CA-31), Mike Coffman (CO-06), Rodney Davis (IL-13), and Dan Benishek (MI-01). (John Boehner's district was also surveyed.) Everyone is under water, but nothing dramatic.

Other Races:

• VA State Senate: GOP Gov. Bob McDonnell has scheduled the special election for Attorney General-elect Mark Herring's 33rd District state Senate seat for Jan. 21. So even if Democrats hold Lt. Gov.-elect Ralph Northam's Senate seat on Jan. 7, Republicans would still control the chamber 20-19 until the second special could be held.

Grab Bag:

• Census: Unsurprisingly, Florida is about to overtake New York to become the third most-populous state in the nation, perhaps when the Census Bureau releases new population estimates on Monday. New York, however, still has a huge edge in GDP, and ranks seventh among all states in GDP per capita. Florida is 39th.

Meanwhile, BuzzFeed has some animated GIFs showing changes in the U.S. since 1990 on the county level, based on Census data, across several different demographic categories.

• Maps: New York Times graphics editor Joshua Katz has taken his data collection on dialects to the next level, with a new quiz that tries to pinpoint where you're from, linguistically speaking, depending on your answers to a battery of questions about vocabulary and pronunciation. It had me utterly nailed as a New Yorker, but come on, people. Are you really playing tennis in those shoes? You are obviously using them for sneaking, duh!

• Money: Kent Cooper lists how much cash the 17 members of Congress who are retiring at the end of next year still have in their campaign accounts. All told, it's $13 million, with Montana Sen. Max Baucus leading the way with $3.3 million.

• SCF: One lesser-known way PACs can support candidates is by acting as pass-through entities, which means they can solicit contributions from donors who earmark them for specific campaigns. As Kent Cooper explains, the gifts count only against the contribution limits of the original donors, who get credit for making the donation; the PAC, meanwhile, gets credit for collecting the money and passing it along. (I believe this is how ActBlue operates, legally speaking.)

Cooper discusses all this in the context of the Senate Conservatives Fund, which has forwarded nearly $500,000 to four different outsider Senate candidates this year. The largest recipient has been Kentucky businessman Matt Bevin, with $304,000. Also receiving funds are Rob Maness (Louisiana), Chris McDaniel (Mississippi), and Ben Sasse (Nebraska)."

Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, followed up the confirmation hearing with a list of questions for the nominee. (The complete questionnaire is posted below.)

In his answers to Grassley’s question about profiling for terrorism among foreign nationals, Medine wrote, “In general, profiling of foreign nationals based solely on their point of departure to the United States is inappropriate.”

The Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on February 28 of this year, approving the nomination of Medine. A vote will be held in the Senate next week. The other four nominees to the board have already been confirmed. They were asked to respond to the same questionnaire.

The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) was created in 2004 after the 9/11 Commission recommended the creation of a board to safeguard civil liberties and oversee the new authorities granted to the security agencies. The PCLOB was slow to develop, holding its first meeting in 2006. The original chair of the board, Lanny Davis, resigned citing disagreements with the White House. In 2007, legislation updated the board’s statute and established the board as an independent agency within the executive branch. Subsequent nominees were stalled for months, until 2010 when Obama nominated two members and then three additional members in 2011.

Medine’s opinion that constitutional protections against racial profiling should be extended to foreign nationals should raise serious red flags. “There may be intelligence regarding a plot being developed or partially implemented in a particular foreign country that could, under some circumstances, justify heightened scrutiny of visitors from that country linked to other information about the plot” answered Medine.

It is important to point out, that eight out of ten fugitives on the FBI’s most wanted terrorists list are foreign-born.

Medine did not answer questions about his views on Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the PATRIOT Act. He is currently an attorney fellow at the SEC and prior that, he worked at the law firm Wilmer Hale.

http://news.yahoo.com/presidential-term-limits--necessary-and-right--or-bad-for-democracy-192726518.html,,[],"Presidential term limits: necessary and right, or bad for democracy?","The time has come to end presidential term limits, because continuing the restrictions on how long one can serve in the country's highest office is bad for the United States, a university professor argued this week.



In an opinion piece published in the Washington Post, Jonathan Zimmerman, a history and education professor at New York University, says deciding whether a president deserves a third, fourth or more terms should be left to the American people, not the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution, which placed a two-term limit on the position. As background, here's an excerpt from the amendment, ratified in 1951:

""No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.""

The amendment came into being a few years after Franklin Roosevelt was elected to the fourth of his White House terms. Known to Americans as the president during the final years of the Great Depression and most of World War II, Roosevelt, a Democrat, died in office before completing his last term. After the war, Republicans made a successful bid to install a two-term maximum for future presidents. But, according to Zimmerman, they limited not only the president's time in office, but also ""democracy itself.""

With President Obama's job-approval numbers down sharply, Zimmerman indicates that the nation's chief executive is perhaps being hampered by the fact that he's in his final term, giving GOP opponents and even Democrats little incentive to support him on issues that might hurt their own re-election chances.

To illustrate his point, he uses two topics in the headlines: the implemention of the new health care law and the nuclear agreement with Iran.

He writes:

""Many of Obama’s fellow Democrats have distanced themselves from the reform and from the president. Even former president Bill Clinton has said that Americans should be allowed to keep the health insurance they have. Or consider the reaction to the Iran nuclear deal. Regardless of his political approval ratings, Obama could expect Republican senators such as Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and John McCain (Ariz.) to attack the agreement. But if Obama could run again, would he be facing such fervent objections from Sens. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.)? Probably not. Democratic lawmakers would worry about provoking the wrath of a president who could be reelected. Thanks to term limits, though, they’ve got little to fear.""

Zimmerman adds, ""Nor does Obama have to fear the voters, which might be the scariest problem of all. If he chooses, he could simply ignore their will. And if the people wanted him to serve another term, why shouldn’t they be allowed to award him one?""



On this last point, he invokes George Washington, the first president of the United States. Washington, he says, stepped down after his second term, but not because he was required by law to do so. Zimmerman says Washington didn't support enforced term limits, citing one of his letters. ""I can see no propriety in precluding ourselves from the service of any man who, in some great emergency, shall be deemed universally most capable of serving the public,"" Washington wrote. By leaving office, however, he did establish a precedent that would be followed for more than a century.



In his ""Presidential Term Limits in American History: Power, Principles, and Politics,"" Michael Korzi, a professor of political science at Towson University, cites the first president's remark, stating that Washington departed voluntarily after his second term ""more for personal reasons than for reasons of philosophy.""



Even so, the Founding Fathers had different opinions on whether to impose a mandate on term lengths, researchers indicate. (U.S. senators and representatives don't have term limits.) Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the U.S., felt a maximum had merit. In ""Jefferson Himself: The Personal Narrative of a Many-Sided American,"" edited by Bernard Mayo, Jefferson referenced his dislike of the idea of an entrenched leader:



""That I should lay down my charge at a proper season is as much a duty as to have borne it faithfully ... . These changes are necessary, too, for the security of republican government. If some period be not fixed, either by the Constitution or by practice, to the services of the First Magistrate, his office, though nominally elective, will in fact be for life; and that will soon degenerate into an inheritance.""



As for the present, Zimmerman's idea isn't new, and in fact, rumor-researching website Snopes.com notes multiple proposals in recent years to repeal the 22nd Amendment. Republicans and Democrats alike have raised the issue, but none of the attempts have gotten too far. .



You tell us: Do you prefer to have presidential term limits? Or would you rather a president be able to run as many times as they want?"

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/10/27/Ken-Cuccinelli-Is-Virginia-s-Libertarian-Choice-Too,2013-10-27 00:00:00,['Dr. Susan Berry'],"Ken Cuccinelli Is Virginia's Libertarian Choice, Too","Though Robert Sarvis is the announced Libertarian candidate who is reportedly pulling 10 percent of the vote in Virginia’s gubernatorial race, Republican Ken Cuccinelli likely has more to offer libertarians in the state than Sarvis. Libertarian Ron Paul and his son Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) think so, and both have endorsed Cuccinelli.

Political analyst Tim Carney of the Washington Examiner, who often espouses the libertarian viewpoint, wrote Friday that Cuccinelli “would arguably be the most libertarian governor in the United States if he wins on Nov. 7,” a point that contrasts sharply with the fact that libertarians are attacking him.

As Carney observes, Cuccinelli, as Virginia’s attorney general, was the first to challenge the constitutionality of ObamaCare’s mandates, taxes, subsidies, and infringements upon liberty.

As governor, Cuccinelli’s plan is to cut the state income tax rate by 15 percent for individuals and 33 percent for corporations, creating an environment that is ripe for the free market.

But libertarians should take note that Cuccinelli’s style is more “pro-economic growth” and less “pro-business,” as evidenced by the fact that his state’s business lobby has had its feathers ruffled by his stand against corporate welfare. Cuccinelli opposed the tax hikes that were sought by Northern Virginia developers to pay for roads and public services, and he pledged to cut the tax credits for special interest groups.

In addition, Cuccinelli fought, while a state senator, to protect second amendment rights and, consequently, has an “A” rating from the NRA. He also opposed smoking bans when serving as a state senator.

As Carney states, “Cuccinelli also often chooses government restraint over ‘law and order.'”

Not afraid to oppose his own party, Cuccinelli, was the only Republican to vote against an expansion of the death penalty in 2009, even during a competitive primary for attorney general.

Cuccinelli’s strong character was visible in his unwavering effort to exonerate Thomas Haynesworth, a black man who was wrongly convicted of rape and jailed for 27 years. Cuccinelli argued successfully to obtain a rare “writ of actual innocence,” which was possible because as a state senator, he had advocated for a law that would make such exoneration easier.

Carney questions why, with Cuccinelli having libertarian bona fides, Ed Crane, former president of the Cato Institute, and other libertarians are supporting Sarvis and spending $300,000 on his campaign?

He suspects, he says, that identity politics plays a role:

I asked Sarvis why a libertarian should oppose Cuccinelli, and the first words out of his mouth were “social issues.” Crane’s only critique of Cuccinelli when announcing the $300,000 buy for Sarvis: “Ken Cuccinelli is a socially intolerant, hard-right conservative with little respect for civil liberties.” Cuccinelli is undoubtedly conservative. He’s an observant Catholic with seven children and a home-schooling wife. He’s a hero to the pro-life cause and an opponent of gay marriage. Libertarians, as a rule, support gay marriage, and most libertarians are pro-choice. But pro-life views fit within the libertarian framework: If you believe an in utero baby is a person, and if you believe the government has a legitimate role in protecting the innocent from violence, it’s logical to restrict abortion. And Cuccinelli, while unwavering in his moral opposition to abortion, is a moderate among Virginia Republicans when it comes to government restrictions on abortion: He worked behind the scenes trying to remove a GOP-created requirement that women undergo an ultrasound before getting an abortion.

Carney gets to the crux of the matter, however, when he asserts, that “social liberals’ attack on Cuccinelli conflates his personal conservatism with his policy views.”

The fact is that, while Cuccinelli might not personally agree with a law, he knows his job is to uphold the laws in his state. So, when he prosecuted a 47 year-old sexual predator who had sex with a minor, he defended his state’s “Crimes Against Nature” law but did not attempt to “ban sodomy” or homosexuality, as his critics say. He also has never attempted to “ban contraception,” as Planned Parenthood and its minions have charged.

As Carney contends, Ken Cuccinelli may personally live a conservative lifestyle, but his record as both a state senator and attorney general is one that demonstrates that liberty is worth fighting for. Shouldn’t libertarians respect his choice to live as he does, while he also works to keep Virginians free?"
http://news.yahoo.com/mitt-romney-documentary-164457144.html,,[],Behind-the-scenes doc shows moment Romney learned he had lost the presidency,"Mitt Romney really thought he was going to defeat President Barack Obama in the 2012 election — a belief he held right up until the polls closed on Election Day. As he told reporters on his campaign plane en route to his election night rally in Boston, he hadn’t considered losing. He hadn’t even written a concession speech.

And that wasn’t just rhetoric. A new documentary about Romney’s 2008 and 2012 presidential bids captures the moment the GOP nominee realizes his quest for the White House is over, that the internal poll numbers that suggested a landslide victory over Obama were dramatically wrong.

“I just can’t believe you’re gonna lose,” someone tells him.

“Yeah, yep,” a stunned Romney replies.

“So what do you think you say in a concession speech,” Romney adds with a hint of a smile. “By the way, someone have a number for the president?”

It’s the opening scene from a trailer for “Mitt,” a documentary set to premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on Jan. 17 and stream on Netflix starting Jan. 24.

The film, directed by Greg Whitley, features behind-the-scenes footage and candid interviews with Romney and his family, dating to 2006 when the former Massachusetts governor ran and lost his bid for the GOP nomination to Sen. John McCain.

The documentary shows another side of Romney, who was long criticized for being awkward and forced on the stump. In the film, Romney is joking and at ease — as he often was during off-the-record chats with reporters on his campaign plane. One scene shows him trying to iron a suit while he’s actually wearing it.

Another scene shows him bluntly acknowledging the public regards him as “the flipping Mormon” — a rare admission of the effect his religion had on his bid for the presidency.

The film also includes footage of the Romney family discussing his potential presidential bid ahead of the 2008 campaign and Romney’s blunt admission that the nominee who runs and loses a bid is branded “a loser for life.”

“If you don’t win, we’ll still love you,” his oldest son, Tagg, tells him at one point. “The country may think of you as a laughingstock, and we’ll know the truth, and that’s OK.”"
http://news.yahoo.com/no-guarantee-gop-senate-majority-220301758.html,,[],No Guarantee of a GOP Senate Majority,"Between the “sorting out” that took place in the past four elections and a redistricting process that maximized the number of safe seats for both parties—but especially for Republicans—the bulk of the 2014 congressional election action won’t be in the House, but in the Senate. The disproportionate exposure for Senate Democrats is very clear, giving Republicans the opportunity to gain a large number of seats, and potentially the six they need for control of the chamber. However, the same was true last year, when instead of gaining two to four seats, the GOP ended up with a net loss of two. A repeat of that looks extremely unlikely, but whether Republicans are in a position to capitalize on their opportunities remains to be seen.

Two seats will be dispensed with this year: Secretary of State John Kerry’s former seat in Massachusetts—which will be settled June 25—and the seat held by Democrat Frank Lautenberg before his death. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie appointed Jeffrey Chiesa, a Republican caretaker, pending an Oct. 16 general election that will be mostly a formality. Republicans are now seen as having little chance of retaining the seat. Democrats are also expected to hold the Massachusetts seat, as Rep. Edward Markey seems to have stabilized his once-precarious advantage over his GOP opponent, former Navy SEAL and pilot Gabriel Gomez. Should Democrats win both of these races, the magic number for Republicans to win control of the chamber goes back up to a six, as it was before Lautenberg’s death.

The 2014 Senate math is quite clear. The last time this particular group of seats came up was in the banner Democratic year of 2008. Democrats have 20 seats up for grabs, to just 15 for the GOP, and six of the Democrats’ seats are in states that Mitt Romney won by double-digit margins. Republicans will have just one seat up in a state that President Obama carried: that of Susan Collins in Maine. Although Obama won there by 15 points, if Collins runs, as she is expected to do, she is extremely likely to win. Another metric to watch is last-election winning percentage. Democrats have seven incumbents up who won with 54.9 percent of the vote or less, Republicans just three. Finally, Democrats have five open seats—usually more difficult to defend—to the GOP’s two.

Story continues

Democrats have four seats up in states that Romney carried by 17 points or more—those of Mary Landrieu in Louisiana and Mark Pryor in Arkansas, and open seats in South Dakota and West Virginia, both of which look very likely to go to Republicans. The two incumbents are also slated for extremely difficult challenges. Then, Democrats have two more seats in states that Romney won by 14 points—Mark Begich’s in Alaska and an open seat in Montana, where Max Baucus is retiring. It’s unclear whether Republicans will end up with a high-quality challenger in Alaska; Democrats have a pretty good shot of holding onto the Montana seat if popular former Gov. Brian Schweitzer runs, as he is expected to do. In the last remaining Democratic seat up in a Romney state, Kay Hagan faces a stiff challenge in North Carolina, where Obama lost by 2 points last year after having won narrowly in 2008. Two more Democratic elections to be watched, particularly if the GOP mounts strong challenges, are for the open Michigan seat and the race against Al Franken in Minnesota.

Because 2008 was such a bad year for Republicans, they have very few vulnerable seats left in this class. Democrats have a long shot at picking up Saxby Chambliss’s open seat in Georgia only if Michelle Nunn—daughter of longtime Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn—runs, and, more important, if Republicans nominate an exotic (read: self-destructive) nominee along the lines of then-Rep. Todd Akin in Missouri and Richard Mourdock in Indiana, both of whom seized defeat from the jaws of victory. In other words, Democrats’ challenge in Georgia is the equivalent of pulling off a two- or three-cushion shot in pool.

After Georgia, the only remote chances Democrats have are in Kentucky, upsetting Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and in Maine, a Democratic-leaning state but with a very popular GOP incumbent. The odds of a Democratic gain in the state, as long as Collins is running, are about nil.

But all of these mathematical opportunities for Republicans are just theoretical unless the GOP recruits and nominates good candidates, a problem that plagued the party the 2010 and 2012 cycles, and begins to cut into its lack of support among minority, younger, female, and moderate voters. In 2010, a great Republican year, the GOP lost five of the seven Senate seats The Cook Political Report rated as Toss-Ups going into Election Day, and also lost eight of the 10 Toss-Ups in 2012—providing a sobering counterpoint to the argument of extensive Democratic exposure. The bottom line is, IF Republicans get their act together, they SHOULD have a good chance to win a majority in the Senate. But that is a big IF."

Canadian-born U.S. Sen. Ted ""Calgary"" Cruz (R-TX) hasn't served a single day of his life in the United States armed services, but over the weekend that didn't stop him from accusing decorated Vietnam veterans and Obama cabinet nominees John Kerry and Chuck Hagel of being against our nation's military:The fact that a chickenhawk like Calgary Cruz would accuse actual war heroes like Kerry and Hagel of being against America is crazy enough on its own, but the substantive argument he was trying to make was just as absurd. Cruz wasn't merely trying to impugn their patriotism, he was also trying to make the case for more military spending.

According to Cruz, what America needs now is to build up American military power just like we did during the Cold War. In Cruz's view, failing to do so would project weakness to whomever it is that we are fighting. Therefore, the fact that neither Kerry nor Hagel believe it is in America's interests to continue feeding fiscal steroids to our military industry means that they must hate America and want our enemy (or is it enemies?) to win.

Obviously, Cruz's thinking isn't alone in the GOP. It's about as common as a Republican foreign policy adviser slipping up and referring to the Soviet Union or Czechoslovakia, which is to say it's pretty damn common. It might be a theory worth debating if our ""enemy"" were the Soviet Union, but whatever our enemy is, it's not the USSR or anything like it.

Nonetheless, Republicans continue to insist on the sort of outdated thinking that leads their leading politicians to say offensive things like Cruz did over the weekend and stupid things like Paul Ryan did in the vice presidential debate when he claimed the sequester's defense cuts encouraged the attack in Benghazi.

There is one good thing to come out of it, though: It's nice to see that yet another guy elected by the tea party is complaining about the spending cuts that they forced into law.

Updated at 4:20 p.m. ET on 8/15



Boston (CNN) - New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie planted himself firmly in the Republican Party’s establishment wing Thursday with a pugnacious speech calling on his party to focus on pragmatism rather than ideology and crippling internal debates.

""We are not a debating society,” Christie told a lunchtime audience at the Republican National Committees summer meeting in Boston. “We are a political operation that needs to win.""



Some of Christie’s remarks, relayed to a reporter by GOP officials who attended the closed-press event, were interpreted by many here as another jab at Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a potential rival for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination.

Christie and Paul tangled earlier this summer after the New Jersey governor criticized Paul’s libertarian-tinged worldview as “esoteric” and “intellectual,” drawing a series of pointed rebukes from Paul and his allies.

“I am in this business to win. I don’t know why you are in it. I am in this to win,” Christie said at the luncheon, his first appearance a meeting of the RNC.

“I think we have some folks who believe that our job is to be college professors,” he said. “Now college professors are fine I guess. Being a college professor, they basically spout out ideas that nobody does anything about. For our ideas to matter we have to win. Because if we don’t win, we don’t govern. And if we don’t govern all we do is shout to the wind. And so I am going to do anything I need to do to win.”

Rand Paul adviser jabs 'content-free' Christie

Christie also appeared to rap Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, another potential White House hopeful who made headlines in January when he implored the GOP to “stop being the stupid party.”

""I'm not going to be one of these people who goes around and calls our party stupid,” Christie said, a startling remark given that Jindal and Christie work hand-in-hand as chairman and vice-chairman of the Republican Governors Association.

“We need to stop navel gazing,"" he added. ""There's nothing wrong with our principles. We need to focus on winning again. There's too much at stake for this to be an academic exercise. We need to win and govern with authority and courage.""

Another Paul takes on Chris Christie

President Obama and Congressional torpor merited barely a mention in his remarks. Christie devoted the much of the speech to his record in New Jersey, highlighting efforts to fix a budget deficit and his noisy fights with teachers unions over pension reform.

“You got two choices as a governor,” he said. “You either sidle up next to them and whisper sweet nothings in their ear or try to hope they don't punch you. Or your second alternative is you punch them first.”

By most accounts, Christie’s remarks were met with enthusiasm by the nearly 200 state GOP chairmen, staffers and party insiders who attend these quarterly meetings to plot election strategy and hunt for business.

“It was really great,” said Indiana committeeman Jim Bopp. “Successful politics is a matter of heeding your principles, implementing them, but also being pragmatic about what you can accomplish and need to win. You can’t govern if can’t win.”

Cindy Costa, a national committeewoman from South Carolina, called the speech “amazing.”

“It was impressive. I forgot about the Obama bear hug,” said Tennessee GOP Chairman Chris Devaney, referring to Christie’s tour of the New Jersey coastline with President Obama just days before last year’s presidential election, a moment of bipartisan harmony that rankled GOP activists and top members of Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign.

Though he earned rave reviews from a range of party leaders, a handful of RNC members, including several Paul supporters, left unimpressed. One conservative on the committee who declined to be identified called Christie “a pompous ass.”

Others expressed admiration for Christie but wondered whether his brash northeastern brand could appeal in other regions of the country.

If Christie does seek the presidency, he would face the prospect of courting voters in Iowa and South Carolina, where Republican primary contests tend to favor candidates from the conservative wing of the party.

“He wouldn’t play too well where I’m from because we’re a little bit too conservative,” said Alabama GOP Chairman Bill Armistead. “He is probably a bit more liberal socially than some folks. That would cause some problems in Alabama. But everybody loves that he tells it like it is and doesn’t flinch at the opposition.”

Christie, who is carefully balancing his re-election campaign in New Jersey this fall with efforts to build a national profile ahead of a possible presidential bid, held a handful of private meetings with some party leaders at the Westin Boston Waterfront hotel, including one with fundraiser Spencer Zwick, the national finance chairman of Romney’s 2012 campaign.

Christie avoided reporters during his day-long visit and made his way into the hotel ballroom where he gave his speech through a back entrance, rather than face a pack of nearly two dozen reporters waiting for him at the bottom of an escalator adjacent to the meeting.

Sean Spicer, a spokesman for the RNC, declined to say whether the request to keep cameras out of the speech came from Christie high command.

“The event has always been closed press,” he said.

But when Spicer agreed to allow a single photographer into the speech to capture a still image of Christie, several reporters protested, prompting a heated argument between about the meaning of “closed press"" with some prominent members of the Boston media.

Eventually, the photographer was allowed in, while the rest of the press waited outside for Christie to finish."

Story highlights Ted Cruz does not play by Senate rules, irritating traditionalists on both sides of the aisle Unapologetic, Cruz says he was elected to do a job that includes shrinking government Cruz ups ante in battle to derail Obamacare, but will he chart new course or stumble? Latest crusade that threatens gov't shutdown frustrates many -- including some in his own party

(CNN) —

Ted Cruz says he wasn’t elected to the Senate to stay quiet. And his refusal upon entering Congress to observe its protocol to sit back and learn like a freshman, as expected, rubbed some of his more senior colleagues the wrong way.

And while he has angered much of his party over his crusade against President Barack Obama’s health care law and the potential government shutdown it could cause, Cruz says he’s standing for the same principles that got him elected.

On Tuesday, he took that edict to the Senate floor in support of his plan to defund Obamacare, saying he would speak “until I am no longer able to stand.”

But his marathon appearance will not do anything to block Obamacare funding with a key procedural vote on the issue still scheduled for Wednesday. Instead, Cruz said his speech was to simply “make D.C. listen.”

Critics question his motives, though — is this about his principles or about presidential aspirations?

CNN political analyst Gloria Borger said his Republican detractors think Cruz is putting his political career above all else.

“While many others have, no doubt, come to the Senate in the past as a springboard to the presidency, it’s hard to recall someone who has created as much controversy within his own party,” Borger said.

Cruz has been in Washington for less than a year, but his short stint has been an effective lesson in partisan politics. Only history will tell, however, if his tactics will be worth repeating.

The Texas Republican’s counterparts in the House of Representatives have tried 42 times to roll back Obamacare, but their efforts have gone nowhere in the Democratic-controlled Senate.

Cruz has upped the ante. His latest battle to disrupt Obamacare is tied to funding the government in the new fiscal year that starts on October 1. The House passed the measure last week. But Senate Democrats are not about to allow the health care bill to be unraveled, therefore putting at risk a government shutdown.

Cruz’s refusal to give up the fight has rankled many of his fellow Republicans, widening divisions in a splintered party. Democrats, meanwhile, are sitting back and watching the intraparty fight.

Who is this guy?

His effectiveness at political debate has landed Cruz in many successful places. He was elected to the Senate in 2012, after rebuking the Republican establishment and winning the Republican primary, paving the way to a general election victory.

Previously, he was the youngest solicitor general of Texas and has argued multiple cases before the Supreme Court. He got his start at Princeton as head of the debate team and then honed his skill at Harvard Law School.

What’s his fight?

Cruz did not take his Senate responsibilities lightly. As a freshman, he refused to stand on the sidelines until he’s gained a measure of seniority, a common tradition in Washington. Instead, he was loud and opinionated.

“I find it amusing that those in Washington are puzzled when someone actually does what they said they would do,” Cruz told CNN in February. “At the end of the day, I was elected to represent 26 million Texans and to speak the truth. You know, I think a lot of Americans are tired of politicians in Washington in both parties who play games.

Cruz was elected, promising to shrink government, especially the new health care law. That battle has been embraced by most Republicans in Congress, but his latest tactic has frustrated many.

Political novice...?

New York Rep. Peter King has been an outspoken critic of Cruz’ latest crusade — at one point calling him a “fraud.”

“Whether it’s Custer, whether it’s kamikaze, or whether it’s Gallipoli or whatever, we are going to lose this,” the New York Republican said on CNN’s “The Situation Room” last week.

And Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee tweeted that he “didn’t go to Harvard or Princeton” but that he “can count” that Democrats outnumber Republicans in the Senate.

But Cruz said to let his critics talk.

“If you get outside of Washington, D.C., there is a frustration with Washington that is palpable. When you ask your constituents what are the problems you’re facing, over and over again, the answer that comes back is Obamacare is killing jobs, is taking away my health insurance, is driving up my premiums, is causing small businesses to shrink, to go out of business. If we listen to the American people, that should be our priorities,” he told CNN this week.

Still, Republicans are frustrated by his insistence at fighting a divisive, losing battle.

’Don’t break filibuster’

“We are giving Obama the escape out,” Republican strategist Ana Navarro said on CNN’s ‘AC360.’ “Instead of now focusing on the problems with Obamacare, everybody’s focused on the civil war in the Republican party.”

Navarro also noted that the numerous polls, including CNN’s latest poll, that while the public is concerned with Obamacare, they don’t support shutting down the government over it.

“If you want to fix Obamacare or repeal it or fix it or change it, the best way to do it is to elect more Republicans. And the political cost of a government shutdown is really going to affect any – any possibility of electing more Republicans,” Navarro added.

…or political genius?

While Cruz is ruffling the feathers of his colleagues in Washington, he is mobilizing the grassroots outside the Beltway.

Conservative groups are praising Cruz.

“Senator Cruz came to Washington to advance conservative policies, not play by the same old rules that have relegated conservatives, and their ideas, to the back bench,” Michael Needham, president of Heritage Action, recently said about Cruz.

His group helps activate grass roots Republicans for conservative candidates and political causes.

And Republican candidates running against Republican incumbents in the primaries are using Cruz’ crusade in their races.

Matt Bevin, who is running for Senate to replace top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell, said in a statement that he would support “conservatives like Sen. Ted Cruz in his fight to defund Obamacare.”

Obamacare: Can it be stopped?

Bevin bashed McConnell for coming out against Cruz’ effort to shut down the government in order to stop Obamacare.

Like so many other crucial fights, Mitch McConnell has caved to (Senate Majority Leader) Harry Reid on Obamacare and is refusing to fight to defund this disastrous legislation.”

And long-time Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming came out in support of Cruz. He is facing Liz Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, in a contentious primary.

Will Cruz be scarred or be a star?

Cruz could alienate his colleagues to a point where he becomes marginalized and completely ineffective in Washington.

He has also hinted at a possible presidential run in 2016. If he has no support of the Republican Party, he risks being cut off from its resources and financing.

On the other hand, Cruz’ principled stand can help to grow a movement of disenchanted conservative voters. If a groundswell of conservative grassroots activists grows between now and 2016 – and their financial support - Cruz could have carved out a path to the Republican nomination.

“I think what Senator Cruz understands is that he has more to gain from adhering to his principles, staying in touch with the grass roots here and around the country than he does being friends with other senators,” Brendan Steinhauser, a leading Texas tea party activist who worked to get Cruz elected, said.

The source of the argument seems to boil down to what it means to be a true conservative in the modern Republican Party, and whether the party needs to change in order to broaden its appeal, particularly to Latino voters.

Disagreement boiled over most publicly when a few hundred delegates attempted to seat a convention chairman who would help them remove Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) from the party. Graham, who has earned a place in Washington as one of the key players in the party establishment and a frequent critic of the Obama administration’s foreign policy, faced resistance from conservatives upset with his work to overhaul the nation’s immigration laws and his support for President Obama’s Supreme Court nominees.

Graham is up for reelection next year, but many of his critics hope a more genuinely conservative candidate will emerge to challenge him in a primary.

The senator acknowledged his critics when he spoke onstage, but warned them: “We’re going to end up in the same boat, whether you like it or not, because there’s holes in the other boat.”

When he turned to immigration, Graham framed the forthcoming debate as critical to ensuring the nation’s security — and the future of the GOP. Citing the immigration status of the suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing, he said the Obama administration had poorly enforced current laws and failed to notice that one of the suspect’s friends had overstayed a student visa.

The crowd appeared to be in step with Graham until he began discussing what to do about the legal status of more than 11 million illegal immigrants. Almost immediately, several in the crowd shouted: “No amnesty!”

“No amnesty, I’ve got it,” he said, cutting them off. “Now here’s the question: After 2012, the question for this party is: Do you believe that we can grow the vote among all sectors of this country?”

Graham’s message was clear: Reforming the nation’s immigration laws is critical to increasing GOP support among the fast-growing Hispanic population, which generally espouses the socially conservative views held by Republicans anyway and could very well eventually support the party’s candidates.

“Conservatism is an asset, not a liability,” Graham said. “You don’t have to be embarrassed about your social conservatism. You just have to talk about it in ways that we can grow this party.”

Finding a way to expand the party’s appeal was clearly on the minds of delegates Saturday, with many conflicted over who should lead the party into the future.

“They have to be strong, honest, able to stand up for what you believe in and not be intimidated,” said Stephanie McKay, a legal aide from Bishopville, S.C. “Without someone like that, nothing’s going to change.”

Dorian Bucholz, a first-time delegate from Charleston, S.C., said determining the party’s next presidential nominee will be difficult “because there aren’t really faces sticking out being strong conservatives. But we’ve got to get our act together because 2016 is going to come fast.”

Almost to a person, the delegates agreed that they want new blood.

“Our party’s ‘it’s your turn’ attitude is over for presidential candidates,” said Walter Whetsell, a GOP political consultant who has worked for several presidential candidates. “It’s never paid dividends for us. These young, fresh faces have a legitimate shot at winning over these people.”

One of those newer faces is freshman Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), who fueled speculation about his own ambitions by speaking Friday at the state party’s annual Silver Elephant Dinner. Pacing the stage like a televangelist, he earned loud applause by discounting his Harvard Law education, joking about the missteps of Vice President Biden and blasting Obama for his health-care law and the Justice Department’s botched Fast and Furious gun-running operation.

Clearly wooing the home-state crowd, Cruz recounted the stories of William Travis and James Bonham, two South Carolina-born officers who led the ill-fated Battle of the Alamo.

“Thank you for the support South Carolina has given, then and now, as we fight side by side,” he said.

By Saturday morning, however, several people said Cruz should wait.

“He’s only been in office about five months,” said Randall Wallace of Myrtle Beach. “I feel like you have to have some experience before you go after the top job.”

Jumping into the 2016 race would mean Cruz is “trying to replicate Barack Obama,” said Peggy Geraghty of Hilton Head Island, S.C. “I never agreed with Obama going for president so soon.”

Geraghty said she’s more interested in Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.), but worries he might not have broad appeal. As for Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), another name often mentioned for president, she said she’ll reserve judgment, but added: “He does have sparkle, so if you have to have the sparkle, I suppose he’d be good.”

Still reminiscing about last year’s GOP losses, Samantha Rogers of Bishopville suggested that Rep. Paul Ryan (Wis.), a former vice-presidential contender, should give it a go: “I actually enjoyed him more than Romney,” she said. “I like the values that he pushed.”

Even Graham acknowledged the party’s shifting demographics in his speech, referring to himself as “a little, short, white guy” in a crowd of rising stars, including the state’s 41-year-old governor, Nikki Haley, an Indian American, and Sen. Tim Scott (S.C.), 47, one of two African Americans in the U.S. Senate.

As Graham concluded, he made another bid to satisfy his critics: “The only thing I’m good at is being me.”

“I don’t believe enough in myself to think that I’m always right and that anyone who disagrees with me is always wrong,” he added. “But I do believe, and I owe it to you, my party and my country to be honest: We need to regroup, rethink and come out anew with a conservative message that will allow this party to grow.”

Most of the crowd rose to its feet and cheered, but about 100 people sat quietly in a dark, back corner of the room, still unimpressed by what they had heard.

http://news.yahoo.com/one-obama-lawn-sign-tore-community-apart-234121157.html,,[],How One Obama Lawn Sign Tore This Community Apart,"Yes, that sounds like a parody movie trailer. But unfortunately this is a real story based on real things that happened in real life instead of brilliant satire. The Washington Post has an amazing story about how an Obama lawn sign ignited an intense legal battle in a Virginia neighborhood.

RELATED: Farewell to Los Angeles's House of Davids

Sam and Maria Farran put an Obama election sign up in their yard leading up to the 2008 election. But what seems like a harmless political statement allegedly violated the stipulations of the homeowners association that governs the sleepy Virginia neighborhood where they live. The sign, it turns out, was four inches too tall. One particularly overzealous neighbor filed a complaint with the association and the Farrans were asked to take it down. Instead, they had a batter idea. They cut the sign in half. The homeowners association didn't appreciate the couples' humor, though, and fined them $900 for the infraction.

The association board believed they were operating within Virgina law, but the Farrans saw this as a violation of their free speech by a group of proto-communists trying to run their neighborhood like 1940s Russia. After the board rejected the couples' proposal for roof and deck renovations under less than legitimate seeming circumstances, the Farrans filed a lawsuit against the association. The battle lines in the neighborhood were drawn. And these people take their legal battles very seriously:

The Farrans said HOA backers told them to move. They found bullets in their yard. Someone implored a priest at their church to prevail on the Farrans to stop the lawsuit. A local real estate agent said the infighting was scaring off some home buyers.

What followed is a legal battle that's still ongoing, and a homeowners association that's been left bankrupt because of it. Is this homeowners association fight as interesting or flashy as the one that killed LA's 'House of Davids'? No, but it's still crazy. You can and should read the whole story over at the Washington Post."

Republicans are defending 13 seats, Democrats 20. But the seats the GOP is defending are nearly all in their territory: ID, WY, NE, KS, OK, TX, AL, MI, GA, SC, TN, and KY. Only Maine is being defended on Blue territory.

Meanwhile, Democrats must defend tough seats in (among other places) AK, CO, MT, SD, IA, AR, LA, NC, WV, and NH—either Red or swing states.

Democratic pickup opportunities are currently severely limited. Maine is obviously top of the list, but only if Susan Collins follows her former colleague Olympia Snowe into retirement. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is surprisingly unpopular in Kentucky, providing an outside chance of a race. American Crossroads is clearly spooked at a Ashley Judd candidacy, already hitting her with this web ad. And then there's the open seat in Georgia, a state that is demographically moving in our direction. The threat of a teabagger challenge chased Saxby Chambliss into retirement, giving us the best chance to replicate Indiana next year.

Republican prospects are much rosier, even if ""rosy"" is relative when it comes to the modern broken GOP (remember, things were pretty darn rosy for Republicans in 2012, and they still ended up losing two net seats to the Democrats).

Mark Begich in Alaska is holding his own in the early polling, but it'll be close. Mark Pryor in Arkansas, Tim Johnson in South Dakota, Mary Landrieu in Louisiana, and Kay Hagan in North Carolina should all face serious and difficult reelection bids. Democratic retirements in Iowa and West Virginia will also be tough holds. Slot in Colorado and New Hampshire as GOP longshots, but they're on the map. Finally, Montana Democrats have been able to buck their state's Red lean during Senate races, and Max Baucus would have the slight edge, though Brian Schweitzer could lock it down (whether via primary challenge, or after a Baucus retirement).

What that all means is that Republicans are well within reach of the six seats they would need to control the Senate. The math makes that obvious. If there's a silver lining here, it's that the Red-state Dems on that list don't have to run with President Barack Obama at the top of the ticket, and won't have to contend with presidential-year turnout which would undoubtedly hurt most of them.

2016



But here's where it gets good. First of all, if a Democrat survived 2010 they can survive anything. That means their seats in CA, CO, CT, HI, MD, NV, NY, OR, VT, and WA are all safe. There's not a good GOP opportunity in that lot, even if retirements were to take place (and none are expected at this time).

Republicans, on the other hand, have to defend (in addition to their safe seats) FL, IL, IA, NH, NC, OH, PA, and WI. Furthermore, AZ, GA, and MO could be competitive if there were retirements, scandal, or teabagger primary victories.

Yes, Marco Rubio is the darling of the GOP and media establishments, but his Florida numbers are average at best. And in any case, he may be on the presidential ticket anyway. Mark Kirk in Illinois is toast. Iowa's Chuck Grassley will be 83 on Election Day 2016. Republicans are praying he doesn't retire.

As long as base turnout doesn't plummet, a la 2010, New Hampshire freshman GOPer Kelly Ayotte will face a tough re-election battle. North Carolina's Richard Burr is a longshot, but still on the map.

But the most fun will be teabagger troika in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, particularly in a presidential year when base turnout will be maximized: Scuttlebutt out of Wisconsin is that Russ Feingold wants a rematch against the joker Ron Johnson representing his state in the Senate. Pat Toomey won the Keystone State by just two points in a year when the Democratic base sat out. And while Rob Portman won his seat convincingly in the Buckeye State, again it was with depressed Democratic turnout.

Put Hillary Clinton on our presidential ticket, and you might even see Republican-held seats in Arkansas and Kentucky under pressure. And finally, Alaska presents an interesting scenario: Lisa Murkowski already lost a Republican primary and won election as a write-in independent. She would likely face a similar situation in 2016, and against another split field, a Democrat might be able to succeed (or push Murkowski out of the GOP).

Obviously, 2016 is a long way away, and much can and will happen before then. But no matter how bleak 2014 looks for us on paper, just remember that 2016 will be our reward for holding strong and limiting GOP gains next year."

BANGALORE — In a morale booster for the governing Congress Party in New Delhi, its regional unit stormed into power in the south Indian state of Karnataka on Wednesday, as trends show, relegating the rival Bharatiya Janata Party, which governed the state for the last five years, to a distant second place.

As of Wednesday afternoon, as Sunday’s election results were being tallied in Karnataka, the Congress Party was winning or leading in 122 of the total 224 constituencies (of which the election process was suspended in one following the death of a candidate). Final results are due Wednesday night.

The regional election is one that a beleaguered Congress Party would like to view as a presage for a big fight for New Delhi, the upcoming Lok Sabha elections slated for mid-2014. Some analysts are going so far as to suggest that this is a trial round for the prime ministerial aspirants, Rahul Gandhi of the Congress Party and Narendra Modi of the B.J.P. Both campaigned in the regional elections but with restraint.

The B.J.P. suffered a humiliating defeat, trailing far behind the Congress Party with around 40 seats, ousted from the only state it has ruled in southern India. The result is widely being interpreted by analysts as a voter backlash against the scandal-ridden B.J.P. rule rather than a vote for the Congress. Over 70 percent of the state’s registered voters showed up to cast their ballot, a record turnout and the highest in 35 years.

In Bangalore, Karnataka’s capital, the government has paid scant attention to creating infrastructure or providing basic services like a reliable water supply and garbage clearance.

The B.J.P.’s losses offered a small reprieve to the Congress-led government in New Delhi, which is reeling under recent scandals dubbed Coalgate and Railgate, concerning the allocating of coal mining blocks and bribery allegations over a railways post. The uproar over these scandals has led the opposition B.J.P. to blockade parliamentary proceedings in recent days and the governing party to adjourn the Parliament session on Wednesday.

In Bangalore, the country’s job and technology hub, a chief minister has yet to be chosen by the Congress Party. Among the front-runners are Siddaramaiah, a widely respected local strongman from the backward classes, who is the party’s only mass leader. Also in the running are two Karnataka ministers in the New Delhi government, Labor Minister Mallikarjuna Kharge and Petroleum Minister Veerappa Moily.

Another potential candidate, G. Parameshwara, appeared headed for defeat in the election, thus taking himself out of contention."

Markey enjoyed robust support from allied groups and surrogates throughout his campaign. President Obama and Vice President Biden each traveled to Massachusetts to campaign with him in the closing weeks. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and Kerry endorsed his candidacy a day after he announced it. And a Democratic super PAC made a seven-figure investment on television ads.

“We began working late last year with numerous partners, in Massachusetts and nationally, to prevent another sneak attack that allowed Scott Brown to win,” said Craig Varoga, a senior strategist at Senate Majority PAC, a Democratic group.

Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Executive Director Guy Cecil wrote in a memo that ""the lesson from Scott Brown’s accidental win in 2010 was that Democrats must never take a race for granted.""

Turnout was anticipated to be very low on Tuesday, an oppressively hot day in the Bay State. The race attracted little attention over the last few months, and few voters tuned into the televised debates between Markey and Gomez.

Gomez drew some early comparisons to Brown, but it became clear late in the race that he wasn't going to repeat his success. The first-time candidate, a former Navy SEAL and the son of Colombian immigrants, cast himself as an independent voice with an outside-the-beltway perspective. But he never really broke through; polls showed him trailing Markey throughout the race.

Many Republican groups and donors were not convinced Gomez was worth a major investment. The National Republican Senatorial Committee says it spent nearly $1 million on the race, but American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS, GOP-aligned groups that often enter the mix in Senate contests, were nowhere to be found. Nor was the Chamber of Commerce. And one pro-Gomez super PAC didn't raise very much money.

The decision to remain on the sidelines could set off a new debate in GOP circles about how best to deploy resources, coming off a tough cycle for Republicans, who lost some key Senate races in red states last year. During the campaign, Gomez allies publicly urged Republicans to join his cause.

“Do conservatives have nerve to try & win?” tweeted Gomez campaign consultant Brad Todd in late May. “Will [the] mod[erate] R donor class put its money where mouth is? Is this a party or therapy session?”

Republicans must pick up five seats to win back the Senate majority this cycle. That number is expected to climb to six later this year when New Jersey voters elect a replacement for appointed Sen. Jeff Chiesa (R-N.J.). Newark Mayor Cory Booker (D) is the front-runner in the blue state race, in which Republicans were unable to land a major recruit.

In a memo to supporters, National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) pointed to the fact that Democrats had to spend big, despite the state's Democratic-tilt. And he signaled that Gomez could be back.

""Today marks the end of the first mile in the marathon to permanently fill the Massachusetts Senate seat. Gabriel Gomez is well prepared to win that marathon over the next 16 months,"" Moran said.

Nearly four decades after winning his first congressional campaign, Markey campaigned for the Senate as a champion of liberal values. He ran to the left of fellow Democratic Rep. Stephen F. Lynch in the primary. In the general election, Markey sought to tether Gomez to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) throughout the course of three televised debates.

Markey repeatedly slammed Gomez over his stance on guns, women’s issues and entitlement spending. His campaign also raised questions about the Republican's work in the private equity sector and criticized Gomez for a tax break he took on his home.

For his part, Gomez sought to pitch himself as a moderate alternative to Markey and contrast his career outside politics with Markey’s decades-long tenure in the House. “You are the poster boy for term limits,” Gomez told Markey at their first debate.

Brown helped Gomez behind the scenes. But he didn't campaign in person with Gomez until hours before polls opened.

Markey will replace Sen. Mo Cowan (D), whom Gov. Deval Patrick (D) appointed as an interim replacement for Kerry. A close Patrick confidant and former chief of staff to the governor, Cowan is the only black Democrat currently serving in the Senate.

Markey won’t have long to celebrate his win before he must return to campaign mode. He will face reelection in November of 2014, when he will be vying for a full six-year term.

They were so effective that she didn't even make it to hearings, she withdrew her name because everyone knew that her confirmation would be an uphill battle and she would probably not get the job, which would spend much of Obama's political capital.

Their agenda was to get Rice out of the picture and get John Kerry the job.

But why would the GOP want John Kerry?

Because that means that Kerry has to leave the Senate and a special off-year election has to be held, that's why.

Since off-year elections are more favorable to Republicans, all they have to do is run Scott Brown (MA's most famous Republican) and get a Senate seat.

The problem is that Scott Brown just recently announced that he's not running, which gives us a great shot of keeping the seat blue. No other MA Republican has the name rec or fundraising capability that Brown does. He is the only real hope of the GOP taking Kerry's seat. This dream of their's is now ruined.

But that's not all...

Susan Rice supported Keystone XL and I've read a few places that she even had investments in the project and would personally profit.

If Susan Rice was confirmed, I imagine Keystone XL would have been as well.

John Kerry is firmly opposed to Keystone XL and will most likely (hopefully) put the brakes on this disaster waiting to happen.

So overall, the GOP's plan to get Scott Brown back in the Senate has failed and now their plan to build a dangerous pipeline across America looks like it might fail as well.

They'll never say it in public, but I bet if they knew then what they know now, they would just go ahead and confirm Rice.

I believe in karma and that what goes around comes around.

The GOP tried to obstruct and play politics to gain political power and it blew up in their faces.

I jut wanted to point this out. :)"

The trio discussed their experiences as debate moderators during the last presidential campaign to panel moderator Marvin Kalb.

When asked by Kalb if she felt rattled by Twitter criticism of her performance, she said:

Twitter, as much as you might want to fight it, Marvin, it’s out there. There are voices out there that have influence. There are. I think for we as journalists, it’s a great journalistic tool. It is. You can find all sorts of stories. I had some strange press the day before that for about fifteen minutes rattled me. It did not affect me as a moderator. It affected me as a mom. My son’s on Twitter all the time. It’s the only way we can communicate. If he’s in the bedroom, it’s like, ‘Are you coming to dinner?’ And I tweet it. But I was worried, because there was such nasty stuff. And then my son was like, ‘Mom, do people..?’ I said, ‘You know there are some crazy people who write really mean things and don’t worry about them.’ She added that she she told him, ‘These people have three followers. Quit answering them. They all live in basements with 75 cats.’

Raddatz was asked later by Breitbart News during the Q & A, “You seemed to have gotten a lot of criticism during the vice presidential debate, allowing Joe Biden to just run all over you–the constant laughing, the interrupting of Paul Ryan, particularly when he was talking about an armed Iran or green energy. How can you say you had any control over that debate whatsoever?”

She responded:

Listen, I want to answer you fairly. I really do. You’re up there and you’re as fair as you can possibly be. I think that when we came out of that debate, Joe Biden had 45 seconds more than Congressman Ryan. I think Congressman Ryan felt it was fair. And that’s what I can say. I think Congressman Ryan afterwards could not have been nicer. Both of them were. And both of them thought it was fair.

However, Michael Steel, Paul Ryan’s Vice Presidential spokesman, told the Daily Caller after the debate that Raddatz did not moderate debate fairly at all. :

“I thought she obviously asserted herself more than [Jim] Lehrer did,” Steel said, referencing the moderator of the first presidential debate last week, according to Politico. “[B]ut there was still a great deal of crosstalk, there was still a great deal of difficulty making points in a reasonable and progressive fashion.”

Marvin Kalb began making a tweeting sound after Breitbart News asked her the question, referencing Raddatz’s previous remarks about criticisms she received on Twitter. However, Raddatz, did not just receive criticism for her debate moderator performance from people with 75 cats who live in basements and have three Twitter followers.

A number of right-of-center journalists were critical of her as well. The Washington Examiner‘s David Freddoso wrote, “Ryan is outnumbered here. It’s two against one.” National Review’s Katrina Trinko remarked, “Raddatz is totally being walked all over by Biden. She’s letting him get by with murder in time of talking.” Phil Klein, who works for the Washington Examiner, said, “Every time Biden starts interrupting Ryan, Martha Raddatz cuts Ryan off.” Fox News Contributor and Radio’s Laura Ingraham asked, “Why does Raddatz want to ‘move on’ when Ryan is getting traction?”

Finally, Fox News contributor Charles Krauthammer said of Raddatz, “I pay good money to see a fight, not the referee.”"

According to the new poll, only 22 percent of Americans think the member of Congress from their district deserves reelection, while 48 percent do not. Another 31 percent said they weren't sure.

Anger runs even higher against the rest of Congress, as only 7 percent of respondents said most members of Congress deserve reelection and 73 percent said they don't.

In an earlier HuffPost/YouGov poll -- conducted Oct. 9-10, during the government shutdown -- 25 percent said their own member of Congress deserved reelection, while 11 percent said they think most members of Congress deserve reelection.

Disdain for Congress crossed party lines in the latest survey: Only 27 percent of Republicans, 25 percent of Democrats and a mere 17 percent of independents said their own member of Congress deserves reelection.

Americans who identified their representative as a Republican said that lawmaker did not deserve reelection by a 56 percent to 29 percent margin. Those who identified their representative as a Democrat agreed by a 49 percent to 29 percent margin.

Notably, 27 percent weren't sure whether their representative was a Republican or a Democrat, and another 6 percent said they believed they were represented by ""something else.""

Respondents who weren't sure whether their member of Congress was a Democrat or a Republican tended also to be unsure whether he or she deserved reelection. But a 30 percent to 7 percent plurality said they wanted their mystery congressperson replaced.

The HuffPost/YouGov poll was conducted Nov. 1-2 among 1,000 U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. Factors considered include age, race, gender, education, employment, income, marital status, number of children, voter registration, time and location of Internet access, interest in politics, religion and church attendance.

House GOP leaders, after a closed door session, announced there would be no votes Tuesday night. With that decision, focus shifted back to the Senate and talks between Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid and his Republican counterpart, Sen. Mitch McConnell.

A spokesman for Reid issued a statement late Tuesday saying, ""Senator Reid and Senator McConnell have re-engaged in negotiations and are optimistic that an agreement is within reach.""

The emerging framework on the Senate side would raise the debt ceiling through February, and include a spending bill meant to last through Jan. 15. That version would not include any provision relating to the ObamaCare medical device tax.

Amid discontent on the House side, conservatives were also unhappy with the Senate version and raised concerns that Senate Republicans would go along with it.

Some were still holding out hope that Republicans could score a bigger victory against ObamaCare, and singled out GOP senators like Bob Corker of Tennessee, John McCain of Arizona, and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who have all suggested the initial push to try and defund ObamaCare as part of the fiscal deal was a bad strategy.

Kansas Rep. Tim Huelskamp panned them as part of the ""Senate Surrender Caucus."" ""And they wonder why conservatives don't trust them,"" he told FoxNews.com.

Heritage Action for America -- the political advocacy arm of the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation, which has led efforts to defund the health care law -- also remained critical of the Senate side.

""To their credit, House Republicans responded to their constituents by pushing to defund this unworkable, un-affordable and unfair law,"" said Mike Needham, chief executive for Heritage Action. ""Unfortunately, their leverage is being severely undermined by many of their Senate colleagues who do not share their determination.""

While the Senate had originally been crafting a bipartisan bill to address the budget impasse, House Republicans surprised Senate negotiators earlier Tuesday when they announced they were pursuing their own framework. Moving quickly, House Speaker John Boehner's office announced late Tuesday afternoon that the chamber would vote by the end of the night.

But a vital meeting of the House Rules Committee, which prepares bills for the floor, was then postponed -- a signal that House leaders were lacking the necessary votes.

Fox News is told that a decision by the Heritage Action to come out against the emerging bill drove some Republicans to oppose the plan -- and helped sideline the proposal.

The group complained that the House plan would ""do nothing"" to stall ""massive new entitlements"" in ObamaCare.

The revised House plan was aimed at both ending the partial government shutdown and raising the debt ceiling, but also imposing one ObamaCare-related provision.

Though Republicans have considered over the last several weeks a range of provisions relating to ObamaCare, the one they settled on in this package would force Congress, the president, and many other administration officials and staff onto ObamaCare without additional subsidies. GOP lawmakers described the proposed mandate as a matter of ""fairness.""

""If the president and Senate Democrats are going to force the American people to live under ObamaCare, then they and all Washington leaders should not be shielded from the law,"" one GOP aide said.

The idea was to pass the bill in the House, and effectively dare the Senate to hold up the bill -- and risk missing the debt-ceiling deadline -- because senators don't want to submit to ObamaCare.

But with some conservatives no longer on board, it was unclear whether Boehner would try to tweak and salvage the package -- or kick the debate back over the Senate.

Amid the confusion, some Democrats urged the Republicans to throw in the towel. ""You have two options -- you can get bowled over by the Senate or you can get bowled over by the Senate,"" said one House Democratic aide.

Senate leaders had effectively hit pause on their own negotiations while talks play out on the House side. While Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and other Democrats blasted Boehner for pursuing a House plan, sources indicated the Senate was willing to wait on the House -- if for no other reason than, procedurally, it would save a lot of time. That's because a measure coming from the House could not be filibustered.

Fox News is told the latest plan to emerge in the House would end the partial government shutdown by funding the government through Dec. 15. It would also raise the debt ceiling through Feb. 7 -- in turn averting the looming Thursday deadline to raise the debt cap.

Unlike a prior proposal, it would not include a provision delaying the medical device tax in ObamaCare. It would include a provision limiting the Treasury Department's ability to buy more time when faced with future debt-ceiling deadlines.

Importantly, the plan would kick other budget decisions, including the debate on the medical device tax, to a conference committee.

Republicans earlier claimed the details of their plan were not so far off from a bipartisan approach being crafted in the Senate. Republicans urged Democrats to give it a chance, and questioned why they would preemptively reject it.

""To say, 'absolutely categorically not, we will not consider what the Republicans in the House of Representatives are doing,' in my view, is piling on,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said on the Senate floor, as Democrats lined up against the House plan. ""Let's sit down and work this out.""

The mood in Washington has shifted drastically in the last day, with both sides of the aisle hurling accusations at one another when, the night before, bipartisan leaders in the Senate were claiming on the floor to have made significant progress.

White House spokeswoman Amy Brundage called the House approach a ""partisan attempt to appease a small group of Tea Party Republicans who forced the government shutdown in the first place.""

In the most visceral remarks, Reid alleged Boehner is trying to ""preserve his role at the expense of the country"" -- and said his plan will not pass the Senate.

""Extremist Republicans in the House of Representatives are attempting to torpedo the Senate's bipartisan progress with a bill that can't pass the Senate ... and won't pass the Senate,"" he said.

Amid the partisan crossfire, President Obama met with House Democratic leadership Tuesday afternoon.

(CNN) - A Congressional seat from Louisiana will remain in Republican hands - although that was never in question.

With 99% of the vote in, the state's Secretary of State announced a winner in a special election for Louisiana's 5th district that pitted Republican against Republican.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

With 60% of the vote, Vance McAllister, a 39-year old businessman and political newcomer, defeated state Sen. Neil Riser, who lost with 40%.

The election was a run-off after an October 19 open primary with more than a dozen candidates, where Riser and McAllister finished in first and second place, at 32% and 18%, respectively.

Both men ran on strong anti-liberal, anti-Washington platforms, including vows to repeal Obamacare.

""A self-made businessman and Louisiana native, Vance’s priorities of fiscal responsibility and accountability will be an excellent addition to Louisiana’s delegation here in Washington,"" said National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Greg Walden, R-Oregon, in a statement.

""I look forward to working with Vance as we fight back against ObamaCare and this Administration’s expensive, big-government, tax and spend policies.”

The seat was vacated by six-term Congressman Rodney Alexander. This summer, Alexander announced he would not run for reelection in 2014, only to bump up his departure and resign effective September 27. He has since joined Gov. Bobby Jindal's administration as the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Veterans Affairs.

""It is clear that the people of the Fifth Congressional District rejected the extreme policies of the state and national Democrat party. Once again, the voters of the Fifth Congressional District have decided to send a conservative Republican to represent them in the nation's capitol,"" said Louisiana Republican Party Chair Roger Villere in a statement.

""Mary Landrieu should take special notice of the results of this election. This race proves that Louisianians want leaders who will shake up the liberal establishment in Washington.""

Then he raised Ted Cruz–one of the most brilliant constitutional lawyers ever to serve in the Senate–the new 41-year old Hispanic senator from Texas.

Cameron added, “But Cruz was born in Canada and is constitutionally ineligible” to run for president. While many people assume that, it’s probably not true.

Cameron was referring to the Constitution’s Article II requirement that only a “natural born citizen” can run for the White House.

No one is certain what that means. Citizenship was primarily defined by each state when the Constitution was adopted. Federal citizenship wasn’t clearly established until the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified in 1868. The Constitution is not clear whether it means you must be born on U.S. soil, or instead whether you must be born a U.S. citizen.

Cruz was born in Canada, but his mother was a lifelong American, born in Delaware. (His father was a political refugee from Cuba.) So under federal law, Cruz was born an American citizen by virtue of his mother. His family moved back to Texas, where Cruz grew up, and lived his entire life except the years he spent in New Jersey attending Princeton, Massachusetts attending Harvard Law School, and Washington, D.C., clerking for Chief Justice William Rehnquist at the Supreme Court and later serving in the Bush administration. So this former Texas solicitor general was born an American citizen and has spent almost all his life in America–usually serving his state or nation.

It would be better to report, “Some constitutional experts say he would be ineligible,” or more accurate still, “A small minority of constitutional experts say he would be ineligible.” But no one can make the unqualified claim that the Constitution declares Ted Cruz is unable to run for president.

There’s never been a court case to decide this issue, and there are only a few law review articles written by professors. The only professor I know of who thinks Cruz in ineligible to run for president also said John McCain was ineligible to run for president because he was born on a U.S. Navy base in Panama. I don’t recall any media outlet reporting John McCain was ineligible to be president.

The most likely meaning of the national-born clause is that you must have been an American citizen at birth, so that you would not have greater loyalty to some foreign nation. Cruz was born an American citizen, and has spent most of his life serving this nation with unabashed patriotism.

If Cruz runs for the White House, then one of his opponents in the primary would have standing to sue in federal court to argue Cruz is ineligible. But the smart money would be on a court agreeing that Cruz is as eligible as anyone else who was born an American citizen.

Actually being a Republican governor of a Democratic state doesn't guarantee victory

As every good subscriber to conventional wisdom knows, when New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie won his overwhelming reelection victory over an underfunded and little-known opponent, he essentially became president-elect. Why? Because as everybody with at least a surface appreciation of politics knows, New Jersey hasn't voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1984 and Christie is a Republican governor in a blue state.

Of course, even on election day there was one little problem with that theory: According to exit polls, the same voters that gave Christie his enormous win would have voted for Hillary Clinton if they had been voting for president and the choice had been between Christie and Hillary.

And now a new NBC News poll shows that Christie has the same problem nationally as he does in New Jersey—and that even at the apex of his popularity, he faces considerable skepticism within the Republican Party.



The poll finds Clinton getting the support of 44 percent of all adults in a hypothetical match up against the New Jersey governor, who gets 34 percent.

The poll shows Hillary leading among African Americans, young people, and Latinos, while Christie leads among whites and upper-income voters, suggesting that for all the hype about Christie being a new kind of Republican, people still see him as a regular old member of the GOP.

But Chris Christie's problem isn't just that he trails Hillary, it's that he's not a lock to to win the GOP nomination.



According to the poll, 32% of Republican and Republican-leaning respondents say they would vote for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in a GOP presidential primary, while 31% prefer another Republican candidate (never mind the other third who are undecided, so together 68% of GOPers are not on board with Christie).

Hillary Clinton's situation is the opposite: Two-thirds of Democrats say they want her to be their party's nominee. Between that and the fact that she leads Christie by 10 points, please excuse the gag-reflex when pundits express the conventional view of Chris Christie's invincibility."
http://news.yahoo.com/obama-fundraiser-calls-gop-impediment-042548707--politics.html,,[],"Obama, at fundraiser, calls GOP an 'impediment'","SEATTLE (AP) — President Barack Obama sounded a nostalgic personal note Sunday night and offered a rare self-assessment while criticizing congressional Republicans as an ""impediment"" to governing during the start of a West Coast fundraising tour for the Democratic Party.

Obama told donors the sight of Mt. Rainier illuminated by a setting sun was particularly special because it reminded him of his mother, who attended high school in the Seattle area. ""I feel the spirit of my mom,"" he said.

He also attempted to contrast himself with Republicans who control the House of Representatives, saying they are ""more focused on positioning themselves for the next election.""

""I'm not a particularly ideological person,"" he said, adding he still is passionate about giving people a fair shake, about the environment, and working for peace and national security. ""But I'm pretty pragmatic about how we get there.""

Money, star power and Hollywood awaited the president on this trip, which featured a bit of official business, but mostly fundraising for a Democratic Party eager to go on offense after a politically debilitating two months.

Obama arrived Sunday evening in Seattle. He also planned stops in San Francisco and Los Angeles, raising money for House and Senate Democrats as well as the national party.

High-profile events on the schedule include a reception at the home of retired basketball star Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson and his wife, Cookie, in Beverly Hills, Calif., and one at the house of Marta Kauffman, co-creator of television's ""Friends.""

Accompanied by House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California, Obama attended a reception and dinner Sunday at the home of former Microsoft executive Jon Shirley.

Though he professed he was not looking for the defeat of another party, he said the country needs Pelosi to be House speaker again.

The money raised — $32,400 per couple — went to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which benefits House Democrats.

Story continues

""In the year before an election like this, I think the most tangible way that an incumbent president of either party, frankly, can benefit his party's prospects in congressional races is to try to help them raise money,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said earlier. ""And I would anticipate that the president's efforts on that front will continue into next year.""

The trip comes as Obama's health care law approaches a crucial Nov. 30 deadline for an improved insurance enrollment website whose catastrophic start Oct. 1 dealt a serious political blow to the White House. Also, the U.S. and other world powers just sealed a historic deal with Iran for a temporary freeze of its nuclear program.

In addition to a half-dozen fundraisers, Obama intended to use the trip to keep the heat on Congress to pass an overhaul of immigration laws. He planned to address that issue during a stop Monday at a Chinese recreation center in San Francisco, and to promote his economic agenda Tuesday at the DreamWorks Animation studio in Glendale, Calif.

In recent days White House officials have tried to draw attention back to the economy to avoid getting bogged down by the botched launch of the health care enrollment.

Lately, Obama has devoted time to raising money for the party, helping the Democratic National Committee reduce a massive 2012 debt and build up cash for House and Senate Democratic Committees.

The White House has been especially attentive to Senate Democrats to ensure that the party retains its majority in the chamber. The House is controlled by the Republican Party.

In addition to the dinner at Shirley's home, Obama also attended a Democratic National Committee event Sunday at the home of Tom Campion, co-founder of the clothing chain Zumiez. Unlike the dinner at Shirley's house, reporters were not permitted into the fundraiser.

The event attracted about 30 donors, the DNC said. Tickets also were $32,400 per couple, according to an invitation."

Obama will make the announcement at 12:10 p.m. in the East Room. McDonough, who is currently Obama's deputy national security adviser, will replace Jack Lew, who the president has tapped to be his Treasury secretary.

In a statement, the official described McDonough as one of Obama's ""closest and most trusted advisors for nearly a decade, dating back to when he helped set up then Senator Barack Obama’s Senator office."" The official also praised McDonough's role on Obama's national security team, and his experience in working with Congress:

Denis has played a key role in all of the major national security decisions--from ending the war in Iraq to winding down the war in Afghanistan; from our response to natural disasters in Haiti and Japan; to the repeal of ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.' As a veteran of Capitol Hill, Denis understands the importance of reaching across the aisle to make progress for the American people--whether it’s on jobs and economy, health care or education, reducing the deficit or addressing climate change.



Later Friday, the White House will also announce nine aides taking new positions at senior levels at the White House. Here is a breakdown of their new roles:

Rob Nabors - Assistant to the president and deputy white house chief of staff for policy

Dan Pfeiffer – Assistant to the president and senior adviser

Jennifer Palmieri – Assistant to the president and communications director

Tony Blinken – Assistant to the president and deputy national security adviser

Danielle Gray – Assistant to the president and cabinet secretary

Katy Kale – Assistant to the president for management and administration

Lisa Monaco – Assistant to the president and deputy national security adviser for homeland security and counterterrorism (upon confirmation of John Brennan as DCIA)

Miguel Rodriguez – Assistant to the president and director of legislative affairs

Michele Bachmann opting against a reelection bid, the Democrat who nearly unseated her last November and was gunning for her again is now out of the race too.

Jim Graves, a St. Cloud businessman, told the local website MinnPost that with the polarizing conservative choosing not to run -- perhaps out of fear she might lose -- his feeling was “mission accomplished.”

“She wasn’t representing the people of the 6th District appropriately, and now she won’t be representing them. There’s no way anyone could run and win who would be worse than Michele Bachmann. So we accomplished that task,” he said.

That’s a turnaround from Wednesday, when he told the Los Angeles Times in an interview that he still intended to run. “It’s a very winnable race against anybody,” he said then. “We weren’t really running against Michele Bachmann as much as we were running for the people in the district and the country. And we’re going to continue that same approach.”

Minnesota’s 6th District is the most Republican of the state’s eight congressional districts, but Graves came within just 4,200 votes of defeating Bachmann last November. Political handicappers viewed her exit as good news for the Republicans because a new candidate would run without the same baggage.

Graves said Wednesday that he thought a wide-open Republican primary, though, would lead candidates to run hard to the right, leaving an opening for him with moderate Republicans and independent voters.

He told MinnPost Thursday night that his decision now to drop out was shaped by conversations with family and friends, and the realization that support from national Democrats and liberal groups would be less likely without Bachmann.

“I was just the guy who was running against her,” he said. “I’m humble enough to realize that.”

An official announcement from Graves was to come later Friday.

Winning Republican-leaning seats like the Minnesota 6th is a necessity, though, if Democrats are to pick up the 17 seats needed to win back control of the House of Representatives. In part because of a redistricting process that favored the GOP in most states, there are few Republicans sitting in centrist or Democratic-leaning seats for the party to target.

The House and Senate adjourned for the day shortly after the incident as the shutdown extended into a third day.

Along with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader, Mr. Boehner has long dismissed the idea that Congress would not act to prevent a damaging default, and President Obama on Thursday called a default “the height of irresponsibility.” But the failure of the House and Senate to reach a deal ahead of the shutdown has raised questions of whether Republicans could be persuaded to join in raising the debt limit before the Treasury Department runs out of money about the middle of October.

His comments were read by members of both parties as renewing his determination on the default and came as the Treasury warned that an impasse over raising the debt limit might prove catastrophic and potentially result “in a financial crisis and recession that could echo the events of 2008 or worse.”

Lawmakers said that in recent days, Mr. Boehner, who is under fierce attack from Democrats over his handling of the shutdown, has made clear that he is willing to use a combination of Republican and Democratic votes on the debt limit if need be. Representative Leonard Lance of New Jersey, one of the moderate Republicans who met privately with Mr. Boehner on Wednesday, would not provide details of the meeting, but said, “The speaker of the House does not want to default on the debt on the United States, and I believe he believes in Congress as an institution, and I certainly believe he is working for the best interests of the American people.”

One lawmaker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Boehner suggested he would be willing to violate the so-called Hastert Rule to pass a debt-limit increase. The informal rule refers to a policy of not bringing to the floor any measure that does not have a majority of Republican votes."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/26/Karl-Rove-s-Crossroads-Reloading-Against-Tea-Party,2013-12-26 00:00:00,['Tony Lee'],Karl Rove's Crossroads Reloading Against Tea Party,"Even though Karl Rove’s American Crossroads brand has been damaged after the group declared war against conservative candidates, the group will reportedly try to influence the 2014 midterm elections by bullying campaigns and creating groups that, on the surface, do not seem to be affiliated with them.

According to the New York Times, Crossroads “appears to be testing” its “new approach” in Kentucky. The Conservative Victory Project, the group formed to take on conservative candidates, has stayed out of Kentucky’s Senate primary between Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Tea Party challenger Matt Bevin. Instead, a group called “Kentuckians for Strong Leadership” is curiously backing McConnell while getting most of its cash from Crossroads donors. It is “legally separate from Crossroads;” but Stephen Law, the president of Crossroads, sits on its board, and the two groups share a treasurer.

Crossroads may set up “similar groups in races in which its brand may be less appealing to voters or donors.” The Times notes that this is an approach Crossroads may have to take because Rove’s organization has been so tarnished among the conservative base that candidates fear donors will not contribute to any group associated with him.

In other races, Crossroads has been threatening Senate candidates, saying the group and its affiliates will not support them if they accept support from other super PACs. According to the Times, Law warned a Republican West Virginia Senate candidate (Rep. Shelly Moore Capito) that if her campaign formed its own super PAC, Crossroads would not offer it support.

Other Republicans said they were “unwilling to let Mr. Rove and his colleagues decide which Senate candidates get the most support.” “You don’t want someone playing God above you saying, ‘You don’t need any more money in your race. You can win by a few less points,'” a Republican told the Times.

Crossroads and its affiliated groups spent nearly $450 million during the 2012 election cycle with no wins to show for it. Law said the group had good financial controls in place so that its money is not wasted."

http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/new-rove-group-could-backfire-on-g-o-p/,2013-02-11 00:00:00,['Nate Silver'],New Rove Group Could Backfire on G.O.P.,"The strategist Karl Rove and his allies last week announced the formation of Conservative Victory Project, a new “super PAC” designed to lend support to what they see as more electable candidates in Republican Senate primaries.

The effort makes plenty of sense on the surface. Republican primary voters nominated a series of inexperienced and extremely conservative candidates in Senate races in 2010 and 2012, often with the support of the Tea Party and other insurgent groups. It can be argued that they lost as many as a half-dozen Senate races as a result, including the contests in Delaware and Nevada in 2010 and in Missouri and Indiana last year.

But conservative groups and activists have reacted very harshly to the announcement, while some conservative candidates who are potential targets of the group, like Representative Steve King of Iowa, have already sought to raise money off the backlash to it.

An analysis of Republican Senate primaries in 2010 and 2012 suggests that money is usually the least pressing problem for the incumbents and other establishment-backed candidates whom Mr. Rove’s group might be inclined to support. Instead, some insurgent candidates won their races despite having been at more than a 10-to-1 fund-raising disadvantage heading into the primary.

The table below reflects 23 Senate races between 2010 and 2012 in which an establishment-backed candidate squared off against an insurgent candidate in a Republican Senate primary. There are some judgment calls required in selecting the races, particularly because the Tea Party consists of no one single group but instead an informal network of organizations that tend to back highly conservative candidates. In other cases, some candidates, like former Representative Pat Toomey in the Pennsylvania Senate primary in 2010, tended to be supported by both Tea Party and establishment groups; these instances are excluded. The list includes a number of relatively obscure candidates. I do require, however, that the candidates listed were viable enough to have filed at least one fund-raising report with the Federal Election Commission.

Photo

These issues aside, the overall message from the data should be reasonably clear. The establishment candidates substantially outraised the insurgents, by an average of $4.3 million to $1.2 million based on the last Federal Election Commission reports that the candidates filed in advance of the primary. (The difference in median fund-raising totals, which reduces the influence of outliers, is just as substantial: about $3 million for the establishment candidates versus about $400,000 for the insurgents.)

And yet, the insurgent candidates won 11 of 23 races, or nearly half the contests. Joe Miller of Alaska did so in 2010 despite being at nearly a 20-to-1 fund-raising disadvantage against the incumbent Lisa Murkowski. Christine O’Donnell of Delaware defeated Representative Mike Castle that year despite having raised about $260,000 to Mr. Castle’s $3.2 million.

Does that mean there is literally no benefit to having more money in a Republican primary? Not exactly; as the chart below suggests, there is a modest but positive correlation between the share of the funds that went to the establishment candidate and that candidate’s margin of victory or defeat.

Photo

However, the relationship is much weaker than it is in general elections for the Senate, when fund-raising totals have about twice as much power to predict the margin between the Democratic and Republican candidates. (The chart below reflects all Senate general elections between 1990 and 2010 in which both the Democratic and Republican candidate were viable enough to have filed at least one F.E.C. report.)

Photo

Moreover, it is not clear that the correlation implies a strong causal link. Better fund-raising totals can serve as evidence that a campaign is well-organized, or has more grass roots support, which are indicators of candidate strength regardless of how the candidate actually deploys her financial resources. But if a superPAC spends a large sum in support of a candidate — or a candidate makes a large contribution to her own campaign — that money may not go far if the candidate is otherwise having a difficult time persuading voters of her merits. (Largely self-funded candidates, such as Linda McMahon of Connecticut and Carly Fiorina of California, have poor track records in recent years despite having gargantuan budgets.)

This may hold especially true in Senate primaries because they usually feature very light turnouts. (Ms. O’Donnell’s win over Mr. Castle in 2010, for example, came with a turnout of only about 58,000 voters in Delaware, representing about 30 percent of Delaware’s population of registered Republicans and less than 10 percent of Delaware registered voters of all parties.) The voters who do turn out in Republican Senate primaries are likely to be highly informed consumers of conservative-friendly news media outlets such as talk radio, prime-time shows on Fox News and conservative magazines and blogs. They may also weigh the endorsements of prominent conservative politicians and organizations. An insurgent candidate who is presented in a favorable light in these outlets may have plenty of ability to reach her target voters, even if she is spending little or nothing on paid advertisements and outreach efforts.

Mr. Rove’s efforts could backfire, therefore, if they result in the insurgent candidate receiving more sympathetic treatment through these channels; the amount of so-called “earned media” that the insurgent receives could outweigh the extra advertisements that the establishment candidate is able to afford.

A related problem is that the insurgent candidates could seek to raise money directly in response to moves by Conservative Victory Project, as Mr. King of Iowa is attempting to do. This could be the case especially when insurgent candidates were otherwise having trouble raising funds.

My analysis of fund-raising data, in this context and others, has found that it is generally the proportion or ratio of funds raised by each candidate that has the most power to predict races, rather than the absolute amounts. This is a consequence of the diminishing returns of campaign spending: the first $100,000 of spending goes a lot further in establishing a candidate’s viability than the marginal $100,000 after she has already spent $5 million.

Suppose, for example, that the establishment candidate has raised $3 million and the insurgent candidate $500,000, a six-to-one advantage for the establishment candidate. Mr. Rove’s group intervenes and contributes $1 million to the establishment candidate, bringing him to $4 million total. In response, the insurgent candidate raises $500,000 through grass roots groups, bringing her to $1 million total. Despite the absolute difference between the candidates’ fund-raising totals having increased, the ratio has declined to a four-to-one advantage for the establishment candidate from six-to-one previously, arguably leaving the insurgent candidate in better shape than before the fund-raising salvos.

The intuition is simply that it may be dangerous to raise the profile of an insurgent candidate for whom a little extra money and exposure could go a long way.

Where might Mr. Rove’s efforts be more likely to achieve their desired goals? One case would be in multiple-candidate primaries where there are two or more establishment-backed candidates running against one insurgent. This eventuality has come up quite frequently in recent years, such as in the Nevada primary in 2010 and the Missouri primary last year, when the insurgent candidate was able to win with 40 percent or less of the vote. By directing money to one of the establishment candidates at the expense of the other, Mr. Rove’s group could force the insurgent candidate to win an actual or near-majority of vote rather than a mere plurality.

The money raised by Mr. Rove’s group might also be more likely to help candidates if it is directed toward functions other than advertising which have a lower public profile, although coordination rules related to super PACs can limit such efforts.

But the money may be less likely to help if Mr. Rove’s group hopes to save struggling candidates through a barrage of advertisements late in the race. Republican voters have already been rejecting these candidates despite their overwhelming advantage in paid media placements, and often because they are viewed as too much a part of the Washington establishment. It will take more than a new super PAC for Mr. Rove to earn back their trust.

An earlier version of this post referred imprecisely to the support a candidate receives from a PAC. While the political action committees can raise and spend money on behalf of a candidate, the candidate does not add the money directly to his or her campaign coffers."

He Died On June']",Charles Krauthammer: A new strategy for the GOP,"It has become conventional wisdom that Republicans are suffering an internal split that President Obama is successfully exploiting to neuter the Republican House. It is not true, however, that the Republican split is philosophical and fundamental. And that a hopelessly divided GOP is therefore headed for decline, perhaps irrelevance.

In fact, the split is tactical, not philosophical; short-term, not fundamental. And therefore quite solvable.

How do we know? Simple thought experiment: Imagine that we had a Republican president. Would the party be deeply divided over policy, at war with itself in Congress? Not at all. It would be rallying around something like the Paul Ryan budget that twice passed the House with near 100 percent GOP unanimity.

In reality, Republicans have a broad consensus on what they believe, where they want to go and the program to get them there. But they don’t have the power. What divides Republicans today is a straightforward tactical question: Can you govern from one house of Congress? Should you even try?

Can you shrink government, restrain spending, bring a modicum of fiscal sanity to the country when the president and a blocking Senate have no intention of doing so?

One faction feels committed to try. It wishes to carry out its small-government electoral promises and will cast no vote inconsistent with that philosophy. These are the House Republicans who voted no on the “fiscal cliff” deal because it raised taxes without touching spending. Indeed, it increased spending with its crazy-quilt crony-capitalist tax ”credits” — for wind power and other indulgences.

They were willing to risk the fiscal cliff. Today they are willing to risk a breach of the debt ceiling and even a government shutdown rather than collaborate with Obama’s tax-and-spend second-term agenda.

The other view is that you cannot govern from the House. The reason Ryan and John Boehner finally voted yes on the lousy fiscal-cliff deal is that by then there was nowhere else to go. Republicans could not afford to bear the blame (however unfair) for a $4.5 trillion across-the-board tax hike and a Pentagon hollowed out by sequester.

The party establishment is coming around to the view that if you try to govern from one house — e.g., force spending cuts with cliffhanging brinkmanship — you lose. You not only don’t get the cuts. You get the blame for rattled markets and economic uncertainty. You get humiliated by having to cave in the end. And you get opinion polls ranking you below head lice and colonoscopies in popularity.

There is history here. The Gingrich Revolution ran aground when it tried to govern from Congress, losing badly to President Clinton over government shutdowns. Nor did the modern insurgents do any better in the 2011 debt-ceiling and 2012 fiscal-cliff showdowns with Obama.

Obama’s postelection arrogance and intransigence can put you in a fighting mood. I sympathize. But I’m tending toward the realist view: Don’t force the issue when you don’t have the power.

The debt-ceiling deadline is coming up. You can demand commensurate spending cuts, the usual, reasonable Republican offer. But you won’t get them. Obama will hold out. And, at the eleventh hour, you will have to give in as you get universally blamed for market gyrations and threatened credit downgrades.

The more prudent course would be to find some offer that cannot be refused, a short-term trade-off utterly unassailable and straightforward. For example, offer to extend the debt ceiling through, say, May 1, in exchange for the Senate delivering a budget by that date — after four years of lawlessly refusing to produce one.

Not much. But it would (a) highlight the Democrats’ fiscal recklessness, (b) force Senate Democrats to make public their fiscal choices and (c) keep the debt ceiling alive as an ongoing pressure point for future incremental demands.

Republicans should develop a list of such conditions — some symbolic, some substantive — in return for sequential, short-term raising of the debt ceiling. But the key is: Go small and simple. Forget about forcing tax reform or entitlement cuts or anything major. If Obama wants to recklessly expand government, well, as he says, he won the election.

Republicans should simply block what they can. Further tax hikes, for example. The general rule is: From a single house of Congress you can resist but you cannot impose.

Aren’t you failing the country, say the insurgents? Answer: The country chose Obama. He gets four years.

Want to save the Republic? Win the next election. Don’t immolate yourself trying to save liberalism from itself. If your conservative philosophy is indeed right, winning will come. As Margaret Thatcher said serenely of the Labor Party socialists she later overthrew: “They always run out of other people’s money.”

Well, his half-comeback. His halfback?","Restless, a little wistful and sharply critical of President Barack Obama's second term, Mr. Romney said in an interview that he plans to re-emerge in ways that will ""help shape national priorities.""

As a first step, the former Republican presidential nominee plans to welcome 200 friends and supporters to a three-day summit next week that he will host at a Utah mountain resort. He is considering writing a book and a series of opinion pieces, and has plans to campaign for 2014 candidates.

There is so much gold in this Wall Street Journal article about Mitt Romney's future plans that I am already giddy with anticipation His first priority is apparently going to be selling Utah timeshares—I mean, bringing his friends together for a few days of privately talking about stuff. Then it will be on to Having Opinions In Public.The WSJ report says the Utah Friends o' Romney Summit and Failure Emporium will be ""splashy, expensive, and closed to outsiders and the press,"" which makes it sound a bit like either a Roman orgy or a Gatsby shindig. I look forward to hearing nothing of substance about it. (If you don't think Mitt's team will be confiscating everything that even looks like a camera and throwing them all into the fires of Mt. Doom before the event begins, oh my—you and I may have a wager to make. I'm not sure they'll allow pencils.)

But don't even tempt us with the possibility of a Mitt Romney book tour. No. Watching Mitt Romney do the talk show rounds to promote a hip new policy prescription for America would be too fine a thing to ask for. Mitt's already offering great, great advice—like how the GOP needs to ""translate our message in a way that minorities understand."" (These new efforts to ""translate"" their message to minorities so far seem to be based on the usual way people attempt to communicate with ethnic people who don't seem to understand them: Say the same thing, but talk LOUDER.)

His Utah event, though, really shows just how much ol' Mitt has his finger on the pulse of Regular Guy America:



The retreat will offer some unusual extracurriculars: Skeet shooting with Mr. Ryan; golfing with Mr. Paul; horseback riding with Mitt and Ann Romney; hiking with Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman.

Oh dear Lord, thank you for this sweet bounty. ""Hiking with Meg Whitman"" should be the title of Mitt's book. Just throwing that out there."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/03/27/SarahPAC-Video-Rallies-Independents-and-Tea-Partiers-For-2014-Elections,2013-03-27 00:00:00,['Tony Lee'],Palin Reloads for 2014 Elections with SarahPAC Video,"In a sign of how active Sarah Palin intends to be in influencing the 2014 elections, SarahPAC, Sarah Palin’s Political Action Committee, released a video on Wednesday meant to ignite independents, conservatives, and Tea Partiers for the 2014 midterm elections. These voters propelled Republican candidates in the historic 2010 midterm elections that saw Republicans take back the House of Representatives on the backs of Tea Party voters.

Titled “Loaded for Bear,” the video shows footage and headlines from mainstream media outlets like Politico referring to Palin as a “kingmaker” and conservative outlets like Fox News acknowledging how successfully Palin has used her star-power to help elect conservative candidates to office.

The video also features Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) praising Palin for her fearlessness and being instrumental in electing senators such as Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Pat Toomey, Jeff Flake, Deb Fischer, Cruz and governors like Nikki Haley of South Carolina.

In 2012, former South Carolina Senator and current president of the Heritage Foundation Jim DeMint said Palin’s endorsement “has more influence in primaries than any other endorsement right now.”

“Sarah Palin picks winners,” Cruz says in the video.

And by all measures, that dynamic will not change in the next two years for Palin is often a one-woman clearinghouse for conservative and Tea Party candidates.

The video, which the group PassCodeCreative made, features Palin at Tea Party rallies in places like Nevada and at the Iowa State Fair in 2011, where she impressed Iowans, liberals and the mainstream media by answering nearly every question asked of her and engaging comfortably with nearly everyone who approached her for nearly six hours.

In the video, footage of Palin’s 2013 CPAC speech is shown where Palin says, “Don’t let the the big consultants, the big money men and the big bad media scare you off” from running for office.

She urges Republicans to focus more on “rebuilding the middle class” than rebranding the party and says “it is time to furlough the consultants.”

Palin also speaks about her signature issue of dismantling the permanent political class and fighting crony capitalism. She urges Republicans look for candidates from Main Street communities, PTA meetings, small businesses and Tea Party rallies.

“SarahPAC supporters – the 2014 elections are just twenty months away. We appreciate your support, together we have elected many great commonsense conservatives over the past four years,” SarahPAC Treasurer Tim Crawford says in a statement posted with the video. “Together, we will keep fighting to support these bold candidates.”

Reporters in the video note only “Sarah Palin will hold Congress to account,” that Palin “plays by her own rules,” and Palin “doesn’t care about old dogs” in the GOP. These are the qualities that make Tea Partiers, conservatives, and independents trust Palin.

The video notes that there are 35 Senate and 36 Governors races in 2014 and ends with a clip of Ted Cruz saying at CPAC, “I would not be in the U.S. Senate today if it were not for Gov. Sarah Palin.”

The words “We Haven’t Yet Begun to Fight” splash across the screen as SarahPAC’s signature bear roars at the end of the video."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/29/Harvard-Prof-Tea-Party-Not-Going-Anywhere-More-Likely-to-Win,2013-12-29 00:00:00,['Tony Lee'],"Harvard Prof: Tea Party Not Going Anywhere, More Likely to Win","A government and sociology professor at Harvard writes that the Tea Party is more likely than not to “win in the end” in an age when Americans are becoming more removed from Washington and distrusting the federal government and their elected officials.

“Tea Party forces will still win in the end,” Theda Skocpol writes, unless moderate Republicans can defeat them. Skocpol concedes that the Tea Party “will triumph just by hanging on long enough” as Americans are getting fed up by “our blatantly manipulated democracy and our permanently hobbled government.”

The article, “Why The Tea Party Isn’t Going Anywhere,” was first published in the journal Democracy, and later reprinted in The Atlantic.

Despite the fact that Democrats, the mainstream media, and the Republican establishment again were predicting the “demise of the Tea Party” immediately after the government shutdown ended, Skocpol doesn’t believe so.

“But we have heard all this before,” she writes. “The Tea Party’s hold on the GOP persists beyond each burial ceremony.”

Skocpol and Vanessa Williamson published a book in 2011 that “showed how bottom-up and top-down forces intersect to give the Tea Party both leverage over the Republican Party and the clout to push national politics sharply to the right.”

“At the grassroots, volunteer activists formed hundreds of local Tea Parties, meeting regularly to plot public protests against the Obama Administration and place steady pressure on GOP organizations and candidates at all levels,” they found. “At least half of all GOP voters sympathize with this Tea Party upsurge.”

Though Skokpol and Williamson have their typical biases and describe the Tea Party movement as a “radical” one that may not like minorities–without any evidence of that assertion–they acknowledge that “even though there is no one center of Tea Party authority–indeed, in some ways because there is no one organized center–the entire gaggle of grassroots” and outside groups that support the movement “wields money and primary votes to exert powerful pressure on Republican officeholders and candidates.”

Skocpol observes that the “Tea Party clout has grown in Washington and state capitals” because “Americans are also losing ever more faith in the federal government.” In addition, “most legislators and candidates are Nervous Nellies,” and they have seen the Tea Party defeat establishment Republicans like Charlie Crist in Florida in 2010 and David Dewhurst in Texas in 2012 in addition to knocking off incumbent Republican Sens. Bob Bennett (R-UT) and Richard Lugar (R-IN).

“That grabs legislators’ attention and results in either enthusiastic support for, or acquiescence to, obstructive tactics,” Skocpol writes.

She writes how powerfully someone like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) resonates with the Tea Party. She noted that he was able to direct House Republicans to pressure House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) to demand that President Barack Obama and Democrats fund the government except for Obamacare.

Skocpol notes that it will not be easy to defeat the Tea Party.

“For one, at least three successive national election defeats will be necessary to even begin to break the determination and leverage of Tea Party adherents,” Skocpol writes. She concedes that Tea Partiers will not “stand down easily or very soon.”

Skocpol notes “moderate Republicans” do not have as much power in Washington or in state capitals and points to Cruz as being “very well positioned to garner unified Tea Party support in the 2016 GOP presidential primaries.” The Chamber of Commerce will reportedly spend $50 million to wage war against the Tea Party, along with Karl Rove’s American Crossroads; Skocpol believes unless those groups defeat the Tea Party, it may well win many permanent victories.

“During the last election cycle, no far-right candidate ever consolidated sustained grassroots Tea Party support, as those voters hopped from Rick Perry to Herman Cain to Newt Gingrich to Rick Santorum,” Skocpol writes. “But this time, Cruz may very well enjoy unified and enthusiastic grassroots Tea Party support from the beginning of the primary election season.”

Skocpol also sends a warning to Democrats who think that the Tea Party will fade because of a few bad polls.

“Once the October 2013 shutdown ended in supposed total victory for President Obama and his party, many Democrats adopted a cocky swagger and started talking about ousting the House GOP in 2014,” Skocpol writes. However, she warns that “a clear-eyed look shows that Tea Party remains powerful and has achieved victories that continue to stymie” Democrats and their statist agenda."

Rozell', 'Posted Felixkeverich', 'Posted Bagehot', 'Posted Sanity-Monger', 'Posted Coindependent', 'Posted Yooper', 'Posted Vulturetx', 'Posted Sayhey', 'Posted Ga_Chris']",Right-wing talk shows turned White House blue,"Talk isn’t cheap, as Republicans have learned. The conservative talk show culture is proving expensive for GOP presidential hopefuls.

Since Rush Limbaugh’s 1992 bestseller “The Way Things Ought to Be,” his conservative talk show politics have dominated GOP presidential discourse – and the Republicans’ White House fortunes have plummeted. But when the mainstream media reigned supreme, between 1952 and 1988, Republicans won seven out of the 10 presidential elections.

Conservative talk show hosts and Fox News blame the “lamestream” national media’s “liberal bias” for the GOP’s poor showing since 1992. Yet the rise of the conservative-dominated media defines the era when the fortunes of GOP presidential hopefuls dropped to the worst levels since the party’s founding in 1856.

It was when most Americans got most of their information from network news programs, which took their lead from what conservatives labeled “liberal” newspapers, that the GOP held the White House. Yet the right regularly accused the mainstream news media of colluding to turn the public against conservative nominees.

Is it all a coincidence that Democrats’ fortunes reversed as Limbaugh and his imitators gained influence?

Despite Limbaugh’s ridicule, in 1992, Bill Clinton won more electoral votes than any Democratic challenger in 60 years. In the previous six presidential elections (1968-1988), the Republicans had won five times – all but one by an electoral landslide. Since conservative media began to flourish, only once (2004) has the GOP candidate captured more than 50 percent of the popular vote. And that candidate, President George W. Bush, had the lowest re-election results of any conservative chief executive in U.S. history.

On the other hand, between 1996 and 2008, with conservative media ascendant, four different Democratic standard-bearers in successive elections – Clinton, Al Gore, John Kerry and Barack Obama – combined for a majority of the popular vote. Democratic nominees had never enjoyed this level of serial success. In 2012, Obama won re-election in a second majority-vote victory – the first Democrat to do so since Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Coincidence again?

“Some things are just too coincidental to be a coincidence,” as Yogi Berra once said. The famed Yankee catcher offers insight into why the new media pitch contributes to the GOP striking out.

Network news sought a mass audience, unlike the niche-programming of today’s cable and radio talk shows. So the network news philosophy focused on fact-based reporting, homogenized for the broadest possible audience – not opinion, which could prove divisive, driving away some potential viewers.

The GOP’s “rally ’round the flag” Cold War anti-communist conservatism was similarly based on a nationalizing formula. So the network economic model and the Republican political equation were a perfect fit.

When the Cold War ended with the Soviet Union’s collapse, the Republican formula lost its philosophic basis. Is it just another coincidence that the GOP’s best showing since the collapse of Cold War conservatism was when Bush could use a nationalizing theme – the threat of terrorism – to win the Republicans’ only recent popular vote majority?

The conservative talk show culture has contributed to today’s new-media fragmentation, which has been so detrimental to GOP presidential hopes. Why is this happening? It’s all about free-market economics.

The more strident and doctrinaire a talk show, the bigger the financial rewards can be for host and sponsor. Programs prosper by capturing a small but deeply loyal slice of the mass audience. This economic model would have decimated national network news in its heyday – as we can now see.

The conservative media powers blame GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney’s defeat on his inability to rally conservative groups. They claim he failed to focus on their issues. However, in championing the niche special-interest groups over a broader national prism, conservative talk show hosts are fragmenting the electorate

This has never been an effective strategy for Republicans. It is Democrats who have been more successful with it, as Roosevelt proved with his New Deal coalition.

Contrary to talk show revisionist history, the “mainstream media” proved the GOP’s best friend for several generations. ABC, CBS and NBC Nightly News worked for GOP presidential candidates – convincing voters to see elections through a wide prism.

Conservatives delighting at the influence of their favorite talk show hosts and the decline of the mainstream media have missed this crucial modern political lesson: The GOP fared best in presidential politics through a nationalizing lens – not narrow-based ideological appeals.

Now, it could all be a coincidence; Yogi could be wrong. After all, he still claims to have tagged out Dodger legend Jackie Robinson, despite the umpire’s saying No. 42 had stolen home on his Hall of Fame rival in one of baseball’s immortal moments, in Game 1 of the 1955 World Series at Yankee Stadium.

He Left The Post In April']",Welcome to the Hillary Rodham Clinton presidential speculation sweepstakes,"There’s a super PAC to support her and one that’s trying, at least in part, to stop her. Every word she utters is parsed by cable TV, blogs and anyone with a political pulse for indications of which way she is leaning. And, there are still 922 days between now and Jan. 1, 2016.

Welcome to the Hillary Rodham Clinton presidential speculation sweepstakes, a process that not only has begun earlier than it did before Clinton ran for president in 2008 but also is significantly more well developed — on both sides of the equation.

“It did start earlier this time around,” said Brian Wolff, a longtime senior aide to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). “You have the confluence of her being the anointed nominee [and] Obama supporters’ overwhelming support for her.”

Already there is Ready for Hillary, a super PAC designed to prime the pump for a Clinton presidential bid that has among its supporters longtime Clinton confidant Harold Ickes and even Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), a strong backer of Sen. Barack Obama in the 2008 primary fight.

And just last week, America Rising, a conservative-aligned super PAC, launched Stop Hillary 2016, a Web site designed to raise money for its efforts to “prevent Americans from ever having to see another Clinton in the White House.”

At this point in the run-up to the 2008 election, Clinton was running for a second term in the Senate and deflecting all questions about her political future until that race concluded in late 2006. While Republicans attempted to recruit a serious contender against her in that 2006 race in hopes of forcing her to spend some time (and money) in the Empire State, they failed miserably. She eventually announced her presidential campaign on Jan. 20, 2007.

While there is broad agreement in the political world that the Clinton hype has started sooner than it did last time, there are differing opinions as to whether that is a good or a bad thing for her if she does decide to run.

“What worries me about the super PACs and groups starting so early is that it is hard to sustain a movement based on an idea — sooner or later, enthusiasm will stall and supporters will want a decision by the person,” said Penny Lee, a former executive director at the Democratic Governors Association and now a lobbyist. “You want to make sure that need for a decision coincides with Hillary’s own timing and doesn’t force her to make a decision before she is ready.”

There have already been some grumbles about Ready for Hillary and whether its stated goal of clearing a path for Clinton when she decides to run might have the opposite effect — by, as Lee suggests, forcing her hand before she is ready to decide or making her look political before she wants to appear that way.

Others argue, however, that all of the early jockeying and planning around the possibility of Clinton running again ultimately is a good thing for her if she wants to run.

“I’m one who believes the early hype is a good thing on both fronts if managed properly,” said GOP media consultant Fred Davis, who handled advertising for the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). “She’s basically able to imply her opponents can huff and puff — but this time you’ll never blow this house down.”

Managing the attention that all of this early activity has created around Clinton is critical. On the one hand, she benefits from being seen as nonpolitical (or at least not a candidate) for as long as possible. On the other, if all of the buzz forces the media to litigate Clinton’s problems — or potential problems — now rather than in the heat of a 2016 presidential campaign, that’s a plus for her.

Also worth considering: Clinton, while one of the most famous people in the world, is out of office and, therefore, has no natural way of making news or driving an issue agenda. She clearly views her involvement in the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation as that vehicle, although it remains to be seen just how effective she can drive a message from that perch.

Whether all of the attention is a good thing or bad thing in the long run then depends on what Clinton and her political team— who is in her inner circle remains unclear — can make of it.

“It’s a double-edged sword. Early hype can deter viable challenges, but it also invites the kind of scrutiny that can deflate a bubble very quickly,” said Phil Singer, a senior staffer in Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign. “The team needs to manage the buzz carefully.”"
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/18/senate-filibuster-reform-dc-circuit_n_4298315.html,2013-11-18 00:00:00,['Senior Politics Reporter'],Senate Democrats Eye Filibuster Reform As GOP Blocks Another Obama Nominee,"WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans filibustered President Barack Obama's third and final nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on Monday, leaving Democrats with two options for filling the court's empty seats: change the rules and take away the GOP's power to filibuster certain nominees, or call it a day.

As expected, Republicans lined up to block a procedural vote for Robert Wilkins. His nomination needed 60 votes to advance. Instead, the Senate voted 53 to 38, with just two Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), siding with Democrats to let him get a confirmation vote.

The GOP blockade on Wilkins was no surprise. In the last month, Republicans filibustered Obama's two other D.C. Circuit nominees, Patricia Millett and Nina Pillard. They'll readily admit their opposition isn't personal; they just don't want Obama to put any of his nominees on the court. Some argue the court isn't busy enough to warrant filling its three empty seats, and others make the counterintuitive argument that Obama is ""court-packing"" by filling vacancies. Both arguments gloss over the fact that the president has a constitutional duty to fill empty seats on a court.

Democrats have been warning for weeks that they're prepared to invoke the ""nuclear option"" and strip Republicans of their ability to block Obama's nominees if they keep filibustering. With Wilkins' vote now blocked, Democrats have to decide if they have it in them to change institutional rules that both parties are typically reluctant to mess with.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and other Democratic leaders are expected to weigh their next steps in a Monday night leadership meeting. One idea being considered is stripping Republicans' ability to filibuster judicial and executive nominees, but not nominees to the Supreme Court. Aides emphasized that nothing has been decided, however, and leaders will likely discuss their options with the full Democratic caucus during lunch on Tuesday.

By the sounds of it during Wilkins' vote, some Democrats are ready to go nuclear right now.

""I fear that after tonight, the talk about changing the cloture rules for judicial nominations will no longer be just talk. There will be action,"" said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""We cannot allow this unprecedented, wholesale obstruction to continue without undermining the Senate’s role provided in the Constitution and without harming our independent federal judiciary.""

“When will we say enough is enough? Repeatedly over the past month, a minority of senators has blocked qualified nominees by abusing the Senate rules,"" Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said. ""The rules on nominees are not working, and we need to change them.""

But Republicans are largely shrugging off Democrats' threats, suspecting it's all talk. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the real reason Democrats want to keep talking about the D.C. Circuit is to take attention away from the rocky rollout of the president's health care law.

Democrats are trying to ""distract Americans from the failings of Obamacare,"" McConnell said ahead of Wilkins' vote. ""I hope the Senate will focus on things people care about rather than spend its time trying to distract them.""

Shortly after the vote, Obama railed against Republicans for blocking another of his key nominees.

""This obstruction is completely unprecedented,"" he said in a statement. ""When it comes to judicial nominations, I am fulfilling my constitutional responsibility, but Congress is not. Instead, Senate Republicans are standing in the way of a fully functioning judiciary that serves the American people.""

This is a developing story and has been updated."
http://news.yahoo.com/a-biden--comeback---he-never-left-223415687.html,,[],A Biden 'comeback'? He never left,"Vice President Joe Biden helped usher in the Obamacare era with a now-famous expression that, while commonly used, cannot be printed here in full. But the voluble veep has kept an uncharacteristically low profile for the past three weeks as Obama’s signature domestic achievement has labored through a thoroughly botched rollout.

Biden, so often at the heart of solutions to past fiscal standoffs, also was silent during the government shutdown and debt ceiling wars. One unconfirmed report said he was deliberately sidelined by Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. On two occasions, the White House left the vice president off the list of attendees when President Barack Obama met with congressional leaders.

When Obama pushed for immigration reform Thursday, there was Biden — standing and smiling next to Obama but not speaking.

Is this the calm before the 2016 storm? Has the VP — the guy who “rode sheriff” on the stimulus, handled major foreign policy headaches, and led the ill-fated push on gun violence — been, for lack of a better coinage, Bide-lined?

Not even close. And that Biden-shaped hole in your life is about to be a thing of the past.

“In the next couple of months, the vice president will travel an average of two days a week and will continue to be deeply engaged on foreign policy,” an aide told Yahoo News.

(Not long after this story posted, the vice president’s office announced that Biden would go to Austin, Texas, on Oct. 30 to highlight efforts to curb violence against women. In a separate statement, it also announced that he would travel to Panama in late November to have a look at the Panama Canal expansion project.)

In the runup to the Obamacare rollout, Biden sat down for interviews and placed op-eds (like this one in the key 2016 state of Iowa) and telephone calls “designed to directly reach young Americans, Latinos [and] African-Americans, and thank key stakeholders who are still working tirelessly to educate their communities” about the law, a Biden aide said.

Story continues

Biden, joined by Department of Health and Human Services officials, held a conference call with 3,000 nurses from 25 nursing organizations working to enroll patients around the United States in Obamacare.

Op-eds by Biden or HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius ran in 29 local papers, according to the vice president’s office.

As the health care marketplaces opened Oct 1, Biden did an interview on College Radio Day, reaching 400 college radio stations. That kind of outreach will be crucial to whether the law succeeds, since the exchanges need young and healthy Americans to sign up in order to offset older, sicker members who require more care.

So what about the shutdown? Where was Biden, so often the administration’s point man for negotiating last-minute deals with Republicans?

Biden and Obama aides said that the vice president was in every meeting at the White House. He “spent many hours with President Obama every day,” a Biden aide said.

So what about those two instances, on Oct. 9 and Oct 15, when the White House left him off the list of upcoming high-profile meetings? Biden and Obama aides said this was entirely unintentional, the result of thinned-out communications staff who were racing to match leaks from congressional Republicans. “It’s absurd. If we’d wanted to sideline him, we just wouldn’t have invited him,” one West Wing official said.

Did Reid really work to make sure Biden didn’t cut a deal with Republicans? “Another option: The VP wasn’t involved in negotiations because our position was ‘no negotiations,’” said a Democratic official.

But the shutdown did sideline Biden in one respect: A scheduled (and announced) Oct. 11 fundraising event for Newark Mayor Cory Booker’s successful Senate run fell by the wayside.

“The shutdown forced our office to reschedule a number of official and political events,” a Biden aide explained.

Even so, Biden was hardly low-profile. On Oct. 4, he joined Obama for a highly unusual stroll to a sandwich shop near the White House.

Biden also has stayed busy behind the scenes. On Wednesday, he met behind closed doors with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

With the shutdown now in the rearview mirror, Biden attended an Oct. 15 Medal of Honor ceremony and the Oct. 18 nomination of a new Homeland Security secretary, and traveled to Massachusetts on Oct. 23 for an event promoting mental health."

James Buchanan was the 15th President of the United States, serving a single term from 1857 to 1861. He has the distinction of being the only lifelong bachelor to hold this office. According to some historians, he was also gay. His niece and ward Harriet Lane (an orphan) filled the position of “first lady” during his presidency. As a “first lady,” historians generally rank her as 2nd (Dolly Madison is ranked as 1st).

The presidential election of 1856 was a three-way race between Buchanan (Democrat), former President Millard Fillmore (Know Nothing), and John C. Frémont (the first Republican candidate for president).

Buchanan’s term as president was marred by the issue of slavery. While Buchanan was a Northerner (he was from Pennsylvania), he claimed that the slaves were:



“treated with kindness and humanity…Both the philanthropy and the self-interest of the master have combined to produce this human result.”

“to arrest, if possible, the agitation of the Slavery question in the North and to destroy sectional parties.”

“Before [the abolitionists] commenced this agitation, a very large and growing party existed in several of the slave states in favor of the gradual abolition of slavery; and now not a voice is heard there in support of such a measure. The abolitionists have postponed the emancipation of the slaves in three or four states for at least half a century.”

“I acknowledge no master but the law.”

He told one Southern Senator that the goal of his administration was:Buchanan felt that the abolitionists were preventing the solution to the slavery problem. He stated:While he attempted to maintain peace between the slave-owning south and the abolitionist north, he felt that secession was illegal, but that going to war to stop it was also illegal. As an attorney, Buchanan’s basic code was:Buchanan also felt that there were too many educated people in the country and vetoed a bill which would have created more colleges.

In response to the Panic of 1857 (a recession), Buchanan advocated reform rather than relief. He felt that government did not have the power to provide relief.

On leaving the White House, Buchanan told his successor, Abraham Lincoln:



“If you are as happy, my dear sir, on entering this house as I am on leaving it and returning home, you are the happiest man in the country.”

Buchanan died on June 1, 1868 at the age of 77. He left an estate valued at $310,000. He is buried in Woodward Hill Cemetery in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

In 1852, the Democrats held their presidential nominating convention in Boston. There was a deadlock among the three presidential candidates—James Buchanan, Lewis Cass, and Stephen A. Douglas—and Franklin Pierce, who was not at the convention, was selected as a compromise choice. Pierce accepted the nomination because he was certain that he would lose. His son prayed that he would lose and his wife wanted him to decline the nomination.

Pierce and his running mate William R. King defeated the Whig Party ticket of Winfield Scott and William A. Graham by 50% to 44% in the popular vote. In 1853, Pierce was sworn in as the 14th President of the United States and the only president who refused to take the oath with the words “I do solemnly swear”.

While Pierce was from New Hampshire, he was a supporter of slavery. During the Civil War, he supported the Confederacy. As President, he renewed the debate over the expansion of slavery in the American west by supporting the Kansas-Nebraska Act.

His personal life during his term as president can best be described as a bit of a mess. First of all, he was an alcoholic. Secondly, his son was killed shortly before he took office and his wife entered a deep depression which lasted for his entire term.

Franklin Pierce died on January 22, 1868 at the age of 64. It is generally felt that he drank himself to death. He left an estate valued at $70,000 which was divided among friends and relatives. He was buried in the Old North Cemetery in Concord, New Hampshire.

Warren G. Harding:

Warren G. Harding was the 29th President of the United States, serving from 1921 to 1923.

Harding was considered the compromise candidate in the 1920 election. He promised a return to a strong economy, independent of foreign influence. He defeated Democrat James M. Cox in a landslide: 60% to 34% of the popular vote.

His administration was marred with corruption, including the infamous Teapot Dome scandal and a notoriously corrupt justice department. These scandals resulted in his low ranking as president.

Historians have described Harding as a “semi-educated political hack” with a “large taste for women, liquor, and poker.” During his term, bootleggers provided the White House with liquor. He has been described as the least qualified person to be elected president.

Harding had a passionate affair with Nan Britton which resulted in a daughter. While in office, he feared that this relationship would become public.

Harding died in office on August 2, 1923 at the age of 57. There were some rumors that he was actually murdered by his wife. These rumors were enhanced by his wife’s refusal to allow his body to undergo an autopsy. His estate of nearly a million dollars went to his wife. After his death, Mrs. Harding burned all of President Harding’s correspondence and documents.

William Henry Harrison:

William Henry Harrison was President of the United States from March 4, 1841 to April 4, 1841. He was the first president to die in office. He not only served the shortest term as president, but he also delivered the longest inaugural address—it took him nearly two hours to read it. Harrison was also the first sitting president to have his photograph taken.

Harrison died broke and facing bankruptcy. Congress voted to give his wife a pension and the right to mail letters free of charge.

Final note: Harrison’s grandson, Benjamin Harrison, became the 23rd President of the United States (1889-1893) and is ranked 34th."

Republican rhetoric focuses on business creators without connecting to the average American.

Republican policies must address common interests %u2013 and not just economic interests.

We need to look to leaders in our party to emerge and solidify around this message.

Republicans feel better about their party thanks to the rash of Obama administration scandals: Benghazi stonewalling, targeting of the IRS, DOJ monitoring of media and NSA leaks. Each disgrace is bad enough, but collectively they display the president's failure to be a different kind of leader. But Republicans cannot just rely on the letdown of the Obama administration.

2012 exit polling tells us that 21% of voters thought that the most important Presidential quality was that the candidate ""cares about people like me"" – and President Obama won these voters 81 to 18. This fact rekindled the discussion over the increasing ""empathy gap.""

The ""gap"" should come as no surprise. Republican rhetoric focuses on business creators without making the connection to the average American. Furthermore, the establishment Republicans policies have cooperated with Democrats to use the government to reward big businesses and big banks at the expense of these job creators. But Republicans often don't even talk about those who work in those businesses: the cooks, technicians, welders, truck drivers, administrative assistants, middle managers, laborers, and all the other good and honorable jobs that are the foundations of these companies. These employees also make the American economy run, and there are a lot more of them than employers.

We need to talk with them – and to them. Plus our policies must address their interests – and I don't mean just economic interests. True empathy is conveyed by message, messenger, and action.

The Republican establishment dismisses such ""populism"" just like they dismissed our 2012 presidential campaign. Contrary to the popular wisdom, we did not base our campaign on contraception and abortion.

In spite of being badly outspent, we won 11 states. (Incidentally, the same number as Ronald Reagan won against Gerald Ford in 1976.) How? Much like President Reagan, we resonated with Middle America. Our campaign focused on American first principles, the family as a key economic unit and economic opportunity for those struggling during this difficult time. We talked about manufacturing, technical training, tax breaks for working families and a patient centered health care system.

In the days after the election, the Romney campaign shared some of the polling they had done during the primary, since we hadn't done any polling of our own. The most fascinating information was a trend they saw when it basically became a two-man race: Every election day exit poll released before the polls closed had Romney doing better than the final results, so they began asking what time of day voters were planning on voting. The last poll they took from Pennsylvania was telling. We were tied with voters who were planning to vote before 5:00 PM, but I lead Romney by 21 points with the folks voting on their way home from work.

Those are the voters up for grabs in America today, irrespective of their ethnicity, gender, or any other ""demographic indicators."" They know that the president's promises of government taking care of their every need is a farce, but they don't see anyone else talking about or to them. Nor do they see policies that move the needle in their lives.

When President Obama said to American business owners during the campaign last summer ""you didn't build that,"" many Americans cringed – and many were rightly offended. He was wrong, of course, but the Republican response was also wrong. Many American companies were built by great entrepreneurs, but they would be the first to tell you that, while they risked the most time and money, they weren't alone. Republicans should have told the story of entrepreneurs and their employees – how conservative principles have a positive impact on everyone's lives.

As we now know, Obama's gaffe didn't hurt him too much. Mitt Romney's ""47%"" comment was far more damaging. Why? Obama showed he didn't care or connect with, say, 13% of the population that were entrepreneurs in 2012, while Romney turned off Middle America.

In the future, Republicans must have the message and the policies that truly level the playing field, get government out of picking winners and losers, and lift up both owners and workers. We need to look to leaders in our party to emerge and solidify around this message.

Republican President Theodore Roosevelt has had a rebirth of appreciation in some conservative circles for a phrase he coined at the turn of the last century: ""Nobody cares how much you know, until they know how much you care.""

Republicans, take heed.

They hire competent managers for their units, set goals and establish clear metrics for evaluating performance. As in politics, competition in business is tough, and CEOs must set ethical boundaries for their managers’ conduct.



In all this, the CEO’s personal conduct is critical.



Early in his presidency, Mr. Obama flaunted American constitutional tradition by pushing through major social legislation, ObamaCare, without a bipartisan compromise and consensus. And he relied on a legislative sleight of hand to pass the Senate.

[pullquote]

Simply, Mr. Obama’s hard left agenda requires him to treat the Constitution and Congress as mere inconveniences – expediency is his ethical standard.



For example, unable to obtain Congressional ascent, even among moderate Democrats, for limits on CO2 emissions and other environmental goals, the EPA – at his public behest – has written regulations imposing new and onerous requirements on business.

The Obama Credo of Management: We’ll do as we please, stop us if you can.

His failure as a CEO, now with grave political consequences, was to impose no limits on managers’ behavior and implement adequate controls – mechanisms for the CEO to monitor the performance of units and head off emerging threats to the survival of the organization. Regarding the latter, of paramount importance is to insulate the president from any fallout from their actions.

More On This... Obama scandals lay bare very real dangers of big government

Cabinet secretaries and agency heads took their cues from the boss – at State, Justice and the IRS senior management would have had us believe they were unaware of what was happening in Benghazi, with the Associated Press, or at the Cincinnati Office of the IRS. And the president only learns about many problems when reported in the news?

Mr. Obama simply has been too busy giving speeches, raising money, and trying to turn every event to political advantage to keep tabs on his managers, as any good CEOs would do.

CEOs periodically meet with their principal managers – in groups and where necessary individually – to probe their tactics, offer assistance from their own wealth of experience, and discern areas where managers may be planting problems that will burgeon into crisis.

Failing at this, the president has managed to continence management failures that cost the lives of Americans abroad, weaken our national security, rock public confidence in government, and threaten our constitutionally guaranteed liberties.

Mr. Obama has a lot in common with one predecessor, Jimmy Carter – both failed as CEOs. The man from Plains is a decent and ethical man but micromanaged too much, whereas Mr. Obama acquired his moral compass in the Windy City and simply can’t manage at all.

Americans should not be surprised. Mr. Obama came to Washington with profound campaign skills but virtually no record as a legislator or manager. He spent seven years in the Illinois Senate as a virtual non-participant, bored and seeking higher office, and his four years in the U.S. Senate running for president.

Americans turned to him, because they were justifiably disappointed with President Bush and tagged John McCain with the blame.

Prior to his presidency, Americans never observed Mr. Obama running anything, other than a campaign. He had not been a governor or a congressional committee chair. In military terms, we made him a five star general before even serving as a lieutenant.

By his own actions, he is arrogantly ambitions but sadly incompetent. He has corrupted the foundations of our Republic, and for that he gets a failing grade."

On Tuesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney batted away the notion that the Obama administration is behaving like Richard Nixon's.

""People who make those kinds of comparisons need to check their history,"" Carney said.

Try as he might, though, Carney has not been able to tamp down the idea that there is something ""Nixonian"" about the Justice Department's secret probe of the Associated Press.

Brian Williams, for example led off Tuesday's ""NBC Nightly News"" this way:

""As a lot of American adults not so fondly remember, the last time the government was found looking into the phone calls of reporters and using the IRS for political purposes, it was the Nixon era, and while times have changed and circumstances are different that subject came up at the Obama White House today as the administration now scrambles on several fronts.""

Tuesday also saw James Goodale, who was the lawyer for the New York Times in the Pentagon Papers case, flatly say that Obama was worse than Nixon in his dealings with the press.

""Obama has all these things that he's done to the press on national security matters that Nixon never did,"" Goodale told the New York Observer.

Goodale also wrote a piece for the Daily Beast in which he drove the point home. He cited, among other things, Obama's unprecedented use of the Espionage Act to prosecute whistleblowers.

Obama, he said, ""is fast becoming the worst national security press president ever, and it may not get any better.""

The New York Times editorial board also weighed in on Tuesday night, harshly criticizing Obama:

The Obama administration, which has a chilling zeal for investigating leaks and prosecuting leakers, has failed to offer a credible justification for secretly combing through the phone records of reporters and editors at The Associated Press in what looks like a fishing expedition for sources and an effort to frighten off whistle-blowers."

Democrats will defend 18 incumbents and two open seats in the Senate in 2014

Seven of the races will be in states that voted for Republican Mitt Romney in 2012

Harkin has seniority and power in the Senate but says %27it%27s somebody else%27s turn%27

With barely a moment to celebrate an increase in their U.S. Senate majority, Democrats face a steeper challenge in keeping control of the chamber in 2014, thanks to the surprise retirements of two senior Democratic senators.

Iowa's Tom Harkin, powerful in the Senate and popular back home, said Saturday he will not seek re-election in 2014, creating an open seat in a swing state. Harkin's announcement follows that of Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, who said Jan. 11 he would retire at the end of his term.

Those departures mean that in 2014, Democrats must try to hang onto two open seats in addition to defending 18 incumbents – and seven of the 20 races are in states that voted Republican in the presidential election. The red-state Senators on the 2014 ballot include Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Mark Begich of Alaska, Max Baucus of Montana, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Kay Hagan of North Carolina.

Republicans will have 13 senators up for re-election, all but one – Susan Collins of Maine — from red states.

Harkin's retirement puts Iowa ""in the top tier of competitive Senate races'' for 2014, Rob Collins, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in a statement. ""With Democrats already on defense in a number of key states such as West Virginia, Louisiana, South Dakota and others, there is no question that this is very troubling news for Harry Reid and his liberal friends in Washington.""

Democrats — counting independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont — hold a 55-45 advantage over Republicans in the Senate after winning Senate seats in Indiana and Massachusetts that had been held by Republicans. In addition, Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who replaced Republican Olympia Snowe, caucuses with the Democrats.

The map is daunting for Democrats, but the math is hard for Republicans, says Matt Canter of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. To take the majority in the Senate, Republicans must win six of the seven red-state Democratic seats. ""Republicans essentially have no room for error if they're going to actually contest the majority,'' he says. ""This is a difficult map for Democrats, but Republicans face a very steep climb, and I don't think the retirements this week dramatically change the map where we sit today.''

Harkin, 73, was elected to the Senate in 1984 and is fourth in seniority among Democrats and the chairman of the important Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. He had already raised money for a 2014 race and planned a fundraiser for next month – minimum $1,500 contribution — with the pop star Lady Gaga.

""To tell you that it's easy to walk away from that kind of position and power, that would be a lie,'' he said Saturday. But ""it's somebody else's turn. I'm hopeful that the Democrats come up with a smart, savvy person who can organize a campaign, raise the money and win.''

Rep. Bruce Braley, a fourth-term Democrat from the northeastern part of Iowa, said in a statement Sunday that he is considering running for Harkin's seat. ""While Senator Harkin's shoes are impossible to fill, in the coming days my family and I will carefully weigh a possible candidacy for Senate,'' Braley said on his Facebook page Sunday.

Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., said Friday he would also retire. Chambliss, 69, was criticized by conservatives in November for refusing to pledge not to raise taxes. Though Georgia is a red-leaning state, Democrats hope Republicans nominate a conservative candidate that will leave an opening for a moderate Democrat to be elected – as happened last November in Indiana. DSCC executive director Guy Cecil called it ""one of the Democrats best pickup opportunities'' in a statement last week. ""There are already several reports of the potential for a divisive primary that will push Republicans to the extreme right.''

Is Barack Obama a liberal?



That question might have aroused spirited debate, especially among Democrats, during the president’s vague-is-in-vogue re-election campaign. But since the polls closed on Nov. 6, President Obama has undeniably positioned himself to the left of Candidate Obama.



Amid the national grieving over the Sandy Hook shootings, Obama suddenly found the gumption to stare down the NRA and put gun control back on the national agenda. His inaugural address will be remembered for the stirring endorsement of gay rights and the sudden rediscovery of climate change. Then before the inaugural glow wore off, the Pentagon announced that it would drop its ban on women in combat. And immigration reform—another explosive topic—is likely to receive a star turn in the upcoming State of the Union address.



But before we dust off right-wing commentator Dinesh D’Souza’s absurd claim that Obama is really a Kenyan socialist, let’s look more closely at the president’s sudden liberal fervor.



Make no mistake, Obama is indeed a transformational 21st-century leader when it comes to any issue that touches on individual rights and equality. He reflects the end of the white-bread politics that elected both Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan to two terms. Rather than defying the demographic and attitudinal shifts that produced the America of 2013, Obama embodies them.



Some of his liberal statements and actions are undoubtedly payback to the electoral coalition that gave the president a second term despite the stagnant economy. When the first wave of Obama White House memoirs are published, it will be fascinating to read about the internal debates over the gay-rights portion of the inaugural address. But maybe, in reality, there was little dissent. Maybe Obama and his top advisers simply understood that it was time.



Any discussion of Obama’s newly expressed passion for gun control has to begin with the fact that this Chicago-shaped politician is our first urban president since John Kennedy. Unlike, say, Bill Clinton, Obama never came from a place where guns are equated with hunting rather than violent shootouts. Remember, during the 2008 primary campaign against Hillary Clinton, Obama in a private fundraiser derided rural voters who “cling to guns or religion.”



When it comes to regulating guns, political geography matters. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg may be the nation’s most zealous proponent of gun control, but it is hard to describe this billionaire plutocrat, who endorsed George W. Bush for president in 2004, as a dangerous left-winger.



Immigration reform is another issue with a bipartisan pedigree. The plan that Obama is likely to highlight in his State of the Union address will bear a close resemblance to the legislation that John McCain and Ted Kennedy introduced in 2005 with the blessing of George W. Bush and Karl Rove. It is hard to describe the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has consistently backed immigration reform, as a hotbed of left-wingers.



Painting an ideological portrait of any incumbent president is tricky since the subject keeps moving rather than holding a fixed position. All presidencies are filled with contradictions: Ronald Reagan raised taxes; Bush dramatically expanded the social safety net by adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare; and Obama, for a while, dramatically increased troop levels in Afghanistan.



Even now, there is a zigzag quality to Obama’s foreign policy. In his inaugural address, the president declared, “A decade of war is now ending.” But not the vastly expanded drone attacks, which have become Obama’s favored way of battling terrorists. To the consternation of liberals, Obama has refused to make public the legal justification for this airborne war conducted by robots.



The president’s economic orientation can be equally confounding. In an interview after the election, Obama claimed, “My policies are so mainstream that if I had set the same policies that I had back in the 1980s, I would be considered a moderate Republican.” Of course, this contention is self-servingly hyperbolic. But Obama’s words do underscore how the political pendulum on economic issues (but decidedly not on social issues) has moved to the right in the past three decades.



How liberal is a president who signed the “fiscal cliff” legislation that made permanent the Bush tax cuts for roughly 99 percent of Americans? How liberal is a president who at various points in his budget negotiations with the Republicans has toyed with raising the eligibility age for Medicare and cutting back the inflation adjustment for Social Security? How liberal is a president who allowed the Wall Street masterminds behind the economic collapse to go unpunished for their flagrant misdeeds?



Even the big-government complexity of Obamacare was created in large measure because the president refused to endorse the liberal cause of a single-payer system like Medicare. And while not beating the drums for the president’s claim to be a moderate Republican, didn’t a Massachusetts governor named Mitt Romney enact an analogous health-care plan?



The point is that an inaugural address and a few post-election gestures do not, by themselves, define who Obama is as a political leader. So far the liberalism of Obama in the personal sphere has been tempered by the centrism of Obama in the economic and foreign-policy realm.



This ideological blurriness comes with the keys to the Oval Office. To steal a line from Walt Whitman, Obama can rightly say, “I am large, I contain multitudes.”"

USA TODAY

Karl Rove offered an interesting postmortem Thursday of what happened to Republicans in their battle with the White House over the government shutdown and debt ceiling.

Rove, the former George W. Bush political strategist and organizer of the political action committee American Crossroads, writes in the Wall Street Journal that Republican lawmakers walked into a trap set by President Obama.

Here's a bit of what Rove had to say:

""There's plenty of blame to go around for the chaos in Washington, but at the top of the list is the absence of presidential leadership. When Congress is close to agreement but still divided, the country rightly counts on its chief executive to bridge the gaps, make the compromises, and smooth the way to passage.

""Instead, President Obama deliberately withdrew from negotiations over the debt ceiling and government shutdown. According to a Bloomberg report on Wednesday, the White House was concerned his personal involvement would be 'a mistake that damaged the president's ability to advance his agenda.'

""Perhaps it was for the best. Mr. Obama's skill is not in bringing Americans together; it is turning them against one another. This latest crisis over the debt ceiling and shutdown is a case in point. Having voted against an increase in the debt ceiling in 2006 as the junior senator from Illinois, the president now characterizes those opposed to one today as reckless and crazed. Hypocrisy makes for clever politics but bad governing.""

Rove concludes:

""Barack Obama set the trap. Some congressional Republicans walked into it. As a result, the president is stronger, the GOP is weaker, and ObamaCare is marginally more popular."""

Bush made barnyard reference to Rick Perry Romney campaign got blunt advice from Chris Christie Some Republicans hoped late entry into race could replace Romney

Editor’s Note: This story contains references to potentially offensive language reportedly used by politicians during the 2012 campaign.

(CNN) —

“Double Down,” a behind-the-scenes account of the 2012 presidential race by the journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, is out Tuesday. It’s the sequel to “Game Change,” their 2008 campaign retrospective that became an HBO film by the same name.

The authors, self-styled ringmasters of Washington’s political media “Freak Show,” are skilled at creating buzz, packing their book with provocative tidbits and a range of splashy scoops – an impressive feat considering that the Barack Obama-Mitt Romney showdown was the most scrutinized national campaign in American history.

Read Peter Hamby’s review in the Washington Post

The book has already made headlines: The Obama campaign flirted with the idea of kicking Vice President Joe Biden off the ticket and replacing him with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Romney campaign was startled by what it dug up on Chris Christie in the process of vetting him to be the Republican vice presidential nominee.

Ann Coulter: I don’t believe Hillary story

But here are 10 other newsmaking items from the book that has Washington transfixed:

1. Obama: ‘I’m really good at killing people’

In late 2011, President Obama, “an inveterate list maker,” began writing up a list of his achievements on a yellow legal pad. Writing his thoughts down on paper “helped him to quiet his mind.” The purpose was to help himself and his advisers reason through the best ways to present his three-year track record to voters.

On September 30, the same day a Predator drone strike killed the American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, Obama presented a small stack of yellow legal pages to his aides gathered in the White House’s Roosevelt Room.

“Obama didn’t need to run through this preamble,” the authors write. “Everyone knew the litany of his achievements. Foremost on that day, with the fresh news about al-Awlaki, it seemed the president was pondering the drone program that he had expanded so dramatically and with such lethal results, as well as the death of bin Laden, which was still resonating worldwide months later.

” ‘Turns out I’m really good at killing people,’ Obama said quietly. ‘Didn’t know that was going to be a strong suit of mine.’ “

Bergen: Did Obama keep his drone promises?

2. Obama’s secret George Soros summit

Obama’s distaste for the ring-kissing demands of campaign fundraising is the stuff of legend among Democrats, so it’s no surprise that a meeting with liberal megadonor George Soros in 2010 came up empty.

In September 2010, the White House arranged “a secret summit” between the president and Soros at the Waldorf Astoria in New York, “in hope that Soros would be induced into serious check-writing on behalf of the Democrats ahead of the midterms.”

Soros lectured Obama for 45 minutes on the economy. Obama, the authors write, “was annoyed and bored.”

“Afterwards, he fumed, ‘If we don’t get anything out of him, I’m never f–king sitting with that guy again.’ “

As for Soros, the hedge-fund titan declined to pony up in any big way for the midterms.

3. George W. Bush called Rick Perry ’chicken-s–t’

After Texas Gov. Rick Perry jumped into the Republican presidential race, long-standing tensions between him and the Bush family began to burst into view. Perry wasn’t shy about criticizing the patrician roots of George W. Bush, his gubernatorial predecessor in Texas. Longtime Bush adviser Karl Rove, who thought Perry was unelectable, fired back at Perry

Publicly, the Bush clan claimed not to be offended by the sudden rise of Perry. But privately, Barbara Bush “was hyperventilating over Perry” up in Kennebunkport, Maine. And her son “was steaming.”

“At a dinner party in Washington, the 43rd president vented to a Romney ally. “You can’t take Perry seriously,” Bush said, according to the authors. “He’s a chicken-s–t guy.”

4. Chris Christie on Newt Gingrich: ‘He’s a joke’

After the once-fading Newt Gingrich returned with gusto in South Carolina and trounced Romney in the Republican primary, Romney’s campaign was forced to recalibrate and develop a game plan to eliminate Gingrich in Florida.

Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey called Romney to give him some advice.

“Get out of your crouch and kick the s–t out of this guy,” Christie said. “That’s what you should do. He’s a joke. And you’re allowing him to be taken seriously.”

Romney went on to trounce Gingrich in the Florida primary, drowning him in attack ads.

A year after 2012 election, Romney talks 2016

5. The white-knight scenario

In the darkest days of Romney’s Republican nomination fight, facing down a surprisingly robust conservative challenge from former Sen. Rick Santorum before the Michigan primary, Haley Barbour was alarmed.

The former Mississippi governor, one of the Republican Party’s most well-connected and well-respected insiders, worried that Romney was so feeble as a candidate that he would be unelectable once the general election rolled around.

So he consulted with Scott Reed, a veteran GOP fixer, about the “white-knight scenario” – recruiting a stronger candidate who could seize the nomination with a late entry into the race and a brokered convention in Tampa, Florida. Reed began investigating filing deadlines and ballot access rules for late primary states, circulating the details to Republican grandees around Washington. House Speaker John Boehner “was warm to the notion.”

And Barbour went even further. In Washington, he sat down with Christie and Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels – two Republicans who had declined previous entreaties to enter the race – and asked them to reconsider. Both gave it serious thought but ultimately declined.

6. The Clinton ransom

Keenly aware of Bill Clinton’s popularity among Democrats and his comfort talking about middle-class issues, Obamaland worked overtime to get the 42nd president involved in the campaign.

But it wouldn’t come without a price.

Clinton’s then-gatekeeper, Doug Band, “issued an ultimatum to the Obamans: the price of WJC’s involvement in the campaign was the retirement of HRC’s balance due.”

In other words, Band was demanding that Obama help pay off Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign debt – at that point, about a quarter of a million dollars – in exchange for Bill Clinton’s help on the trail.

Though top members of the Obama campaign were flabbergasted at the demand – and held Band in especially low regard, calling him a nickname unfit for printing here – they eventually agreed to help retire Clinton’s debt.

7. The Ricketts plan

The story landed like a hydrogen bomb: The New York Times reported in May 2011 that Republican billionaire Joe Ricketts, the TD Ameritrade founder and Chicago Cubs co-owner, was proposing an eye-popping $10 million ad campaign designed to dredge up the 2008 controversy surrounding Obama’s former pastor, Jeremiah Wright.

The Obama campaign was furious that Republicans would consider playing the race card. But it turns out that Obamaworld was behind the story.

The Ricketts plan, it seems, was anonymously dropped off at the Chicago offices of Democratic direct-mail vendor Pete Giangreco by “a mystery brunette” carrying a manila envelope. Just who leaked it remains a mystery, Halperin and Heilemann write.

Giangreco promptly rushed over to Obama’s Michigan Avenue headquarters to hand off the document to Obama campaign manager Jim Messina. Obama high command then decided to slip the Ricketts plan to the media, in hopes of killing it with negative publicity before it could even get off the ground.

“The Obamans didn’t want their fingerprints on the disclosure, so they used a third-party cutout to funnel the Ricketts document to The New York Times,” the book reveals.

It worked. All hell broke loose, and the Obama rapid response operation had a field day prodding reporters to get Romney to disavow the proposed ad campaign and anything related to Wright.

8. The Eastwood ‘car crash’

Clint Eastwood’s rambling, incoherent, off-the-cuff speech-turned-performance-art appearance at the Republican National Convention caused heads to explode backstage.

Once Russ Schriefer, the campaign’s point person for convention planning, began to wrap his head around the scale of the disaster before him, “he was in a state of panic.”

“Rushing backstage to the control room to try to give Eastwood the hook, he ran into [Romney adviser Stuart] Stevens – who started screaming, ‘This is terrible! It’s a car crash!’ “

According to the authors, “Stevens lost all control. He was throwing things, howling, cursing, and weeping, until he dropped his head into his hands.”

Stevens also excused himself, made his way to another room, and vomited.

9. ‘Project Goldfish’

Romney’s search for a running mate began in April 2012 with about two dozen names compiled by his longtime adviser Beth Myers, who presided over the vice presidential search, code-named “Project Goldfish” after the snack food.

Presented with the initial list, Romney narrowed his possible choices down to 11 Republicans: New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, Texas Sen. John Cornyn, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, former Tennessee Sen. Bill Frist, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan.

After sorting through “preliminary research” on each of them, the Republican nominee drilled down on five final choices: Christie, Pawlenty, Portman, Rubio and Ryan. In keeping with the “Project Goldfish” theme, each potential running mate was given a code name. Christie’s was “Pufferfish.”

Once a larger group of advisers were brought into the process, “the overwhelming consensus” was for Ryan, who was eventually picked. Romney adviser Stevens, though, was “adamantly in favor of Christie.”

But Romney and Myers ultimately concluded, based on research compiled by attorneys on the vetting team, that Christie’s background was “littered with potential landmines” – and they pulled the plug on Christie.

10. The Huntsman debacle

Among the GOP cast of characters, no one emerges more sullied than Jon Huntsman, whose shameless ambition wilts under the grueling spotlight of a national campaign and clashes with his own staff.

As Obama’s ambassador to China, Huntsman apparently circumvented the Hatch Act – which prohibits high-ranking U.S. officials from engaging in partisan political activity – by using his wife, Mary Kaye, as a back channel to plot embryonic campaign strategy with John Weaver, his adviser-in-waiting back in the States.

In the fall of 2010, the authors write, “Mary Kaye began e-mailing Weaver and asking about 2012. Sometimes two or three times a day the missives hit his inbox: What’s the state of the race? Who’s in? What do you think? She referred to her husband as “HE,” a code that probably would not have provided much protection had the communications been exposed.”

Once a candidate, Huntsman and his family were taken aback by the drudgery of campaigning, particularly fundraising. They were also mortified by the fire-breathing anger of the tea party.

Instead, the Huntsmans were “like candle-drawn moths to the liberal glitterati,” cozying up to New York celebrities like Tina Brown, Arianna Huffington and Diane Von Furstenberg who ‘made them swoon.’ “

Mired in low single digits in national polls, Huntsman also decided at one point to abandon his Republican bid and run as an independent, but he was talked out of it by his family."

Stanley Druckenmiller, who Bloomberg reports served as Soros’s “chief strategist” for “more than 10 years” as a client money manager, has joined Zuckerberg’s efforts at FWD.us to push for comprehensive immigration reform.

Druckenmiller served as the lead portfolio manager for Soros’ Quantum Fund from 1988 until 2000. According to Bloomberg, he “produced average annual returns of 30 percent at his hedge fund Duquesne Capital Management LLC” from 1986 through 2010.

In addition to hiring Druckenmiller, Zuckerberg funds former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour’s “Americans for a Conservative Direction.” According to the New York Times, that group has been one of the many special interests at the forefront of trying to push conservatives in the House of Representatives to support a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. The Times wrote recently that Barbour’s Zuckerberg-funded group “has been running ads in Iowa lately that implore those watching to ‘stand with Marco Rubio to end de facto amnesty.'”

The Mexican government once paid Barbour to lobby on behalf of amnesty for illegal immigrants inside the United States.

Other special interest groups are lobbying for the House to pass an amnesty program, as well.

The American Action Network, a group led by former Minnesota Republican Sen. Norm Coleman, has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on television and radio ads pushing the Senate’s immigration bill in the House. Coleman founded the American Action Network with Sen. John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign National Finance Committee co-chair Fred Malek. In addition to his various roles in politics, Malek is the founder and chairman of Thayer Lodging Group.

Karl Rove is similarly spending money pushing amnesty. “Certainly the way in which the bill is perceived and Rubio’s own political fortunes are closely entwined,” Steven Law, the president of Rove’s American Crossroads, said a few weeks ago. “Our first priority is to promote and advance immigration reform, and to talk about the ways this advances conservative goals. If we do that we will not only be helping to move legislation, but it will also protect those who stuck their necks out like Rubio.”

Before those special interests started their lobbying and advertising campaigns for amnesty in the House, most of House GOP leadership seemed to brush off the Senate’s bill. After weeks of pressure from these special interests, however, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor will hold a hearing on his version of the “DREAM Act” on Tuesday, an amnesty provision for young illegal immigrants.

Beyond Druckenmiller’s role, several Soros-backed groups are involved in the effort to pass amnesty. As Breitbart News has reported, the Evangelical Immigration Table (EIT) and the National Immigration Forum (NIF) are funded by the progressive billionaire."

Memoli Worked In The Los Angeles Times', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'Bureau', 'Where He Covered The White House', 'The Presidential Campaign', 'National Politics Based In D.C.', 'Plus A Dozen Or So Swing States In Presidential Election Years . A New Jersey Native', 'He Graduated Loyola University In Maryland.', 'Lisa Mascaro Previously Covered Congress In Washington']",Senate Democrats invoke ‘nuclear option’ on filibusters,"WASHINGTON — Democrats made a historic change to Senate rules Thursday, ending the minority party’s ability to use filibusters to block most presidential nominations and, in the process, virtually guaranteeing that the rest of President Obama’s term will be dominated by executive actions and court battles rather than legislation.

In changing the long-standing rules with a near party-line vote in the middle of the session, Democrats brushed aside a century of congressional tradition and further embittered relations between the parties on an already deadlocked Capitol Hill.

The Senate Republican minority, which will see its power dramatically curtailed, threatened reprisals and characterized the rule change as a political power grab, comparing it to Obama’s push to pass the landmark Affordable Health Care act in 2010 without bipartisan support.

The decision by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to deploy the so-called nuclear option means Senate confirmations of presidential appointments — except for Supreme Court justices — will proceed by a simple majority vote. Previously, a 60-vote threshold had become the norm to avoid a filibuster by the minority party. The change does not affect filibusters on legislation.

PHOTOS: 2013’s political moments

Over the years, Democrats and Republican have used filibusters to block nominations, but the practice became much more common in recent years.

“I realize that neither party has been blameless for these tactics,” Obama said Thursday in supporting the rule change. “They’ve developed over years, and it seems as if they’ve continually escalated. But today’s pattern of obstruction — it just isn’t normal. A majority of senators believe, as I believe, that enough is enough.”

Only three Democrats — Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Carl Levin of Michigan — joined Republicans in the 48-52 vote.

Eleventh-hour offers of a deal from Republicans to allow some nominees to proceed were dismissed by Democrats as too little, too late. The unprecedented action injected unusual drama into the historic Senate chamber. At one point, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), arguably the body’s leading centrist, could be seen pleading with Reid to pull back from the vote.

For Democrats, the move is a calculated gamble that Republicans won’t win both the White House and Senate majority in the 2016 election.

“You may regret it a lot sooner than you think,” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Referring to the vote as “Obamacare 2,” he said, “It only reinforces the narrative of a party that is willing to do and say just about anything to get its way.” In 2005, Republicans, who held the Senate majority, threatened a similar move but backed down after Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) led a bipartisan group that forged a compromise.

This time, the vote reflected the view of many Democrats that the chance of any major legislation passing the divided Congress over the next year already had dwindled to almost nothing. As a result, Reid and his allies felt they had little to lose.

“We’d much prefer the risk of up-or-down votes and majority rule than the risk of continued total obstruction,” said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). “That’s the bottom line no matter who’s in power.”

“I’d rather fight over policy,” said Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska), who is running for reelection for the first time in the conservative state. “It’s not a Republican or Democratic issue. It’s that the American people are asking us to fix this system.”

A filibuster is a Senate tool that enables a single member to delay or block a vote on legislation or nominations. In the past, members were required to take the floor and talk nonstop, but in recent years that practice has become rare as leaders instead simply acknowledge the member’s objection and attempt to gather a 60-vote majority to break the filibuster.

The White House also seems resigned to a second term marked by congressional paralysis. Obama has indicated that he would use executive actions wherever possible to advance major items on his agenda, including efforts to combat climate change and implement his healthcare law. Immigration advocates have pushed him to use administrative actions to limit deportations.

That approach puts a premium on filling vacancies in executive agencies and in the courts that review executive actions — something that Republicans had succeeded in significantly slowing.

In the short term, the change paves the way for the confirmation of Obama’s three pending appointments to the influential D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The court currently has eight judges, evenly divided between Democratic and Republican appointees. Because the D.C. Circuit handles most major cases involving Washington-based regulatory agencies, it is a prime forum where major Obama initiatives will be fought out.

The Senate will move first to confirm Patricia Millett, whose nomination to the D.C. Circuit was the vehicle for Thursday’s action. The other two nominees to the court are expected to be approved after Thanksgiving. Rep. Melvin Watt (D-N.C.), who became the first sitting lawmaker in more than a century to face a Senate filibuster, is now also likely to be confirmed to lead the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

Republicans argued that Democrats were “breaking the rules to change the rules” by using a simple majority vote rather than a two-thirds vote to make the rule change. Democrats cited more than a dozen examples of other rule changes that were adopted in such a fashion in the last four decades. They also insisted that Republicans were likely to have made the same change to filibuster rules the next time they gained majority control of the Senate.

Democrats had been threatening to change the rules for nearly a year, but they held off in part because of hesitation by long-serving senators on their side of the aisle. But in recent days, several of the veterans joined recently elected Democrats who led the campaign to change the rules.

“I recognize that I could be back in the minority again, but that’s OK if that happens,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who just began a fifth term and who recently decided to support changing the rules. “I want, in the remainder of my five-plus years, to get something done, to be able to get nominees approved, to be able to get bills moved.”

While Democrats said the immediate motivation for the rule change was the fight over nominations, the move to end filibusters was probably only a matter of time, reflecting the long-term shift in American politics toward ever-greater polarization, particularly over the last two decades.

Polarization of the two parties has reached levels not seen since the 19th century, according to studies by political scientists Keith T. Poole of the University of Georgia and Howard Rosenthal of New York University. Congress has moved toward a parliamentary system characterized by near-lock-step party voting and deep, consistent ideological differences between the two parties.

Bipartisan coalitions have dwindled, and so have incentives on other side of the aisle to bend the majority party’s agenda. For both parties, winning a majority now comes with heavy pressure from constituents to actually adopt the majority’s program. That made tools like the filibuster, intended to protect minority-party rights, appear more as an anachronism.

Republicans still have a number of procedural opportunities to delay Senate business, including some that are traditionally dispensed with as a courtesy to allow other issues to come to the floor. McCain, who was key to a deal last summer that defused the last Democratic threat to change filibuster rules, warned of the toxic atmosphere ahead.

“It’ll be very poisoned,” he said.

In her first, she highlights a little-remarked upon aspect of the 2012 Presidential campaign--that George W. Bush, ""history's actor,"" the last Republican to hold the White House, presiding over our country for eight seemingly endless years--was nowhere to be seen.

It's an appropriate introduction for Dr. Maddow. The shadow of Bush looms not only over today's Republican Party, but on all of us, and especially on Maddow herself. In a real sense she owes her career--and Markos owes the success of this site--to the depravity of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.

Bush made no noteworthy appearances for any candidate in 2012. He was a non-entity at the Republican National Convention. Not even the corporate media that had fawned over his worst excesses seemed interested in what he thought--about anything. His was the ""name that shall not be named,"" terminating the lofty aspirations of his heir apparent brother and bringing the family dynasty to a screeching halt. For a two-term President to have been utterly shunted by his own Party to the silent dustbin of history is a singular accomplishment. Maddow points out that no former Bush official holds any major visible position in today's Republican hierarchy:

[B]y the time the Bush era was winding down, the whole administration, including the president, was stewed in terrible, Cheney-level disapproval ratings. And now, almost no one who played a significant role in that administration is anywhere to be found in electoral politics, beyond the tertiary orbits of Punch-and-Judy cable news and the remains of what used to be the conservative “think tank” circuit.

The 2008 Republican presidential primaries were like some odd eight-year cicada hatch in which the candidates went underground in 2000 and then birthed themselves after Bush and Cheney were gone, as if the intervening years had never happened.

2012 simply cemented the consensus felt by the GOP in 2008, that the Bush name carried the toxicity and accompanying shelf-life of a nuclear meltdown:The Bush legacy is so tainted that it has spawned an ideological shift in a GOP that, however dimly, recognizes that the face in the rear-view mirror is too hideous for most Americans to bear. Hence the outsized rise of the Libertarian elements in the party (perceived by Maddow as having at least the potential to win over a more youthful demographic). But even of those, the search for viable new leaders is crippled by the wreckage left in Bush's wake. The damage done by Bush to his own party is historic in and of itself.

She believes that the Bush experience contains a cautionary note for the Democrats as well. While President Obama's tenure is hardly likely to leave the negative blowback on the Democratic Party that Bush foisted on the GOP, the President's legacy to his Party is something he should be aware of and working on at this point in his second term. The rise of a more progressive breed of Democrats, particularly in the Senate, ought to inspire that effort going forward. And although hailed by the corporate soothsayers as the inevitable nominee in 2016, Hillary Clinton thus far (in Maddow's eyes) simply hasn't generated the grassroots enthusiasm one would expect from the Democratic base:



Unless Vice President Biden’s presidential hinting suddenly takes a turn for the serious, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton is the obvious inheritor of the party’s mantle. But, as in 2008, the Beltway may be overstating her inevitability. The grass roots aren’t all with her, frankly, and it’s yet to be seen if she’s interested in trying to win them over. Mainstream press may buy big-dollar donors (and more mainstream press), but it can’t buy the passionate volunteers and activists and excitement that are the oxygen for a winning campaign and sustained, effective leadership.



The bottom line? The President should be concerned about the legacy he leaves when he departs the Oval Office. And if Hillary is to inherit that legacy, she will first and foremost need to answer to us."

Here is a map of the whole state:

District 1: Mike Kelly (R-Butler)

Demographics: 94/3/2/1 (White/Black/Hispanic/Asian, all in VAP)

Prez 2008: 51-47 McCain

This district is improved for Kelly by including all of Butler County, which neatly drowns out Erie County. It also includes all of Crawford and Venango Counties, most of Mercer County, and a small part of Lawrence. SAFE R.

Southwest Pennsylvania:

District 2: Mike Doyle (D-Pittsburgh)

Demographics: 75/19/2/3

Prez 2008: 67-32 Obama

This district takes in all of Pittsburgh and most of its more Democratic inner suburbs. It’s quite similar to Doyle’s current district. This is one of the few Democratic districts in my map. SAFE D.

District 3: Keith Rothfus (R-Sewickley)

Demographics: 94/3/1/1

Prez 2008: 55-45 McCain

This district includes parts of Lawrence and Beaver Counties, the northern suburbs of Pittsburgh, NW Westmoreland County, and all of Armstrong County. Jason Altmire lives here, and could be a strong candidate for the Democrats, however this district is trending away from us, and it would be hard to dislodge an incumbent here. LEAN R with Altmire, SAFE R without Altmire

District 4: Tim Murphy (R-Upper St. Clair)

Demographics: 95/3/1/1

Prez 2008: 55-44 McCain

This district takes in the southern parts of Beaver and Allegheny Counties, and most of Washington and Westmoreland Counties, and then dips a finger into Cambria County to pick up Johnstown. This district is trending away from us, and Tim Murphy is a popular, entrenched incumbent. SAFE R.

District 5: Bill Shuster (R-Hollidaysburg)

Demographics: 94/3/1/1

Prez 2008: 56-43 McCain

This district takes in all of Greene, Fayette, Somerset, Bedford, Fulton, and Franklin Counties, as well as most of Cambria and parts of Washington, Westmoreland, and Indiana. This is actually the most Republican district in the state, which goes to show just how well I have gerrymandered the state. Shuster doesn’t actually live in this district (he lives in Blair County), but he would run here. The additions of Bedford, Fulton, and Franklin Counties to this district, which otherwise is similar to John Murtha’s old district, make it totally unwinnable for us. SAFE R.

District 6: Glenn “G.T.” Thompson (R-Bellefonte)

Demographics: 94/2/2/2

Prez 2008: 52-47 McCain

This district takes in vast, mostly rural section of northern and central Pennsylvania. It then stretches an arm out to Lackawanna County to pick up some Democrats there, with the goal of eliminating Matt Cartwright. Despite this, Thompson is a popular incumbent and can win Dem-leaning Centre County, so he is safe. SAFE R.

District 7: Tom Marino (R-Williamsport) and Matt Cartwright (D-Moosic)

Demographics: 92/3/3/1

Prez 2008: 54-45 McCain

This district slashes through the center of the state in an effort to crack Lackawanna County. It stretches from Scranton to Altoona, with lots of rural Republican areas in between. Marino may not be particularly well liked, but he doesn’t have to be, since Cartwright has no chance of winning here. SAFE R.

South-central Pennsylvania:

District 8: Lou Barletta (R-Hazleton)

Demographics: 93/2/4/1

Prez 2008: 52-47 McCain

This district also slashes through the center of the state, but its center of gravity is more to the north, where it takes in all of Luzerne County. It then goes all the way to the Maryland border where it takes in Adams County and Gettysburg. This district’s only blue area is Wilkes-Barre, and Barletta can do well there since he is from Luzerne County. SAFE R.

As a side note, this district also takes in part of Schuylkill County. When I drew this map, one of my first considerations was to ensure that a Tim Holden comeback does not happen. To this end, I split Schuylkill County into not two, not three, but FOUR pieces, each with a large chunk of the county’s voters. Holden has nowhere to run under this map.

District 9: Scott Perry (R-Carroll Township)

Demographics: 84/9/5/2

Prez 2008: 52-47 McCain

This district is quite similar to Perry’s current district. It contains all of York County, the city of Harrisburg, some suburbs in Cumberland County, and a small slice of Adams County. Perry is completely safe here, as Obama outperformed most Democrats in York County in 2008. SAFE R.

District 10: Open Seat

Demographics: 88/4/4/2

Prez 2008: 54-45 McCain

This district is the open seat that results from the dismantling of Matt Cartwright’s district. It begins in Wayne County, takes in Pike, Monroe, and Carbon, slices through Schuylkill, includes the Republican parts of Dauphin County, takes in a small slice of Cumberland County, and then finishes with heavily Republican northern Lancaster County. I’m not quite sure who would run here, but the winner of the election would definitely be a Republican. SAFE R.

Southeast Pennsylvania:

District 11: Charlie Dent (R-Allentown)

Demographics: 82/4/11/2

Prez 2008: 55-44 Obama

This district is similar to Dent’s current district. It includes all of Lehigh, most of Northampton except for Easton, a slice of Schuylkill including Pottsville, and an arm into Montgomery that includes heavily Republican Franconia Township. Seeing as Dent survived the 2006 and 2008 waves with little difficulty, I don’t see him losing this district. Tim Holden actually lives here, but he is unknown in the Lehigh Valley, so Dent would probably beat him. LEAN R with Holden, LIKELY R otherwise

District 12: Mike Fitzpatrick (R-Levittown)

Demographics: 88/4/4/4

Prez 2008: 54-45 Obama

This district includes all of Bucks County, Easton, and parts of Northeast Philadelphia. Fitzpatrick is a popular incumbent who ran six points ahead of Romney last year, so he should be mostly safe. However, since the district is probably an Obama district with the addition of Easton, I think it’s LIKELY R.

District 13: Jim Gerlach (R-West Pikeland Township)

Demographics: 82/5/10/2

Prez 2008: 50-49 Obama

This district weaves its way around eastern and southeastern Pennsylvania, taking in the fourth slice of Schuylkill County as well as Lebanon County and parts of Berks, Lancaster, and Chester. Romney won this district last year, Democrats generally do worse here downballot, and Jim Gerlach is a strong incumbent, so this district is SAFE R.

District 14: Joe Pitts (R-Kennett Square)

Demographics: 85/5/7/3

Prez 2008: 52-47 Obama

This district takes in mostly Republican areas of Lancaster, Chester, Delaware, and Berks Counties, as well as Pottstown in Montgomery County. This district, even more than the 13th, is heavily Republican downballot, and even though Pitts is a right-winger and Obama won here in 2008, Romney won here in 2012, and we have no bench here. Pitts is safe. SAFE R.

District 15: Chaka Fattah (D-Philadelphia)

Demographics: 33/52/5/8

Prez 2008: 90-10 Obama

Although Bob Brady currently represents a substantial chunk of this district, I think Fattah would run here because this district is majority-African-American while the other Democratic district in Philadelphia is not. Either way, this is completely safe for any Democrat. SAFE D.

District 16: Pat Meehan (R-Drexel Hill)

Demographics: 84/6/4/5

Prez 2008: 56-43 Obama

This district stretches from central Delaware County to outer Berks County, with a substantial chunk of Montgomery in between. Obama performed significantly worse here in 2012 than in 2008, and Pat Meehan is a strong incumbent (he outperformed Romney by about seven points last year). Meehan could probably hold this district down in a neutral year, but he would be vulnerable in a wave year. LEAN R.

District 17: Bob Brady (D-Philadelphia)

Demographics: 32/44/17/6

Prez 2008: 88-12 Obama

This district is the other Democratic district in Philadelphia. It takes in part of North and Northeast Philly, as well as most of Lower Merion and Cheltenham Townships. Brady is safe here, but if he retires this district would be a prime opportunity for an African-American. SAFE D.

District 18: Open Seat

Demographics: 82/7/4/6

Prez 2008: 56-43 Obama

This is the riskiest district I drew. It stretches from South Philly all the way to Berks County, and is politically divided between its north and south segments. Republicans would need a strong candidate to win and hold this seat, but luckily for them they have many in the State Legislature, including State Representative Tom Murt (R-Upper Moreland Township). Democrats would probably have to run a Montco-based candidate if they wanted to win here. How this district will vote depends on the candidates, but just based on the map I’d say it is a TOSSUP.

So there we go. This map would create 14 Republican districts, one Tossup district, and only three Democratic districts in the entire state. We should all feel lucky that Republicans didn’t draw this map.

But wait, there’s more…

State Senate

I’m not going to talk about each individual district here like I did with the Congressional districts, but I’ll talk about each region of the state.

Southwest Pennsylvania:

First, freshman State Senator Sean Wiley (D) keeps his Erie-based seat. It wasn't worth trying to dismantle this one. However, this map is less merciful with other Democratic State Senators. Matt Smith (D-Mount Lebanon Township) was combined with another Democratic State Senator, and a second Pittsburgh Democrat was drawn out of their seat as well. In addition, State Senators Rich Kasunic (D-Dunbar) and Tim Solobay (D-Canonsburg) have been combined in a Democratic vote sink, while the district of John Wozniak (D-Johnstown) has been split into several pieces, each of which is far too Republican for Wozniak to win in.

South-central Pennsylvania:

Moving on to central Pennsylvania, Rob Teplitz (D-Susquehanna Township) has been placed in an unwinnable district, while all the other districts remain heavily Republican. The two Democratic districts in NEPA have been combined into one, and I also created a Democratic vote sink in the Lehigh Valley to ensure that all the surrounding districts are Republican. I also eliminated Sen. Judy Schwank (D-Fleetwood) by splitting her district into three pieces: Reading goes with northern Lancaster, Reading’s suburbs go with Lancaster’s suburbs, and a new, all-rural Berks County district is created.

Southeast Pennsylvania:

In SEPA, drawing the districts was more about keeping the current incumbents safe, since SEPA is already pretty gerrymandered. I maintained the Bucks County gerrymander, took Chester out of Dominic Pileggi (R)’s district to make him safer, and split the district of Andy Dinniman (D-West Whiteland Township) into three pieces, each of which is pretty Republican. I also created a swing district entirely in the city of Philadelphia.

So in total, this map has:

12 Safe D

With this map, we’d be lucky if we got more than 15 Democrats in the State Senate, never mind a majority.

Is a gerrymander like this possible in the State House of Representatives as well? Yes, it is.

State House of Representatives

This section is going to be more maps than descriptions, since there are way too many districts (203) to go through.

Southwest Pennsylvania:

In general, I tried to combine Democratic areas into just one or two districts, and spread the moderate surrounding areas with conservative rural areas.

South-central Pennsylvania:

Other times, I went after particular incumbents, for example Rick Mirabito in Lycoming County. He’s a Democrat that represents a very Republican district. To get rid of him, I put his hometown of Williamsport in with heavily Republican Tioga County, because the voters there who don’t know him won’t vote for him.

Northeast Pennsylvania:

There are more swing districts in this map than in my other two maps. This was unavoidable; large areas of Pennsylvania are swingy, and sometimes, the districts just get too small to gerrymander.

Southeast Pennsylvania:

Many Republicans in SEPA represent districts that voted strongly for Obama in 2008, especially in Delaware County. I tried to protect these incumbents without sacrificing too many seats.

In a neutral year, Democrats would probably win around 65 of the 203 seats in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives with this map. We currently have 93 seats, so that's a very big drop.

It just goes to show that the Pennsylvania Republicans could have been a heck of a lot more ruthless with redistricting than they actually were, and we should definitely be thankful for that.

Questions, comments, concerns, and thoughts are all appreciated."

After leaving her office in the State Capitol last week to pick up her 11-year-old daughter from school, Ms. Tennant sat for a quiet-voices interview in the children’s section of the main branch of Charleston’s public library, while her daughter studied for a test.

She framed her candidacy as a contrast with “the dysfunction that Congresswoman Capito has continued to perpetuate” in Washington, citing the government shutdown in October.

Ms. Capito, 60, the daughter of a former governor here, said in an interview that she had opposed the shutdown and that she voted for the recent budget compromise that Tea Party-leaning Republicans rejected.

“I’ve been known as someone who reaches across the aisle,” she said. She spoke by phone from her home in Charleston, where she was readying an office Christmas party for her husband, Charles, an investment manager of Wells Fargo bank.

Ms. Capito is well liked by leaders of both parties in a small state where most people in public life know one another. Polls show her winning up to one in three Democratic votes. “I couldn’t be elected without Democrats,” she said.

More than in any other state, deep ties to King Coal expose Democrats’ vulnerability in West Virginia because of the national party’s stances on climate change and renewable energy. Both Ms. Tennant and Ms. Capito diverge sharply from the Obama administration on its coal policy, an issue that is often more emotional than economic in Appalachia, where jobs are being lost to cheaper natural gas as much as to environmental regulation."

The folly of secession, c1861, Currier & Ives

Like the die-hards of the racist South a century and a half ago, who would destroy the union before giving up their slaves, so would these people burn down the place, sink the ship.

At least let’s name this for what it is, sabotage of the democratic process. Secession by another means. And let’s be clear about where such reckless ambition leads. As surely as night must follow day, the alternative to democracy is worse.

It was Newt Gingrich who twenty years ago spearheaded the right-wing’s virulent crusade against the norms of democratic government. As Speaker of the House he twice brought about shutdowns of the federal government once, believe it or not, because he felt snubbed after riding on Air Force One with President Clinton and had to leave by the backdoor. It was also Newt Gingrich, speaker Gingrich, who was caught lying to congressional investigators looking into charges of his ethical wrongdoing. His colleagues voted overwhelmingly, 395 to 28, to reprimand him. Pressure from his own party then prompted him to resign. Yet even after his flame out, even after his recent bizarre race for the presidency bankrolled with money from admiring oligarchs, even after new allegations about his secret fundraising for right-wing candidates, Gingrich remains the darling of a fawning amnesic media.



In his recent essay, "" On the Sabotage of Democracy "" Bill Moyers, who I often think of as the conscience of America, calls out the forces who are trying to demolish democracy, and likens this shut-down to the time this nation was torn asunder by the Civil War.He is blunt in conclusion.In the essay he calls out the lies told by Rep. Steve King, Fox and Friends, Rush Limbaugh, and hones in on Newt Gingrich, reminding us:Thank you Bill Moyers.

And to those Teapublicans who do not remember history, perhaps you should think long and hard about who won that war, and the cost of it to us all.

But rather than serve as a fresh read on the feelings of an electorate tormented by the messy and combative budget mess in Washington, the closing days served up a bipartisan shoulder shrug.

Turnout was reported to be light, if steady, the former befitting a strangely-timed Wednesday election, just a few weeks before the regularly scheduled statewide elections. (The date was chosen by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican running for reelection next month; the Senate seat was held by Democrat Frank Lautenberg until his death in June.)

Democrat and Newark mayor Cory Booker was the Senate frontrunner throughout, helped by outside parties like New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s political organization, which aired ads on Booker’s behalf. Republican Steve Lonegan battled from behind, with tea party allies making verbal pitches for him but not tossing in the kind of cash that could have made the contest more competitive.

“New Jersey, the eyes of America are on you tomorrow,” former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said Tuesday, as she solicited volunteers nationwide to call in to New Jersey to persuade voters to cast ballots.

Lonegan’s chances seemed limited to the combination of strong tea party turnout and a flatlining for Booker among New Jersey’s dominant Democratic voters, a circumstance made easier by the selection of the Wednesday election day.

A poll released Monday showed Booker with a comfortable 10-point lead, though the Monmouth University pollsters cautioned that “turnout continues to be a big question in this unprecedented situation: a mid-October Wednesday election held just three weeks before the regularly scheduled November election for governor, state legislature, and a variety of local offices.”

The poll showed that, as can happen in contentious contests, voters had come to agree with the negative arguments made by both sides.

Almost half of likely voters — 48% — said Booker was seeking office to fashion a place on the national stage, to 37% who said he was interested in serving New Jersey. (That was a central argument by Lonegan, who made much of Booker’s Hollywood connections and frequent travel.)

But more likely voters than not also felt that Lonegan’s conservative views were out of step with the state, reflecting the thrust of Booker’s criticisms.

“Concerns about Cory Booker’s intentions to serve New Jersey continue to persist and his favorability ratings continue to drop. At the same time, voters clearly prefer Booker’s political views over Lonegan’s,” Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement.

As election day neared, both candidates did what candidates do before special elections: try to maximize the turnout of their voters by any means possible.

“I am asking for your vote today in this pivotal race for #NJ & America,” Lonegan told supporters via Twitter. “The polls close at 8P. Thank you for your support.” @lonegan

Booker received a blizzard of tweets from supporters noting that they had cast ballots for him. “Thank you! Please encourage others to do so,” he said.

(CNN) —

If you want to know why there’s little cooperation in Washington these days, I’d start with a campaign promise made in 1988 by presidential candidate George H.W. Bush.

“Read my lips: No new taxes.”

So, when he raised taxes two years later, quite naturally, voters, particularly conservatives, were upset.

If you want to know why so little is being accomplished in Washington these days, I’d start with that broken promise and what Bush did in an attempt to get those conservatives back.

He carried Rush Limbaugh’s bags.

That’s right. In 1992, President Bush invited Limbaugh for a sleepover and personally brought his guest’s bags into the Lincoln bedroom for him

ESPN LZ Granderson

They were not friends.

In fact, Limbaugh didn’t care for Bush that much, and “41” knew it. But Bush was seeking re-election. He was saddled with a slumping economy and locked in a tough battle with Gov. Bill Clinton and businessman Ross Perot.

He believed he needed Rush Limbaugh.

The party has been carrying Limbaugh’s bags ever since.

So, if you want to know when Washington became so polarized, maybe we should circle August 1, 1988, exactly 25 years ago. That was the day a satirical talk show host syndicated his act and, in the process, made a lot of money and became one of the most influential figures in American politics today.

“Have any of you heard of an individual by the name of LZ Granderson?” Limbaugh asked on his show in June 2012. “Snerdley? He has not heard of LZ Granderson. Dawn, have you? Brian, have you heard of LZ Granderson? Prior to last night I had not heard of LZ Granderson.”

Which isn’t true.

In June 2011, Limbaugh brought me up on his show as well, going so far as to say, “You can blame me, LZ Granderson, all you want, and I’ll take it.”

It only takes a few seconds on “The Rush Limbaugh Show” website to find out those facts. But Limbaugh isn’t on the air to provide facts, he’s there to entertain. Many of his listeners understand that.

And many of them don’t.

A 1994 New York Times article leading into the midterm election called Limbaugh “a kind of national precinct captain for the Republican insurgency of 1994” and documented caller after caller legitimately asking the Mahi Rushie – he calls himself that on occasion – for guidance.

Not much has changed.

During the Affordable Health Care Act debate, callers were actually asking Limbaugh, a shock jock in the mold of Howard Stern, what was in the bill. He even threatened to move to Costa Rica if it was implemented, which seemed counterintuitive, considering Costa Rica has universal health care.

But it’s moments like that when you remember that Limbaugh’s purpose isn’t to provide thoughtful political discourse. It’s to vent on his listeners’ behalf, to appeal to their censored side. The side that wants to hear a white man say “nigga” in public or call a woman a “slut” without getting fired.

If that makes you laugh, then he’s doing his job.

If that disgusts you, well that’s his job, too.

Limbaugh has had us on this yo-yo since the moment he assumed the role of Gabriel in the Kingdom of Reagan 25 years ago. Back then, it was only offensive, because he was the party’s megaphone, warning listeners about the impending invasion of welfare queens with his mixture of righteous indignation and half-truths. It became destructive when listeners and politicians alike made him its spokesman: a pseudo-politician free from the burden of actually having to do anything.

Like use facts.

In rebutting the legitimacy of climate change, Limbaugh once told listeners the United States had more acreage of forest land today than at the time the Constitution was written. That wasn’t true, of course, but it sounded good.

Not too long ago, he read what he believed to be passages from Obama’s senior thesis, passages that expressed a disdain for the U.S. Constitution. Sadly, the whole thing was made up by a blogger. And while Limbaugh did sheepishly tell listeners what he had read earlier was false, the host still found a way to justify reading it by saying, “We know he thinks it.”

Some folks eat that kind of stuff up.

Some get riled up about it.

And the folks in Washington? Well, after 25 years, they’re still not quite sure what to do with it or him. If you’re a Democrat, do you ignore him? If you’re a Republican, do you carry his bags? I imagine it’s like that feeling you get when someone tells you something that you can’t determine is a joke or not. You just stand there half-smiling like an idiot.

So, if you want to know what the folks in Washington are doing about the economy, I’d start there.

McAuliffe leads with 43 percent over Cuccinelli's 38 percent among likely voters that include those undecided but leaning toward a candidate for November's election, according to the survey by NBC4/NBC News and the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. Cuccinelli is Virginia's attorney general, in a state dominated by Republican officeholders, but which went for Democrat Barack Obama in last year's presidential election. Republican Bob McDonnell is the current governor but state law bars him from running for re-election. McAuliffe's lead is negligible when the margin of error of plus or minus 4.2 percentage points is factored in. But it does mark a shift from a NBC4/NBC News and Marist poll in May showing the two candidates tied. ""None of the candidates has reached a comfort level with voters,"" said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute. Last week, in a poll conducted by Quinnipiac University, McAuliffe led by 3 points, within that survey's margin of error. McAuliffe led Cuccinelli when voters were asked which candidate came closer to their social views, cared more about the middle class, shared their values, understood residents' problems and could be trusted more to do what's best for Virginia. Cuccinelli led when voters were asked which candidate would be better for business and had the experience to be governor. Cuccinelli has been ensnared in a scandal involving the chief executive of Star Scientific Inc, Jonnie Williams, who gave gifts to him and McDonnell. Cuccinelli has said he would give a charity $18,000, the value of the gifts he received from Williams. The landline and cellphone poll by NBC4/NBC News and Marist was conducted September 17 to 19. New Jersey is the only other state with a gubernatorial election in November. Incumbent Republican Chris Christie, seen as a likely presidential candidate in 2016, holds a strong lead over Democratic state Senator Barbara Buono, according to recent polls.

Sarah Palin announced that she will travel to Washington, D.C. on Sunday to support and honor the veterans who will be arriving for the “Million Vet March” on the memorials.

Speaking at a rally for New Jersey Republican Senate candidate Steve Lonegan along with Mark Levin on Saturday, Palin denounced the Obama administration for dishonoring veterans by barricading the World War II Memorial during the federal government shutdown. She said it was “heart-wrenching,” “atrocious,” and “not right.”

“We’re going to zip on in to D.C.,” Palin said of herself and her husband Todd. “We’re going to shake hands with those vets who are being dishonored.”

Palin then accused the Obama administration of “using our military as pawns” during the government shutdown with such actions.

She also mentioned that the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), whose seat Lonegan and Democrat Cory Booker are running for, was the last World War II veteran to serve in Congress and noted that his memory was also being dishonored by the Obama administration’s actions.

Palin said the memorials serve to remind Americans of “the cost to provide for this exceptional nation” and the price Americans have had to pay to fight “against tyranny” and “for liberty.”

Palin noted that the memorials, though they received some federal assistance, were also built with private donations.

“And our government thinks they can shut down our memorials that honor our vets?” Palin said. “For shame.”

Palin has previously urged Obama administration employees to engage in acts of civil disobedience at the “Barrycades.” At the “Million Vet March”, veterans will demand that the Obama administration re-open the memorials and urge Congress to pass legislation to forbid the memorials from being closed in future government shutdowns."

[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']



(CNN) - It's one of the country's hallmark political slugfests. And on Saturday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was dealt a large portion of the blows.

At Kentucky's annual Fancy Farm picnic, politicians from the state gather at the event hosted by St. Jerome's Catholic Church in Graves County, tucked away in the southwest corner of the Blue Grass State.



Elected leaders and candidates give short speeches before a crowd of hecklers and supporters. Audience members can shout, jeer, boo and taunt as loud as they want. Only ground rules? No profanity, sexist or racist comments. Oh, and no artificial noisemakers.

""This isn't the World Cup,"" the moderator said Saturday before introducing the speakers. The event was recorded by CNN affiliate KET.

From the outside, it can be seen as a daunting task: Try to get your voice heard in a roomful of people who either admire you or want to see you crash and burn, with both sides trying to drown out the other.

But the candidates for next year's U.S. Senate seat in Kentucky seemed to embrace the tradition, especially McConnell's opponents from both the left and right, who delivered slam after slam to the five-term incumbent.

McConnell vs. Grimes: Let's get ready to rumble

For his part, the senator was up first but hardly acknowledged the presence of his Democratic foe, Alison Lundergan Grimes. Instead, his most stinging remark was directed at her father, a top Democratic figure in Kentucky who has deep ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton.

""I want to say how nice it is to see Jerry Lundergan back in the game,"" McConnell said, before making a dig about Mr. Lundergan's financial contribution to Anthony Weiner's mayoral campaign in New York City.

A veteran of Fancy Farm, McConnell continued on and tried to speak above the raucous crowd, facing shouts of ""Go Grimes Go!""

His key message? This campaign will be between McConnell and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, not Grimes.

""We're not just choosing who's going to represent Kentucky in the Senate; we're going to decide who's going to run the Senate,"" he said.

If Republicans win control of the chamber next year, McConnell would become Senate majority leader.

""It's really quite simple,"" he added. ""Here's the choice: Obama's Nevada 'yes-man,' or a Kentuckian to run the Senate.""

McConnell backers–mostly wearing red shirts and holding signs that read ""Team Mitch""–gave thundering applause to the longtime incumbent. While he hasn't officially announced his re-election bid for 2014, he gave no indication he had any plans to sit this one out.

""We're going to have a great campaign. It's going to be a lot of fun,"" he said, exiting the stage.

McConnell stayed on stage when Grimes, the youngest female secretary of state in the country, took the podium in one of her first public speeches as the main Democratic challenger. The 34-year-old, whose grandmother sat next to her on stage, dove right in, delivering far more hard-hitting lines than McConnell.

""Let's just tell it like it is: If the doctor told Senator McConnell he had a kidney stone, he'd refuse to pass it,"" she said, getting a big response from the crowd.

Web wars start early in crucial 2014 Senate battle

Wearing a sleeveless red dress, Grimes looked confident and her delivery was polished, though clearly rehearsed, with a voice that seemed to carry beyond McConnell's in the boisterous environment.

With McConnell sitting just feet from her, she pulled no punches as she sought to paint the senator as the most despised lawmakers in the country. Her speech offered a preview of what will likely be sure attack lines in the coming months.

""There's a reason McConnell is disliked, not only by Kentucky but by the entire United States, and that's because there is a disease of dysfunction in Washington, D.C. And after 30 years, Senator McConnell is at the center of it,"" she said. ""As long as he remains in Washington, D.C., DC will stand for Dysfunctional Capital.""

McConnell sat still with his arms crossed, occasionally smiling.

Grimes seemed unfazed by the McConnell supporters shouting ""We want Mitch!"" and kept her eyes trained mostly on her supporters' side of the venue. Dropping the words ""gridlock"", ""obstruction"" and ""partisanship"" to describe McConnell and Washington Republicans, Grimes did not hold back in trying to define the minority leader.

The secretary of state, who was elected to office in 2011, also took time to poke fun at herself, making a joke about her lengthy name.

""Because it's such a long name, my grandmother and I decided we would do something about that,"" she said. ""With your help, Kentucky, come January 2015, you can call me senator.""

Matt Bevin, McConnell's GOP primary challenger, was also ready to pounce. But by the time Bevin took the stage, McConnell had already left the scene.

His absence clearly egged Bevin on. The candidate asked his family to come stand behind him at the podium since McConnell had left room on stage. Grimes, meanwhile, remained in place.

""Mitch McConnell has amazingly disappeared...maybe we can call him back,"" he said, as he started a chant: ""Where's Mitch? Where's Mitch?""

Bevin, a businessman with tea party ties, hit McConnell on immigration, jobs, and financial bailouts. On Obamacare, Bevin said McConnell should stop simply talking about the pitfalls of the health care law but stand side-by-side with conservative senators who want to defund it altogether.

Primary challenger to top Senate Republican lands conservative endorsement

""Be a man. Stand up. And put your money where your mouth is,"" Bevin said.

The candidate, who had launched his campaign the week prior, appeared remarkably comfortable at the podium for a first-time candidate.

Conservative challenger takes on top Senate Republican

Bevin supporters rang bells throughout the speech, a coordinated move that went along with his line: ""The bells toll for you, senator.""

""I don't intend to run to the right of Mitch McConnell. I don't intend to run to the left of Mitch McConnell,"" he said. ""I intend to run straight over the top of Mitch McConnell and right into the U.S. Senate."""

(CNN) – Republican U.S. Senate candidate Gabriel Gomez is calling on his Massachusetts opponent, Democratic Rep. Ed Markey, to take down a web video showing him on screen with Osama bin Laden.

""Career Politician Ed Markey has started his campaign with a textbook despicable political attack to attempt to connect me with Osama bin Laden in the minds of voters,"" Gomez said Saturday.



The former Navy SEAL called the video an ""insult to my service and an insult to the intelligence of the people of Massachusetts,"" demanding his opponent take the video down immediately.

But Markey's campaign sees things differently, pointing to Gomez's past work for the special interest group called Special Operations OPSEC Education Fund, which accused President Barack Obama of ""politically capitalizing on U.S. national security operations and secrets"" after the bin Laden raid.

""Gabriel Gomez is now attacking Ed Markey for a web video containing video footage of Gomez's own advertisement that accused President Obama of politicizing the death of Osama bin Laden, and risking Americans' lives,"" Markey's campaign said responding to Gomez's demand for the ad to be taken down.

In the web video, titled ""Meet Gabriel Gomez: Just Another Republican"" shows a clip from MSNBC where Gomez and an image of the September 11, 2001, terrorist mastermind are displayed side-by-side. In the clip, Gomez is seen defending the group.

In denouncing the video, Gomez's campaign sent out a release Saturday with Medal of Honor Recipient Thomas Hudner calling Markey's ad ""dishonorable"" but Markey's campaign suggests their opponent is being hypocritical.

The controversy comes just days after each candidate won his party’s nomination to contest for the open Senate seat left vacant when John Kerry became secretary of state.

The two will compete in the special election on June 25. William ""Mo"" Cowan is currently serving as interim senator, appointed by Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick.

The race has been overshadowed by the Boston Marathon bombing that left three people dead and more than 260 others injured.

The candidates suspended campaigning for nearly a week following the attack. Though the campaigns are up and running again, media attention continues to be saturated with the bombing investigation.

Washington (CNN) - Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said she would be ""disappointed"" in the American electorate if Hillary Clinton becomes a serious candidate for president in 2016.

The 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee argued Clinton would not be right for the role as commander in chief after four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya, died last year in a terrorist attack against a U.S. consulate in Benghazi.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

""If (Benghazi) doesn't have an impact on the 2016 presidential election, if she is a candidate, then America, I am very disappointed in our electorate,"" Palin said Sunday on Fox News, where she's a contributor.

She said ""anyone who would just throw away 200 years of military ethos and leave our men behind to be murdered"" should ""never be considered as a commander in chief.""

The lack of security at the consulate and the September 11, 2012 attack are poised to be a major point of contention by Republicans if Clinton decides to run for president. Clinton ultimately took responsibility for diplomats' safety, and was grilled before two congressional committees in January.

At one point she lost her temper while responding to questions from Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin. He was asking her about the erroneous, initial talking points that claimed the attack stemmed from a spontaneous protest against an anti-Islam video, though the administration later defined it as a terrorist attack and said a protest never happened.

""What difference at this point does it make?"" Clinton responded. ""It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, senator.""

The attack on Benghazi is still a matter of congressional investigation by House Republicans.

""That's why I'm so grateful for Congress to be pursuing what happened in Benghazi,"" Palin said. ""Because at this point, it still makes a difference what happens in Benghazi.""

""Anyone who doesn't understand that and dismisses it as being indifferent, they should not be our commander in chief,"" she continued.

For her part, Clinton said in a recent interview with New York Magazine that she is in no hurry to decide about a potential 2016 bid for the White House, saying it is a decision ""not to be made lightly.""

Asked how she plans to combat any conflicts she may face related to her political legacy, she said the best course is to ""find common ground.""

""I have a lot of reason to believe, as we saw in the 2012 election, most Americans don't agree with the extremists on any side of an issue,"" Clinton said in the interview. ""But there needs to continue to be an effort to find common ground, or even take it to higher ground on behalf of the future.""

Palin's comments mark a stark contrast to high praise Clinton received Sunday from House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who said if Clinton decides to run, ""she will win.""

Mike Enzi, a popular conservative Enzi said that Cheney told him she would not run if he ran for re-election

(CNN) —

The U.S. Senate race in Wyoming has it all: A popular incumbent Republican facing a primary challenge, a GOP feud, a generational divide, and Dick Cheney, one of the most polarizing figures in politics.

Liz Cheney met with reporters in Casper on Wednesday, one day after announcing her bid for the seat. It came on the same day that three-term Republican Sen. Mike Enzi said he would run for re-election.

“I’m focused on earning every vote I can, the way it ought to be done in Wyoming, which is one person at a time,” Cheney said.

Enzi says Wyoming voters will stick with him

Cheney, a former State Department official and Fox News contributor, is the eldest daughter of the former vice president, who served for a decade as the congressman from Wyoming.

Like her father, Cheney is a very vocal critic of President Barack Obama.

“President Obama has launched a war on our Second Amendment rights. He has launched a war on our religious freedom. He has used the IRS to launch a war on our freedom of speech. He has used the EPA to launch a war on Wyoming’s ranchers, farmers and energy industry,” said Cheney in a statement announcing her bid.

CNN Chief National Correspondent John King, who covered the Cheneys over the years, says Liz Cheney has been a very loyal aide to her father.

Liz Cheney announces Senate run

“Clearly she has his blessing or she wouldn’t do it,” King said. “If her dad had turned to her and said ‘Don’t do this,’ she wouldn’t have done this. In her putting her neck out, in her offending Mike Enzi and everyone else in the Wyoming Republican party, so has her dad.”

Enzi is a proven conservative but has been willing to try to accomplish bipartisan solutions in the Senate.

While not directly criticizing him in her announcement, Cheney said, “I am running because I know as a mother and as a patriot, we can no longer afford simply to go along to get along.”

And the 46-year-old Cheney appears to be making Enzi’s age an issue, saying, “I believe it is necessary for a new generation of leaders to step up to the plate.”

Enzi is 69.

One veteran analyst of Senate races isn’t sure the age argument will be effective.

“She is running against an incumbent from her own party who has a solidly conservative voting record and is well-liked by voters. Her theme seems to be Enzi’s age, but I don’t know that it will play that well,” said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor for the non-partisan Cook Political Report.

But the primary will highlight the ongoing struggle for the future of the GOP.

“This race now will be the highest-profile test of what’s happening in the Republican Party, the struggle over whether you fight and compromise or do you fight and keep fighting. This race will capture huge national attention,” King added.

Enzi says he’s not surprised he’s being challenged.

“She’s been traveling around Wyoming for a long time, so I’m not surprised. I’m only surprised in that she said if I ran she wouldn’t. She announced 30 minutes after I more specifically stated my intention,” Enzi told CNN Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash on Wednesday.

And he pushed back on his age, telling Bash, “I’m absolutely not too old to be a senator. I’m about the median age for this body. I’m in really good health, I’m on the committees that I want to be on. I have seniority.”

And Enzi doesn’t think his ability to work with Democrats is a liability, saying “I’ve developed trust on both sides of the aisle, people trust me that what I say I’m going to do, I do.”

On Tuesday Enzi told reporters that he wouldn’t change his plans to run for a fourth term, but admitted to reporters that fundraising has “always been a problem for me.”

But he told Bash that people in Wyoming “complain about long campaigns. It doesn’t take them long to make up their mind. And it doesn’t cost a lot of money to have them make up their mind.”

Enzi appears to have the backing of the two other members of Wyoming’s congressional delegation.

“I think that Mike has done an excellent job representing the people of Wyoming and I’m going to continue to work to support Mike Enzi, Sen. John Barrasso told CNN on Wednesday.

“I have a great deal of respect for the entire Cheney family, for the vice president, for Liz and for Lynn, but I think it’s the wrong race at the wrong time,” he said.

Republican Rep. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming ripped Cheney’s decision as “bad form” and predicted she would lose in the GOP primary next year.

“I don’t know that anybody can out-conservative Mike Enzi,” Lummis told CNN Senior Congressional Producer Deirdre Walsh and other reporters outside the House chamber on Tuesday.

The congresswoman, Wyoming’s at-large representative, admitted Cheney had the upper hand in raising money, but said that wouldn’t matter.

“She will outraise him by factors of 10 or more, and he will still win because Wyoming is grassroots, retail campaigning,” she said.

The National Republican Senatorial Committee was quick to say it stands firmly behind Enzi, the GOP incumbent.

“Our mission is to re-elect our incumbents and build a Republican majority,” NRSC Communications Director Brad Dayspring told CNN.

Cheney, who chairs a nonprofit on national security and education called Keep America Safe, had been rumored this year to be considering a Senate run.

Early last week, former Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming told the New York Times that a potential Cheney primary challenge would bring about “the destruction of the Republican Party of Wyoming,” adding that, “It’s a disaster – a divisive, ugly situation – and all it does is open the door for the Democrats for 20 years.”

Simpson had a different message after Cheney’s announcement on Tuesday.

“I deeply care about them both,” he said, according to the Casper Star Tribune.

Cheney will come under attack for being a carpetbagger. She was born in Wisconsin and grew up in Virginia’s D.C. suburbs before attending college in Colorado and law school in Illinois. She spent most of her career working in the nation’s capital before moving to Wyoming last year.

Cheney touted her family’s longtime Wyoming roots in a speech in May and in her announcement Tuesday.

He highlighted that her family “first came here in 1852, in search of religious freedom,” adding that her grandmother “was raised in the Salt Creek oil field and grew up to become Natrona County’s first female deputy sheriff.”

Will the carpetbagger tag stick?

There have already been comparisons to Hillary Clinton. In 2000 the first lady, who grew up in Illinois and lived for many years in Arkansas, successfully ran for the U.S. Senate in New York, but faced the carpetbagger attacks.

“What did Hillary Clinton have? She had national name identification. She had a giant fundraising network, she had a bunch of people willing to work for her and willing to fight and she ran a very effective campaign and she won,” King recalled.

As for Cheney, he said, “She will have money. She has the name identification. Now the test is, since she’s new to politics, can she run a campaign. Can she convince the people of Wyoming that she’s right.”

By some forecasts, it may not be a pretty sight.

Gathered with him that evening were several of the nation’s leading historians, who reminded him of the sorry litany of second terms — the cascade of scandal, war, recession, political defeat and other calamities that afflicted past presidents after the heady crescendo of re-election.

For Mr. Obama, who will be sworn in for another four years in a quiet ceremony on Sunday and then again in more public fashion on Monday, the lessons were familiar if daunting. Embarking on the next half of his presidency, he and his advisers are developing a second-term strategy intended to avoid the pitfalls of his predecessors with a robust agenda focused on the economy, gun control, immigration and energy.

“We’ve talked a lot about this,” said David Plouffe, the president’s senior adviser who is leaving the White House at the end of the week. “We have spent a lot of time trying to figure out both what to pursue but also these issues of making sure you’re bringing the same sort of energy and same sort of focus as the first term.”"

George H.W. Bush, for example, is someone whose legacy has grown -- in a good way -- because of the work he did after he lost to Bill Clinton in 1992. Clinton, too, has largely aided his political legacy by his active involvement in both Democratic campaigns and humanitarian efforts since leaving office. (The exception to that rule for Clinton was his campaigning on behalf of his wife in 2008, which took some of the shine off his reputation.)"

Kennedy asked Frank Sinatra to produce his inaugural celebration in 1961 Beyonce, James Taylor and others will perform this year at Monday's ceremony

Many Americans recall the image of Barack Obama standing on the steps of the Capitol as he was sworn in as the 44th president of the United States in 2009.

But they also remember Aretha Franklin, and how she belted out “My Country, ‘Tis of Thee” wearing an enormous bow that threatened to engulf her entire head.

Later that night, Beyonce crooned “At Last” while the Obamas took their first spin on the dance floor as POTUS and FLOTUS.

This time, Beyonce will perform the national anthem, with Kelly Clarkson singing “My Country, ‘Tis of Thee” and James Taylor doing the honors on “America the Beautiful.”

Inaugural events have spotlighted the intersection of politics, pop culture and music since the early ‘60s, said David Gergen, director of the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard University.

“The person that really changed the nature of inaugural music was John Kennedy, because he was a friend with many in Hollywood – especially Frank Sinatra,” said Gergen, also a CNN contributor. “Sinatra came in and co-produced one of the great shows at an inauguration … and that became sort of the standard.”

Who will be there: Celebrities flock to D.C. for inauguration

Kennedy was 43 when he was elected. Bill Clinton and Obama were also in their 40s for their first terms in the Oval Office.

“The younger the president, the more we see a connection to pop culture and to music,” said Phil Gallo, senior correspondent for Billboard. “So Kennedy, you have it. Nixon, you don’t.”

At Richard Nixon’s first inauguration in 1969, the crowd was treated to “This is My Country” performed by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir of Salt Lake City, according to the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.

Gallo believes you can learn a lot about a commander in chief by the musical acts he chooses to spotlight. “George W. Bush loved to portray himself as a Texas rancher. Therefore, what’s a Texas rancher listen to? Country.” So Brooks & Dunn and Clint Black headlined his first inaugural celebration in 2001.

In 1977, Jimmy Carter looked to his regional roots for inspiration. “Jimmy Carter, he was a Georgian,” Gallo explains. “At that time, that meant the stars of Southern rock. So the Allman Brothers are in the White House.”

Sometimes the musicians are joined on stage by the president himself.

In 1989, George H.W. Bush strummed a guitar with B.B. King at one of his inaugural galas, while in 1993, Clinton grabbed a saxophone for a duet with the E Street Band’s Clarence Clemons. But even they were upstaged by the five members of Fleetwood Mac, who famously reunited to perform their megahit that became Clinton’s campaign song, “Don’t Stop.”

Frontman Lindsey Buckingham recalls the mood that night. “It was extremely exhilarating and exciting to do a song that you’ve done a million times, but doing it in a completely different context. As we were going out with the tag, ‘Don’t you look back, don’t you look back,’ Bill comes up, and Hillary comes up and shakes our hands. It was just one of those experiences you’ll never forget.”

Lessons in style from Michelle Obama

That one performance caused Fleetwood Mac members to rethink old grievances with each other.

“Oddly enough, it did act as the catalyst for me to sort of reconsider my options, shall we say, and the band got back together,” Buckingham chuckled.

This year’s festivities include a Kids’ Inaugural Concert on Saturday and two official balls on Monday night. Performers for those events include Katy Perry, Brad Paisley, Alicia Keys, Marc Anthony, Stevie Wonder and Smokey Robinson – a mix of pop, country, R & B, Latin, rock and old-school hitmakers.

Gallo says Obama’s lineup is deliberately inclusive to reflect his campaign agenda – but it could just as easily reflect the playlist of the first family.

“It almost looks more like they booked it by looking at the iPod of Barack and Michelle, and then looking at the iPod of their daughters.”

Expect Obama’s second-term events to be more celebratory than his first-term functions.

“The first time around, we heard songs that had a message that you wouldn’t have heard in previous inaugurations – ‘A Change is Gonna Come,’ ‘We Shall Overcome.’ We had people reflecting on the civil rights movement, the fact that we had our first African-American president,” said Gallo. “Now, I think it’ll be a little more up-tempo, a little peppier. People want a bit of a diversion as we start to think about the next four years.”

Gergen doesn’t disagree. “Presidents often choose to make statements about who they are, and what their hopes and aspirations are through the music, through the inaugural address, through the people they bring together there.”

By Kevin Murphy

KANSAS CITY, Kan. Oct 8 (Reuters) - Milton Wolf, a Tea Party activist and distant cousin of President Barack Obama, will challenge three-term Kansas U.S. Senator Pat Roberts in the 2014 Republican primary election, Wolf's campaign said on Tuesday.

Wolf, 42, a radiologist, will make the formal announcement on Tuesday evening, according to his website. Campaign manager Ben Hartman confirmed his candidacy.

""If you think that the career politicians in both parties have failed America, join us,"" Wolf said on his website. ""We are building the Wolf Pack - an Army of Davids to defeat the Goliaths...""

Wolf did not respond to a call or email seeking comment.

Wolf said on his website that he is related to Obama through the president's mother, Ann Dunham, who was born in Kansas. Obama's grandmother, Madelyn Dunham, who had a major role in raising the president, is Wolf's mother's cousin, he said.

Roberts, 77, is the latest Senate Republican incumbent to get a challenge from the right in the primary campaign. The others are Michael Enzi of Wyoming, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Enzi's challenger is Liz Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney.

Roberts is ranked by several groups as one of the most conservative senators and he is ready to run on that record, Leroy Towns, his executive campaign manager, said on Tuesday.

""It will be pretty hard for anyone to get on the conservative side of Pat Roberts,"" said Towns.

Roberts' reelection campaign has already raised about $2 million, Towns said. Although Wolf has no experience in politics, Towns said Roberts will take the challenge seriously.

Wolf said he is proud that America elected its first black president in 2008, but that he has ""profound differences"" with the president.

""Tragically, he misunderstands the greatness of America and believes it is founded in our bloated bureaucracies and government regulations,"" Wolf said on his website. ""He believes America suffers because our government is too small. I believe our greatness is found in our free people and a free market.""

Texas Sen. Wendy Davis

2014 is election year in Texas, and Rick Perry will be running for an unprecedented fourth term. Maybe . We'll know soon enough. But either way, voters will be deciding on their next governor at that time.

Texas has been inhospitable to Democrats for a while. In fact, it's been a full generation (20 years), since the Democrats last won a statewide-elected office in the state. And while demographic changes are shaking up the state, its poor-performing Latino community (51st in the nation in voter participation) has severely undermined Democratic chances.

But polling has already showed Hillary Clinton competitive in hypothetical 2016 Texas matchups, the same polling that also showed this:





@ppppolls In January we found Wendy Davis trailing Rick Perry just 47-41 despite- at that time- pretty low name recognition: http://t.co/...

No one knew who Wendy Davis was when that poll was conducted. It's a whole different reality today for the Fort Worth Democrat.

The problem with Texas isn't that Republicans outnumber our people, it's that our people don't vote—Latinos, African Americans, young voters, single women, etc.

Last night's epic filibuster (the talking kind, which are okay) was a national phenomenon, Battleground Texas is rebuilding the state's infrastructure, millions of Latinos will be left uninsured thanks to Perry's rejection of Obamacare, and so on. Things are changing at the speed of light.

Wendy Davis would nationalize that Texas governor's race, and help accelerate the state's transition to Purple (and eventually Blue) status.

So what do you think? Should we launch a draft movement?

Update: So the answer was ""hell yes!"". Click here to join the Draft Wendy Davis movement. Lend your name, leave an encouraging message, and drop a few dollars if you've got 'em into her campaign. Let's show her we've got her back!

Because Davis will turn Texas Blue ahead of schedule."

But a rare sequence of events is drawing some big names to an off-season congressional race in South Carolina's Low Country.

A primary is scheduled for March 19 to fill the U.S. House seat of now-Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C. In December, Gov. Nikki Haley appointed Scott to succeed former Republican Sen. Jim DeMint, who resigned to become president of the conservative Heritage Foundation.

With no incumbent, the field was wide open for both novice and experienced politicians to enter the race for South Carolina's Republican-leaning 1st Congressional District. The candidates have poured in; two Democrats and 16 Republicans are running.

Mark Sanford, who represented this district for three terms in the U.S. House from 1995 to 2001 before being elected governor in 2002, is the GOP frontrunner. Hand-painted campaign signs underscore his reputation as a fiscal conservative.

""Folks have had a lot of fun with it,"" said Sanford, also a former Fox News contributor. ""Ultimately, campaigns are about messages. And it's certainly a reinforcement of what people have come to know about me for 20 years.""

Sanford's apparent lead comes less than four years after he secretly left the country for an extramarital affair. Several days into his 2009 disappearance, Sanford announced through a spokesman that he was hiking the Appalachian Trail. But when confronted by reporters upon his return, he admitted he had actually been in Argentina visiting his mistress Maria Belen Chapur.

The revelation ultimately ended Sanford's marriage. At the time, many thought it would also end his political career. Sanford was among them.

""I, for all the obvious reasons ... thought that politics was forever over for me,"" said Sanford, who's now engaged to Chapur.

But when the District 1 vacancy arose, Sanford said friends convinced him he had a rare opportunity to do something about spending in Washington, using everything he had learned at the statehouse, on Capitol Hill and even from his personal scandal.

""If you go through the experience that I went through, it humbles you,"" Sanford said. ""And I think that if there's anything that's needed in Washington, D.C., right now it's a little bit greater level of humility from either party's perspective in where they're coming from.""

While Sanford runs on his experience, fellow Republican Teddy Turner, the son of billionaire media mogul and CNN founder Ted Turner, is running against the political establishment.

""We can't send more politicians to Washington,"" Turner said. ""It's the definition of insanity -- doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result.""

As a high school economics teacher, Turner is no career politician. However, his family name recognition is a mixed blessing for a Republican trying to distance himself from his father's liberal views.

""I've had a lot of access to a lot of great things in my life because of my father,"" Turner said. ""That part is a huge asset. I am who I am because of him. But in a political race, it makes it a lot more difficult because people assume they know who you are. Just they hear the name. They assume. And they also assume, unfortunately, that I'm liberal.""

Turner is not the only candidate with a famous family member. On the Democratic side, political satirist and comedian Stephen Colbert is bringing his star power to the campaign of his sister, Elizabeth Colbert Busch.

""With 11 brothers and sisters, you'd better learn how to negotiate,"" Colbert Busch told reporters at a recent campaign event.

Colbert Busch faces an uphill battle running as a Democrat in a district that favors Republicans. However, her career in maritime trade and involvement in economic development initiatives have earned the respect of many in the business community, according to Kendra Stewart, a political science professor at the College of Charleston.

""There's a lot of Yankee Republicans in this district who are more concerned with fiscal issues than social issues,"" Stewart said. ""So, they would be much more willing to consider a candidate who wasn't terribly left-leaning, but was a Democrat who had good business values and maybe a little more fiscally conservative.""

Colbert Busch has another advantage in that she faces only one Democratic challenger in the March 19 special primary, perennial candidate Ben Frasier. But with 16 contenders vying for the GOP nomination, it's unlikely any Republican will pass the 50 percent of the vote threshold needed to avoid a runoff on April 2.

Colbert Busch ""can step back and save all her money and watch the Republicans slug it out, while she capitalizes on their attacks on each other,"" Stewart said.

""We need to pass a budget,"" said Republican candidate Larry Grooms, who currently serves in the South Carolina State Senate. ""It needs to be a responsible budget. And we need to learn to live within our budget. That's not happening in Washington.""

All the candidates agree fiscal responsibility is a key issue in this race. The debate is over which candidate is uniquely qualified to make it happen in Washington.

Other candidates in the Republican field include environmental consultant Keith Blandford; former Charleston County Councilman Curtis Bostic; engineer Ric Bryant; military prosecutor Jonathan Hoffman; systems engineer Jeff King; former State Sen. John Kuhn; defense contractor Tim Larkin; State Rep. Chip Limehouse; State Rep. Peter McCoy; Charleston County school board member Elizabeth Moffly; former Dorchester County Sheriff Ray Nash; State Rep. and former Secret Service agent Andy Patrick; and attorney Shawn Pinkston.

""I believe in duty,"" said Pinkston, an Army veteran who served in Iraq. ""I believe in putting the country's interest above my own.""

The winners of South Carolina's 1st District primaries will face each other in a general election on May 7."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/10/12/rubio-ryan-values-voters-straw-poll,2013-10-12 00:00:00,['Matthew Boyle'],"Rubio, Ryan Crater, Cruz Soars in Values Voter Summit Poll","Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), the GOP’s most recent vice presidential candidate, finished with a combined total of less than 10 percent of the vote in the Family Research Council (FRC) Values Voter Summit straw poll.

Rubio finished in fifth place with 5 percent of the vote, while Ryan finished in sixth place with 4 percent of the vote. The three biggest issues for the 762 straw poll voters were religious liberty, life, and Obamacare.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) finished overwhelmingly in first place, taking in 42 percent of the straw poll’s vote. Dr. Ben Carson, an ardent opponent of Obamacare, and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, a social conservative, finished tied for second place with 13 percent of the vote each.

Rubio has taken a beating among the GOP’s rank-and-file voters for his stance on immigration reform and continues to be unable to return to the top tier of conservative leaders. Ryan, who also supports comprehensive immigration reform, has recently become the face of the GOP establishment’s willingness to surrender to President Barack Obama on Obamacare and the ongoing fiscal fights over both the budget and the debt ceiling.

A high-ranking conservative Capitol Hill staffer told Breitbart News that Ryan’s fiscal stances seem to be out-of-step with the values of conservatives. “I don’t think he did himself any good by his latest proposal, mostly proved himself to be out of touch with the current trend,” the staffer said in an email. “We are hoping the majority of the majority will enjoy being on the right side.”

When FRC Action president Tony Perkins was asked by Breitbart News what he thought of Ryan’s performance in the straw poll, Perkins said, “He wasn’t here personally. Clearly, I think it helps if you’re here and able to speak. Now, he did speak via video, but I just think the competition is steep. We had really, really great speeches by some really great leaders. It’s hard to compete with that by video message so that’s what I would attribute it to.”

Ryan had previously stated he would join the summit but ended up sending in a video speech in order to attend negotiations with the White House instead.

Perkins also said he thinks the ongoing fiscal negotiations that Ryan is leading on behalf of House Republicans “factors in quite significantly.”

“As I was just talking with Ted Cruz to call him to give him the results of the polling, and I do that every year, I will call the individual and give them a heads-up on who wins the straw poll, and so I called and talked to Ted,” Perkins said. “He was very encouraged by the response he received here and very surprised and excited to hear the results that he won the straw poll. It simply served to encourage him and bolster him in the stand that he is taking, that he is representing and defending the families of this country that will be negatively impacted by Obamacare and keeping his word to voters that he would come here to repeal Obamacare.”

“So I think it says that those base voters are not only not punching those who are doing what they said they were going to do, but rewarding them for doing so,” Perkins said.

Perkins added he does not think immigration “divides the social conservative voters as much as some would like it to.”

“There certainly are differences in opinion of how we address it and how we approach it, but I do not think that in my numerous conversations regarding this issue that it divides social conservatives as much as some think,” Perkins said. “I think this [straw poll] is more a reflection of who has been out front on one of the most pressing issues; as I mentioned, Obamacare finished at the top three of our issues. Religious liberty was at the very top, which Obamacare is a direct assault on.”

“Who’s been leading the charge on that? And that answer would be Ted Cruz,” he stated.

Cruz also helped lead the charge, along with Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), in the U.S. Senate against the “Gang of Eight” immigration bill and remains opposed to any pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants in America.

Perkins added that this straw poll shows the GOP establishment must begin representing populist ideas of what the conservative base wants. “That [the establishment] is the same mindset that brought us the results in 2008 and 2012,” Perkins said. “These issues that the vast majority of the Republican voting base care about were ignored.”

“The numbers, and I’ve seen the analysis of the 2012 election specifically, the post-election analysis, and the Republicans said this is where they’re going and they wanted to reach the middle and they did, but they stepped over the base,” he explained. “What you’re seeing here consistently is the president is mobilizing and exciting his base on many of these issues and in many of these elections the Republicans have not. They’ve not been able to do that.”"

John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Sunday that Chuck Hagel will likely be confirmed as U.S. secretary of defense when Congress returns from recess next week.

""I'm confident that Senator Hagel will probably have the votes necessary to be confirmed as secretary of defense,"" McCain said of President Obama's choice to head up the Pentagon during an appearance on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

McCain is one of 40 Republican senators who voted to delay a vote on Hagel's confirmation last week. Republicans said they held up the vote in order to have more questions answered about Hagel, a former Republican senator from Nebraska, as well as about the attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya last September.

McCain said Sunday that he believed the 10-day recess was long enough to get adequate answers from the White House, but that he would not vote in favor of confirming his former colleague.

""No, I don't believe he's qualified, but I don't believe we should hold up his confirmation any further,"" McCain said. ""I think it's a reasonable amount of time to have questions answered.""

Last week, McCain acknowledged that Republican opposition to Hagel's confirmation stemmed partially from his criticism of former President Bush over the Iraq War.

""There's a lot of ill will towards Senator Hagel because when he was a Republican, he attacked President Bush mercilessly, at one point said he was the worst president since Herbert Hoover, said the surge was the worst blunder since the Vietnam War, which is nonsense, and was anti his own party and people,"" McCain said during a Thursday interview with Fox News. ""You can disagree, but if you're disagreeable, people don't forget that.""

On Sunday, however, McCain denied that his opposition to Hagel is politically charged.

""99 percent of it has to do with the positions Senator Hagel has taken,"" he said.

The Senate is expected to take a final vote on Hagel's confirmation next week, following the President's Day holiday."

Republicans won big in the 2010 midterm election, taking control of the House and numerous state legislatures. That victory corresponded with a significant increase in the percentage of Americans calling themselves conservative, particularly on economic issues. Since then, however, the percentage has steadily declined, according to an annual “values and beliefs” survey conducted by Gallup.

The latest version shows a further drop, with 41% of Americans calling themselves economic conservatives, down from just over 50% at the 2010 peak. On social issues, the share identifying as conservatives has dropped slightly and is now just more than 1 in 3.

On social issues, the big gain has come among those who call themselves liberals, whose ranks have increased from 22% of adults in 2010 to 30% now. On economic issues, gains have mostly come among those calling themselves moderates, with the percentage of liberals holding relatively steady.

For Republicans, the trend poses a challenge. The party depends heavily on self-identified conservatives for votes, even as their ranks have become scarcer.

Just more than a quarter of American adults (26%) now identify as conservatives on both economic and social issues. But that relatively small group makes up almost two-thirds (63%) of those who identify themselves as Republicans or independents who say they lean Republican, the Gallup data show.

Conservatives can take heart that they still outnumber self-identified liberals – 1 in 8 adults (13%) called themselves liberal on both economic and social questions. But Democrats don’t depend on liberals as exclusively as Republicans depend on conservatives. Consistent liberals make up only a bit more than a quarter of those who identify themselves as Democrats or independents who lean toward the Democrats.

None of those numbers necessarily forecasts an election result. Republicans won big in 2010 in part because more Americans considered themselves conservative, but also because more of them showed up to vote. That’s where the current Washington controversies over the IRS, the killing of the U.S. ambassador to Libya last year and other issues could have an effect. Republican strategists hope those issues will arouse their voters and spur them to the polls while dispiriting Democrats.

Over the longer term, however, Republicans clearly face a problem that will require either changing voters’ minds or shifting their party’s identity if it is to keep winning. Changing voters’ minds can happen – after all, the percentage of Americans who call themselves conservative did go up after Barack Obama’s first election as president, so presumably, it could go up again. But that would require swimming against a fairly strong tide, which shows up clearly in an analysis of different age groups that Gallup did for the Los Angeles Times.

Among adults 65 and older, those identifying themselves as conservative hit 43% on social issues and 47% on economic ones.

But among those younger than 30, the corresponding figures were 31% and 32%.

Among adults 18 to 29, those who call themselves liberals on social issues form a larger group (41%) than either social conservatives (31%) or social moderates (37%).

Advertisement

And among those in the next older age group, those in their 30s and 40s, liberals, moderates and conservatives on social issues make up about equal shares. The pattern is not quite as sharp on economic issues, but there too the results show a noticeable break around age 50 in the ideological labels people choose, with those who are younger significantly more likely to call themselves liberal.

On social issues, although not on economic ones, education levels matter a lot. Those with college degrees or higher call themselves liberal on social issues at a much higher rate than those without. In recent elections, Democrats have gained heavily among college-educated voters, and the percentage of Americans who go to college and earn a degree has been on a long-term increase.

These results should mostly not be affected by the well-publicized problems that befell Gallup during the last election, in which its results skewed significantly toward Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Some of those problems had to do with how Gallup forecast who would show up to vote. Many of those problems, which Gallup has tried to fix, would not affect these numbers, which come from a survey of all American adults, not just likely voters. The survey, conducted May 2-7, interviewed 1,535 adults, age 18 and older. The margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.

A little over 20 million people watched President Obama's second inauguration on television, Nielsen reported Wednesday afternoon.

The ratings agency counted up the viewers across 18 different networks. It said that 20.552 million people watched coverage airing from 10 AM to 4:30 PM on Monday. (CNN was the top-rated cable news network, and NBC the top-rated broadcast network.)

The numbers were a steep drop from Obama's first inauguration, which drew 37 million viewers, and was the second-lowest rating for an inauguration since 1969, as the New York Times' Bill Carter noted.

This is not surprising: TV viewership is down for all programs, not just inaugurations, and second inaugurations are rarely as popular as first ones.

Obama did manage to easily beat George W. Bush, his immediate predecessor, who drew just 15.5 million viewers for his second inauguration. He was well behind the highest-rated second inaugural -- Richard Nixon's in 1973. That speech was watched by over 32 million."

What the hell were they thinking?,"Kaboom.

Kaboom.

True, today's deal preserved the existing filibuster rule, but it really didn't. Democrats established that they could bust through any filibuster with a simple majority anytime they wanted. Sure, it's still a process to do so, full of blustery threats and hyperbolic doomsaying, but it's a process [...] But if Republicans continue to prevent up-or-down votes on further administration officials, or perhaps more importantly, judicial ones, Democrats now have a tool to force action. And that means we've come a long way from a few years ago, when Senate Democrats simply shrugged at the inevitability of the GOP filibuster arguing they had no other option.

Republicans could relent on Obama’s right to fill vacancies and keep the filibuster in place. Obama would get some more judges, but he would not be able to fill all the outstanding vacancies by next year considering that he has only identified nominees for about half of those seats. But if Republicans provoke the end of the filibuster, then I suspect the White House can quickly find another 50 or so judges without much fuss.

Just four months ago, I wrote I must admit, I didn't expect Republicans to challenge this notion this quickly. And the reason is simple: Even with a truncated and compromised filibuster, Republicans were able to gum up the works to unprecedented levels. As Bill Sher at the Campaign for America's Future notes , the federal judiciary is now evenly balanced, withand. However, there areIn other words, surrendering on three judges would've allowed the GOP to continue obstructing the other 87. Provoking the Democrats into eliminating the filibuster, on the other hand, now allows Democrats to ram all 90 through with minimal trouble. And there's no longer any need to try and find judges that can pick up a handful of Republican votes, so they should prove better ideologically. This will also take the judiciary from a 50-50 partisan split to a 55-45 Democratic-appointed one. And we still have another three years of vacancies ahead of us before we choose our next president.

So why surrender their ability to gum up the works? Is it a bet that they'll take over the chamber in the 2014 elections? Not really. A presidential veto would negate the need for minority Democrats to filibuster.

So is it a bet that Republicans will take both the Senate next year, and the White House in 2016? Perhaps. But if so, why not give proper deference for three years, relent on a handful of judges, preserve the filibuster, and then ditch it when they theoretically took power in early 2017?

None of this makes sense. Republicans have been daring Democrats to go nuclear all week, and today things went ""boom!"". But that bomb detonated over Republicans while Democrats watched from a safe bunker miles away. So what were Republicans thinking?"

Calling it “the next phase of this movement,” former campaign manager Jim Messina described the new group as an extension of Obama’s successful bid for a second term, which used technology to engage volunteers at a new level in their communities.

“If we can take the enthusiasm and passion that people showed throughout the campaign and channel it into the work ahead of us, we will be unstoppable,” Messina, who will be the chairman of the new group, wrote in an email to campaign donors early Friday morning.

The launch, which the Los Angeles Times wrote about Thursday, was the subject of chatter among Democratic activists and strategists, who predicted that it could upend the party’s power structure.

If it is able to sustain the intensive volunteer effort that propelled Obama twice into the White House, Organizing for Action could outstrip the role played by traditional interest groups, such as organized labor and the environmental movement -- and challenge the party itself as a center of influence.

To accomplish that, however, the organization must avoid the fate of a similar effort Obama officials made in 2009 to extend his first presidential campaign into a permanent advocacy force. That project, Organizing for America, largely failed to turn grass-roots support into a political force from within its confines at the Democratic National Committee.

On Friday, Messina wrote that the new organization would be driven by supporters and would hew to the campaign’s principles: “respect, empower, include.”

“We’ll work on the key battles of our generation, train the next generation of grassroots organizers and leaders, and organize around local issues in our own communities,” Messina wrote. “We’ll continue to support the President in creating jobs and growing the economy from the middle out, and in fighting for issues like immigration reform, climate change, balanced deficit reduction, and reducing gun violence.”

The new group is being organized under the tax code’s section 501(c)4 as a nonprofit social welfare organization, which cannot have politics as its primary purpose, limiting its ability to coordinate with the party or candidates.

In setting the group up as a 501(c)4, Obama aides chose the same structure as conservative advocacy groups, such as Crossroads GPS and Americans for Prosperity, which the president has lambasted for not disclosing their donors. It remains to be seen whether Organizing for Action will voluntarily reveal information about its financial backers.

Rick Perry said midway through a 27-minute criticism of California, he wasn’t in Anaheim to criticize California.

That might have come off a tad hollow, given that Perry had already asserted that the state comes in a distant second to his by almost every measure imaginable -- tax rates, poverty levels, business growth, even freedom, by the governor’s sights.

“The purpose of my visit is not to bash California,” he said on the first day of the state Republican Party convention. “This is a wonderful state with great innovative people.”

But, he said, the very “future of the nation” depended on a blunt conversation about which course was best: California’s “big government, protectionist, nanny state” or Texas’ “limited-government, unsubsidized, freedom state.”

Perry’s remarks centered on new jobs for his state’s residents, but they seemed intended to enhance the chances of a new one for him. The governor already has announced that he will not seek reelection and is said to be pondering a second presidential bid.

The first one didn’t end all that well -- entering the race as, essentially, the frontrunner, he stumbled badly and iced his own chances by being unable to remember parts of his own governing proposals during a candidate debate. “Oops” was the grave marker for his hopes.

A second try depends on Perry’s ability to dramatically alter his image. To that end, the governor is coursing across the country with new hipster glasses and a more disciplined approach, taking on Democratic governors’ policies, trying to swipe their state’s jobs, and putting himself prominently in the public eye. A Texas group has aired ads in several areas that depict Perry. He has repeatedly courted gun manufacturers, and, by extension, their influential voter base.

The weekend’s convention, at which Perry will deliver Saturday night’s signature address, puts him in close contact with people who, even if the state is a goner for his party in presidential contests, remains a key source of primary votes, activists and, most especially, money.

His only criticism of Republicans came when he was asked about the party’s regular inability to attract Latino voters nationally and in California. “The California Republican Party needs to take a look at their policies, the words that they use,” he said. “I would suggest that that matters.”

Asked why, if his broad assertions were correct, Californians appeared fairly happy with their Democratic governor and the state’s economic revival, rising housing prices and dropping unemployment rate, Perry replied: “This isn’t about Jerry Brown.”

“The governor is not the issue here,” Perry said. “It’s the policies that are the issue.”

Brown spokesman Evan Westrup took note of the location from which Perry spoke, less than a mile from Disneyland.

“It seems our friend from Texas took a detour to neighboring Fantasyland while in Anaheim today,” Westrup said. “We hope his stay is pleasant. In case you missed it, while Gov. Perry spent his afternoon politicking, Gov. Brown was taking action to bolster the state’s business climate. ... Also, a reminder that California has had 26 consecutive months of job growth.”

Circuit Court of Appeals.

During a Wednesday hearing on one of Obama's key judicial nominees, Nina Pillard for the D.C. Circuit, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee resurrected the claim that the president's effort to fill three vacancies on the court amounts to ""court-packing."" The term refers to an effort to increase the number of judge slots on a court with the goal of shifting its political balance, not to fill existing vacancies.

""The president appears to have targeted the D.C. Circuit in hopes that he can pack the court and stack the deck to his advantage,"" said Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah).

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) noted that the Senate already confirmed a nominee to the D.C. Circuit this year, Sri Srinivasan, and argued that Obama's efforts to fill the court's remaining vacancies are politically motivated.

""I have deep concerns about what the administration is doing now with a package of three nominees to the D.C. Circuit after the Senate just confirmed a very qualified nominee,"" Cruz said. ""I believe [this] is an attempt by this administration to pack that court.""

Not only is the charge factually inaccurate -- the court has three empty seats, which the president is constitutionally required to fill -- but one could easily make the case that Republican efforts to prevent Obama from filling empty court seats, thereby keeping those courts from having any more judges appointed by a Democrat, are actual instances of ""court-unpacking.""

Scuffles over the D.C. Circuit come as Senate Republicans have been using a variety of methods to block Obama's judicial nominees. Tensions over stalled nominees have gotten so high that Democrats nearly proceeded with filibuster reform earlier this month, a standoff that was defused at the last minute as party leaders cut a deal that allowed some of Obama's executive nominees to get votes. That deal did nothing to unclog Obama's judicial nominees, though, and filling the D.C. Circuit is a major priority for the president.

Republicans haven't signaled much interest in allowing D.C. Circuit nominees to get a vote. As it stands, the court has 11 seats, three of which are vacant. Lee and Cruz are both are cosponsors of a bill by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) that would eliminate those three seats altogether and keep the court where it is: with eight judges, four of whom were appointed by Democrats and four of whom were appointed by Republicans.

Grassley, the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee, re-upped that argument during Wednesday's hearing. He cited statistics that he said illustrated that the court has the lowest workload of all circuit courts. He also read aloud anonymous statements that he said were from current D.C. Circuit judges arguing that the court isn't busy enough to warrant filling its vacancies. Those statements came in response to a letter that Grassley said he sent to the court's judges asking for their take on the matter.

""The judges themselves confirmed everything I've been saying,"" Grassley said. ""Who is in a better position than the judges to make an assessment about the court's workload and the need for additional judges?""

But Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said Grassley's argument overlooks the fact that the D.C. Circuit, considered second only to the Supreme Court in terms of its importance, takes on particularly hefty and complex cases that require extra scrutiny. He also listed off the names of current and former judges on that court -- including Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts -- who have spoken publicly about the court's intense workload.

Plenty of judges who have served on the court ""have commented for the record, not anonymously, their views as to the workload of the court,"" Blumenthal said, ""all indicating very strongly and unequivocally that the workload of this court is certainly a tremendous challenge and growing, rather than diminishing."""

Wednesday night, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC), an ardent Obamacare foe, didn't face an adoring crowd of teabaggers there to shout their support for him and scream their hatred for Obamacare.

Instead, he got a message about the law that he probably wasn't expecting, including from the woman in the video above who lost her son to colon cancer, largely because it was caught too late. It was caught late because he didn't have insurance because of a preexisting condition, a birth defect. She wasn't the only one McHenry heard from.



They all wanted direct answers from the congressman Wednesday evening, and many of them, including Skip Edwards, questioned the Republican’s position on the Affordable Care Act. Edwards and his wife, both 63, had health insurance until he lost his job during the recession and the East Asheville couple found themselves in financial trouble despite staying relatively healthy. Both had pre-existing conditions and were denied insurance, making them eligible for a state plan called Inclusive Health. “It cost us $1,300 bucks a month — extremely expensive,” Edwards said. “It taps us out every month. But at our age and health, we’ve got to have it.”

McHenry's response was typically lame—he loves the stuff about no more discriminating for preexisting conditions and allowing young people to stay on parents' plan until their 26, but didn't explain how his repeated votes to repeal and defund the law that includes those protections preserved them.

Instead, he talked about the usual stuff Republicans talk about: expanding high risk pools, ""adding 'That is more of a solution than I think that Obamacare will be,' as many in the crowd groaned."" He also said that people should be able to buy insurance across state lines, another big Republican ""solution."" Not surprisingly, ""Edwards was not satisfied with the congressman’s answer.""

That's what happens when Republicans are forced to confront the reality of actual people who really need health insurance. They've never had real answers and they've never been able to present a valid alternative. That's why we haven't heard ""repeal and replace"" since 2010; they've never had a ""replace."" It's why the answer now is ""repeal, defund, and/or shutdown government."" It's only ever been about selling the rabid base the idea that they could kill the law.

American Bridge has released their video of the exchange between Mr. Edwards and Rep. McHenry. The audience reaction to McHenry is priceless. And it's about time he heard it."

The harsh reality is that, in order to seize a House majority, the Democrats are probably going to need a bigger cushion than even the 1.4 million vote edge they took last year.

And that is because the ""it's not all about gerrymandering crowd"" does have some political science to back them up.

The New Republic's Nate Cohn addressed the issue back in February when he wrote:



But even if redistricting were non-partisan, Republicans would possess a modest advantage in the chamber. Democrats do even better in cities than Republicans do in rural areas, so even a fair process would pack a larger number of Democratic voters into strongly Democratic districts.

This type of ""geographic clustering"" is based on a very simple premise:segregation.

African-Americans have spent decades as the most loyal voting bloc in the Democratic coalition, and the past several elections have also seen a steady movement of Latino voters into the ""loyally Democratic"" column. If either voting bloc congregates together in one community, that community is inevitably going to be terribly one-sided come election time.

And those are two ethnic groups, as it happens, that tend to be clustered tightly in ethnic enclaves in the larger cities of the United States, as well as other pockets of rural America (the Rio Grande River valley in Texas and Alabama's ""black belt"" of rural counties near the Mississippi border are excellent examples).

Ergo, even if you drew perfectly compact maps, you'd probably see a situation where there would be a large number of districts where Democrats would absolutely throttle the GOP, because of the high concentrations of African-American or Latino voters nestled within those districts. That would ""throw off the curve"" on those national numbers, because almost all of that 1.4 million vote edge is going to be owed to ... if you crunch the numbers ... less than 10 districts that are so deep blue that the margins are simply ridiculous.

Consider: if one looks at the Daily Kos Elections compilation of how all the 435 House districts voted for president last year, you'd see that the most one-sided Republican district in the nation was TX-13, an absurdly right-wing slice of rural Texas represented for nearly two decades by Rep. Mac Thornberry. Mitt Romney snared 80.2 percent of the vote in the 13th district.

You would also see that there are ... wait for it ... 25 Democratic House districts that are more one-sided in favor of the blue team. The most Democratic district in the nation? Jose Serrano's district in the Bronx is the winner, with 96.3 percent of the district vote going to Barack Obama in 2012.

Lest you think that this alone is proof of rampant gerrymandering, remember that a large number of those districts came from states where Republicans did not control the pen in the redistricting process (nearly a half dozen, for example, came out of California).

What's more, under the previous maps, where the Democrats had a healthy majority at one point, this phenomenon was still present. By going back to 2008, the recent high-water mark for Democratic majorities in the House, we see that there were a total of 87 districts in the country where Obama beat McCain by a two-to-one margin or greater. There were only 21 districts nationwide where McCain beat Obama by a similar margin. Of course, some of that is owed to the fact that Obama beat McCain nationally by a healthy margin, but that doesn't explain the gap in total.

So, does that mean that the defenders of the Republican majority are correct, and that gerrymandering played little-to-no role in the perpetuation of a GOP House majority?

Nah.

Residential patterns explain some of the disparity between seats and votes, but it would be absolutely asinine to say that it explains it completely. If that were true, I'd make this challenge to the GOP House majority and all of its defenders in the public conversation: do a mid-decade redistricting, in every state, entirely by independent commission (a la Iowa or California). After all, if the GOP House majority can be explained entirely by geographic clustering, there'd be nothing to lose, right?

George Mason University professor Michael P. McDonald jumped on this subject earlier in the month. The entire article is worth a read, but here is a key point:



Upon some reflection by anyone who has drawn a redistricting plan -- and I've been a redistricting consultant in 14 states -- geography is not really constraining on congressional redistricting. Congressional districts are very large. In moderate- to large-sized states they consist of over 700,000 persons. It is easy in all but the most densely-urban areas to combine urban, suburban, and rural voters within a compact district. And again, the plans implemented in the states with the largest urban centers are not responsible for the current partisan imbalance among the congressional plans.

McDonald very subtly makes two incredibly important points here. For one thing, the sheer size of American congressional districts make it easy to draw ""fair districts,"" if that is the goal. For another, the districts where geographic clustering are the most obvious are in states where the lines were drawn in such a way that Democrats actually do quite well. Of the 25 most one-sided districts in the nation, 15 of them came in three states: California, Illinois and New York. Democrats drew the lines in Illinois. California was drawn by a newly created independent commission in a map that was more favorable to Democrats than the previous one. And New York was the result of a court-drawn map that largely held in place the overwhelming Democratic majority in the delegation.

When people talk about Republican gerrymandering, they aren't talking about those three states. They are talking about Ohio. About Michigan. About Pennsylvania. About Florida. And about North Carolina.

North Carolina, in particular, is a real case study in the impact of gerrymandering. When Republicans snared control of the legislature in 2010, their redistricting efforts (which, in a curious quirk of state law, could not be vetoed by the state's Democratic governor) were ambitious to say the least. In the previous incarnation of the state's maps, the median district in the U.S. House was 47 percent Obama in 2008: a point or two behind his statewide result there, but generally in line with the statewide outcome. As would be expected in a closely contested state, Obama won a majority of the vote in six of the state's 13 CDs. After the NC GOP finished their handiwork, the median district in the state's U.S. House delegation was 41.7 percent Obama. The president scored a majority in just three of the state's 13 districts in 2012, despite only performing only slightly worse in the state between 2008-2012. But in those three districts, he scored a higher percentage of the vote (between 71-78 percent) than he did in any of the Tar Heel State's districts in 2008, when he carried the state.

What's more: Obama's 4th best performing district in the state? An 11.9 percent win for Mitt Romney in the reconfigured 13th district. The Democrats were not only packed into a trio of districts, but the remaining 10 districts were essentially rendered uncompetitive, with the sole exception of conservative Democrat Mike McIntyre somehow clinging to his seat in a district that went 59-40 Romney.

Now, it seems incredibly implausible that the voters of North Carolina somehow dramatically reclustered themselves in four years. So, in this case, the argument that residential patterns drove the result would take a pretty ignorant GOP cheerleader in order to make it. Just as it would be equally ignorant to claim that the current imbalance of the House delegation there (9-4 Republican) accurately reflects the will of the people in the state. This was the purest example of a gerrymander one can find.

The other states mentioned were not quite as naked, but they were notable nonetheless. And ""geographic clustering"" partisans would probably be quick to point out that those states are not necessarily gerrymandered, because of Democratic vote sinks in each state (Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, Columbus and Cleveland in Ohio, etc).

But Working America's Seth Michaels took that point head on earlier in the month, with an awesome example to the contrary:





@sethdmichaels geographical sorting matters a lot, but if gerrymandering didn't matter, Southeastern PA wouldn't be drawn like this. http://t.co/...

Michele Bachmann opting against a reelection bid, the Democrat who nearly unseated her last November and was gunning for her again is now out of the race too.

Jim Graves, a St. Cloud businessman, told the local website MinnPost that with the polarizing conservative choosing not to run -- perhaps out of fear she might lose -- his feeling was “mission accomplished.”

“She wasn’t representing the people of the 6th District appropriately, and now she won’t be representing them. There’s no way anyone could run and win who would be worse than Michele Bachmann. So we accomplished that task,” he said.

That’s a turnaround from Wednesday, when he told the Los Angeles Times in an interview that he still intended to run. “It’s a very winnable race against anybody,” he said then. “We weren’t really running against Michele Bachmann as much as we were running for the people in the district and the country. And we’re going to continue that same approach.”

Minnesota’s 6th District is the most Republican of the state’s eight congressional districts, but Graves came within just 4,200 votes of defeating Bachmann last November. Political handicappers viewed her exit as good news for the Republicans because a new candidate would run without the same baggage.

Graves said Wednesday that he thought a wide-open Republican primary, though, would lead candidates to run hard to the right, leaving an opening for him with moderate Republicans and independent voters.

He told MinnPost Thursday night that his decision now to drop out was shaped by conversations with family and friends, and the realization that support from national Democrats and liberal groups would be less likely without Bachmann.

“I was just the guy who was running against her,” he said. “I’m humble enough to realize that.”

An official announcement from Graves was to come later Friday.

Winning Republican-leaning seats like the Minnesota 6th is a necessity, though, if Democrats are to pick up the 17 seats needed to win back control of the House of Representatives. In part because of a redistricting process that favored the GOP in most states, there are few Republicans sitting in centrist or Democratic-leaning seats for the party to target.

Last year, the department found that the two prosecutors had engaged in reckless — though not intentional — professional misconduct and ordered them to be suspended without pay. One, Joseph Bottini, was suspended for 40 days, and the other, James Goeke, was suspended for 15 days.

The legal team that defended Mr. Stevens, Republican of Alaska, called those suspensions “pathetic” and inadequate, saying the department had “demonstrated conclusively that it is not capable of disciplining its prosecutors.” But the two prosecutors contended that the discipline was too severe and appealed to the federal Merit Systems Protection Board, an agency that hears disciplinary cases involving career civil servants in the federal government.

In a 29-page ruling released late Friday night, the administrative judge, Benjamin Gutman, overturned the suspensions. He ruled that the Justice Department had violated its own procedures, under the Professional Misconduct Review Unit, which called for a rank-and-file lawyer to decide whether professional misconduct had occurred."

Lautenberg New Jersey will hold special election in October Decision avoids possibility of Democratic turnout boost when Christie on ballot in November Christie says his decision is not political, says he wants what is best for state, voters

(CNN) —

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie opted for a special election to fill a newly vacant Senate seat through 2014 instead of appointing a replacement through that time, saying the decision was about giving voters “a choice and a voice in the process” and was not driven by political self-interest.

While the Republican’s decision for a special October ballot could help him avoid stronger Democratic turnout in his re-election bid a month later, it also opens him up to criticism from his own party that is on the short end of the balance of power in the Senate.

Christie explained his decision one day after the Garden State’s senior senator, Frank Lautenberg, a liberal Democrat, died at 89 after an illness. Christie said he would name a placeholder as soon as possible to fill the seat until the October election.

Opinion: The last ‘swamp dog’

Democrats immediately slammed the move, asserting that Christie is wasting taxpayer money to protect his ambitions. National Republicans weren’t critical but they didn’t praise the governor, either.

Christie announced that Democratic and Republican primary elections will be held on August 13 with the general election on October 16.

The winner of the special election will serve out the final year of Lautenberg’s term, and an election for a full six-year term will occur the following November.

Christie sets October special election to replace Lautenberg

Voters should have say

While Christie said state law allowed him to name a replacement for the remaining year-and-a-half of Lautenberg’s term, he believes an appointment over that period of time was not suitable or fair.

“The issues facing the United States Senate are too critically important and the decisions that need to be dealt with too vital not too have an elected representative making those decisions who was voted on and decided on by the people of this state. These decisions should be made by an elected official who represents the will of voters of New Jersey,” Christie said.

The expense of an election is also an issue during an era of belt tightening.

The New Jersey Office of Legislative Services, an administrative wing of the Democrat-controlled state Legislature, estimates it will cost $12 million to state taxpayers to conduct a primary and another $12 million for a general election.

Analysis: Christie helps himself

New Jersey is already voting in a general election on November 5, when Christie is bidding for a second term. So some ask why doesn’t he save $12 million and schedule a special general election a few weeks later?

Christie said state law only permits the option of an October special election or an election in 2014.

Christie said “there’s no political purpose” behind his decision on the election date.

But polls show that he has a 2-1 advantage over state Sen. Barbara Buono, his Democratic challenger. And putting a special Senate election on the same day in November would most likely increase Democratic turnout, especially if Newark Mayor Cory Booker is on the ballot. Booker was considering his own run for Senate in 2014.

By placing the special Senate election in October, Christie avoids Democratic turnout tied to this issue possibly becoming a problem for him.

Democrats unhappy

National Democrats quickly blasted the decision.

“Governor Christie might not know or care how many millions of taxpayer dollars his special election gambit will waste, but the people of New Jersey certainly do. Christie should do the right thing, protect New Jersey taxpayer dollars instead of his own political career, and hold the Senate election on the same day as his own,” Democratic Governors Association Executive Director Colm O’Comartun, said in a statement.

Christie said that the costs associated with special primary and general elections “cannot be measured” against the value of an elected senator “when so many consequential issues are being debated and determined this year.”

State Democrats had threatened legal action if Christie pushed the election back to November 2014, but Christie’s not sure if his decision averts a legal challenge, adding, “In New Jersey, people sue over everything.”

Opinion: The last ‘swamp dog’

Christie said he has yet to decide on a placeholder. But he said he has a list in his head and that he’ll make a determination relatively soon.

“I’m looking for a person who’s going to be a good United States senator,” he said.

The outspoken governor also said it wouldn’t be fair to appoint a GOP placeholder to serve out the remainder of the late Democratic senator’s term.

“I understand the political advantage that would come to me if I was the person, the sole person, to decide who would be in the Senate representing New Jersey for 18 months, but I just did not feel comfortable doing that,” he said.

Christie didn’t say at the news conference whether the placeholder will be allowed to run in the special election, but a source close to the governor told CNN, “Legally the appointee could run if he or she wanted to, but would have to go through the election process.”

Republicans not praising Christie

National Republicans weren’t criticizing Christie’s decision, but they weren’t praising it, either.

“I am sure the governor exercised whatever option he had in the best interest of his state and I won’t question the path that he has chosen,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said.

Christie’s decision could complicate his already-strained relationship with national conservatives, which could spell trouble if he decides to run for president in 2016.

“I was disappointed he didn’t pick a Republican to fill out the rest of the term, but not surprised,” said Katon Dawson, the former Chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party.

“Chris Christie has always done what’s best for Chris Christie in New Jersey,” added Dawson, whose state is traditionally one of the first to cast ballots in the presidential primary process.

Many on the right are still upset with Christie’s praise of President Barack Obama personally and the federal response in the wake of Superstorm Sandy, just days before last November’s presidential election.

Republican: ‘Debilitating stupidity’

While Christie’s approval rating in New Jersey soared after Sandy and has remained high, some commentators in his own party blasted him for his praise of Obama, saying it contributed to the defeat of GOP nominee Mitt Romney.

And Democrats were quick to point that out.

“Republicans have not won a Senate race in New Jersey in more than 40 years. Their only shot was an appointee who had a year and a half to establish themselves before an election in 2014,” Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Deputy Executive Director Matt Canter said. “With this news, I assume operatives at the NRSC are busy planning Christie’s defeat in Iowa and New Hampshire right now.”

Meanwhile, the rival National Republican Senatorial Committee pointed toward what could be a divisive Democratic primary.

“Democrats will now face an ugly primary sprint between Cory Booker, Rob Andrews and Frank Pallone – all with substantial war chests and a healthy dislike for each other,” NRSC spokesman Brad Dayspring said. “Corey Booker did not want to have to wrap this up in two months.”

Democratic Congressman Rush Holt may also make a bid for the Senate seat.

http://news.yahoo.com/california-sends-bill-let-illegal-immigrants-practice-law-050138556.html,,[],California sends bill to let illegal immigrants practice law to governor,"By Sharon Bernstein SACRAMENTO (Reuters) - A California bill to let undocumented immigrants become lawyers passed its last legislative hurdle on Thursday and will be sent to Governor Jerry Brown for his signature. The legislation was prompted by the case of an undocumented Mexican immigrant, Sergio Garcia, who was brought to the United States as a baby and later graduated from a California law school. He has won the support of the State Bar of California and state Attorney General Kamala Harris in his quest to be admitted to practice law, over the objections of the U.S. Justice Department. The bill passed the state Assembly on Thursday in the waning hours of the legislative session. It would authorize the California Supreme Court, which finalizes applications to become licensed as a lawyer in the state, to admit qualified applicants regardless of their immigration status. ""By the grace of God, I was born on this side of the border,"" said Democratic Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, who introduced the bill in the Assembly. Were it not for that accident of fate, Gonzalez said, she might have been prevented from becoming a lawyer. The bill previously cleared the state Senate. It was not clear if Brown, a Democrat, would sign the legislation. The efforts to deal with illegal immigrants in California come just months after the Democratic-led U.S. Senate passed a landmark immigration overhaul that includes a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants currently living illegally in the United States. However, the measure faces little chance of passage in its current form in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. Garcia is challenging the application of a federal law prohibiting government spending for the benefit of illegal immigrants, even on such matters as professional licensing. The law, on which the state Supreme Court recently held hearings, has been interpreted to mean that the state cannot license applicants to be lawyers if they are undocumented. Attorneys of the 36-year-old Garcia have maintained that the language of the law was vague and should not be interpreted as applying to law licensing. In a hearing before the state Supreme Court earlier this month, State Bar attorney James Wagstaffe pointed to case law that he said showed that statutes such as those cited by Garcia's opponents were not meant to regulate attorney licenses. U.S. Justice Department attorneys argued that the statute in question was clearly intended to bar illegal immigrants from being issued law licenses, which because they are finalized by the state Supreme Court, require public funding. Garcia, who earned a law degree from Cal Northern School of Law in Chico, California, north of Sacramento, lived in the United States until the age of eight or nine and then returned with his family to his native Mexico. At 17, Garcia re-entered the United States with his father, who was then a permanent U.S. resident and later became a citizen. His father filed a petition seeking an immigrant visa for Garcia in 1995. Garcia is still waiting to receive the visa, which would allow him to seek permanent residency and ultimately citizenship.

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/19/opinion/keller-war-on-the-core.html,2013-08-19 00:00:00,['Bill Keller'],War on the Core - The New York Times,"So let’s take a look at this fiendish federal plot to brainwash our children.

First, it is not federal. President Obama has used Race to the Top money to encourage states to embrace higher standards, but the Common Core was written under the auspices of the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers, an effort that began in 2007, before Obama was elected. Some advocates of Common Core have actually implored Obama and his education secretary, Arne Duncan, just to stop talking about it, because their endorsement feeds the myth that this is a federal takeover.

Second, there is no national curriculum. The standards, which you can read here, describe a reasonable progression of learning from grade to grade, but leave it to state and local school officials to get there. The Common

Core is not an attempt to pack kids’ heads with an officially sanctioned list of facts, but to assure that they are able to read a complicated text and understand it, to recognize a problem and know how to solve it.

So, to pick an example at random, the Common Core says a third grader should be able to “describe characters in a story (e.g., their traits, motivations or feelings) and explain how their actions contribute to the sequence of events.” By eighth grade the student should be able to “analyze how particular lines of dialogue or incidents in a story or drama propel the action, reveal aspects of a character or provoke a decision.”

The Common Core does not dictate what stories these kids will be reading or what textbooks schools should use and does not prescribe reading lists, except for a few obvious essentials, including America’s founding documents and a bit of Shakespeare.

Third, the Common Core is not some new and untried pedagogical experiment. Much of it leans on traditional methods that have proved themselves over time. Kids are taught phonics in the early grades. They learn times tables and memorize the formulas for areas and volumes.

The standards encourage more use of informational texts and literary nonfiction to build background knowledge and vocabulary that will be useful in the real world. But the Common Core does not stint on literature. By the end of high school, nonfiction would account for 70 percent of the total reading material in all subjects. That still leaves a lot of room for the classics."

According to the Huffington Post, EIT is running a $250,000 advertising campaign in favor of the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” immigration bill. Even so, EIT admitted to Breitbart News it does not legally exist as an incorporated political entity or non-profit organization but said NIF is the group that “facilitates” its activities.

NIF is a power player in immigration politics, and includes among its leadership some of the most powerful Washington figures on the issue.

In 2009, OSI donated $257,152 to NIF aimed at “implementing immigration reform campaign through communications, policy, and field organizing.”

Also in 2009, OSI donated another $1.5 million to “allow” NIF to “manage and lead Four Pillars Campaign for comprehensive immigration reform, and sustain core policy work supporting and leading policy efforts.”

A year later, in 2010, Soros’s OSI gave NIF another $1.5 million over two separate grants both intended for “general operating support.”

NIF has also received $1 million total from the leftist Ford Foundation, spread over two separate half-million-dollar grants in 2009 and 2011. Those grants were both intended for advocacy in favor of comprehensive immigration reform.

Jim Wallis, the president and CEO of Sojourners, a leading force in the Evangelical Immigration Table group, has admitted to accepting funding from Soros as well.

World magazine writer Marvin Olasky laid out in a 2010 article how Wallis and his organization, Sojourners, had received $325,000 from Soros groups over three grants from 2004, 2006 and 2007. According to OSI’s 2007 990 form filed with the IRS, available publicly through the Foundation Center, the 2007 money–a total of $100,000–was for Wallis’s Sojourners “to support the Christians for Comprehensive Immigration Reform Campaign.”

Wallis originally denied being funded by Soros when he was first confronted with the accusation, and accused Olasky of lying. “It’s not hyperbole or overstatement to say that Glenn Beck lies for a living. I’m sad to see Marvin Olasky doing the same thing,” Wallis said in 2010 interview with Patheos. “No, we don’t receive money from Soros. Given the financial crisis of nonprofits, maybe Marvin should call Soros and ask him to send us money.”

“So, no, we don’t receive money from George Soros,” Wallis added. “Our books are totally open, always have been. Our money comes from Christians who support us and who read Sojourners. That’s where it comes from. In fact, we’ve had funding blocked, this year and last, by liberal foundations who didn’t like our stance on abortion. Other liberal groups were happy to point out to them that our stance wasn’t kosher on abortion, so our funding was blocked.”

After Olasky and the National Review‘s Jay Richards confronted this claim by Wallis, Wallis admitted he made an incorrect statement to Patheos and that he was accepting Soros money. “I should have declined to comment until I was able to review the blog post in question and consulted with our staff on the details of our funding over the past several years,” Wallis said in a statement.

“Instead, I answered in the spirit of the accusation and did not recall the details of our funding over the decade in question. The spirit of the accusation was that Sojourners is beholden to funders on the political left, which is false. The allegation concerned three grants received over 10 years from the Open Society Institute that made up the tiniest fraction of Sojourners’ funding during that decade–so small that I hadn’t remembered them.”

While that original Soros funding may have been almost a decade old when it was uncovered, Wallis has subsequently accepted more money from the leftist billionaire. In a 2011 story, Olasky noted that Wallis had confirmed to him he accepted another $150,000 from Soros for a grant that would take hold in 2012.

Interestingly enough, even though evangelicals are receiving funding from Soros and his groups, his official website notes that he “identifies himself as an atheist.”

Soros is also well known for his pro-amnesty, open borders positions on immigration."

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']","Obama court pick withdraws, thwarted by Republicans in Senate","WASHINGTON—Former New York state attorney Caitlin Halligan, President Obama’s choice for the U.S. Court of Appeals here, withdrew her name Friday, defeated by the Republican minority in the Senate.

Halligan’s withdrawal is the latest example of how the GOP has employed the filibuster rule not only to block major legislation, but routine presidential appointments as well.

The D.C. Circuit decides significant challenges to federal regulations, including those on environmental protection and worker’s rights. Obama is the first president who has been unable to put a single judge on the court.

The Constitution says judges are to be nominated by the president and confirmed by a majority vote in the Senate. Halligan had the support of the Senate’s Democratic majority, but minority Republicans blocked a vote to confirm her. Under the Senate’s rules, it takes 60 votes to close debate and set a final vote.

Obama issued a statement saying he was “deeply disappointed that…a minority of senators continued to block a simple up-or-down vote on her nomination. The D.C. Circuit is considered the nation’s second- highest court, but it now has more vacancies than any other circuit court. This is unacceptable.”

Halligan, 46, is a graduate of Princeton and Georgetown Law School and clerked at the Supreme Court for Justice Stephen Breyer. She served as New York’s solicitor general from 2001 to 2007, and her office pursued a state lawsuit against gun manufacturers for causing a public nuisance. She also supported a New York Bar Assn. report that was highly critical of the indefinite detention of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.

The National Rifle Assn. opposed her nomination, and Republican senators cited the gun case as a reason for opposing her. Two years ago, 54 senators voted for her, but it was not enough to win her confirmation.

Earlier this month, Republicans stood firm in blocking her.

“Ms. Halligan has demonstrated an activist judicial philosophy,” said Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo), chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee. “Her persistent activism against gun manufacturers” and her willingness to “use the courts to promote liberal ambitions” are grounds for blocking her confirmation, he said.

Liberal groups have been upset by the success of the GOP filibuster strategy. “The D.C. Circuit is far too important to be held hostage by Senate obstructionists,” said Caroline Frederickson, president of the American Constitution Society.

“Senate Democrats need to revisit the Senate rules reform and stand up to the tyranny of the minority,” said Nan Aron, president of the Alliance for Justice.

In January, the D.C. Circuit Court dealt Obama another blow when it ruled unconstitutional his decision to fill two seats on the National Labor Relations Board through a “recess” appointment. The three judges, all Republican appointees, said the president needs to win Senate confirmation of those appointees.

Halligan was first nominated in 2010 to fill a seat on the D.C. Circuit that has been vacant since 2005 when then-Judge John Roberts became the chief justice of the United States.

President George W. Bush has two of his D.C. Circuit nominees blocked by Democratic filibusters, but he also succeeded in winning confirmation for four appointees to the appeals court.

Obama has one other nominee pending for the D.C. Circuit. He is Sri Srinivasin, who is the deputy U.S. solicitor general. He will be arguing before the Supreme Court in one of two gay-marriage cases scheduled for hearings next week.

Mike Johanns won’t seek reelection,"Johanns is the fifth senator to announce his retirement since the 2012 election, joining Sens. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.), Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.).

While the races for some of those seats will be competitive, Nebraska is a tough state for Democrats. They had a top recruit in the state last year in former senator Bob Kerrey, but he wound up losing by 16 points to now-freshman Sen. Deb Fischer (R).

""The Cornhusker state will look to continue its strong conservative tradition by electing an equally dedicated Republican leader in 2014,"" said Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

Potential GOP candidates for the seat include the two runners-up to Fischer in the 2012 primary -- state Attorney General Jon Bruning and state Treasurer Don Stenberg. But the heavy favorite, if he ran, would by Gov. Dave Heineman, who is term-limited in his current job in 2014.

Heineman was Johanns's lieutenant governor before ascending to the state's top job in January 2005, when Johanns was appointed agriculture secretary. Heineman's approval rating his been in the 60s and even the 70s for much of his tenure.

If he ran for Senate, it seems logical that other ambitious politicians would likely focus on the governor's race rather than the Senate race.

Still, Democrats immediately set about trying to define Heineman as an arch conservative, labeling his budget an ""his ill-conceived tax plan to hurt Nebraska’s middle class.""

""With Johanns’ retirement, the Nebraska Republican Party continues to define their future by skewing even more to the right..."" state Democratic Party chairman Vince Powers said.

On the Democratic side, potential recruits could include Kerrey and 2008 nominee Scott Kleeb. But the Democratic bench in the state is thin, with Democrats holding no congressional seats or statewide offices.

Johanns last week was one of four Republicans to vote to bring former senator Chuck Hagel's (R-Neb.) nomination as defense secretary to a vote. Johanns occupies the seat once held by Hagel.

Following is Johanns' full e-mail to his supporters."

No surprise that Democrats would be focusing 2014 efforts on Michele Bachmann.

That means running ads on the airwaves and online, as well as working social networks and local media in advance of the general election. [...] Democratic super PACs played an influential role in 2012, but only later in the cycle as their fundraising accelerated and their political operations ramped up to full speed. This is the first campaign in which super PACs on the Democratic side will have the opportunity to play at this scale so early in the election cycle.

Republican gerrymandering means it's going to be hard for Democrats to take back the House in 2014. And that in turn means that if Democrats are going to have any chance to do it, they can't just relax until later in the cycle—the campaign against potentially vulnerable Republicans has to keep going. Which is what House Majority PAC is planning, announcing an initial target list of 10 Republican House members:The campaign will target Colorado's Mike Coffman, New York's Michael Grimm, Minnesota's Michele Bachmann and John Kline, Illinois' Rodney Davis, Pennsylvania's Mike Fitzpatrick, Nevada's Joe Heck, Ohio's David Joyce, Florida's Steve Southerland, and California's Gary Miller. Bachmann, of course, needs no introduction. Coffman is a birther who took less than 48 percent in a district that went for Barack Obama. Grimm has had some seriously questionable finances and his district rather unexpectedly went for Obama.

Bush doesn’t think we’ve had enough Bushes in the White House, Jeb says","In an interview with Matt Lauer ahead of the opening of George W. Bush's presidential library in April, former first lady Barbara Bush was asked how she felt about her son Jeb, the former governor of Florida, being a possible presidential candidate in 2016.

""We've had enough Bushes,"" Barbara Bush replied bluntly.

Her husband doesn't agree, at least according to Jeb.

In an interview that aired on Sunday's “This Week with George Stephanopoulos,"" Jeb Bush, who served two terms as governor of Florida, was asked what his father thought about his potential candidacy.

""What about your dad?"" ABC's Jonathan Karl asked the former Florida governor. ""Has he offered you any advice? Does he think you should run?""

""I think we've got a split ballot amongst the Bush Sr. family,"" Jeb Bush, 60, said with a laugh. ""Pretty sure that's the case.""

Jeb's brother, former President George W. Bush, has said he thinks Jeb should run for president.

Jeb, considered among several early contenders for the Republican nomination in 2016, has not ruled out a run for the White House, but says he won't decide until at least 2014.

""My thinking is not to think about it for a year,"" Jeb Bush said last month. ""Life teaches you that you need to make decisions in the right time—not too early, not too late. ... I'll check in maybe a year from now, 15 months from now, something like that.""

Earlier in the ABC interview, Jeb was asked about his 89-year-old father's failing health.

""I think it was hard at first for my dad to transition to being immobile,"" Jeb Bush said. ""[But] I think he's found the right balance. I think he's in a good place, he's mentally alert, he's funny as all get out. He's spiritually in a place that we should all envy. He's more comfortable with his age. And that makes me happy."""

While those in more conservative states won their elections, others lost to Democrats who might have been ineffective against more moderate opponents — leading establishment Republicans to blame them for bungling an opportunity to gain control of the Senate.

In Texas, Mr. Cornyn saw Mr. Cruz snatch a Senate seat out from under Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, the deep-pocketed Republican who most believed had the 2012 race locked up.

Although Mr. Cornyn says he is prepared for a primary challenge, his prospects of getting “Dewhursted,” as some Texas Republicans have taken to calling it, appear slim.

“It’s impossible to do to Cornyn what’s been done to Dewhurst,” Mr. Mackowiak said.

For one thing, there is no obvious Cruz-like challenger waiting to challenge him; thus far, he has one primary opponent, Erick Wyatt, a military veteran from Rockport, a self-described “constitutional conservative” who is aligned with the Tea Party. Nor is there early evidence of a Democratic candidate likely to give Mr. Cornyn a run for his money in the general election.

For another, Mr. Cornyn’s seniority, national fund-raising connections and Senate leadership post are valuable assets that make him less vulnerable to the rumblings of the far-right interest groups that called for his head after his reluctant vote for the fiscal cliff deal.

Since then, both Mr. Cornyn and Mr. Cruz voted against Senator John Kerry’s confirmation as secretary of state, notable because they were two of just three senators, all Republicans, to do so. Mr. Cornyn, who has voted against several of President Obama’s nominees, said Mr. Kerry had a “long history of liberal positions,” while Mr. Cruz said he had a “less-than-vigorous defense” of national security."

In 2016%2C photo ID will be required to vote in North Carolina.

Early voting sites will now be open longer.

North Carolina has no-excuse absentee voting. New York does not.

Imagine if the Transportation Security Administration decided airline passengers no longer need a photo ID. Providing a name and destination would be good enough to board an airplane. No doubt, the public and our national elected representatives wouldn't stand for such lax protection.

Similar concern has been expressed by new residents of North Carolina when they discover a photo ID isn't required at the polls. They're amazed that providing a name and address is all it takes to get inside the voting booth.

Newcomers aren't the only ones concerned. The vast majority of North Carolinians believe that photo ID should be required to cast a vote.

In 2016, photo ID will be required to vote in North Carolina, just as it is today when citizens cash a check, apply for government benefits or even when buying cold remedies such as Sudafed.

The need for photo ID has been questioned by those who say voter fraud isn't a problem in North Carolina. However, assuming fraud isn't a threat when multimillion dollar campaigns are trying to win in a state where millions of votes are cast is like believing oversight isn't needed against Wall Street insider trading.

The changes we're making in early voting have been called restrictive by liberals and the news media. That's not true. While the early voting calendar has been shortened, the actual number of hours a voter has to cast an early ballot is unchanged.

Going forward, early voting sites will now be open longer, and uniform days of operation will guarantee every voter has an equal opportunity to cast an early ballot.

When our reforms are fully implemented, North Carolina will remain a national leader in ballot access, a fact you might find surprising given the hypocritical national reporting.

The New York Times characterized North Carolina as a leader in voter suppression. Yet, North Carolina has 10 days of early voting. New York offers none. North Carolina has no-excuse absentee voting. New York does not.

In reality, the legislation I signed into law keeps North Carolina in the mainstream of election law, not the fringes.

Photo ID has made flying safer and prevents fraud in government programs. Photo ID has become a part of everyday life in America, and our individual vote deserves the same protection.

Pat McCrory is the governor of North Carolina."

He Left The Post In April']",Welcome to the Hillary Rodham Clinton presidential speculation sweepstakes,"There’s a super PAC to support her and one that’s trying, at least in part, to stop her. Every word she utters is parsed by cable TV, blogs and anyone with a political pulse for indications of which way she is leaning. And, there are still 922 days between now and Jan. 1, 2016.

Welcome to the Hillary Rodham Clinton presidential speculation sweepstakes, a process that not only has begun earlier than it did before Clinton ran for president in 2008 but also is significantly more well developed — on both sides of the equation.

“It did start earlier this time around,” said Brian Wolff, a longtime senior aide to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). “You have the confluence of her being the anointed nominee [and] Obama supporters’ overwhelming support for her.”

Already there is Ready for Hillary, a super PAC designed to prime the pump for a Clinton presidential bid that has among its supporters longtime Clinton confidant Harold Ickes and even Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), a strong backer of Sen. Barack Obama in the 2008 primary fight.

And just last week, America Rising, a conservative-aligned super PAC, launched Stop Hillary 2016, a Web site designed to raise money for its efforts to “prevent Americans from ever having to see another Clinton in the White House.”

At this point in the run-up to the 2008 election, Clinton was running for a second term in the Senate and deflecting all questions about her political future until that race concluded in late 2006. While Republicans attempted to recruit a serious contender against her in that 2006 race in hopes of forcing her to spend some time (and money) in the Empire State, they failed miserably. She eventually announced her presidential campaign on Jan. 20, 2007.

While there is broad agreement in the political world that the Clinton hype has started sooner than it did last time, there are differing opinions as to whether that is a good or a bad thing for her if she does decide to run.

“What worries me about the super PACs and groups starting so early is that it is hard to sustain a movement based on an idea — sooner or later, enthusiasm will stall and supporters will want a decision by the person,” said Penny Lee, a former executive director at the Democratic Governors Association and now a lobbyist. “You want to make sure that need for a decision coincides with Hillary’s own timing and doesn’t force her to make a decision before she is ready.”

There have already been some grumbles about Ready for Hillary and whether its stated goal of clearing a path for Clinton when she decides to run might have the opposite effect — by, as Lee suggests, forcing her hand before she is ready to decide or making her look political before she wants to appear that way.

Others argue, however, that all of the early jockeying and planning around the possibility of Clinton running again ultimately is a good thing for her if she wants to run.

“I’m one who believes the early hype is a good thing on both fronts if managed properly,” said GOP media consultant Fred Davis, who handled advertising for the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). “She’s basically able to imply her opponents can huff and puff — but this time you’ll never blow this house down.”

Managing the attention that all of this early activity has created around Clinton is critical. On the one hand, she benefits from being seen as nonpolitical (or at least not a candidate) for as long as possible. On the other, if all of the buzz forces the media to litigate Clinton’s problems — or potential problems — now rather than in the heat of a 2016 presidential campaign, that’s a plus for her.

Also worth considering: Clinton, while one of the most famous people in the world, is out of office and, therefore, has no natural way of making news or driving an issue agenda. She clearly views her involvement in the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation as that vehicle, although it remains to be seen just how effective she can drive a message from that perch.

Whether all of the attention is a good thing or bad thing in the long run then depends on what Clinton and her political team— who is in her inner circle remains unclear — can make of it.

“It’s a double-edged sword. Early hype can deter viable challenges, but it also invites the kind of scrutiny that can deflate a bubble very quickly,” said Phil Singer, a senior staffer in Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign. “The team needs to manage the buzz carefully.”"
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/02/24/Club-for-Growth-Interview,2013-02-24 00:00:00,['Tony Lee'],"Exclusive–Club for Growth: Culture of Senate Beginning to Change; Cruz, Lee, Paul Will 'Stand and Fight'","Chris Chocola, the president of the Club for Growth, told Breitbart News this weekend that establishment Republicans who have no qualms about growing the size of government and benefit from it find the fiscally conservative group to be a nuisance because the Club aggressively identifies conservatives and backs them in Republican primaries.

And when candidates the Club for Growth supports come to Washington, they often do not just “go along to get along,” especially when it comes to matters regarding taxes and spending.

Case in point: Ted Cruz.

In 2012, establishment Republicans like Karl Rove and American Crossroads preferred Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst over Ted Cruz in the Texas Republican Senate primary, with their donors backing Dewhurst against Cruz. It was the Club for Growth that helped Cruz counter the Rove-approved establishment money that was going to Dewhurst’s campaign in addition to Dewhurst’s considerable wealth, which he used to self-fund his failed Senate run. The Club for Growth spent $5.5 million in independent expenditure ads to support Cruz in his fight against Dewhurst. The group accounted for 83% of all pro-Cruz outside spending.

While Sarah Palin’s endorsement of Cruz ultimately got the attention of and galvanized Tea Partiers and conservatives to ensure Cruz got into the runoff against Dewhurst, the Club for Growth’s money ensured Cruz could stay on the air against Dewhurst in Texas’s huge and expensive media markets.

Rove, in stark contrast, said on Fox News’ “Hannity” after Cruz won the primary that Texas had “three good candidates” in that race, meaning Rove, unlike the Club for Growth, would have been perfectly content with the more moderate candidates like Dewhurst who would not fight in Washington, D.C.

Last year, the group emphasized that it committed “to do everything within our power to ensure Cruz won the primary” and “went all in and it did so because it is absolutely critical to the future of our nation that we have a true fiscal conservative representing the state of Texas in the United States Senate.”

And that’s exactly what Cruz has done since arriving in Washington, D.C., voting against John Kerry to be the next Secretary of State and fiercely questioning President Barack Obama’s Secretary of Defense nominee Chuck Hagel to the point where liberals have resorted to calling him a “McCarthyite.”

Chocola noted the Republican establishment often views the types of candidates the Club for Growth supports as “threats to the big-government status quo” that Republicans often help enable.

Chocola added that in part because of the group’s efforts, those in Congress are talking about “spending less money, not simply slowing the rate of growth of spending.”

The full interview with Chocola is below.

Breitbart News: Given the success of Club for Growth in supporting free market principles, policies and candidates, what do you make of the attacks–often behind closed doors–by establishment figures like Karl Rove and Haley Barbour regarding your involvement in Republican primaries?

Chris Chocola: We’re not surprised at all. The Republican establishment has always viewed the types of candidates supported by our PAC as threats to the big-government status quo that the GOP often helps enable. We’ll continue to support candidates like Ted Cruz, Pat Toomey and Marco Rubio. They’ll continue to support candidates like David Dewhurst, Arlen Specter, and Charlie Crist. It’s that simple.

Breitbart News: What are Club for Growth’s key objectives for 2013?

Chris Chocola: We want to continue to grow the pro-growth caucus by supporting strong, fiscally conservative candidates through our PAC. We are hoping that the candidates the PAC has helped elect are helping to drive the agenda within the Republican Party. We’ll be watching closely to see if Republicans stand strong on sequestration and the continuing resolution. We’ll be urging them to cut spending and put us on a path to a balanced budget within 10 years. The whole purpose of the Club for Growth is to encourage policies that lead to a high-growth economy, and we’re very concerned that our growing debt burden and uncertainty about our economic future is holding us back. All we’ve ever wanted from Congress is responsible behavior, and we think that message is beginning to percolate throughout capitol hill. For the first time in a long time, members of Congress are talking about spending less money, not simply slowing the rate of growth of spending. That’s a sea-change, and we’re looking to build on that momentum.

Breitbart News: When you look at specific policy proposals–such as those dealing with the debt ceiling, the deficit, the fiscal cliff, and federal spending in general–do you think the Club is winning the war of war of ideas among the Republicans on Capitol Hill.

Chris Chocola: We take pride in our ability to advocate for free markets and limited government, but it’s really the new members we’ve helped elect through our PAC that are driving policy. It’s because of members of Congress like Jeff Flake and Pat Toomey that earmarks are banned. It’s because of members like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul and Mike Lee that the culture of the Senate is beginning to change. We supported those members and others because of what they believe, and they will stand and fight for their principles. Our goal is to get a majority of the majority. We’re not there yet, but the changes that have happened within the Republican Party on policy over the past decade because of the Club for Growth and its members is undeniably positive."

With little actual legislation expected as the Senate winds down before its Christmas recess in less than two weeks, Democrats, who control the action on the floor, have decided to use their new power to push through dozens of presidential nominees for everything from high-profile positions like the secretary of homeland security to more obscure ones like ambassador to Albania.

But the two-century-old Senate rule book still offers the minority party plenty of avenues to stall even if the filibuster is not an option. Like a losing team using up all its timeouts before the end of a game, Republicans have started to take advantage of those alternatives and vowed on Tuesday to continue doing so as long as they could.

“It’s very important that we do what we think is necessary to bring home the point that they broke the rules,” said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. “They have basically violated everything I’ve known of as a member of the United States Senate. For us to say that’s fine, business as usual, is not something that we could possibly do.”

Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said flatly, “If the majority can’t be expected to follow the rules, then there aren’t any rules.”"

He Previously Covered South Asia Mumbai', 'India', 'National Security The Washington Bureau.']",Chuck Hagel’s opponents switched gears,"WASHINGTON — For all the controversy over President Obama’s choice for Defense secretary, many of Chuck Hagel’s most outspoken critics were for the former Nebraska senator before they were against him.

In 2006, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who forged a close bond with Hagel over their shared service in Vietnam and penchant for bucking the Republican establishment, said, “I’d be honored to have Chuck with me in any capacity.”

In 2007, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged that many of Hagel’s dire predictions about the Iraq war had come true. He praised Hagel at an Omaha fundraiser as “one of the premier foreign policy voices” and “one of the giants in the United States Senate.”

Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) worked with Hagel for years on efforts to ease the embargo against Cuba and promote trade policies to help Midwestern farmers. He tolerated playful ribbing from Hagel when the University of Nebraska beat Kansas schools in football.

Now, McCain says he worries about his fellow Republican’s “worldview.” McConnell said, “I’m going to take a look at all the things that Chuck has said over the years and review that … in terms of his qualifications to lead our nation’s military.” And Roberts has said flatly that he won’t back his onetime friend for the Pentagon post, citing “a lot of concern about Chuck.”

Several factors are behind the opposition to Hagel, including the anger he caused among many Republicans by criticizing the George W. Bush administration’s Iraq policies and by endorsing some Democrats for office.

At least in public, the opposition to his nomination has focused on remarks he’s made on Israel and Iran, particularly one 2006 interview in which he said the “Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people” in Congress. Critics have objected to his referring to the lobbying as “Jewish” rather than “pro-Israel.”

Supporters note that Israeli leaders haven’t voiced any such worries about Hagel, who has often called Israel “a close friend and ally.” They say he’s been the victim of a U.S. political landscape that has become not only more partisan but less tolerant of criticism of Israel. Particularly on the Republican side of the aisle, unwavering support for Israeli policies has become a litmus test over the last decade.

“The debate about the U.S. relationship with Israel has certainly moved to the right,” said Bob Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat who served alongside Hagel in the Senate until 2001. “You could oppose settlements in the 1990s,” he said, referring to Israelis building on land beyond Israel’s 1968 borders. “Not anymore.”

A review of Hagel’s history shows a worldview, particularly on the Middle East, that does not fit easily into current political divisions.

Shaped by a tour in Vietnam — where mine explosions left him with burns and shrapnel lodged in his chest — Hagel, 66, has long been a reliable if sometimes blunt voice for caution in using military force. He has called for engaging with America’s enemies instead of isolating them and for a healthy but restrained defense budget.

He first ran for the Senate in 1996 on a pledge to increase defense spending, which had been cut sharply after the end of the Cold War. By the time he ran for his second term, defense spending had begun to soar in the buildup after the Sept. 11 attacks. In recent years he’s called the Pentagon budget “bloated.”

Hagel had been in the Senate barely a year when, during a Foreign Relations Committee hearing in 1998, he cited a “perception in the Arab world that we’ve tilted way too far toward Israel in the Middle East peace process.”

But at the same time he was building ties to Israeli leaders. In December 2000, a surge of deadly violence threatened President Clinton’s bid to seal an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal in the final weeks of his presidency. At the request of the incoming Bush administration, Hagel carried an urgent message to Israeli leaders.

In a private meeting at the Israeli defense ministry, Hagel assured embattled Prime Minister Ehud Barak that Bush would support the peace deal if he signed it. It was a crucial promise from the American president-elect, who was then little known in the Middle East. In the end, Palestinian opposition killed the peace bid.

Martin Indyk, then-U.S. ambassador to Israel and the only other person in the meeting, said Hagel was “very sensitive, sympathetic and most of all supportive. He helped to calm Barak.”

In recent years, Hagel has rejected unilateral sanctions against Iran, arguing that they only inflame anger in the Muslim world, but has said he supports sanctions imposed in concert with U.S. allies. He has argued against military action to stop Iran from building a nuclear weapon but, in a September opinion article in the Washington Post, called for “keeping all options on the table, including the use of military force.”

That skepticism about sanctions has a long history with Hagel. In 2001, he was one of two senators to vote “no” on renewing unilateral U.S. sanctions against Iran and Libya.

Advertisement

“Somebody has to give another point of view here,” Hagel said at a Senate Banking Committee hearing in which he questioned whether the sanctions worked.

But at the same hearing, he invoked Israel’s needs, saying, “I don’t think you bring more security to Israel by this kind of policy — which, again, unless you can tell me otherwise, has not produced any results.”

Advertisement

In a 2006 speech at the Brookings Institution, Hagel criticized U.S. boycotts of talks with Hamas, Iran, Syria and other foes, saying that approach impeded efforts to end crises in the region.

“I don’t know how the world has gotten better” by the U.S. refusal to talk, he said. “Things have gotten worse by any measure. And so it tells me that we’d better take some serious review of our current policy.”

Advertisement

Many of Hagel’s words echo those of Obama, who, like many Israeli military leaders, is said to be reluctant to launch a military strike on Iran. Obama has imposed tough sanctions on Iran but resisted more severe measures pushed by some in Congress because they could weaken a broad coalition of nations — including China — that backs the measures currently in place.

Hagel’s supporters say that in his two terms in the Senate — he now serves as chairman of the Atlantic Council, a think tank that promotes multilateralism — he was a consistent realist.

“The principles he came away with from Vietnam are still there,” said Charlyne Berens, a University of Nebraska-Lincoln journalism professor who wrote a 2006 biography on Hagel. “He’s been saying these things for more than a decade.”

http://news.yahoo.com/no-surprises-alexander-gop-incumbents-161209771--election.html,,[],No surprises for Alexander and GOP incumbents,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Faced with a potentially serious primary challenger, Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander was not about to sit back and wait.

The former two-term governor locked down endorsements, banked more than $3 million and linked arms with popular Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and former GOP presidential contender Mike Huckabee. When conservative state Rep. Joe Carr announced he would challenge Alexander, the senator's team was ready.

""I learned to count in Maryville City Schools,"" Alexander wrote in a recent op-ed in The Tennessean, recalling his East Tennessee hometown. ""So I know that if you only have 45 votes and you need 60 senators to get something important done like balancing the budget and fixing the debt, then you have to work with other people — that is, IF you really care about solving the problem.""

Call it the Revenge of the Incumbents: Alexander is the latest Senate Republican staring down a primary challenge with aggressive tactics aimed at blunting any early momentum from tea party-backed opposition. The early moves seek to avoid the fate of former Senate colleagues who were bounced by tea party challengers in 2010 and 2012.

In Kentucky, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has scorched challenger Matt Bevin with stinging ads accusing him of accepting government bailouts to help his family business and embellishing his academic background. Bevin, with help from tea party supporters, has responded with his own accusations, labeling the Senate leader ""Mudslinging Mitch"" and tarring him for supporting the Wall Street bailout in 2008.

South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has drawn criticism from conservatives for pushing immigration reform, has raised more than $6 million for his re-election and could be helped by a crowded primary field that includes three conservative opponents. Wyoming Sen. Mike Enzi has locked up support from Senate leaders and his Republican colleagues in the face of a challenge from Liz Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney.

Story continues

The early tangling shows the degree to which some Republicans are trying to dispel critics who say they have been too prone to cut deals with Democrats and support the federal bailouts that marked the end of the Bush administration. With the public holding Congress in low esteem, they could face similar headwinds that derailed incumbents like Dick Lugar of Indiana, Bob Bennett of Utah and former Rep. Mike Castle of Delaware.

But they won't be surprised.

""They won't be caught asleep at the switch like Sen. Lugar,"" said Greg Strimple, a Republican pollster who advised John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign.

In Tennessee, Alexander had already spent close to $1 million on his campaign before Carr entered the race. The senator has secured a list of endorsements from county chairmen and former state chairs. He also ran an ad in July highlighting his work with Paul to halt federal fishing restrictions in their states and appeared with the tea party favorite at an event in Nashville last month.

Since Carr's announcement, Alexander has broadcast TV and radio ads citing his 23 votes to eliminate President Barack Obama's health care laws and featuring an exchange with the president over the merits of the sweeping overhaul. It follows a radio spot by the Senate Conservatives Fund, an outside GOP group, that criticized Alexander for declining to join efforts to threaten a government shutdown over health care funding.

""We never expected not to have some opposition in this political environment,"" said Alexander campaign adviser Tom Ingram. He suggested that tough tactics will come if needed, saying: ""In politics you measure your opponents before you waste ammo. But when you fire, you do so very carefully and selectively. And you make sure you hit your target.""

Carr, who had previously planned to challenge Republican Rep. Scott DesJarlais, has likened his campaign against Alexander to the Biblical story of David vs. Goliath, and he has said Alexander's voting record had betrayed conservatives in recent years.

Political unknown Brenda Lenard, who has struggled to raise money, also is challenging Alexander. Tennessee tea party groups also are planning a series of events to determine their preferred candidate, and several others are considering a bid, including Knox County Mayor Tim Burchett and former Williamson County GOP chairman Kevin Kookogey.

But Republicans call Carr the most serious challenger so far, and they say he could be hurt by remarks he made at a Republican National Convention event last year in which he appeared to agree with Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin's statement that women have the biological ability to prevent pregnancy following a rape. Carr later tried to distance himself from the remarks.

Republicans say the two high-profile primaries — Tennessee and Kentucky — could hinge on whether the Senate Conservatives Fund and a separate group, the Club for Growth, pour money and advertising into the states to tear down the incumbents.

The Senate Conservatives Fund, which was founded by former South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint, spent about $16 million in 2012 and $8 million in 2010. The Club for Growth, an anti-tax group led by former Indiana Rep. Chris Chocola, spent about $18 million last year and about $5.5 million in 2010, a sign that it could shake up these races if they get involved.

Matt Hoskins, the Senate Conservatives Fund's executive director, said both Alexander and McConnell should be on notice.

""You really can't put lipstick on a pig,"" Hoskins said. ""You can surround yourself with as many endorsements as you want. If your record is liberal and people find out about that, there aren't enough endorsements in the world to cover that up.""

http://news.yahoo.com/5-things-obama-tried-during-state-union-address-220559135--politics.html,,[],5 Things Obama Tried to Say During His State of the Union Address -- But Didn't,"Some words missing from tonight's State of the Union address: Iraq. Famine. Sudan. Moon. Mars. Assault rifles. Keystone XL. Videogames. Clinton. Fracking.



The State of the Union is the most public of events but it’s also filled with hidden meanings. The president is explicit at times saying he wants this or that--a higher minimum wage, a “National Energy Trust”--and at other times it’s more obtuse, deliberately so. Omissions mean as much as commissions.



So here are five moments of the State of the Union address, decoded for greater understanding:



1. Deflating the deficit. Obama said: “Over the last few years, both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than $2.5 trillion -- mostly through spending cuts, but also by raising tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. As a result, we are more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction.”



What he meant: Reality check. Technically he's right; Congress has made cuts from future growth. But the deficit has grown remarkably under Obama’s watch to over 100 percent of GDP. Whether you blame the president or the recession for that is one issue. What’s indisputable is that Obama wants to portray the deficit as a problem that’s on its way to resolution and one that can be worked out with more bipartisanship.



But the effort to reframe the debate is a tricky one. Republicans have made the deficit and spending the centerpiece of all they do, and while it didn’t help them in the last election, it’s still a message that rallies their base and their legions in Congress. Obama could have adopted some of their urgency but he chose not to, instead making spending and deficit reduction less of a priority. This will play well to Democrats and Paul Krugman readers but it may not be the best way to win GOP votes that he’ll need for passage. After all, the tax increase he got through Congress was a lucky break, the result of the Bush tax cuts expiring. It won’t be nearly so easy this year as he attempts to get a GOP-controlled House to sign on to his “balanced” approach to deficit reduction.



2. The clock is ticking on immigration. The president said this about immigration: “In other words, we know what needs to be done. As we speak, bipartisan groups in both chambers are working diligently to draft a bill, and I applaud their efforts. Now, let’s get this done. Send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few months, and I will sign it right away.”



What he meant: The president doesn’t have a lot of time to get this done. There’s a rare burgeoning bipartisan consensus for immigration reform and the longer time passes before a vote, the more likely the idea is likely to die. It’s the basic law of congressional inertia that ideas rarely gather strength over time. Obama is also signaling to Hispanic groups that he understands their urgency. The president kicked immigration reform to his second term and some of his erstwhile allies are still miffed.



3. Drones, what drones? What he said: “Today, the organization that attacked us on 9/11 is a shadow of its former self. Different al-Qaida affiliates and extremist groups have emerged -- from the Arabian Peninsula to Africa. But to meet this threat, we don’t need to send tens of thousands of our sons and daughters abroad, or occupy other nations.... Where necessary, through a range of capabilities, we will continue to take direct action against those terrorists who pose the gravest threat to Americans.”



What he meant: President Obama faces a tricky moment on al-Qaida. He has to declare enough victory in Afghanistan to justify leaving while pointing America towards a long twilight challenge from a constellation of al-Qaida franchises. It’s telling that he uses the mealy-mouth phrase “a range of capabilities” when he surely means drones, special forces, and the like. He doesn’t want to define this new phase of the war too specifically.



4. Gun control is about a vote. The president said: They deserve a vote. They, of course, are gun-violence victims. The vote is on some of his proposals. It’s not surprising he brought up the issue. What is interesting is the way he framed it.



What he meant: The president’s rousing call for a vote on gun issues puts the onus on his opponents and spares him having to promise success. Just a vote is all he asks. And by mentioning the slew of mass shootings in disparate corners of the country he made it a national problem. It’s probably the best play for a president who doesn’t have an easy way to get this through.



5. Tax Reform: I’m for it. Now show me a plan. The president talked up tax reform: “Now is our best chance for bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit.”



What he meant: Hey, I’m not going to send you a comprehensive tax plan, you gotta come up with it. That may be too lax. The Reagan Treasury Department goosed tax reform in 1986 and the president is already counting on Congress to work up an immigration plan. This is one area where he could help Congress from taking too much shrapnel by proposing some reforms. What he told us is that he won’t."

My guess is that Priebus' real concern has nothing to do with pro-Hillary collusion between NBC News and NBC Entertainment. He just doesn't want Hillary Clinton, the presumptive favorite for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, to get extra air time, adulatory or otherwise, as the election season approaches. But is that really a big concern in this multiplatform age? Surely we've progressed past the time when people worried that Arnold Schwarzenegger the politician would receive some unfair political advantage if ""Terminator"" were rerun on TV (as if susceptible voters couldn't watch it on a DVD). And isn't it patronizing to suggest that voters could be manipulated by a miniseries or a documentary? The best answer to Preibus' complaint is that, whatever her political prospects, Hillary Rodham Clinton is a historical figure with a fascinating personal backstory. That she's also a potential candidate for president doesn't change those facts. So let the cameras roll. And rather than agonize about whether the movies will mess with their brand, reporters at CNN and NBC should focus on covering the 2016 campaign fairly.

Presidential debates have not been debates for a long time. In the primaries, they’re cattle shows where a half dozen or more would-be nominees recite talking points hoping for a sound bite that sticks for 24 hours. In the general election, they’re press conferences with two participants trying to avoid stepping on landmines. The most memorable moments have had less to do with substantive discussion than appearance, like President Obama sleepwalking through his first encounter with Mitt Romney in 2012. But even from that low starting point, Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, has dragged the idea of presidential debates farther down. [...] On one level, Mr. Priebus is right. Debate moderators have not been people whose interest was promoting the Republicans or their nominees. They have been journalists whose interest was in asking questions dispassionately. That’s how it is supposed to be. If the Mr. Priebus wants debate moderators to lob softballs designed to let the candidates look good and avoid areas that might hurt them, he should just give Fox News an exclusive.

The Republican House caucus has probably stopped comprehensive immigration reform this year. If the GOP succeeds in blocking the path to citizenship for immigrants, the Republicans will fail at the polls next year. When Republicans aren't blocking reform legislation, they spend their time trying to kill reforms that are already law. House Republicans have now voted 40 times to kill the Affordable Care Act, which Hispanic Americans support in large numbers. The GOP's electoral problems extend far beyond Hispanic voters. A national poll that CBS conducted in July indicated that Americans are much more concerned about the economy (40 percent) than the budget deficit (16 percent), or anything else for that matter. By focusing like a laser beam on the deficit, the GOP is blissfully ignoring the problem that concerns large numbers of voters. Meanwhile President Obama has spent the last two weeks on the road, talking about the economy.

the humanities are not about success. They’re about questioning success — and every important social value. Socrates taught us this, and we shouldn’t forget it. Sure, someone who studies literature or philosophy is learning to think clearly and write well. But those skills are means to an end. That end, as Plato said, is learning how to live one’s life. “This discussion is not about any chance question,” Plato’s Socrates says in “The Republic,” “but about the way one should live.” That’s what’s at the heart of the humanities — informed, thoughtful dialogue about the way we ought to conduct life. This dialogue honors no pieties: All positions are debatable; all values are up for discussion.

Teaching should be among the most respected professions. Teachers should be paid extremely well, and they should have tremendous amounts of support, resources and quality professional development. Teachers should bring out the creative spark in children. Teachers should help students gain high levels of rigorous knowledge and skills. And teachers should be held to high standards that look at how they and their students perform on a variety of measures, year after year. These “shoulds” build on one another; they do not tear one another down. For low-income children and parents, there are many comprehensive services that can help level the playing field, and not just academically. Housing policy is education policy. Transportation policy is education policy. Health-care policy is education policy. Criminal justice policy is education policy. Food policy is education policy. And, yes, education policy is education policy. I do not know anyone involved in the education reform movement worth his salt who thinks that schools are the sole answer; I do not know anyone opposed to the education reform movement worth her salt who thinks schools don’t matter. [...] There’s only one divide that matters: the one between those who believe all kids can succeed regardless of the circumstances of their birth and the color of their skin, and those who don’t.

Those who vote for the bill will be on Team Boehner and those who oppose it will be on Team Cantor. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is backing the bill, and conservative groups like FreedomWorks are opposing it.

House Speaker John Boehner is, according to some media accounts and several Republican members, prepared to vote in favor of the the Senate “fiscal cliff” deal that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Vice President Joe Biden cut late on New Year’s Eve, which passed by an 89-8 margin. Boehner aides haven’t answered requests for confirmation of these rumors and reports. The National Review‘s Robert Costa reports that Boehner won’t personally vote unless his vote is needed to pass the plan through the House.

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor will be taking a different path. He’ll be voting against the bill, and according to some offices, he’s been the organizing power behind House GOP opposition to the deal.

That means the number one and number two House Republicans will be heading in completely different directions when the “fiscal cliff” vote happens.

Some conservatives, like Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho, who plan to vote against the bill expect it to pass anyway. And that may end up happening. But the internal House GOP fight is far from over with this vote.

Boehner suffered politically after his failure to pass his fiscal cliff “Plan B” before Christmas, and now that he’ll likely need Democratic votes to push this plan through he’s even weaker.

That means Cantor, who’s wanted the speakership for a long time, could strike now and challenge Boehner in the election for House officeholders on Thursday–or he’ll likely have to wait at least another two years.

Cantor’s spokespersons Doug Heye and Rory Cooper both publicly tweeted denials. “Majority Leader Cantor stands with @SpeakerBoehner,” Heye wrote. “Speculation otherwise is silly, non-productive and untrue.”

“Folks out there w/ crazy theories about what’s going on in House,” Cooper wrote. “All ridiculous. Just figuring out best path forward. Stay calm, carry on.”

Cooper’s and Heye’s comments don’t negate the fact that Boehner and Cantor are deliberately taking drastically different stances heading into this vote.

Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer even thinks Cantor may be going to make a move at Boehner. “It’s possible (Eric Cantor’s opposition to fiscal cliff bill) is the prelude to a challenge Thursday,” Krauthammer said on Fox News Channel’s Special Report on Tuesday evening.

“It would be naked to do it at this late hour as a result of the split over this vote. Look, there are a lot of conservatives in the Republican caucus in the House who hate the bill and for good reason. This is a complete surrender on everything. The ratio of tax hikes to spending cuts is 40 to 1, rather than 1 to 1 or 1 to 2 or 1 to 3. So, I mean it’s a complete rout by the Democrats.”"

(CNN) – Karl Rove wasted no time in hitting back at Sarah Palin after she criticized him for getting involved in Republican primaries last year.

""If she can play in primaries, other people can play in primaries,"" he said on ""Fox News Sunday.""

During her speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday, Palin chided Washington establishment attempts to shape the last election, especially in congressional races. While she didn't mention his name, the former Alaska governor seemed to be aiming at Rove, the former top political adviser to George W. Bush who was dubbed the ""architect"" of the former president's campaigns.

Rove now runs American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS, two independent groups that spent money for conservative candidates in last year's contests, as well as in the 2010 mid-terms. While candidates that Crossroads supported two years ago saw success, most of them failed to win their contests last year.

""If these experts who keep losing elections and keep getting rehired and raking in millions, if they feel that strongly about who gets to run in this party, then they should buck up or stay in the truck. Buck up and run,"" Palin said. ""The architects can head on back.""

Rove is now starting another organization, the Conservative Victory Project, that's designed to help find candidates who can easily win Republican primaries. Palin joined tea party activists in blasting the new move, saying it's simply a way to push out more conservative voices.

Palin herself was active in backing the more conservative candidates in several Republican primaries last year. Many of her preferred candidates went on to win, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska.

With 20 months until the 2014 mid-terms, Palin said Washington should not be in the game of hand-picking a candidate. She urged her CPAC audience to change the ""top-down political process"" and create their own search for the next best crop of contenders.

Asked to respond to her remarks, Rove said Sunday that the 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee had little room to talk.

""Well, first of all, I live in Texas, and I don't live in Washington,"" Rove said on Fox, where Palin once served as a paid contributor.

""Second of all, look, Sarah Palin should be agreeing with this. She didn't support Todd Akin, and when he said the reprehensible things he said, she wisely came out and said he ought to get out of the race.""

He was referring to Akin's controversial statement about rape that ultimately derailed the Missouri congressman's campaign for the U.S. Senate - a seat he was favored to win. Akin made the comments soon after he became the Republican nominee in the race. Palin had backed Republican Sarah Steelman for the nomination.

Rove said he also had to set the record straight on two other points of contention.

""First of all, raking in millions - I'm a volunteer. I don't take a dime from my work with American Crossroads. I even pay my own travel expenses, out of my own pocket. I thought Sarah Palin was about encouraging volunteer, grass-roots activity. I'm a volunteer,"" he said.

""Second of all, look. I appreciate her encouragement that I ought to go home to Texas and run for office. I would be enthused if I ran for office to have her support. I will say this, though: I don't think I'm a particularly good candidate. Sort of a balding, fat guy. And second of all, I'd say if I did run for office and win, I would serve out my term. I wouldn't leave office midterm,"" he said, taking a swipe at Palin's decision to resign from her governorship in 2009."

Perry, whose endorsement in the May runoff election could be significant, was aiming her remarks at City Controller Wendy Greuel, who benefited from heavy financial support from organized labor on her way to a second-place finish in Tuesday’s primary. Greuel will face City Councilman Eric Garcetti in a May 21 runoff election.

Perry, a City Council member who finished fourth in the primary, declined to say whom she would support in the race’s final round. But she disparaged Greuel’s record, asserting that the controller owes too much to labor leaders she may have to face across a contract negotiating table.

Perry, an African American, represents a significant swath of South Los Angeles. She was the top vote-getter in that part of the city and among black voters — two voting blocs Garcetti and Greuel hope to attract in the runoff.

Garcetti and Greuel also are competing to attract conservative supporters of entertainment lawyer Kevin James, who finished third in Tuesday’s mayoral voting. The onetime federal prosecutor was scheduled to meet with Greuel on Friday and with Garcetti over the weekend.

In her first sit-down interview since the election, Perry was clear about her lack of admiration for Greuel, her onetime colleague on the City Council.

Greuel received $2.8 million in support from independent campaign committees, much of it from union workers at the city’s Department of Water and Power. The day after the election, she was endorsed by another union representing 10,000 civilian city employees. She also has the backing of the city’s police and fire unions.

That should be cause for deep concern, Perry said.

Voters “need to examine what that will mean to them,” Perry said. “They should look at where the money in this campaign comes from and think about if they want to have greater control of their public utility, for instance. Otherwise, if they don’t pay attention, they will be completely rolled over.

“Because that is what is at risk here, at great risk,” she continued. Having someone too closely allied with employee unions in the mayor’s office could mean “the death of independent politics altogether. It could mean the only way you get elected in this town is if you get money from unions.”

Greuel said she has demonstrated a willingness to confront those who aren’t performing for taxpayers. “I am proud to have both business and labor support,” she said. “I have demonstrated as controller that I am willing to take on my allies. I am going to be an independent person for the voters of Los Angeles.”

Greuel’s aides noted that Garcetti has also received public-employee unions support, including an endorsement from United Teachers of Los Angeles and the unions that represent airport and port police officers. Garcetti also sought the support of other city unions, which went to Greuel.

Perry argued that Greuel has received much more financial support from labor groups and alleged she would push out the city’s chief budget official, Miguel Santana, who has been at odds with union leaders. Santana is “bright, gifted and a truth-teller” whose removal would be “tragic,” Perry said.

Greuel said she has never said she would replace Santana. “I have been consistent and said I would look at every general manager when I become mayor of Los Angeles. And the bottom line is that I, ultimately, would be responsible.”

Perry’s rift with Greuel goes back at least to the mayoral campaign’s early days. The councilwoman contends Greuel sought to undermine her candidacy by spreading rumors that Perry would drop out of the race. The accusation is untrue, Greuel said.

Perry also said she was “amazed and appalled” when Greuel sent a mailer to voters noting that Perry had filed for personal bankruptcy and warning, “Don’t let her bankrupt L.A.” The financial troubles, Perry said, stemmed from her former husband’s law practice — a contention he backed up when the bankruptcy was first reported in the press.

Greuel “went and bought those ads and said I was covering something up,” Perry said. “I never covered anything up.”

Greuel said that the mayoral candidates’ lives were thrown open during the campaign and that financial failures were fair game.

Perry — who worked at City Hall for 23 years, most of them as a council aide — also spoke about her time in City Hall and her plans for the future. Among the things she learned in the mayoral campaign is the city remains racially polarized, despite some progress, she said.

People “told me early on that I could go out to the Valley all I wanted and that nobody there would change their mind,” she said. “I thought that was a sad commentary.” She said she was heartened that some voters, including conservatives, heard her out and liked her message.

She said she was moved that many voters empathized with her personal story — growing up in Ohio, the daughter of two civil rights activists who once had a cross burned on their lawn. “A lot of people even saved the mailer on that,” Perry said. “That meant a lot to me.”

The struggle for equal opportunity continues, she said, recalling an election-day tour of South L.A. housing projects. Many young men were milling about, without jobs or meaningful activities to keep them occupied, she said. “That has got to change, and it can still change,” Perry said. “I am looking for the candidate who can do something about that.”

Advertisement

She said she already has fielded calls about job possibilities. “Whatever I choose to do, I will have to have some passion for it,” she said.

She wistfully described driving out of the City Hall garage and seeing a man holding up her mailers. “You are my candidate! I am going to vote for you!” he declared.

But that was Thursday, Perry said, two days after the election.

Oxon Hill, Maryland (CNN) - Sarah Palin, igniting a crowd of conservatives, says it's time to stop ""preaching to the choir"" and instead evangelize a grass-roots, anti-Washington message to all Americans, even those who disagree with the right.

""They're not our enemies. They're our sisters and our brothers. They're our neighbors, they're our friends. It's imperative to reach out and to share that conservative message of liberty and less government and lower taxes,"" the former Alaska governor said, urging growth of the movement.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

Saturday marked Palin's second time to address the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. With the gathering serving as a time for introspection among the Republican Party, Palin bucked party leadership and said only real reform can come from the bottom up.

""We're not here to re-brand a party, we're here to rebuild a country,"" she said. ""We're here to restore America and the rest is just theatrics. The rest is sound and fury. It's just making noise.""

Palin's comments come two days before the Republican National Committee is scheduled to unveil its conclusions from a months-long ""autopsy"" of the party, following its big election losses in November.

Walking out to Shania Twain's ""She's Not Just a Pretty Face,"" the 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee easily got the crowd on their feet. Her speech was rife with her folksy tough talk and snipes at President Obama. And of course, no Palin speech is complete without references to her hunting and outdoors life in Alaska.

Take, for example, an anecdote about her husband buying her a rifle rack for Christmas, while she bought him a gun.

""This go-around, he's got the rifle, I've got the rack,"" she said.

She spurred another wave of cheers and applause while pausing to take a sip from a Big Gulp, a not-so-veiled swipe at New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's push against large sugary drinks. ""We're cool. Shoot, it's just pop with low calorie ice cubes in it. I hope that's OK.""

Not known for pulling her punches, Palin also took the opportunity to blast the president and Senate Democrats for failing to get a budget passed in four years.

""Barack Obama promised the most transparent administration ever,"" she said. ""You lied.""

The president, she said, has turned from ""no drama Obama"" to ""all drama Obama"" in a city that she said operates like a reality television show. She also dinged the president's support for background check legislation.

""And background checks, yeah, I guess to learn more about a person's thinking and associations and intentions? More background checks?"" she said. ""Dandy idea, Mr. President. Should have started with yours.""

But Palin's most forceful criticism was directed against GOP leaders in Washington.

She chided establishment attempts to shape the last election, especially in congressional races. While she didn't say his name, Palin seemed to take aim at Karl Rove, the former top political adviser to George W. Bush who was dubbed the ""architect"" of the former president's campaigns.

""If these experts who keep losing elections and keep getting rehired and raking in millions, if they feel that strongly about who gets to run in this party, then they should buck up or stay in the truck,"" she said. ""The architects can head on back.""

Rove's groups, American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS, spent millions in Senate races but had little success in getting their supported candidates elected. They're now facing push-back from tea party conservatives for starting a new group aimed to help electable candidates sail through Republican primaries.

Critics say the new move is simply a way to push out conservative voices. For her part, Palin was active in backing the more conservative candidate in several Republican primaries last year. Many of her preferred candidates went on to win, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska.

With 20 months until the 2014 mid-terms, Palin said Washington should not be in the game of hand-picking candidate. She urged the audience to change the ""top-down political process"" and create their own search for the next best crop of contenders.

""Now is the time to furlough the consultants, tune out the pollsters, send the focus groups home, and toss the political scripts, because if we truly know what we believe we don't need professionals to tell us,"" she said, adding one final message to Washington.

""Get over yourself,"" she said. ""It's not about you."""

“Latino groups are intensifying get-out-the-vote efforts in the Virginia governor’s race against a national backdrop of a congressional struggle over immigration reform,” NBC News Latino reports. “The groups said Thursday immigration reform is a critical issue on which candidates will be measured by Latino voters in the race.

As the groups work to have a strong showing of Latino turnout in Tuesday’s race, pressure has intensified on House Republicans to move immigration reform legislation in the waning days of this congressional year. That has helped keep the issue in the forefront as the Virginia candidates head to Election Day and groups try to turn out Latino voters in the state, home to the 16th largest population of Hispanic-eligible voters.”

NBC Latino quotes the National Council of La Raza Action Fund’s executive director Matthew McClellan who said his group and others are organizing 75,000 phone calls on behalf of McAuliffe and conducting door-to-door get-out-the-vote efforts, running ads in Spanish-language media and sending direct mail to more than 27,000 homes. “The Latino community is tired of talk and demanding action,” McClellan said. “Saying the right thing is not enough and we will be looking for action after is over.”

Labor Council for Latin American Advancement executive director Hector Sanchez called on Hispanics who want comprehensive immigration reform to show up at the polls for McAuliffe. “It’s very important for everyone to turn out to the polls, to analyze where those candidates are and make sure those candidates are representing Latinos on issues that are critical for the community,” Sanchez said.

They are specifically pushing DREAM Act proposals, ones that would grant amnesty to young illegal immigrants who crossed the border or entered or stayed in the country illegally before they became adults. Ken Cuccinelli, the GOP candidate running against McAuliffe, opposes amnesty and DREAM Act proposals.

No matter the result, these leftwing groups and others are likely to try to extrapolate the election results in Virginia to fit their national agenda, as both House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA) and House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) are from the Commonwealth. Cantor and Goodlatte are key players in the immigration debate, and both thus far remain publicly open to attempts from House GOP leadership to go to a conference committee to negotiate with the Senate and its “Gang of Eight” immigration bill. Cantor and Goodlatte remain open to such efforts despite the fact that the Senate bill’s key GOP sponsor, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), has publicly come out against such efforts"

The RNC sees the odd programing move as an in-kind contribution to Clinton’s presumed campaign for President in 2016. As a result, the party will formally bar Republicans from partnering with the networks on any primary or Presidential debates in 2016.

Priebus wrote to CNN:

I find CNN’s actions disturbing and disappointing. Your credibility as a supposedly unbiased news network will most certainly be jeopardized by the decision to show political favoritism and produce an extended commercial for Secretary Clinton’s nascent campaign.

And to NBC:

I find this disturbing and disappointing. NBC cannot purport to be a neutral party in American politics, and the credibility of NBC News, already damaged by the partisanship of MSNBC, will be further undermined by the actions of NBC Universal executives who have taken it upon themselves to produce an extended commercial for Secretary Clinton’s nascent campaign.

The decision by NBC and CNN to produce a mini-series or film about the life of Hillary Clinton is indeed odd. They do not regularly produce films about major figures in American politics. Perhaps I missed it, but I don’t recall a network bio of former Secretary of State Condolezza Rice. I also haven’t seen films about NY Senator Kristin Gillibrand or First Ladies Laura Bush and Michelle Obama.

The RNC Summer meeting is August 14th. Unless the networks scuttle their plans to produce their Hillary Clinton films, Priebus will seek a binding vote by the full RNC to bar the party from partnering with, or sanctioning, any primary or Presidential debate with the two networks.

The 2016 campaign for President has begun.

Let Chris Christie thunder to a second term as the governor of New Jersey, his hubris flowering as his ultimate designs on the White House take shape.

Jeb Bush, lying low in the subtropics of Florida, has something they don’t: the unalloyed affection of many of the Republican Party’s most influential moneymen, who are waiting for word on what he’ll do, hoping that he’ll seek the 2016 presidential nomination and noting with amusement how far he has drifted off fickle pundits’ radar, at least for the moment.

Politics today has a shorter memory than ever. It also has a more furious metabolism, which Bush hasn’t fed much since March, when he was promoting a new book on immigration and created enormous confusion about whether he does or doesn’t support a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who came here illegally. (He later clarified that he does, with caveats, and even later praised immigrants for being “more fertile.”) That awkwardness gave some of his supporters pause, as they wondered whether he’d been too long out of the fray and was too clumsy for the split-second hyperscrutiny of the Twitter era. He hasn’t run for anything since 2002, when he was re-elected as the governor of Florida, an office he left in early 2007. A whole lot has changed since.

But with the exception of that immigration mess, Bush has been a more articulate advocate of a new tone and direction for the Republican Party than have Paul, Cruz, Christie or others currently in the foreground of the 2016 race, which has already begun, on both sides of the aisle. (Hillary Clinton gave a big policy speech last week and has another already announced.)"

Steve King missed the message from party leaders about how supporting an immigration overhaul could help boost the GOP’s standing among Latino voters.

He just isn’t buying it.

“I’m incredulous with the conclusion they drew when the sun came up on the morning of Nov. 7,” the firebrand Iowa congressman said the other day, standing outside the Capitol. “They just said that Mitt Romney would be president-elect on that morning if he just hadn’t said two words: self-deport.”

It was a sparsely attended news conference: Just a handful of hard-line House Republicans protesting the immigration bill a Senate committee was poised to approve.

So it goes these days with the opposition to revamping the immigration system, a movement that has been more muted than six years ago when a similar effort successfully turned back a reform bill.

The opponents this time include a sizable coalition of tea party and conservative leaders, including many local-level talk radio hosts.

NumbersUSA, a group that has long fought to limit immigration, has run radio and television ads in more than a dozen states, seeking to pressure senators to vote against the bill. The organization’s president, Roy Beck, brushes off the idea that opposition has waned, noting that polls suggest Americans have mixed feelings about granting citizenship to immigrants. “It seems lonely — just us and the American people,” he said.

But the opponents face a much different landscape than six years ago. Not only are key Republicans not overtly attacking the proposal, but support appears much more solid among Democrats, who had also played a role in dashing earlier efforts.

The growing influence of the Latino electorate, which spurned Romney to help reelect President Obama, and the defeat of much of Arizona’s strict anti-immigration law in the Supreme Court, “created a lot of running room for Republicans to come to the table,” said Simon Rosenberg, president of NDN, a center-left think tank in Washington.

Republicans as well as Democrats have become more comfortable with offering legal status to an estimated 11 million people who have entered the U.S. illegally or stayed beyond their visas.

The lawmakers are being nudged along, in part, by the stories being told by young people brought to the United States as children who have become adults without legal status. These young adults, who call themselves “Dreamers,” after the Dream Act, a failed legislative effort that would have offered them a route to citizenship, have given a compelling voice to a once largely unheard immigrant population.

Frank Sharry, executive director of America’s Voice, an immigration reform advocacy group, recalls that a “sort of death march” took hold of the 2007 legislative effort as both sides found reasons to back away.

“I don’t think there are as many shaking Democrats today as there were in 2007,” said Angela Kelley, vice president of immigration policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress.

One other element has weighed heavily on both parties: the White House.

Obama used executive authority last summer to defer deportations of Dreamers who came forward and registered. It was, for many lawmakers, a turning point.

Democrats saw the move as a political win that helped give Obama a 44-percentage-point lead among Latinos over Romney in the election.

Advertisement

Republican leaders have since sought to persuade reluctant colleagues that the time has come for Congress to fix the immigration system, lest Obama take further action on his own — and Democrats seize a permanent advantage among the growing Latino electorate.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) has privately pushed a bipartisan group of lawmakers to complete their work on the House’s proposed immigration overhaul. “We’re not going to be stampeded by the White House or stampeded by the president,” he said last week.

Advertisement

King says that there are more Republican lawmakers on his side than the few who stood beside him on that sunny spring day and that he believes more will join to defeat the bill as voters learn about it.

In the NumbersUSA spots, a man’s voice argues that an overhaul will allow too many legal immigrants into the U.S. who would then compete with out-of-work Americans for jobs.

Advertisement

The group has enlisted its 2 million members to corner lawmakers at home. “We’re hoping to shame the senators: ‘You’ve got these long lines of unemployed Americans, and you’re going to pass this sort of bill?’” Beck said.

Like-minded Republican opponents also exist in the Senate, and so far not one beyond the four who helped draft the bill has fully endorsed the overhaul.

King predicted that over time, Republican leaders would join him.

“If they’re not on our side,” he said, “I’d suggest that they are convertibles.”

COVID-19 has claimed the life of another New Brunswicker, pushing the total number of COVID-related deaths in the province to 38, Public Health announced Monday, along with 15 new cases. A person in their 90s in the Edmundston region, Zone 4, has died ""as a result of COVID-19,"" according to a news release. The person resided at Pavillon Beau-Lieu, a special care home in Grand Falls, where there's an outbreak involving the variant first reported in South Africa. Health Minister Dorothy Shephard said she is saddened by the news. ""I join all New Brunswickers in sharing sincere condolences with this person's loved ones during this difficult time,"" she said in a statement. On Sunday, Public Health announced another resident of the special care home, someone in their 80s, had died in hospital ""as a result of COVID-19."" With the 15 new cases, there are now 142 active cases of respiratory disease in the province. Six people are in hospital, including two in intensive care. The breakdown of the new cases is as follows: Moncton region, Zone 1: one case: A person 30 to 39 This case is a contact of a previously confirmed case. Saint John region, Zone 2: three cases: A person 30 to 39 A person 40 to 49 A person 50 to 59 One case is under investigation, one case is travel-related and the other is a contact of a previously confirmed case. Fredericton region, Zone 3: five cases: A person under 19 A person 30 to 39 A person 40 to 49 Two people 60 to 69 Three of the cases are contacts of a previously confirmed case and two are travel-related. The 15 new confirmed cases announced Monday put the total number of active cases in the province at 142.(CBC) Edmundston region, Zone 4: three cases: Two people 50 to 59 A person 90 or over All three cases are contacts of a previously confirmed case and are linked to the outbreak at Pavillon Beau-Lieu. Campbellton region, Zone 5: one case: A person 50 to 59 This case is travel-related. Bathurst region, Zone 6: two cases: A person 40 to 49 A person 50 to 59 Both cases are travel-related. New Brunswick has had 1,954 confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic started just over a year ago. There have been 1,773 recoveries so far. A total of 295,822 tests have been conducted, including 1,339 on Sunday. UNB residence elevator eyed as possible source Public Health is investigating whether an elevator could be the source of transmission in the University of New Brunswick's Fredericton campus residence COVID-19 outbreak that still stands at 12 positive cases, as of Monday. Last week, Public Health and UNB looked into the ventilation system at Magee House and determined ""the risk is minimal,"" said Department of Health spokesperson Bruce Macfarlane. ""Public Health officials are now focusing their efforts to determine surface contacts within the elevator as the potential source of transmission,"" he said in an email. UNB's Magee House residence has about 180 adults and children living in the 101 apartment-style units, according to resident Martin Kutnowski.(Ed Hunter/CBC) According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, COVID-19 spreads from an infected person to others through respiratory droplets and aerosols (smaller droplets) created when an infected person talks, sings, shouts, coughs or sneezes. COVID-19 can also spread by touching something that has the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes with unwashed hands, the agency's website states. The outbreak at Magee House involves the variant first reported in India, which has two mutations that make it ""more concerning than all the others,"" Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Jennifer Russell has said. It is ""very, very, very aggressive in terms of being contagious and causing more severe symptoms."" Magee House is a seven-storey apartment-style residence designed for mature students, some of whom have families. The residents remain in isolation as Public Health deals with the outbreak. Paul Mazerolle, president and vice-chancellor of the University of New Brunswick, says isolation needs to happen at Magee House to prevent the spread of COVID-19.(Ed Hunter/CBC) Meanwhile, the UNB campus reopened Monday, as did the adjacent St Thomas University campus and nearby New Brunswick Community College campus, more than a week after they moved to essential services only in response to the outbreak. Faculty, staff and students can now go on campus as long as they follow relevant operational guidelines. ""COVID is difficult,"" said Paul Mazerolle, president of the University of New Brunswick. ""The uncertainty creates concern and we're not through this."" Monday marks day nine of the Magee House lockdown, and a third round of mass testing was scheduled for residents and staff on Sunday. As of Monday afternoon, Public Health was still awaiting the results. Alex Hill-Stosky, who lives with his family in Magee House, said many people in the building are either anxious or angry because of the lockdown. ""A lot of people feel we are test subjects rather than people,"" said the engineering student. Residents of Magee House at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton are in quarantine after at least 12 people tested positive for COVID-19. (Maria Jose Burgos/CBC) Mazerolle said he understands people are concerned and worried about their personal freedoms, but it's important to limit the spread of the virus. ""To minimize the potential spread, unfortunately people's movements need to be restricted for a limited period of time. … If we didn't restrict movement, we could be in a much worse situation."" Students have also expressed concerns over the residence's ventilation system. Mazerolle said the ventilation system has been checked twice and deemed safe by engineers with Public Health and the Department of Environment. ""From what I've been told by the experts, there's no evidence to suggest that the ventilation system is putting people at risk for COVID-19. Mazerolle expects Magee House to reopen on Saturday. ""We're looking forward to this coming to an end,"" he said. Public Health said the isolation period for Magee House individuals who have tested negative throughout the process could end Saturday. Meanwhile, the isolation for residents and staff of UNB's Elizabeth Parr-Johnston residence could be lifted as early as Wednesday, depending on the results of retests taking place Monday, said Public Health. So far, all test results have been negative. George Street Middle School reopens George Street Middle School in Fredericton reopened Monday, six days after students, staff and their families were urged by Public Health to self-isolate last week following a confirmed case of COVID-19. In a letter to parents on Sunday, Public Health said students and staff can return to school, and their families can return to work, with the exception of those who have been told by Public Health to self-isolate for 14 days. New Brunswick Public Health confirmed a case of COVID-19 at George Street Middle School in Fredericton last week.(Elizabeth Fraser/CBC) ""Custodial services have been through the school disinfecting high touch areas,"" said Dr. Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health. ""Everyone who has not been identified as a close contact should feel confident to return to normal activities."" The George Street and UNB cases are linked, Public Health said earlier. Voting in self-isolation Elections New Brunswick is encouraging people who are under COVID-19 isolation and haven't voted in the May 10 municipal election yet but wish to do so to contact their local returning office to find out what options are available. With election day less than a week away, the options available are starting to decrease, said Kim Poffenroth, municipal election officer. Municipal election officer Kim Poffenroth asks everyone to be patient as election officials, who are all temporary workers hired for just a few days of work, do their best to deliver these elections during the 'unusual and challenging circumstances of this pandemic.'(Screenshot/ParlVu) ""Our municipal returning officers will gladly work with these individuals to determine the best way to arrange for them to vote, based on their current situation,"" she said in a statement. Options may include voting by mail, if time permits, curbside voting, and other forms of contactless voting. ""We will do our utmost to make sure every New Brunswicker is provided with the opportunity to vote, while at the same time respecting public health rules and protecting the thousands of people working for us during these elections,"" Poffenroth said.

http://news.yahoo.com/ryan-says-gop-needs-pick-fights-obama-204420214--politics.html,,[],Ryan says GOP needs to pick its fights with Obama,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Rep. Paul Ryan has a message for fellow Republicans: Let's stick together and carefully pick our fights with President Barack Obama.

In a speech Saturday to conservatives, the Wisconsin congressman and 2012 vice presidential nominee outlined a pragmatic approach for dealing with a second Obama administration. Saying that Obama would attempt to divide Republicans, Ryan urged them to avoid internal squabbles.

""We can't get rattled. We won't play the villain in his morality plays. We have to stay united,"" Ryan said at the National Review Institute's weekend conference on the future of conservatism. ""We have to show that if given the chance, we can govern. We have better ideas.""

The GOP is reeling from back-to-back presidential defeats and trying to determine whether to oppose Obama at every turn or shape his proposals with conservative principles.

How the party rebounds was a major theme of the three-day meeting of conservative activists, a dominant voice in the GOP. A similar theme dominated the Republican National Committee's winter meeting, which ended Friday in Charlotte, N.C.

With a surging minority population altering the electorate, Republican leaders have discussed the need to attract more women and Hispanics while at the same time standing firm on the values that unite conservatives. Republicans said despite the losses, the party could return to power by projecting optimism and attracting new voters with a message of economic opportunity.

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a star among conservatives after surviving a union-led campaign to recall him from office, said government needed ""brown-bag common sense,"" a reference to his frugal practice of packing his own lunch of ham-and-cheese sandwiches every day. Qualities like optimism, staying relevant to voters and showing courage in tackling big problems would be rewarded at the voting booth, he said.

""We've got to learn to be more optimistic. We've got to learn to give a viable alternative to the voters,"" Walker said.

Story continues

Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said Republicans needed to use upcoming fights over the budget and the deficit as ""leverage points"" to tame long-term spending and debt. Projecting an upbeat outlook for the party, he said Obama's policies would drive many voters to Republicans just as many Americans turned to Ronald Reagan after the economic turmoil of the late 1970s.

""We're on the verge of a rebirth of conservativism,"" Cruz said.

Looking ahead, Ryan rejected the notion that Republicans were ""in the wilderness,"" noting that the party controls the House and most statehouses. But he said Obama's victory over Romney meant that Republicans would need to recalibrate their approach to deal with the new political realities.

""If we want to promote conservatism, we'll need to use every tool at our disposal,"" Ryan said. ""Sometimes, we will have to reject the president's proposals — that time may come more than once. And sometimes we'll have to make them better."" He said Republicans should have two main goals for the next four years, namely ""to mitigate bad policies"" and ""to advance good policy wherever we can.""

Ryan acknowledged that ""we all didn't see eye to eye"" on the recent ""fiscal cliff"" vote to deal with a combination of spending cuts and higher taxes that were set to take effect at the start of the year. He defended his support for the bill, saying it was the only way to avoid sweeping tax increases and prevent the economy from going into a free-fall.

As chairman of the House Budget Committee, Ryan said Republicans needed to guard against a debt crisis for the country that would undermine the economy. He said he would promote changes to Medicare and Medicaid and would propose a budget ""that will balance and pay down the debt.""

But November's election results still linger. Ryan said he was ""disappointed"" by the outcome, saying he was ""looking forward to taking on the big challenges"" while living at the vice president's residence. ""My kids were looking forward to having a pool,"" he joked.

Obama was seen as “cool” in 2008, and his popularity spread like wildfire among young voters. Obama and his “Change we can believe in” slogan was a trend in 2008 to which many young Americans were attracted. In 2008 and again in 2012, the Obama campaign used young supporters as precinct captains and boots on the ground. They were enthusiastic voices bringing their friends and neighbors into the campaign. The RNC and Republican candidates need to establish the same network of committed young voters who will help spread our message.

This is not a unique take—the general view of Republicans is that Obama’s success with young voters is a product of some intrinsic “cool” he possesses. If the GOP can mimic that cool, the argument goes, then they’ll make inroads with young people."

Story highlights Conservative Political Action Conference calls itself largest gathering of conservatives Most politicians considering a presidential run are appearing at the conference Last year's GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney will speak to conference on Friday

(CNN) —

Nearly a dozen Republicans who might be considering a run for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016 are auditioning in front of the Conservative Political Action Conference, which touts itself as the largest and oldest annual gathering of conservatives.

On Friday, Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, will speak at CPAC. If Romney is the GOP’s past, then Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky are the GOP’s future.

Both men, considered leading 2016 Republican White House hopefuls, gave back-to-back and dueling speeches Thursday. Although different in style and with divergent plans to revitalize a party that’s lost the last two presidential elections, both men praised the conservative cause.

“We don’t need a new idea. There is an idea. The idea is called America, and it still works,” Rubio said to loud applause.

Paul said that for the Republican Party to win, “liberty needs to be the backbone of the GOP.”

Texas Gov. Rick Perry spoke a few hours later. His 2012 bid for the GOP nomination crashed and burned, but he is considering another run in 2016. Perry used his address to criticize Romney and Arizona Sen. John McCain, the 2008 Republican nominee.

“The popular media narrative is that this country has shifted away from conservative ideals, as evidenced by the last two presidential elections. That’s what they say,” Perry said. “That might be true if Republicans had actually nominated conservative candidates in 2008 and 2012.”

On Friday, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, a conservative favorite who battled Romney deep into last year’s Republican primary calendar, is scheduled to make several appearances. Santorum could make another run for the White House in 2016.

Big CPAC surprise: Jeb Bush not on ballot

Later in the afternoon Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who is also considered a possible presidential hopeful, will address the crowd. So will House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, the congressman from Wisconsin who was Romney’s running mate. And Friday night former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who lately has openly discussed 2016, will keynote a CPAC dinner.

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin will appear on Saturday. Cruz was born in Canada to an American mother and Cuban father; his eligibility for president has been subject to debate.

Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos said there’s a reason White House hopefuls come to the conference.

“CPAC is where all 2016 candidates need to go to pass the conservative litmus test: Are they for freedom, or for something less,” said Castellanos, who is spearheading a new super-PAC called the NewRepublican.org to refocus the party’s messaging and policy goals.

Paul, Rubio provide competing glimpses of a revamped GOP

GOP strategist and CNN contributor Ana Navarro said CPAC is a must-do for anyone remotely thinking about the nomination.

“There’s not many other events where they all accept the invitation and are happy to parade one after the other, modeling in their swimsuits and evening gowns hoping to be amongst the finalists,” she said.

The conference, which draws tons of attention, has been increasingly critiqued as more political carnival than conference. Regardless, the confab will once again end with its GOP presidential nomination straw poll, which is considered by many as a key gauge of conservative sentiment and garners much media coverage. But there’s also been plenty of criticism in recent years that the CPAC straw poll is not the indicator it once was.

“It’s a more an anecdotal measurement than an empirical one. Its relevance as a prediction of grassroots strength within the party has waned over the last few years. It can, however, give someone who isn’t well known a shot of adrenaline so that they’re more prominently featured in any of the chatter about 2016,” said Kevin Madden, a GOP strategist who served as a senior adviser to Romney in both his 2012 and 2008 presidential campaigns. “Folks shouldn’t read too much into the results. Straw polls are kind of like political junk food. You know it’s all empty calories, but some folks eat it anyway.”

CPAC straw poll list shows wide array of 2016 potential

GOP analyst Rich Galen says the poll means nothing three years out from the election and it represents only part of the party.

“If we’ve learned anything from CPAC it’s that the conference does not represent mainstream GOP thinking. The poll is routinely hijacked by whomever wants to spend the money to get the eight hours of attention,” said Galen, who advised actor and former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson during his 2008 GOP presidential bid and is author of Mullings.com, an online column.

“Last year we not only did a straw poll but also had a national poll we announced simultaneously,” said Al Cardenas, chairman of the American Conservative Union, the organization that puts on the conference. “The outcomes were identical. The same order of top three finishers in the straw poll were the same order as the top three finishers in the national poll, and so to those skeptics who were concerned about the accuracy of the straw poll, the national poll provided empirical evidence that it was a pretty good representative sample of what’s going on.”

Romney finished first in both polls, ahead of Santorum and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.

This time around there are 23 names on the straw poll ballot, including some who were not invited to CPAC.

Among those on the ballot who won’t be speaking is Chris Christie, the tough-talking New Jersey governor who is considered a leading prospect for the 2016 nomination. While popular in his party, Christie angered some on the right after praising President Barack Obama for the federal response to Superstorm Sandy, which devastated parts of the Garden State just days before the November election. Christie also criticized House Republicans for temporarily holding up federal aid following the storm.

Major conservative conference comes at crucial time for GOP

Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell also may have designs on the White House, but he is not addressing CPAC. Earlier this year he pushed through a transportation plan that included tax increases, considered heresy among fiscal conservatives. Though he doesn’t have a keynote speaking role, he is part of a panel session at the conference.

Others on the ballot without speaking spots include New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez; former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, who now heads Purdue University; and Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, a major Romney surrogate last year.

Neurosurgeon Ben Carson interestingly appears on the poll – the only one on the list who’s never been elected to public office. He generated buzz in conservative circles after he advocated conservative policies on taxes and health care in front of President Obama while keynoting the national prayer breakfast last month.

There’s one glaring omission from the 23 names on the straw poll ballot: Jeb Bush, who asked not to be on the list.

Christie dismisses lack of CPAC invite

“It was our request to Mr. Cardenas when he extended the invite for Gov. Bush to speak. We asked not to be included, as Gov. Bush has said repeatedly, it is too early to think about 2016,” Bush spokesperson Jaryn Emhof told CNN chief Washington correspondent Jake Tapper.

For many conservative activists attending CPAC, the straw poll is fun, but they don’t take it too seriously.

“I don’t put much weight on it. It’s a fun way of getting to see opinions, but it doesn’t predict anything,” said Ryan Robertson of Reston, Virginia.

“I did it for fun. Why not? But there’s so much time between now and then,” said Shelby Vest, a recent University of Florida graduate and first time straw poll voter.

Teresa Ferguson of Albertville, Alabama, sees a value in the straw poll.

“We’ve got to start thinking about someone, don’t we?”

She said the results may reflect the hopes and dreams of some, but added that the straw poll is “a popularity contest.”

http://news.yahoo.com/official-congress-hits-time-low-polls-112211763.html,,[],It’s official: Congress hits all-time low in the polls,"Amid weeks of reports about slumping polling data, the last major polling group that didn’t say Congress was at an all-time low in popularity confirms what we all know: Congress is in a slump.

The Gallup organization is the granddaddy of political pollsters, and even during the government shutdown, its approval ratings for the House and Senate stayed at about their historic low of 10 percent. That number was hit twice during 2012.

But in data released on Tuesday, only 9 percent of Americans approved of Congress in a Gallup survey taken last week. It is the first time that the Gallup congressional approval rating has hit single digits in the 39 years that Gallup has been asking the question.

And in a rare act of consensus, folks of all political stripes seem to agree with their opinions of Capitol Hill.

“Public displeasure with Congress is equally rampant across political groups, with Republicans (9%), independents (8%), and Democrats (10%) giving the institution similarly low approval ratings,” said Gallup.

Gallup is one of the last polling groups to show an all-time low popularity rating for Congress since the shutdown and debt ceiling crisis hit the headlines.

In September, CNN said its congressional approval rating hit 10 percent in a poll that dates back decades. Another poll from Harris Interactive put the approval rating at 7 percent.

An October poll from the Associated Press and GFK put the congressional approval rating at a rock-bottom 5 percent.

The Washington Post/ABC News poll in October had the approval rating of 12 percent, the lowest in that poll during the past 25 years.

And a late October survey from CBS News and the New York Times put the congressional approval rating at 9 percent—the lowest number in that poll since the question was first asked in 1977.

Other polling firms have equally dismal numbers for Congress. Rasmussen Reports has the approval rating at 7 percent, as of early November, which is the lowest number in the seven years the group has asked that question.

Story continues

And in a late October NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 63 percent of voters said they want to replace their own member of Congress, the highest percentage on record since that question was first asked in 1992.

In a similar trend, in a Pew survey about 74 percent of Americans wanted to see most members of Congress defeated if they ran for re-election. That is a record in the survey for data gathered back to 1990 about midterm elections. (The previous record was 57 percent in 1996.)

Are you running for governor?

""I am thinking about it,"" said Rauner, 57, a Republican who has spent decades working for school reform, has been an adviser to Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel and is a target of the Chicago Teachers Union and labor bosses.

""I'm doing some serious evaluation, meeting with people, getting ideas on how to do this. But I make decisions. And I'm going to decide soon.""

My translation? He's running.

He talked to me about bringing business back to Illinois, and jobs, and attacking the education mess and the pension debacle. He supports immigration reform, and he thinks Republicans should focus not on social issues but on shrinking government and fixing schools.

That sounds like a man running for governor. And he wouldn't have sat down for an interview with me and had his photo taken if he weren't close to it.

For weeks Rauner, the retired chairman of the private equity firm GTCR, has been meeting privately with Republican governors from Wisconsin's Scott Walker to Louisiana's Bobby Jindal to New Jersey's Chris Christie, as well as former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. He's been traveling across Illinois, speaking at Lincoln Day dinners and so on, and is putting a team together.

His twin passions are riding his Harley and bird hunting. He has two labs and a German wirehaired pointer. He wears an $18 wristwatch and drives a 10-year-old van. Like many people of real wealth, he's not flashy about it.

I had to ask him the Jesse Jackson Jr. question: You ever think about getting a $43,000 Rolex?

""Never,"" he said. ""I don't have a Rolls. I don't have a jet. That's not me.""

But he has millions to spend on his campaign. And that frightens other Republicans, and Democrats, too. Politicians like colleagues who can be leveraged.

There's something attractive about a candidate who can't be bought, especially in Illinois, where so many are for sale. But we've seen other wealthy candidates fail, in part because they were too defensive about their money.

Rauner isn't defensive about a thing, although he hasn't yet been scrubbed by investigative reporters, or dissected by opposition research teams on all his business dealings.

So he's already ordered up opposition research on himself, figuring that others will do it, whether it's Gov. Pat Quinn or Attorney General Lisa Madigan or Bill Daley among the Democrats, or state Treasurer Dan Rutherford or state Sen. Kirk Dillard among possible Republican candidates.

""I know that's coming in politics,"" he said. ""We've built more than 200 businesses, and it will all be scrutinized. Who was fired? What about contracts? I understand that. That's politics.""

Rauner's relationship with the Rahmfather will also be an issue. Rauner's firm worked with Emanuel on several business deals after Emanuel left the Clinton White House and became an investment banker in the 1990s.

""He came to me once for a job. I didn't hire him. I thought his name was Ron. I said, 'How are you doing, Ron?' And he said, 'It's Rahm, it's Rahm.'""

Though he's advised Emanuel, he's criticized him as well, and loudly, for getting rolled by the CTU in last year's teachers strike.

What's fascinating about Rauner is his independence. And an unapologetic candidate with his kind of wealth — he wouldn't say if he's worth more than a billion — threatens the political order.

""I think I'm going to be very dangerous to the people in Springfield,"" he said. ""I think they're going to be scared. They should be. Because I can't be bribed, influenced, intimidated, threatened. I just want the state fixed and I just want to do the right thing for the taxpayers. You're right, I've done well in business. I'm very proud of it. I've got the resources to do whatever it takes to win, and to do what it takes to help fix the state. ... And the powers down there that like the status quo, they should be very scared.""

The criticism of Rauner is that he's used to getting things done his way. That bull-in-a-china-shop mindset could hurt him in a campaign.

""I think it's a blessing and a curse,"" he said. ""I have my strong views and opinions. I really want to transform Illinois government because this state is failing the taxpayers and the children. It's going to take steel backbone to get it done. Because I don't care about a political career. I certainly don't need a job. Getting re-elected is not on my top 10 list. I'll be willing to do things that politicians won't do. Because I don't care who I upset.""

Republican consultants circle him, and the common wisdom is that they view him like a side of beef, eager to carve him up for dinner.

""These political consultants love business guys who've never been in politics to try and take advantage of them. I get that. What I'm going to do is try and study from the smartest governors. I'm a pretty disciplined investor and pretty disciplined buyer. I do my due diligence. I do my homework. I don't waste money.""

He has a great upside. He's direct and uncompromising. Illinois voters might be seeking such a candidate to fix their broken state.

But business is business and politics is politics. And Bruce Rauner is about to learn the difference."
http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/03/21/1195898/-Elizabeth-Warren-Too-Big-to-Fail,2013-03-21 00:00:00,"['This Content Is Not Subject To Review Daily Kos Staff Prior To Publication.', 'Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags']",Elizabeth Warren: Too Big to Fail,"David Bernstein, longtime political reporter for the Boston Phoenix, scored a rare sit down interview with Senator Warren recently. He met with her on the day of her now infamous questioning on the minimum wage during a hearing of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, which was notably diaried here (video at the link).

There's been a lot of (imo, trollish) talk in the mainstream media about how Senator Warren should follow the Hillary Clinton path for new Senators -- keep your head down, don't make waves, ingratiate yourself to your colleagues, wait your turn, etc. There's been a lot of coverage -- national press and local press -- implying that Warren has taken this path. But it's a more mixed picture than that, and has been from the beginning. The reporting has seemed very lazy in my view (I know, shocking!!) and frankly like wishful thinking. A few reporters have noticed this and called out the trollish media coverage for what it is -- an attempt to neutralize Warren.

The profile in the Phoenix, in contrast to much of the recent MSM coverage of Warren, gets it just about right, I think, and also provides an interesting window on the balance Warren is attempting to strike as she learns to navigate the parochial terrain of the US Senate. Warren has been very strategic, but she has by no means kept a low profile or failed to speak out loudly and forcefully on her key issues (the plight of the middle and working class, and the criminality of the big banks).

Part of her strategy has been to prioritize local issues and local media; she has gotten near constant (and overall very positive) press in local media throughout Massachusetts over the past few months since being sworn in -- and most of that coverage has been a result of extensive local events and work on local issues (business development and job creation in regions throughout the state, the fisheries crisis in Massachusetts, how the sequester will adversely hit Massachusetts, etc.).

But the other part of her strategy, which Bernstein notes at length, is the polar opposite of the Hillary Clinton strategy. Warren has made waves -- deliberately. She has been outspoken. She has been warm and polite and solicitous of her colleagues (the piece is full of glowing reviews from her colleagues), but not at the expense of staying quiet. And she has not shied away from criticizing the Obama Administration, a move that a freshman Senator would normally avoid at all costs, ""the kind of behavior that would get a lot of new lawmakers smacked down hard, or marginalized into ineffectiveness.""

But, as Bernstein notes:



""Warren has an independence and authority that frees her to be outspoken without getting alienated.""

She is, in her own way, too big to fail. (...) And that might be what scares her Wall Street enemies the most. There is no amount of money, or scurrilous attacks, likely to cause her downfall at the polls. That will only make them more eager to find other ways to halt her efforts. They will counter-attack at every opportunity — as with the current attempt to derail Cordray's re-nomination — and undoubtedly plan longer-term strategies to limit her sway.

She can also react with righteous outrage when I asked about Obama's recent support of ""chained Consumer Price Index (CPI),"" which liberals view as a cut to Social Security benefits. When I suggest that most brand-new senators would not undercut their own party's president that way, she responds: ""Better I should say this now, than wait to have anybody surprised about it later on.""

""I don't want to wake up in six years and say: 'I scattered my fire across a wide range and changed nothing.' No. For me, that's a nightmare. It's something I've thought about every single day.""

I've excerpted a few of my favorite bits from the Phoenix article below but you really should just go read the whole thing Finally, so that this diary has a real driving purpose, please join me in signing up to donate or volunteer to elect Ed Markey to the US Senate so Elizabeth Warren has a strong partner going forward!"

Jim Oberweis' plan to seek the GOP nomination for the U.S. Senate could be seen as a welcome development for Republicans looking for a wealthy candidate who could help finance a challenge to veteran Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin.

But instead, the prospect is inspiring fear among leaders of the moribund Illinois GOP, which is trying to reach out to women and minorities and is hobbled by its social conservatism in a deepening blue state. They are concerned his candidacy could hurt the ticket as well as the party's efforts to rebrand itself.

Oberweis, from west suburban Sugar Grove, said he expects to formally announce his decision in the next few weeks, just a year after winning his first public office: a four-year term in the state Senate for District 25. Before that he lost two primary bids for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate, a GOP primary for governor, and a double loss in special and general election bids for Congress.

The win-loss record of the money manager and boutique dairy owner is not what troubles some GOP leaders. Instead, it's his history of outspokenness, gaffes and controversies. Many in the upper echelon of the Republican Party are content to have little-known, first-time candidate Doug Truax of Downers Grove take on Durbin and head the GOP ticket in fall 2014, leaving the real contest for Illinois governor.

""Jim, while he may no longer believe some of the things he said in the past, it will come back,"" said Illinois Senate Republican leader Christine Radogno of Lemont, who has discouraged an Oberweis bid. ""I don't think that will help the ticket. I encouraged him to think long and hard.""

Oberweis, who has acknowledged being ""too harsh"" in his previous campaigns, said he wants people to listen to him this time.

""I hope that as time has gone on I have matured a little bit and people will listen to what I have to say now and look at what I've done in Springfield,"" said Oberweis, whose legislative record includes sponsoring two bills. One, raising interstate speed limits, became law.

Oberweis is perhaps better known lately as the member of the policy-setting Illinois Republican State Central Committee who led the move to oust the state GOP chairman, Pat Brady, primarily over Brady's public support for same-sex marriage.

But his campaign history is marked by a string of controversial moments.

Even before announcing his 2002 bid for the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate, Oberweis angered anti-abortion activists and fellow Roman Catholics while discussing abortion. In a radio interview, he said, ""I think that right now we're getting a very, very strong symbol in the Taliban of what can happen if we try to impose our religious beliefs on others.""

In his second U.S. Senate bid, in 2004, he ran TV ads showing him flying over Soldier Field in a helicopter, contending enough ""illegal aliens"" cross the border and steal jobs to ""fill Soldier Field every single week."" That figure was strongly disputed.

Some worry that Oberweis could prove the kind of lightning rod Democrats used to their advantage in the 2012 election, seizing on controversial statements involving rape and pregnancy by Republican U.S. Senate candidates in Missouri and Indiana to tarnish GOP candidates around the country.

Rep. Jim Durkin of Western Springs, the new Illinois House Republican leader, said Oberweis should do some ""soul searching."" Durkin, who defeated Oberweis for the 2002 GOP U.S. Senate nomination, said Oberweis needs to be aware that a litany of controversial statements ""don't wash away after the election"" but ""will continue on as long as you're in the public eye.""

The disagreement over Oberweis represents yet the latest schism in a Republican Party that has been split between an establishment old guard that is more moderate and a conservative wing that has sought to take advantage of a lack of powerful political officeholders to gain control.

Oberweis has been among the conservative faction, making good on his threat to run for governor in 2006 if the GOP state central committee did not make him its state chairman in 2005. He received no nominations for the top Republican post then, but in March 2010 won election to the state central committee.

Another former rival who encouraged Oberweis to run next year now says he, too, is opposed to the idea.

Chicago businessman Ron Gidwitz, a social moderate who also unsuccessfully sought the 2006 GOP nomination for governor, acknowledged he ""sort of did suggest very strongly on a number of occasions"" that Oberweis consider a U.S. Senate bid in 2014.

Gidwitz had an automated poll conducted, with very few questions, that showed Oberweis running 11 percentage points behind Durbin in a potential head-to-head contest. Gidwitz said he forwarded the results to Oberweis but encouraged him to do a more traditional and exhaustive poll on his viability before embarking on a campaign.

""I'm not persuaded as much at all that he's got much of a chance,"" Gidwitz said. ""It's not inconceivable he gets the nomination, but I don't see how he can beat Durbin. ... He's too far to the right-hand side of the road on these social issues.""

The camps of the four major Republican candidates for governor declined to weigh in on having Oberweis at the top of the ticket.

Some Republicans suggest privately that Oberweis could help draw conservative voters to the polls in a primary — something that would help like-minded candidates for governor and in races lower on the ballot.

Greg Baise, a longtime Republican who heads the Illinois Manufacturers Association, said Oberweis has the ""propensity to say things controversial that make people in the party uncomfortable"" and that ""sometimes his filters aren't as strong in how he characterizes issues.""

Still, Baise said, Oberweis represents a ""viewpoint of a large number of people"" in the GOP and noted Durbin also has committed his share of gaffes."

113th Congress convened Thursday

Democrats retained control of the Senate, Republicans the House following the 2012 election

New Congress will face ongoing battles over the nation's debt

WASHINGTON--House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, was re-elected to a second two-year term to lead a polarized Congress, which convened for the 113th session on Thursday. Debates on deficit reduction, immigration, and gun laws are on the agenda.

For Boehner, leadership challenges also await. He begins the new Congress on a weakened note after failing to deliver a majority of Republicans in support of a bipartisan deal to avert the fiscal cliff of tax hikes and spending cuts, which passed on the strength of House Democrats' support.

He also came under fire this week from Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., for delaying action on federal aid for storm victims in the Northeast.

His re-election was never in doubt, but rank-and-file frustration spilled out on the House floor during the roll call vote to elect the speaker, which is the first order of business in a new Congress. Nine Republicans voted for someone other than Boehner, and one lawmaker, Rep. Steve Stockman, R-Texas, voted present. Of the nine who voted against Boehner, three voted for his top deputy, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va. Two freshman lawmakers who won in the 2010 Tea Party wave, Reps. Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina and Raul Labrador of Idaho, did not vote despite being present.

Boehner was re-elected with 220 votes, while Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., received 192. Pelosi did not receive the support of a half dozen Democrats.

In a speech before the House, Boehner sought an inspirational tone for the new session. ""For those who are returning, who have walked these aisles before, maybe it's time we feel awestruck again,"" he said, calling the the 113th Congress ""a time to rise"" and cautioned lawmakers against putting politics ahead of the country. ""So if you have come here to see your name in lights or to pass off political victory as accomplishment, you have come to the wrong place. The door is behind you,"" he said.

In her remarks, Pelosi called on Congress to address immigration reform and gun laws, invoking the shooting massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

The Senate was also sworn in Thursday, ushering in a historic level of women, 20, serving in the chamber and the first black senator from the South since Reconstruction, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C. He is the only African American in the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., will continue to lead the chamber.

Vice President Biden swore in the 12 new members elected in November. Opening day draws scores of former lawmakers back to Capitol Hill. Looking on from the Senate gallery was former senator and vice president Walter Mondale from Minnesota. Defeated GOP senator Richard Lugar and retired Democratic senator Evan Bayh appeared alongside newly elected home state Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, a Democrat. Former Ohio Democratic senator John Glenn appeared with newly reelected Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio.

Shortly before the session, Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., who had been absent for the past year while recovering from a stroke, slowly walked up the 45 steps to the Senate, with Biden nearby and the Senate leaders at the top of the stairs to greet him.

""A courageous man,"" Reid said. Members of the Illinois congressional delegation and senators stood on the steps.

As he entered the building, resting on a cane, Biden and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., helped Kirk take off his coat. The senator said he was glad to be back.

The traditions come against the backdrop of a divided Congress that is on a collision course with President Obama over upcoming budget fights to extend the $16.4 trillion debt ceiling and fund the federal government.

A deal to avert the ""fiscal cliff"" of big tax increases and spending cuts split the parties in New Year's Day votes, and the House's failure to vote on a Superstorm Sandy aid package before adjournment prompted GOP recriminations against the leadership.

""There's a lot of hangover obviously from the last few weeks of this session into the new one, which always makes a fresh start a lot harder,"" said Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas.

Followng the 2012 elections, Democrats tightened their grip on the Senate for a 55-45 edge in the new Congress, while Republicans maintained their majority in the House but will have a smaller advantage, 233-200. There are two vacancies.

The new Congress still faces the ideological disputes that plagued the dysfunctional 112th Congress, one of the least productive and most unpopular in more than 60 years. Tea Party members within the Republican ranks insist on fiscal discipline in the face of growing deficits and have pressed for deep cuts in spending as part of a reduced role for the federal government. Democrats envision a government with enough resources to help the less fortunate and press for the wealthiest to pay more in taxes.

""We can only hope for more help,"" said Manchin, who was re-elected in November. ""Any time you have new members arriving you have that expectation of bringing fresh ideas and kind of a vitality that is needed. We hope that they're coming eager to work hard and make some difficult decisions and put the country first and not be bogged down ideologically.""

At least one longtime Democrat, Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, will be departing in a few weeks, nominated by Obama to be secretary of State. That opens the door to former Republican senator Scott Brown, the only incumbent senator to lose in November's elections, to possibly make a bid to return to Washington.

Eighty-two freshmen join the House — 47 Democrats and 35 Republicans.

In the Senate, the Associated Press reported that Reid and Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky are negotiating possible changes in the rules as lawmakers face a bitter partisan fight over filibusters, according to a Senate Democratic leadership aide who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about private matters.

Reid has complained that Republicans filibuster too often and has threatened to impose strict limits with a simple majority vote. That step could set off retaliatory delays and other maneuvers by Republicans, who argue that they filibuster because Reid often blocks them from offering amendments.

The aide said Reid was preserving the option of making changes with a simple majority vote.

WASHINGTON — President Obama starts his second term with a clear upper hand over GOP leaders on issues from guns to immigration that are likely to dominate the year, a USA TODAY/Pew Research Center Poll finds. On the legislation rated most urgent — cutting the budget deficit — even a majority of Republican voters endorse Obama's approach of seeking tax hikes as well as spending cuts.

The survey underscores the quandary for the GOP as it debates the party's message in the wake of disappointing losses last November for the White House and in the Senate.

Now just 22% of Americans, nearly a record low, consider themselves Republicans.

And those automatic spending cuts, known as the sequester, that are poised to take effect next week?

If no deal is reached to avert them, half of Americans say congressional Republicans will be more to blame. Less than a third would blame Obama first.

""On many of the issues, President Obama has staked out positions that seem to be closer to the public's thinking than the positions Republicans have staked out,"" says Michael Dimock, director of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The poll is the first in a new partnership between Pew and USA TODAY. ""The challenge for him is in building the public's sense of immediacy on some of these issues, particularly on climate change and guns.""

Republicans have the opposite challenge. ""Their focus on the deficit is in tune with the public's priorities right now,"" he says. ""Yet their positions are not quite in step with the kind of compromises that the public tells us they want to see.""

To be sure, Obama faces his own challenges.

His approval ratings for handling seven specific issues are no better than lukewarm, ranging from a low of 34% on the deficit to a high of 46% on the situation in Afghanistan. On the central issue of managing the economy, 40% approve and 56% disapprove. Americans also continue to be deeply unhappy with the country's direction. By 2-to-1, 64%-31%, they are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the United States.

Even so, those surveyed say by narrow margins that Obama has a better approach than congressional Republicans for dealing with the deficit and guns. By double digits, they favor his plans on immigration and climate change, including limits on emissions from power plants.

The president's overall job approval rating is 51%, a bit higher than it typically has been for the past three years. The approval rating for Republican congressional leaders is a dismal 25%. Democratic congressional leaders stand in-between, at 37%.

The telephone poll of 1,504 adults was taken by land line and cellphone Feb. 13-18. It has a margin of error of +/–3 percentage points.

Since winning re-election, Obama has outlined bolder policies and taken a less compromising stance toward the GOP lawmakers he blames for frustrating much of his legislative agenda over the past two years. In his inaugural address and State of the Union speech, and at events across the country, he has focused more on generating public support for his proposals than on forging ties with Congress to negotiate them.

""I think there is a fresh start,"" says Sue Mohler, 60, of Nashua, N.H., who works in computer IT support. An Obama supporter, she was among those called in the poll. ""It's not as big a fresh start as we would like it to be, but I'm hopeful. I'm not as pessimistic as I was."" She says she's encouraged by signs that Republican leaders are ready to shift their stance on issues such as immigration.

For her part, Lynn Wright, 47, a homemaker from Richlands, N.C., doesn't appreciate Obama's more combative tone. ""I really feel like his feet are very, very, very buried in the sand,"" she said in a follow-up interview. ""I did not vote for him, but yes, he did win. But I just don't see how he can say, 'OK, this is my time now; you guys can't tell me no.' ""

Red flags on red ink

There is bipartisan agreement on this: Dealing with the budget deficit is urgent.

That's a change. When Obama took office in 2009, during a cascading financial crisis, Americans put deficit reduction in the middle of a list of policy goals in a Pew poll. Now it has risen near the top. Seven of 10 Americans (including not only 81% of Republicans but also 65% of Democrats) say it is essential for the president and Congress to enact major deficit legislation this year.

Just 4% say nothing needs to be done within the next few years.

In the wake of the Great Recession, the deficit as a percentage of the economy has spiked to its highest levels since the years following World War II. Now, after four years of topping $1 trillion, the shortfall this year is projected at $845 billion by the Congressional Budget Office.

When asked which of four issues was most pressing — the deficit, guns, immigration or climate change — 51% chose the deficit, three times that of any other issue. However, there were some significant differences by race and ethnicity. Hispanics were inclined to choose immigration as the most critical issue; African Americans chose guns.

""The biggest thing is the deficit,"" declares Rennie Woodhouse, 49, a foundry supervisor in Wellsboro, Pa. ""I just think we're getting further and further in the hole.""

To begin digging out, three of four Americans say a deficit plan should include both tax increases and spending cuts, akin to the ""balanced"" approach Obama backs. While there is stronger support to cut spending than raise taxes, only one in five say a deficit-reduction package should rely solely on spending cuts, the position embraced by House Speaker John Boehner.

By almost 3-to-1, 71%-26%, those surveyed favor Obama's proposal to raise the minimum wage to $9 an hour from the current $7.25. On this issue, as on some others, the GOP faces divisions in its ranks: Those who agree with the Tea Party movement oppose the idea by 2-to-1. Those who don't agree with the Tea Party support it by nearly as wide a gap.

For Ian Tate, 23, of Springfield, Ill., the threat of the deficit should take precedence over everything else even though he is himself unemployed and looking for work. ""It's kind of a stalemate, a Catch-22 kind of situation,"" he says, expressing concern that government job-creation programs would end up worsening the budget shortfall.

The potential impact on national security from Pentagon cuts included in the sequestration worries Travis Petry, 34, a courier who lives in Lafayette, La. ""North Korea, they're test-firing nukes, and the Middle East in general — it's always a problem down there,"" he says.

But he doesn't expect the president and Congress to succeed in reaching a deal to avoid the across-the-board cuts, scheduled to take effect March 1. ""Both sides are just hardheaded,"" he says. ""Neither is going to compromise. It's business as usual.""

Most Americans aren't paying much attention to the looming deadline despite dire warnings by Obama on Tuesday that jobs could be lost and communities hurt. Only about a quarter of those surveyed say they have heard a lot about it. That's half the number who had heard a lot about the debt-ceiling showdown at a similar point last summer.

If the president and Congress can't reach a budget deal by next week, half of Americans say they should delay the spending cuts. But a significant number, four in 10, say the cuts should be allowed to go into effect.

That attitude could reflect ""crisis fatigue,"" Dimock says. ""They've seen one crisis after another, and now they're told yet another one is coming. A pretty large share of them, even a third of Democrats, are saying, 'Just let it happen.' They're throwing up their hands.""

An immigration divide

A 51% majority of Americans say it's essential for the president and Congress to pass a sweeping immigration bill this year, and nearly everybody, nine in 10, say a major bill is needed within the next few years.

But to do what?

One in four want the bill to focus on better border security — that's down 10 percentage points from a year ago — and another one in four want the focus to be on creating a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants now in this country. Nearly half of those surveyed, 47%, say both should be equal priorities.

There is a predictable partisan divide on the issue: Democrats want a pathway to citizenship while Republicans back stronger security and enforcement of existing immigration laws. That could create problems for Republican leaders, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who are working on bipartisan bills that would include a path to legal status for illegal immigrants as well as border security measures.

By a wide margin, 50%-33%, Obama's approach to immigration is preferred over the GOP, and the president has seen his approval rating on handling immigration surge. During his first term, his disapproval rating on immigration was 20 points or more higher than his approval rating. Now, as many Americans approve of his work on immigration as disapprove, 44%-43%. Only his handling of Afghanistan ranks higher.

For Obama, having higher ratings than congressional Republicans doesn't guarantee passage of any legislation, given the polarization in a divided Congress. But it does put him in a stronger position to bring public pressure on lawmakers. And it complicates Republican efforts to unite a fractured party behind a message that will appeal to voters.

""Lots of things need to be passed in Congress, and it seems everything is a filibuster,"" says Jaime Cortez, 23, of Edinburg, Texas. ""I know a lot of strong, far-right Republicans, but I just think they need to ease up and listen to the public's opinion.""

While most Americans want action on the deficit and immigration this year, Obama faces a more difficult task in pressing two other priorities he's outlined, on gun control and climate change. His approach to the issues is preferred, but the public's sense of urgency is lower.

On climate change, only a third of those surveyed say action is urgent this year. Still, Americans do back stricter emission limits on power plants, a step Obama has discussed, by more than 2-to-1. By 54%-34%, they support developing alternative sources of energy over expanding production of oil and coal.

On gun control, 71% of Democrats say it's essential to pass legislation this year but only 19% of Republicans agree. Among independents, 42% want action this year.

A majority of Republicans say nothing should be done on guns now or later. That puts them at odds with Americans overall: 83% back mandating background checks for all gun buyers; 56% a ban on assault-style weapons; 53% a ban on high-capacity ammunition clips.

Monte Latham, 41, of Jacksonville, says the economy should be the top issue, but he ranks gun legislation close behind. A Navy veteran who is now studying nursing, he hopes supporters push for action while memories of the December shooting rampage in Newtown, Conn., are fresh.

""If gun control takes a back seat,"" he worries, ""it's just going to lose that momentum."""

Washington (CNN) – A few months after turning 50 years old, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie secretly underwent lap-band surgery in February for the sake of his wife and kids, a source close to the governor confirmed to CNN.

Christie told the New York Post, which first reported the story early Tuesday morning, that the invasive procedure came after his family and friends urged him to start improving his health.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

""I've struggled with this issue for 20 years,"" he said. ""For me, this is about turning 50 and looking at my children and wanting to be there for them.""

Christie had the 40 minute long surgery on Saturday, February 16, a source close to Christie tells CNN Chief Washington Correspondent Jake Tapper, and was back to work by the following Tuesday.

His concerns over the ""minimally invasive procedure,"" according to the source, were allayed by the fact that Dr. George Fielding would be operating on him. Fielding has done the procedure many times and even had the surgery himself, the source told Tapper, anchor of CNN's ""The Lead.""

Although Christie has lost some weight, the source told Tapper, the governor is ""not doing any victory laps"" and knows this is just the beginning of the weight loss process.

In an interview with the Post, Christie says his surgery was solely for his children and wife, but almost anything the Republican governor does is seen through the lens of a possible presidential run in 2016. Christie, in an interview with the Post, attempted to squash any speculation.

""It's so much more important than that,"" Christie said. ""I know it sounds crazy to say that running for president is minor, but in the grand scheme of things, it was looking at Mary Pat and the kids and going, 'I have to do this for them, even if I don't give a crap about myself.'""

A ""tight circle"" of top staff knew about the procedure, a source close to the governor told CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger.

""They were the right people; he had to make sure a small circle knew. But it was mostly family who knew,"" the source said, adding the the catalyst was Christie's 50th birthday.

""He had been thinking about it for a while, and working on it (weight loss)"" through diet and exercise, the source said. And while the source can't discount the presidential considerations entirely, the source added ""this was more about his kids and his family.""

Are there any potential downsides?

""Everyone will be watching"" as every pound does (or does not) come off, the source said. The upside is that it ""humanizes him.""

""(The) struggle is something he can talk about,"" the source added, also noting that when Christie attended the George W. Bush Presidential Center dedication ceremony last month, some noticed he had shed some pounds.

OPINION: Congrats Gov. Christie: You saved your life

Christie's weight has been an issue of fodder for comedians and journalists alike, but primarily because the governor is regularly self-deprecating about the issue.

Earlier this year, while comedian David Letterman was offering a lengthy apology to the governor for all of the weight jokes he had made on his late night comedy show, Christie played along by reaching into his pocket and grabbing a donut.

""I didn't know this was going to take so long,"" Christie said to the laughing audience. He continued to joke about his weight during the interview, telling Letterman that he is ""basically the healthiest fat guy you've ever seen in your life.""

In response to the bit, a former White House doctor told CNN National Political Correspondent Jim Acosta that she ""winced"" at the routine and questioned whether Christie's weight would hold him back on a presidential run.

""I'm worried he may have a heart attack. I'm worried he may have a stroke,"" former White House physician Connie Mariano, M.D. said in the interview. ""It's almost a like a time bomb waiting to happen unless he addresses those issues before running for office.""

Mariano, who served nine years as a doctor in the White House medical unit said Christie's obesity would certainly become an issue should he run for the presidency in 2016. She warned a future President Christie could suffer from potentially deadly complications from diabetes, sleep apnea, and heart disease.

In response, Christie said unless Mariano has given him a physical exam, ""she should shut up.""

""The idea that somehow, you know, I don't care about this – of course I care about it. And I am making the best effort I can,"" Christie said at a press conference before he had the surgery in February.

""In terms of people in the state being concerned about whether or not it prevents me from being able to do my job effectively, I think they've seen the results of that,"" Christie said.

Christie's weight was in issue in his 2009 run for governor, when he defeated Democratic incumbent Jon Corzine. Christie's girth was portrayed unflatteringly in campaign ads by Corzine's campaign. But Christie's weight has not been an issue as he runs this year for re-election to a second term. A Quinnipiac University poll of New Jersey voters conducted in March indicated that 68% of Garden State voters were comfortable with an overweight candidate, with just 17% holding reservations.

Lap-band surgery entails a doctor fitting a band around the stomach in order to make the organ smaller. It helps people lose weight because as someone eats, the smaller stomach feels fuller faster, thereby cutting down on the amount of food someone consumes. As the lap-band recipient loses weight, doctors can add saline to the band to shrink the stomach even more.

The surgery is considered a less dangerous alternative to gastric bypass, where a doctor shrinks the size of a stomach by dividing the stomach into two using staples.

In July 2012, Christie told ABC that gastric bypass was ""too risky"" of a surgery for him.

http://news.yahoo.com/unyielding-gop-politicians-doing-voters-ask-084659707--politics.html,,[],Unyielding GOP politicians doing what voters ask,"HEBER CITY, Utah (AP) — U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz flew home from Washington last week, leaving behind a capital baffled by Republicans like him in Congress: those who stubbornly refuse to compromise with President Barack Obama, a tactic that some see as damaging the GOP brand and pushing the nation repeatedly to the brink of fiscal chaos.

Back in his Utah district, Chaffetz drove to the Dairy Keen and barely had bitten into a bacon cheeseburger before a diner begged him to stop Obama's health care overhaul.

""It's the stupidest plan in the world,"" said Phoebe Eason, 69, leaning over her booth to complain about a clause that forces her husband, a podiatrist, to pay more for medical devices.

""I'm doing everything I can to repeal it or take out these sections,"" Chaffetz reassured her. Minutes later, he headed to a town hall where some constituents asked why the president hadn't yet been impeached.

To understand why the nation may remain politically gridlocked for the next two years, talk to people in a place like Heber City, a conservative farming and ranching hub nestled beneath the imposing peaks of the Wasatch mountains. Many voters here, and in conservative communities across the country, still want to do whatever it takes to stop Obama, despite his solid re-election in November, and the politicians they elect are listening.

In his State of the Union address this week, Obama laid out an ambitious agenda that includes gun control, raising the minimum wage, allowing most of the 11 million illegal immigrants in the country to become citizens and raising tax revenue to help cut the deficit.

But the president has acknowledged it will be difficult to get those proposals through a Republican-controlled House of Representatives.

""The House Republican majority is made up mostly of members who are in sharply gerrymandered districts that are very safely Republican and may not feel compelled to pay attention to broad-based public opinion, because what they're really concerned about is the opinions of their specific Republican constituencies,"" Obama said in an interview with The New Republic magazine last month.

Story continues

Analysts differ on whether gerrymandering — the practice of drawing district lines so your party can pick up more seats — fully explains why Obama handily won re-election in November, even as Republicans lost only a handful of seats in the House. One thing is clear: Compromise is a dirty word for many of the Republicans remaining in the House.

A Pew poll last month found that 36 percent of GOP voters would look favorably on a politician who compromises, compared with 59 percent of Democrats and 53 percent of independent voters.

Virtually all House Republicans come from districts that voted against Obama in November. And in many states, primary voters have punished Republicans they see as too eager to cut deals with Democrats.

That's how Chaffetz, 45, won his seat in 2008. He challenged a 12-term Republican congressman who angered the party's base by backing an immigration overhaul that included granting citizenship to many illegal immigrants. Two years later, Utah Republican primary voters also pushed out Sen. Robert Bennett, replacing him with a tea party-supported candidate who is now the state's junior senator.

Though he has worked with Democrats on some bills, Chaffetz has refused to budge on some of the biggest issues in Washington. In 2011, he voted against raising the debt ceiling, arguing Congress and Obama weren't reining in entitlement spending. Most economists said that if the limit hadn't been raised it would have triggered a global depression. Last month, Chaffetz voted against the so-called fiscal cliff deal because it involved raising levies on those making more than $450,000 annually. Taxes would have risen on all income levels had the deal not passed.

Chaffetz also voted against aid for victims of Superstorm Sandy, saying the bill was larded with pork. He did vote to delay another debt ceiling confrontation until May, but said he won't budge on automatic spending cuts scheduled to kick in next month or on his opposition to citizenship for illegal immigrants.

""The perception inside the Beltway is dramatically different than in hometown America,"" Chaffetz said. ""Most people in my district believe we've compromised too much.""

Chaffetz's district stretches from the southern Salt Lake City suburbs and Provo, home to Brigham Young University, to the high valleys of Wasatch County. Nearly half of the county's 23,000 residents live in this town. Once an overlooked rural community far from the Salt Lake City metropolitan area, it has recently seen an influx of more liberal-minded residents drawn by its proximity to storied ski resorts like nearby Park City. In Utah, this place is almost a swing county. Nonetheless, it voted 3-1 for Romney in November.

Here's how things look from Heber City: Obama hiked taxes while pushing through his health care reform. Then he got another round during the fiscal cliff negotiations. Now he's making a third attempt during the latest debt ceiling standoff. Meanwhile, the federal budget has been trimmed, but only slightly. The debt is still huge. Republicans are folding at every turn.

""I'm sick of Republicans not sticking to their principles,"" said Tina Peterson, 45, who works at a resort in nearby Park City. She recently moved her family here from Arizona after the recession destroyed their construction business. A new arrival in Utah — ""I'm a Christian but not LDS"" — she sees Obama as the unbending force in Washington, not her own party.

""His ideology is what it is and he can stick to it,"" Peterson said. ""We do the same and we get demonized.""

Not everyone here wants to just say no.

""There's no sense in falling on our sword and throwing a wrench just to destroy things,"" said Aaron Gabrielson, chairman of the Wasatch County Republican Party. Still, he added: ""It doesn't seem like compromise has gotten us very far.""

Jaren Davis, 53, a Republican Salt Lake City real estate developer who owns a second home here, sat in Chick's Cafe on Main Street and bemoaned polarization in politics.

""Both sides, right and left, with 24-hour news, they just need to get more fanatical to get on TV,"" said Davis, who unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the state Legislature. He noted that partisans have to cater to their extreme wing to win a primary — the same as winning the general election in this deeply red state.

Chaffetz held his town hall in a county education building. He began by giving a presentation on the weight of the federal debt. Voters asked about the value of the dollar, how to keep the federal government from converting more of the state's land to protected wilderness and the use of drones in the U.S. They also voiced their frustration about the president.

""Have you not found anything to impeach the president of the United States?"" asked Jeff Riddle, 34, an attorney. ""Losing a drone to Iran? Killing Americans with drones? Infringing on Second Amendment rights?""

Chaffetz asked for patience. He said the best course was to allow congressional investigations into possible administration wrongdoing, like the Fast and the Furious gun-running program, to continue.

""What is it going to take to make the change in Washington?"" asked retired commercial airline pilot Robert Wren, 74. ""Are we going to have to have a minor revolution of the people? Are we going to have to wait until the next election?""

Chaffetz said the problem is that Republicans haven't communicated well with voters. Later, asked if he ever felt pressure to back down, he acknowledged occasional disagreements with GOP leadership on whether to subpoena the White House.

""I don't know if we have stood up for ourselves as much as we should,"" he said.

Wren said he was pleased with his congressman's unflinching stance. ""He's representing his constituents.""

According to the latest wave of Fox News exit polls, the surprising closeness of the race can be attributed - in part - to the disastrous rollout of ObamaCare.

Virginia voters in general oppose ObamaCare by a margin of 53 to 45 percent, according to exit polls. Of those who oppose the law, 80 percent voted for Cuccinelli and 11 percent voted for McAuliffe.



McAuliffe is faring well among women voters and is also performing strongly in the Washington D.C. suburbs in Northern Virginia. Libertarian candidate Robert Sarvis remains a distant third, although he is garnering a fair amount of votes from young people.

As polls closed, so did the hard-fought Virginia gubernatorial race between an establishment Democrat and a Republican who warned that a vote for his rival was a vote for ObamaCare.

“ObamaCare has been a big part of why this race is a horse race at this point,” Republican nominee Ken Cuccinelli said after casting his vote Tuesday morning.

The race between the Tea Party-backed Cuccinelli and Democrat Terry McAuliffe was billed as the marquee 2013 gubernatorial contest and has lived up to expectations through the finals days -- with the better-funded McAuliffe clinging to a single-digit lead.

The race, in which the candidates raised a combined record $54 million, has also been marked by negative ads and accusations of questionable ethics -- and its results could be a bellwether for the 2014 and 2016 races.

The results are expected to show whether a swing state such as Virginia could elect a Tea Party-backed governor. They are also expected to gauge whether Republicans can continue to ride Americans’ dissatisfaction with ObamaCare and if Democrats can reestablish a political foothold in the South.

McAuliffe voted before dawn and visited campaign offices to help sustain his six-point lead in the polls.

Cuccinelli, the state’s attorney general, made several final-hour campaign stops in hopes his conservative supporters give him a come-from-behind win.

He told reporters after voting in northern Virginia that a strong GOP turnout was “absolutely critical.”

“I hear people's aspirations and their complaints,” Cuccinelli said. “One of their complaints is they don't like how things run. My answer is: 'Well make sure you show up.' …The world is run by the people who show up.”

A third candidate, libertarian Robert Sarvis, also was on the ballot.

Turnout was expected to be low -- 40 percent was the figure both sides were using. And both candidates were mustering their campaign organizations to find every last supporter. The negative tilt of the campaigns turned many voters off, and strategists in both parties predicted the outcome could be decided by just a few thousand votes.

Richard Powell, a 60-year-old retired IT manager who lives in Norfolk, described himself as an independent who frequently votes for members of both parties. He said he cast his ballot for McAuliffe because he was more determined not to vote for Cuccinelli, whom he said overreaches on a variety of medical issues.

Voters were barraged with a series of commercials that attempted to tie Cuccinelli to restricting abortions.

""I'm not in favor of abortion -- let's put it that way -- but I find that restricting abortion causes far more social harm than allowing abortion, so that was an issue for me,"" Powell said.

Both candidates got help from some big names. Former President Bill Clinton and wife Hillary made appearances in the final weeks for McAuliffe, a major fundraiser for the political couple and a former Democratic National Committee chairman.

President Obama campaigned for him last weekend. First lady Michelle Obama lent her voice to a radio advertisement, and Vice President Joe Biden spoke to supporters on the eve of the election.

Cuccinelli got visits from Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Sens. Marco Rubio, Florida, and Rand Paul, Kentucky -- all potential presidential contenders in 2016.

The winner will succeed term-limited Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican, for a four-year term starting in January. Obama won the state in 2008 and 2012, but far fewer voters participate in off-year elections and that gives the GOP better odds.

Republicans bet a deeply conservative candidate would be their best shot, passing over a lieutenant governor for Cuccinelli, an early crusader against ObamaCare.

""I'm scared to death about what ObamaCare is doing to Virginians, and Terry McAuliffe is scared to death what ObamaCare is doing to Terry McAuliffe,” said Cuccinelli, who has tried to make the election into a referendum on the law, which McAuliffe supports.

Democrats chose a loyal partisan in McAuliffe and recruited the Clintons to raise millions for him and rally the party faithful.

The 45-year-old Cuccinelli went into Election Day trying to overcome a lingering wariness among fellow Republicans about his conservative views, including those on climate change.

The 56-year-old McAuliffe is trying to avoid an eleventh-hour error. On Tuesday morning, McAuliffe stopped by a campaign office to rally volunteers near Richmond. He urged them to knock on one more doors and phone one more friend as the campaign neared its end. McAuliffe said that effort was needed to combat low turnout.

""This is the greatest democracy in the world. We want everyone to vote,"" McAuliffe told reporters.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/01/27/big-week-in-washington-stoked-talk-clinton-biden-running-in-2016/,2013-01-27 00:00:00,[],"Big week in Washington stoked talk of Clinton, Biden running in 2016","Two of Washington’s biggest events last week -- the presidential inauguration and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s testimony on Benghazi -- also turned out to be early-but-critical moments for two top potential 2016 Democratic presidential candidates.

Vice President Biden moved across Washington -- even breaking into a jog along the Pennsylvania Avenue parade route -- like a man clearly excited about 2016 possibilities.

His private swearing-in ceremony was attended by New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan, who would be a key ally in the state's first-in-the-nation primary. And he attended the State Society Inaugural Ball for Iowa, whose caucus results can kick-start a presidential run.

Meanwhile, Clinton’s long-awaited Capitol Hill testimony on the Sept. 11, 2012, deaths of four Americans at a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya, essentially put the issue to rest for supporters but agitated critics who would be certain to revive the debate should Clinton run in four years.

“We don't know why the president and the secretary of state ignored the warnings,” Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain told ABC’s “This Week.” “There are so many questions that are unanswered.”

Biden’s demeanor last week and over the past few months prompted a Democrat close to the White House to tell Politico that the vice president is “ intoxicated by the idea.”

Political observers have said the Democratic field would be instantly cleared should Clinton, who has insisted she is exhausted and finished with public office, decide to run. The former first lady and New York senator would return as a more experienced politician than the one who lost to Obama in 2008. And her approval rating late last year was as high as 75 percent, according to one poll.

However, the recent emergence of Biden, whose middle-class appeal helped Obama get re-elected, has sparked debate about who the president would support and who might or might not step aside.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney tried Wednesday to tamp down speculation, two days after the public inauguration, by saying: “For the sake and sanity of all involved, it's worth taking a bit of a break from presidential election year politics.""

Biden will be nearly 74 on Election Day 2016. But he is well aware of how campaigns work and the energy that is needed, after unsuccessful bids in 1988 and 2008.

In addition, the former Delaware senator has compiled a list domestic and foreign policy achievements in Washington, even as his occasional off-script moments have become fodder for Republican critics. In fact, Biden helped reach a deal several weeks ago with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to avert the fiscal crisis.

""There's a whole lot of reasons why I wouldn't run,"" Biden told CNN before the inauguration. ""I don't have to make that decision for a while. In the meantime, there's one thing I know I have to do, no matter what I do. I have to help this president move this country to the next stage.""

Biden also has good, fresh contacts with members of the Democratic ground game in such key states as Florida, Iowa, Ohio and New Hampshire. And he has a decent approval rating -- 49 percent according to the most recent New York Times/CBS poll.

""It seems obvious that he's going to keep that option open for himself and do the right things,"" said Mike Gronstal, the Democratic leader of the Iowa state Senate.

Prior to the recent Biden talk, young Democratic Govs. Andrew Cuomo, New York, and Martin O’Malley, Maryland, each appeared to have a clear path toward a potential nomination.

Though they now might have to wait, both are pushing ahead with a legislative agenda like the one voters supported in re-electing Obama.

What issues might emerge during the next presidential election cycle remains unclear.

But Cuomo has already gotten the state legislature to pass his proposal for tougher gun laws, in the wake of the shootings last month inside a Connecticut elementary school in which 20 first-graders and six adults were killed.

He has also proposed a “Reproductive Health Act"" as part of a 10-point plan to advance ""women's equality"" that is expected to include language that would allow abortion after 24 weeks of pregnancy if it is ""necessary to protect a woman's health.""

O’Malley, who was a frequent advocate for Obama through the 2012 election cycle, must leave the Maryland state house because of term limits. But last year he started a federal Political Action Committee that allows him to raise money for future office.

He also already this year has renewed efforts to bring offshore wind energy to Maryland, called for more early voting on Election Day and wants to restricts mental-health patients' access to firearms as part of his gun-control plan.

Judges on the Court of Appeals, however, would be transferred after age 70, to a State Supreme Court.

But because the Bonacic bill would have to be passed by both chambers — twice, in separately elected sessions — and then approved by voters, the earliest that it could take effect would be 2016. And that would be too late for two judges on the Court of Appeals: Chief Judge Lippman, who turns 70 in 2015, and Judge Robert S. Smith, who turns 70 in 2014.

The fate of the two bills has caused some whispers in the Capitol because Mr. Lippman is friendly with Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the Democrat-dominated Assembly. The two men grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where Mr. Silver still lives, and Mr. Silver was an ardent supporter of the judge’s nomination as chief judge by Gov. David A. Paterson in 2009.

Chief Judge Lippman, who has established himself as a solid liberal voice, declined to comment.

But Mike Whyland, a spokesman for Mr. Silver, said the friendship between the speaker and the judge had nothing to do with the proposed extension of the retirement age. “This is a broad based, politics-neutral bill that covers many judges and will be voted on by the public,” Mr. Whyland said, referring to the Weinstein measure.

Mr. Bonacic initially said he had offered his bill — which had passed the Senate once before, in 2011, but died in the Assembly — because he had heard “too many concerns from other judges that they are not included” in the Assembly version. But late last month, Mr. Bonacic suggested that he was leaning toward a compromise: allowing both bills to the Senate floor.

Still, he said, there was no consensus within the Republican conference in the Senate on the issue. “I am not so sure the people want judges serving until they are 80,” he said.

Langdon Chapman, an aide to Senator Bonacic, added that his bill, and its longer legislative timetable, was not related to Mr. Lippman’s looming retirement."

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) introduced a bill Tuesday that would prevent employers from discriminating against job applicants who have poor credit.

The legislation, co-authored with six Democratic senators, prohibits credit checks in the hiring process.

In an MSNBC interview on Tuesday, Warren explained that outlawing credit score disclosure would allow potential employees to compete on their ability to do a job, not on their economic standing.

""People ought to be able to get out there and compete for a job based on whether or not they can do the job, not based on whether or not they can pay their bills or whether or not they've had a problem in the past: a divorce, a job loss, a death in the family, the kinds of things that cause people to have financial problems,"" Warren said.

Warren, a defender of the middle class, argued that mandatory credit score disclosure is one way ""the game is rigged"" in favor of the financially stable.

""This is a problem that hits hardworking families who are struggling to get back on their feet,"" Warren said. ""It's not one that hits the rich and I think that's just wrong. It's how we fight for people who have been hit by one economic blow or another and are out there trying to compete in the job market and just want a level playing field.""

Fletcher', 'May', 'Michael A. Fletcher Is A Senior Writer For Espn.']","In North Carolina, unimpeded GOP drives state hard to the right","Backed by throngs of chanting supporters, dozens of liberal demonstrators are subjecting themselves to arrest each Monday at the state legislature here to protest a flurry of bills that could transform North Carolina into a model of conservative governance.

The state’s hard turn to the right comes less than five years after people took to the streets here to celebrate the 2008 victory of Barack Obama, the first Democratic presidential candidate to capture the state since Jimmy Carter in 1976. The win prompted Obama’s supporters to crow about the growing influence of progressive and minority voters not only in North Carolina but across the South.

But that euphoria is now a distant memory. Since the recession hit, North Carolina has been saddled with one of the nation’s highest unemployment rates. The bad times helped prepare the way for a carefully executed strategy, with big financial support from a major conservative activist, that helped the GOP win control of both chambers of the state General Assembly in 2010.

Those victories were capped last year when Republican Pat McCrory was elected governor, giving the party control of all levers of state government for the first time since 1870.

The victories were aided by the strong financial support of Art Pope, a multimillionaire who spent heavily in support of the state’s GOP candidates. The Institute for Southern Studies, a North Carolina-based research organization, said Pope’s advocacy network spent $2.2 million on 22 legislative races, winning 18. Overall, conservative organizations largely supported by Pope accounted for three-fourths of the outside money spent in North Carolina legislative races in 2010, according to the institute.

One of McCrory’s first acts after being elected governor was to install Pope, a former legislator, as the state budget chief. (The governor’s office declined to make Pope available for an interview.) And now, GOP lawmakers are moving swiftly to enact a long list of legislation they say is largely aimed at limiting government debt and snapping the state’s economy out of a years-long malaise.

Legislators have slashed jobless benefits. They have also repealed a tax credit that supplemented the wages of low-income people, while moving to eliminate the estate tax. They have voted against expanding Medicaid to comply with the 2010 federal health-care law. The expansion would have added 500,000 poor North Carolinians to the Medicaid rolls.

“Before considering Medicaid expansion, we must reform the current system to make sure people currently enrolled receive the services they need and more taxpayer dollars are not put at risk,” McCrory said in a written statement after signing a bill blocking the expansion.

Lawmakers are also considering proposals to reduce and flatten income tax rates while expanding the sales tax, perhaps to even include groceries and prescription drugs — which some advocates see as a first step toward eliminating the state income tax.

“North Carolina is a high-income-tax state, and we’re suffering the consequences,” said Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger (R). “Our unemployment rate is the fifth worst in the country, and our high tax rates are hindering economic growth and pushing jobs to our neighbors.”

There are also measures pending to require drug testing for low-income people applying for job training and welfare benefits.

Other GOP-controlled legislatures have passed or considered similar measures in the wake of the recession. Florida, Missouri and Michigan are among the states that have slashed jobless benefits. Texas, Louisiana and Wisconsin are among at least 15 states not participating in the Medicaid expansion called for in the Affordable Care Act. And West Virginia, Kansas and Texas are among the states where legislators have proposed bills requiring drug testing for welfare recipients.

The North Carolina House has passed a law requiring voters to have a government-issued identification card, and legislators are considering bills to roll back the state’s law allowing same-day voter registration and to sharply limit early voting — measures that supporters of the current law say were integral to the high turnout of minority voters in the past several elections.

“I don’t know that there is a state that has as many regressive policies on tap,” said Penda Hair, co-director of Advancement Project, a Washington-based civil rights group that is considering a lawsuit challenging changes to the state’s voting laws.

Liberals may be up in arms, but North Carolina conservatives are applauding the new direction of the General Assembly. After the state Senate unveiled its tax reform plan this month, the state chapter of Americans for Prosperity released a poll that it said showed widespread support across the state. Nearly two-thirds of respondents said the state tax code is in need of reform, and nearly half backed moving to totally eliminate the personal income tax within four years.

“The poll results show a clear desire for bold tax relief and reform that gets North Carolina back in the game for jobs and business,” said Dallas Woodhouse, state director of Americans for Prosperity in North Carolina.

The legislative effort has mobilized liberals who see North Carolina as a laboratory for conservative ideas propelled nationwide by the money of a handful of key patrons. They note that many of the initiatives being pursued by legislators here have long been championed by a network of conservative organizations supported by Pope and billionaire activists Charles and David Koch, including Americans for Prosperity and the American Legislative Exchange Council.

“Most of the laws that take us backwards do not come out of Congress but out of state legislatures,” said the Rev. William J. Barber II, head of the North Carolina chapter of the NAACP. “Conservative forces here have gone all out to implement these policies and to lock in their power by changing the voting laws.”

In an effort that resurrects some of the tactics of the civil rights movement, Barber has led a growing, multiracial campaign of civil disobedience intended to draw attention to the changes being pursued by legislators.

This past week, more than 600 demonstrators, some waving placards and singing freedom songs, gathered outside the North Carolina Legislative Building for the fourth “Moral Mondays” protest.

With the crowd behind them, 57 protesters walked inside the building and stood in front of the large brass doors leading to the Senate chamber. The demonstrators — pastors, students, college professors and senior citizens among them — were arrested and led away in plastic handcuffs. They joined a group of more than 100 North Carolina residents who had been arrested and jailed in three previous protests.

“This leadership wants to make our state a place of deeper stratification and inequality,” Barber said.

In the coming weeks, Barber plans to move the protests from the doorstep of the legislature to the home districts of the lawmakers through a series of 25 town meetings.

But, as it stands, there is very little opponents can do to alter the will of the governing majority — something many of the protesters acknowledge.

“My hope is two-pronged,” said Derick Smith, an instructor at North Carolina A&T University who was arrested several weeks ago during a protest. “You want to bring attention to what’s happening. And you’ve got to hope that the governor will listen and back away from some of the more divisive provisions.”"

(You can analyze them all in PPP's PDF.) But there's absolutely no good news in here for Chafee, which in a way is too bad, since Raimondo, the state treasurer and Democratic front-runner, seems to occupy ideological space to Chafee's right. She's made her mark cutting union pensions and is at the forefront of the austerity movement, even encouraging the creation of a shadowy ""pension overhaul"" group called EngageRI that won't release the names of its donors.

Providence Mayor Angel Taveras seems like the more progressive choice, and in a primary matchup without Chafee, he trails Raimondo 44-35, with former state Auditor Ernie Almonte at 9. So while Raimondo is tight with big-money interests, these numbers suggest Taveras could pose a real threat to her if he makes the race.

P.S. There's been strong movement in favor of gay marriage in Rhode Island, with voters now supporting it 57-36. To show you how fast the issue has moved, when PPP asked two years ago, the margin was 50-41 in favor. Hopefully these numbers will buttress marriage equality supporters as legislation to legalize same-sex marriage makes its way through the legislature (it's passed the House but conservative Democrats in charge of the Senate are making things very uncertain).

Senate:

• KS-Sen, -Gov: Republican Secretary of State Kris Kobach says he'll seek re-election to his current job in 2014, which is noteworthy only because it means he won't be issuing a primary challenge to either Gov. Sam Brownback or Sen. Pat Roberts, both of whom go before voters again next year.

• MA-Sen: Well, blargh. After hemming and hawing and even contradicting published reports saying he'd run for Senate, conservative Democratic Rep. Stephen Lynch finally launched his campaign in the special election to succeed John Kerry. And Lynch's preferred campaign message is exactly as chip-on-the-shoulder as you'd expect. Indeed, seeing as he begins the race way behind in the polls against fellow Rep. Ed Markey, Lynch's only hope is to go negative. He's off to a fast start:



""It will be an uphill fight for me, but the fight is worth fighting. Shame on us to allow someone to clear the field, box out all the other candidates, and buy the election,"" said Lynch, in an apparent reference to Markey....

In addition to attacking Markey, Lynch undoubtedly will try to run to his right. Here's the first taste:Never mind that Elizabeth Warren handily beat Scott Brown without trying to clone his most cloying attributes, as Lynch prefers to do. In any event, the person Lynch is appealing to most right now is Brown himself, since the Republican former senator has to be licking his chops at the prospect of a nasty primary between the two Democrats. Brown still hasn't announced a decision, but surely this development can only make his entry more likely.

So what should Markey do now? Fortunately, he has two advantages: He's got a lot more money than Lynch, and he's got a terrific progressive profile. I don't think he necessarily has to respond in kind to Lynch. Rather, he can and should tout his credentials loudly in order to lock down the liberal vote, which still constitutes the majority of the primary electorate, despite what Lynch may believe. Lynch of course will have his union allies, but in a statewide primary like this, there are lots of votes out there for Markey to unearth.

Oh, and put up your freakin' website already. That would help.

P.S. Lynch also picked up the endorsement of the Iron Workers union—but seeing as he once was an iron worker himself, this is like Rudy Giuliani endorsing the Yankees. Still, it'll be worth watching to see whether any labor groups back Markey (this is the first union endorsement in the race), or whether Lynch will lock them all up.

• NJ-Sen: There was nothing in Al Capone's vault... but it wasn't Geraldo's fault. However, if the gasbag TV clown actually follows through and runs for Senate in New Jersey, it most definitely will be his fault. The most amazing thing? Geraldo, long berated as a lunatic liberal by FOX News types, wants to run as a Republican!

Gubernatorial:

• WY-Gov: I have to admit that while I can probably name the governors of all 50 states, I struggle to remember the name of the guy in charge of Wyoming. But (god bless Wikipedia) that would be Republican Matt Mead, elected in a landslide in 2010. Assuming he runs again, will he be re-elected next year? In ruby red Wyoming, you'd have to bank on it—unless, of course, he faces a primary challenge. And it looks like he's just earned one, though it's hard to tell how serious it is.

It turns out Mead just signed a bill that strips State Superintendent of Public Instruction Cindy Hill ""of leadership of the state Department of Education, reassigning those duties to a person appointed by the governor."" Hill is challenging the move in court, but I'm guessing the fact that Mead was able to shunt her aside via legislative maneuvering means Hill doesn't have a whole lot of friends in the establishment.

Other Races:

• OH-Treasurer: It's the news you've all been waiting for: DKE's least-favorite Republican of the 2012 cycle, Josh Mandel, says he'll seek re-election as state treasurer next year. Mandel, of course, was solidly thumped by Sen. Sherrod Brown, despite being the beneficiary of eleventy-zillion moneys spent on his behalf by outside groups. Of course, after first winning his current post in 2010, Mandel promised he wasn't looking for an immediate promotion, so I definitely won't trust his current pronouncement until the filing deadline passes. Hopefully we'll get to beat him again, though!

Grab Bag:

• DCCC, NRCC: Despite being deep in the minority, House Democrats outraised their GOP counterparts by a wide margin in the 2011-12 cycle: The DCCC took in $184 million versus $156 million for the NRCC. That probably helped the Democrats pick up seats, though of course the majority remains as elusive as ever. In any event, both parties started the year with $1.5 million in cash, while the D-Trip had slightly higher debt ($13.5 mil vs. $12 mil).

• Polltopia: If you're a careful poll-watcher, you've probably noticed what I've noticed over the last couple months, which is Rasmussen putting up strangely positive numbers for the Democrats, on presidential approval and especially on the generic House ballot. As far as the latter is concerned, they've been putting up take-back-the-majority type numbers with Dem leads in the high-single-digits, usually notably better than what other pollsters like PPP are finding. Well, Harry Enten has noticed too, and he takes Rasmussen to task for it.

You might be thinking that Rasmussen is consciously overcompensating for its overly-Republican results over the previous few cycles by putting a thumb on the scales in the Dems' direction, but it's not that simple; instead, it looks like they're just committing the same methodological problems that have always plagued them, but in the wake of a solid 2012 election for the Dems, that leads Rasmussen down the same screwed-up path but in the opposite direction.

Instead of weighting based on demographics using Census data like good pollsters usually do, Rasmussen continues to weight based on party ID in the last election (a bad idea, because party ID isn't an immutable characteristic but one that fluctuates easily based on who's up and who's down politically). Dems had a six-point edge in 2012 exit polls in 2012. So, now we've got a weighted sample in Rasmussen polls that's 38 D, 32 R: maybe right for a presidential election, but overly rosy for a midterm. (David Jarman)

• Texas: PPP has some Lone Star State miscellany, asking their usual gay marriage and sports questions. (Did you ever imagine there'd be a pollster with an equal interest in both topics? This is why Tom Jensen is awesome.) GOP Sen. Ted Cruz's first job approval ratings are pretty meh, at 36-30, but that actually gives him the highest net approval of any statewide elected official PPP's tested there. Meanwhile, as you'd expect, most Texans are opposed to same-sex marriage, by a 55-35 margin, but 61 percent support some form of legal recognition once you include civil unions."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/08/17/Media-Matters-Attacks-NYT-For-Clinton-Foundation-Expos,2013-08-17 00:00:00,['Wynton Hall'],Media Matters Attacks NYT over Clinton Foundation ExposÃ©,"In the wake of last week’s much-discussed New York Times investigative report detailing cronyism and mismanagement inside the Clinton Foundation, former president Bill Clinton issued an open letter in an attempt to stem the public relations backlash. Clinton’s letter challenged a couple of the Times’ assertions that his nonprofit had run deficits.

Curiously, Clinton’s letter left unchallenged the Times’ more troubling reporting–based on over two dozen interviews with Clinton Foundation insiders–that the nonprofit is rife with cronyism and conflicts of interest that leverage access and power to benefit for-profit ventures like Teneo, a consultancy co-founded by Bill Clinton’s “surrogate son” and former Clinton Foundation aide Douglas Band. Teneo, whose earliest clients included the now-defunct MF Global headed up by Obama bundler Jon Corzine, has also hired Hillary Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin, wife of mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner.

That placed Media Matters in the awkward position of defending Hillary and Bill Clinton from the liberalNew York Times. Media Matters blogger Emily Arrowood filed a blog post chastising the New York Timesfor its “misleading Times story, which apparently failed to perform due diligence in reporting on the accounting requirements for foundations.”

Oddly, Arrowood went on to scold conservative media outlets for having the temerity to cite the New York Times reportage.

“Predictably, conservative media did not wait to learn these facts surrounding the Clinton Foundation, preferring to cite the initial Times story to decry imaginary scandals and lob both new and old attacks at Hillary Clinton,” wrote Arrowood. She blasted Fox News host Eric Bolling, The Blaze, The London Telegraph (sic), former New York Times Magazine editor-in-chief Ed Klein, and The Atlantic as being part of a “right-wing noise machine” that was “scrambling to find a new Hillary scandal.”

Like Bill Clinton’s letter, however, Arrowood’s blog post sidestepped the Times’ more serious charges of cronyism and conflicts of interest and ducked altogether the Breitbart News report last week featured on Drudge Report that chronicled additional Clinton Foundation conflicts of interest not included in theTimes’ original report. As Breitbart News reported, by 2008, the Clinton Foundation raised at least $46 million from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Brunei, Oman, and other foreign governments with whom Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would later negotiate. In her role as a New York Senator, Hillary Clinton also reportedly helped New York developer Robert Congel win millions of dollars in federal assistance after Congel donated $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation.

Then there is the case of Teneo. According to the Times, the Clintons, Band, Teneo, and the Foundation were entangled in a web of crony alliances and conflicts of interest:

Mr. Band poached executives from Wall Street, recruited other Clinton aides to join as employees or advisers and set up shop in a Midtown office formerly belonging to one of the country’s top hedge funds. By 2011, the firm had added a third partner, Declan Kelly, a former State Department envoy for Mrs. Clinton. And Mr. Clinton had signed up as a paid adviser to the firm. Teneo worked on retainer, charging monthly fees as high as $250,000, according to current and former clients. The firm recruited clients who were also Clinton Foundation donors, while Mr. Band and Mr. Kelly encouraged others to become new foundation donors. Its marketing materials highlighted Mr. Band’s relationship with Mr. Clinton and the Clinton Global Initiative, where Mr. Band sat on the board of directors through 2011 and remains an adviser. Some Clinton aides and foundation employees began to wonder where the foundation ended and Teneo began.

The crony connections between Teneo, Douglas Band, and the Clintons had grown so alarming, reports theTimes, that Chelsea Clinton “became increasingly concerned with the negative impact Mr. Band’s outside business might have on her father’s work and that she cited concerns raised during the internal review about potential conflicts of interest involving Teneo.”

The Media Matters piece made no mention of Teneo, Douglas Band, Robert Congel, or Chelsea Clinton’s concerns over crony capitalist conflicts of interest.

Instead, following Bill Clinton’s lead, Media Matters dodged the New York Times‘ most serious revelations and quibbled over “context”–a risky tactic that may encourage the Times to dig deeper.

Indeed, just one day after Bill Clinton and Media Matters’s retort, liberal New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd followed up the Times’ Clinton Foundation cronyism report with this: “If Americans are worried about money in politics, there is no larger concern than the Clintons…Clintonworld is a galaxy where personal enrichment and political advancement blend seamlessly, and where a cast of jarringly familiar characters pad their pockets every which way to Sunday.”

Dowd added, “The most egregious nest of conflicts was a firm founded by Doug Band called Teneo, a scammy blend of corporate consulting, public relations and merchant banking. Band, a surrogate son to Bill, put Huma, a surrogate daughter to Hillary, on the payroll. Even Big Daddy Bill was a paid adviser.”

No word yet from Media Matters on Maureen Dowd’s newly minted allegiance with the “right-wing noise machine.”"

The GOP is in serious trouble — and it is trouble that we, as long-time Democrats, recognize all too well.

Since their defeat in 2012, Republicans have offered plenty of excuses: candidates who can’t fire up the base, gaps in messaging and technology, the hard-to-match charisma of a historic president. And most Republican leaders seem to hope that cosmetic changes will be enough to reverse course in 2016 — without challenging the convictions of the party’s core supporters.

A quarter of a century ago, it was our party that was in a bad way. After losing a third presidential election in a row, Democrats offered a litany of explanations for what had gone wrong. Many of the recriminations focused on 1988 candidate Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. Others pointed to fundraising and technology, media and momentum. Even after Dukakis’s defeat at the hands of a decidedly uncharismatic George H.W. Bush, Democrats continued to tell themselves that their fortunes would start looking up when Ronald Reagan left the arena.

We disagreed, and in a 1989 manifesto, “The Politics of Evasion: Democrats and the Presidency,” we set out to debunk the myths that Democrats were using to explain away their dismal defeats. “Too many Americans have come to see the party as inattentive to their economic interests, indifferent if not hostile to their moral sentiments, and ineffective in defense of their national security,” we wrote. We pointed to evidence that the party’s problems were more fundamental than the ones being discussed. And we laid out the kinds of changes the party would have to embrace if it wished to regain its competitiveness in presidential elections.

Of course, as Democrats, we welcome today’s reversal of fortunes. We’re gratified that many fewer Americans see the party as out of touch and that many more are open to the Democratic agenda. And no doubt the Democrats’ electoral success has been helped by the fact that it is now the Republican Party that is a victim of adverse demographic trends, unpopular positions on the issues and a demanding base that is far from the country’s center of political gravity.

But we also believe that our democracy is better off with two healthy political parties willing to debate fiercely — and then reach honorable compromises. A Republican Party dominated by a new generation of reform-minded conservatives who care more about solving problems than scoring points would be a huge step toward restoring a federal government that can govern. So we’d like to pass on to Republicans now some of the advice we offered Democrats then.

The first step is to dispense with the evasion. Our manifesto explored three myths that were prevalent among Democrats in 1989— and that can be seen among Republicans today.

The Myth of Fundamentalism

The Myth of Fundamentalism held that Democrats lost presidential elections because they strayed from traditional liberal orthodoxy.We argued that there simply were not enough liberals in the electorate to carry the party to victory. To win, it would need to both hold on to liberals and attract a substantial majority of the moderate vote.

Three years later, Bill Clinton sought to do that. Running for president as a “New Democrat,” he famously promised to “end welfare as we know it,” campaigned against outsize budget deficits and trade protectionism, and proposed to reinvent government, not expand it.

The Republican Party today is as out of step with the mainstream as Democrats were in 1989. For too many conservatives, “Back to Reagan” is a soothing mantra. They think conservatism’s ills can be cured by becoming more conservative. But Republicans are as far from the end of the Reagan administration as Democrats were from FDR during the Nixon era, and the party’s 1980 platform won’t solve today’s problems.

Although there are more conservatives than liberals in the electorate, the GOP still needs moderate support. But the tea party’s Wahhabi-style drive to restore pure, uncompromised conservatism has led Republicans away from an electoral majority. This is especially true with young voters and minorities, although in recent years the entire country has become more tolerant and inclusive. A party dominated by hard-edged social conservatives, opponents of the DREAM Act and climate-change deniers will have a difficult time gaining a hearing.

Republicans would also do well to acknowledge that their commitment to shrinking government entails much deeper spending cuts than most Americans are willing to accept — especially in programs such as Social Security and Medicare. And they must find a way to respond to mainstream concerns about stagnant wages and widening disparities of income and wealth.

The Myth of Mobilization

The second myth we explored was the Myth of Mobilization: the argument that on Election Day, “selective mobilization of groups that strongly support Democratic candidates, especially minorities and the poor, would get the job done for Democratic presidential candidates.” We recalculated the 1988 electoral college results based on African American turnout levels as high as 68 percent of the voting-age population, and even such a record showing wouldn’t have come close to changing the outcome.

The Republicans’ demographic problem is the mirror image of the one that Democrats faced a quarter-century ago. Back then, there weren’t enough minorities to make the Democrats’ electoral strategy work; today, there aren’t enough whites to put the Republicans over the top.

And it will only get worse for them: By the middle of this century, the Census Bureau projects, whites will no longer constitute a majority of the U.S. population. A nearly all-white party, which is what the GOP has become, will have no chance of obtaining an electoral majority. Republicans will have to compete for black, Latino and Asian votes.

The Myth of the Congressional Bastion

The final misconception we called the Myth of the Congressional Bastion. This was perhaps even more important than the other two myths in sustaining the optimism Democrats felt in 1989. It went something like this: “There’s nothing fundamentally wrong with the Democratic Party; there’s no realignment going on; the proof is that Democrats still control Congress and a majority of state and local offices as well.” (Despite Dukakis’s seven-point defeat, Democrats gained governorships and controlled 28 statehouses.)

We argued at the time that it was unrealistic to expect that the enormous Republican tide in Southern states at the presidential level would have no effect at the congressional level, and that the power of incumbency was masking what was happening in the electorate.

Five years later, the myth collapsed. In the 1994 midterm elections, Republicans won the House of Representatives for the first time in 40 years, along with 10 governorships, for a total of 30.

Incumbency can protect a party against shifts in the electorate for only so long. The Republican hold on the House is not overwhelming, and it is far from permanent. Nor is the GOP’s edge among governors. If the generational replacement taking place at the presidential level continues, it will inevitably affect Congress and the states as well.

Reform on the horizon?

Who might play our iconoclast role in this version of the movie? Among the contenders are libertarians, populists and even mainstream conservatives who believe that the idea of compassionate conservatism deserves to survive George W. Bush’s presidency.

Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson and fellow Bush 43 veteran Peter Wehner are trying to build on what Bush got right — and warn the GOP away from what the tea party gets wrong. In a March Commentary magazineessay headlined “How to Save the Republican Party,” they wrote: “It is no wonder that Republican policies can seem stale; they are very nearly identical to those offered up by the party more than 30 years ago. For Republicans to design an agenda that applies to the conditions of 1980 is as if Ronald Reagan designed his agenda for conditions that existed in the Truman years.”

Gerson and Wehner propose focusing on the economic concerns of working- and middle-class Americans, welcoming rising immigrant groups, pushing back against hyper-individualistic libertarianism by demonstrating the party’s commitment to the common good, engaging social issues “in a manner that is aspirational rather than alienating,” and harnessing policy views to scientific findings. Describing opposition to same-sex marriage as a “losing battle,” they note tartly (and correctly) that “it is heterosexuals, not homosexuals, who have made a hash out of marriage,” and they suggest that Republicans and conservatives might more usefully focus on strengthening marriage in all its forms.

Gerson and Wehner also offer a theme: “The Republican goal is equal opportunity, not equal results. But equality of opportunity is not a natural state; it is a social achievement, for which government shares some responsibility.”

Despite this intellectual ferment, the transformation of the Republican Party has barely begun. There’s no substitute for a leader who has the guts to break with outdated party orthodoxy, as Clinton did on trade, fiscal policy, welfare and crime, among other issues. And he did more than that: In the famous Sister Souljah episode, when he denounced an African American rapper for comments that justified blacks killing whites, he spoke out against a tendency in the party’s base that crossed the line from protest to extremism.

Mitt Romney and the other contenders for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination had numerous opportunities to do just that, and they ducked them all. The incredible statements about women and rape by two Republican Senate candidates could have served as a Sister Souljah moment for Romney. But rather than using them to mount a full-throated protest against extremism in the party, he offered a mild rebuke that did nothing to undo the damage or to change the trajectory of the campaign. As long as aspirants for GOP leadership flinch from confronting their angry base, the American people will continue to see Republicans as uncompromising, uncaring and retrograde.

And until party leaders are willing to call extremism by its rightful name, repudiating not just mean-spirited words but also narrow-minded policies, it is unlikely that any candidate will be willing to do so. The phrase “liberal fundamentalism” made us few friends a quarter of a century ago, but it was necessary for us to utter it. We’re waiting for our counterparts among today’s Republicans and conservatives to do the same.

(CNN) —

For the first time since the 2008 presidential race, Hillary Clinton made a foray back into the thorny world of campaign politics on Saturday, appearing at a rally for Terry McAuliffe, the longtime Clinton confidante now running for governor of Virginia.

About 500 people showed up to the historic State Theatre in Falls Church, a suburb of Washington, D.C. to witness Clinton’s smiling re-emergence on the political scene, showering her with applause when she made even the slightest allusion to running for office again.

What did we learn about her future plans as she considers a repeat bid for the White House in 2016? Not much at all, actually.

But here are three important takeaways from Clinton’s first big political speech since leaving the State Department earlier this year:

She was relaxed

Never a dynamic speaker on the stump in 2008, Clinton was instead relaxed, confident and authoritative on Saturday.

It’s not hard to see why.

This was a supremely low-risk event for Clinton – as perfect a re-entry into national politics as she could have asked for. Barring some kind of wacky collapse in the final three weeks of the race, McAuliffe is generally expected to defeat his Republican opponent Ken Cuccinelli, though some Democrats here expect the winning margin to be a few points smaller than the eight-point lead he holds in the polls, given the usual GOP turnout edge in an off-year.

The former secretary of state has a close personal friendship with McAuliffe, a longtime fundraiser, poker buddy, cheerleader, political fixer and all-purpose confidant for the Clintons.

The event’s frame – it was billed as a “Women For Terry” rally – was right in Clinton’s strike zone, giving her a chance to talk about politics in terms she feels most comfortable.

“The whole country is watching to see if the rights of women and girls will be respected, especially over our own bodies and our health care,” she said of the Virginia race, alluding to Cuccinelli’s efforts as a state legislator and attorney general to curb access to abortion.

Add it all up, and Clinton was completely at ease on Saturday, campaigning in front a fawning audience in the Washington suburbs, talking about women’s issues and propping up one of her longtime pals.

“I thought hard about what I wanted to say to Virginians today,” she said. “I’ve been out of politics for a few years now. And I’ve had a chance to think a lot about what makes our country so great. What kind of leadership is required to keep it great.”

How long can Hillary Clinton wait?

She wasn’t afraid to jab Republicans, however gently

Clinton stayed mostly positive, but she didn’t shy away from taking a few shots at Republicans, albeit not by name.

Talking about the political gridlock on Capitol Hill that led to a 16-day government shutdown this month, she said that “we have seen examples of the wrong kind of leadership” in recent days, an unmistakable poke at House Republicans.

“Politicians choose scorched-earth over common ground,” she continued. “They operate in what I called the evidence-free-zone, with ideology trumping everything else,” she said, before listing the consequences of the shutdown, such as furloughed workers and “children thrown out of Head Start.”

Clinton also made sure to highlight Republican efforts to enforce stricter abortion regulations in Virginia. McAuliffe, she said, would “stand up against attempts to restrict women’s health choices.”

Rounding out her speech, Clinton alluded to Alexis de Tocqueville, the French writer who described Americans as having “habits of the heart” when he traveled to the U.S. nearly 200 years ago.

But Clinton warned that such a spirit is under threat.

“We cannot let those who do not believe in America’s progress hijack this great experiment, and substitute for the habits of the heart suspicion, hatred, anger, anxiety. That’s not as a people who we are.”

Clinton on possible presidency: ‘I’m realistic’

She executed the McAuliffe game plan

As much as Clinton was the story here, time and again she served as a character witness for McAuliffe, whom Republicans have relentlessly attacked as a carnival barker and Washington insider.

“I’ve seen the values that he was raised with,” Clinton said of McAuliffe, standing next to her on stage at the State Theatre, along with his wife Dorothy. “He grew up in a middle class family. He was taught about the dignity of work and the importance of looking out for each other. He started his first business at the age of 14 because he knew he was going to have to put himself through school. He’s lived those values.”

The Clinton appearance was straight out of McAuliffe’s playbook from day one.

No one in Virginia is surprised that his campaign deployed Clinton at this late stage of the game, an effort to stir up scads of press attention and drown out the cash-strapped Cuccinelli, who is not even airing television ads in the crucial northern Virginia media market this weekend, two ad-buying sources told CNN.

Cuccinelli spent Saturday rallying the conservative base with Mike Huckabee in central Virginia.

The Democrats’ goal is to lock in McAuliffe’s lead and keep their boot on Cuccinelli’s neck as they head into the final stretch.

And guess what: former President Bill Clinton, the big dog himself, will also be campaigning for McAuliffe in the coming weeks. Date TBD."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/08/18/Exclusive-Poll-Sen-Alexander-Trails-Generic-Conservative-by-5-Points,2013-08-18 00:00:00,['Mike Flynn'],Exclusive — GOP Poll: Sen. Alexander Trails Generic 'Conservative' by 5 Points,"A new poll of Republican voters in Tennessee shows Sen. Lamar Alexander trailing a generic “conservative” challenger by 5 points. The poll, obtained exclusively by Breitbart News, shows a “credible conservative candidate” leading Alexander 49.5-44.9%. While a serious opponent hasn’t yet emerged to challenge Alexander, the poll shows how vulnerable he is in next year’s August primary.

The poll, from Triton Polling, interviewed over 680 Republican voters in the Volunteer State last week. The poll has a margin of error of +/- 3.7%.

Around 64% of Republican voters, at least somewhat, approve of the job Alexander is doing, an unsurprising result for a Republican incumbent. Only 27% view Alexander as “conservative,” however. 65% of Republican voters view him as “moderate” or “liberal.” These are the views of Republican voters, 51% of whom identify themselves as “very conservative.” In total, over 85% of Republican voters consider themselves at least somewhat conservative.

Any incumbent polling in the 40s is in a weak position. Alexander’s position is particularly vulnerable, however, because the base voters view his ideological orientation as distinct from their own. Just over 30% of Republican voters say they will “definitely” vote to renominate Alexander next year.

After the head-to-head match-up question, which, again Alexander lost, the poll then has several “push” questions, testing possible messages against Alexander. Ranging from “voting with Obama 62% of the time” to “supporting amnesty” for 11 million illegals, each finds around 70% of Republican voters “less likely” to support Alexander.

Of course, Alexander can’t lose the primary if he doesn’t have a challenger. BEAT LAMAR, a grass roots effort opposed to Alexander’s reelection is holding a candidate forum on August 31st, to begin the vetting process of selecting a conservative opponent for the primary.

“Everybody has agreed that we need to get behind a single candidate and put our efforts behind someone who can challenge Lamar, debate his public record and basically just push back against the Republican establishment that is trying to bully and intimidate anyone who wants to run against him,” Nashville Tea Party President Ben Cunningham told The Tennessean.

This latest poll may tempt more seasoned candidates into the race. Ralph Bristol, a popular talk radio host in Tennessee, told Breitbart News, “If a strong, articulate, conservative who has been vetted and tested in lower office were to mount a challenge, and attracted Tea Party support, I’m convinced Lamar is at least as vulnerable as Lindsey Graham or Mitch McConnell, probably more so.”"

On Tuesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney batted away the notion that the Obama administration is behaving like Richard Nixon's.

""People who make those kinds of comparisons need to check their history,"" Carney said.

Try as he might, though, Carney has not been able to tamp down the idea that there is something ""Nixonian"" about the Justice Department's secret probe of the Associated Press.

Brian Williams, for example led off Tuesday's ""NBC Nightly News"" this way:

""As a lot of American adults not so fondly remember, the last time the government was found looking into the phone calls of reporters and using the IRS for political purposes, it was the Nixon era, and while times have changed and circumstances are different that subject came up at the Obama White House today as the administration now scrambles on several fronts.""

Tuesday also saw James Goodale, who was the lawyer for the New York Times in the Pentagon Papers case, flatly say that Obama was worse than Nixon in his dealings with the press.

""Obama has all these things that he's done to the press on national security matters that Nixon never did,"" Goodale told the New York Observer.

Goodale also wrote a piece for the Daily Beast in which he drove the point home. He cited, among other things, Obama's unprecedented use of the Espionage Act to prosecute whistleblowers.

Obama, he said, ""is fast becoming the worst national security press president ever, and it may not get any better.""

The New York Times editorial board also weighed in on Tuesday night, harshly criticizing Obama:

The Obama administration, which has a chilling zeal for investigating leaks and prosecuting leakers, has failed to offer a credible justification for secretly combing through the phone records of reporters and editors at The Associated Press in what looks like a fishing expedition for sources and an effort to frighten off whistle-blowers."

Rich Anderson knocks on doors seven days a week, for at least two hours a day. He’s not selling anything. He’s listening.

After 30 years in the Air Force, he’s used to straight talk. But what Anderson, a Republican who represents 80,000 residents of Prince William County in the Virginia legislature, is hearing these days is blunt to the max.

Knock-knock: “I’m fed up with all of you,” says Tony Smathers, a retired research physicist at the Naval Research Lab.

Knock-knock: “It must really suck to be a Republican right now,” says a federal worker who, truth be told, is a Republican herself.

Knock-knock: “Lifelong Republican,” says the woman at the door, a senior executive in the military. “I’m sorry — I have to tell you, I’m not apt to vote for anyone in my own party this year. Can’t do it.”

These voters will help choose a new governor in two weeks, and they are gearing up to send a message about the most recent horror show in Washington.

At many doors, voters tell Anderson that they plan to hold his party and its candidate for governor, Ken Cuccinelli II, to account for the D.C. follies. Anderson winces and explains that Virginia does business differently from the jokers in Washington. Things get done, budgets get balanced, opponents work together.

At some doors, there’s a grudging nod, maybe even a thin smile. But at many, this genial state delegate is the convenient guy to vent at.

Thirty-five miles from downtown Washington, Richard L. Anderson’s turf includes Virginia’s most reliable political barometer, the ultimate bellwether: the Coles Magisterial District, which happens to have voted right — that is, for the winning candidate, no matter his party or philosophy — in a dozen statewide elections in a row. People here voted for Barack Obama, twice, for George W. Bush, twice, for gubernatorial candidates Robert F. McDonnell, Timothy M. Kaine, Mark R. Warner and James S. Gilmore II, and for Senate candidates Kaine, James Webb, Mark Warner and John W. Warner — winners all.

So the men who want to be governor — Cuccinelli, the state attorney general, and his opponent, Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic National Committee chairman — need to know: What are they thinking in Coles?

Answer: They do not like you. They cannot stand you. They want you to go away.

In interviews with more than 40 voters in Prince William’s Coles District, one — one — expressed actual enthusiasm for either candidate.

View Graphic An analysis of previous Virginia governor elections

Coles voters are people of all walks, living in all kinds of settings. Prince William is part winding rural byways, part densely packed townhouse clusters, part cookie-cutter estate homes in developments that haven’t made it onto the road maps quite yet.

As more northerners, Asians, Hispanics and blacks have moved into new developments in Coles, the pattern of picking winners has persisted, a reflection of Virginia’s overall shift toward a more ethnically and politically diverse electorate. That change, which has turned a solidly Republican state into one with two Democrats in the U.S. Senate and two Democrats among the last three governors, is poised to alter the political lineup in Richmond, with Democrats in strong contention in all three statewide races this year.

(Coles is the northeast fringe of a vast congressional district represented by Rob Wittman, a conservative Republican from a tiny town 85 miles away.)

What unites Coles residents now is not any passion for particular candidates, but rather their desire to send a message that the elected representatives in Washington do not represent them. In their lives, you actually do the job you were hired to do.

There are no signs for Cuccinelli or McAuliffe in the Hunters Ridge development off the Prince William Parkway; the homeowners association doesn’t allow political signs in front of its 225 houses on large lots. But Delton Nichols, who has lived in Hunters Ridge for 14 years and spends two to three hours a day commuting to and from his federal job in the District, says there wouldn’t be many campaign signs on lawns even if they were permitted.

“People live here for a reason,” he says. (His house is adjacent to a stretch of thick forest; a sign at the curb says, “This Street May Be Extended in the Future.”) “You have a little more elbowroom, you work hard. The people here are informed and follow the issues. They’re people who believe we have to do all things in moderation. And then I look at this campaign, and I see one candidate far on the right and one on the left, and I don’t hear anyone excited about either of them. We’ve lost our way. Where is the moral courage? All this bickering is a waste of time.”

Nichols plans to vote for McAuliffe, largely because “I don’t like the hard line that Cuccinelli takes on those social issues. I’m a Christian, but God allows people the freedom to do things that maybe I don’t do. I agree that all life is sacred, but life is complicated.”

Similar conversations have taken place among Sheila Mitchell and her neighbors a couple of developments over from Nichols. Mitchell doesn’t work for the government anymore, but she spent nine years in the Air Force before starting a business that helps veterans navigate the benefits thicket. Many of her friends and neighbors, like a substantial portion of the Prince William workforce, have government connections, and she watched their struggles in recent weeks as they were told that because politicians couldn’t get along, they couldn’t work.

“We will vote, but we will cringe,” Mitchell says after discussing the election with her neighbors. “We’re looking at the governor’s race, and we’re going, ‘Yuck! What? Those are the choices?’ ”

Four years ago, when McAuliffe first ran for governor, Mitchell looked him over. “I thought, ‘God, he doesn’t look like you can trust him,’ ” she says. “Since then, research has shown I don’t think I can trust him. But then I look at Cuccinelli, and it’s, ‘Gosh, you don’t like women much, do you?’ ”

Mitchell is appalled by the Republican’s rhetoric on abortion and his proposal a few years ago to define “personhood” as beginning at the moment of fertilization, an approach that medical groups said could have limited women’s access to contraception.

All of that has Mitchell “leaning more toward McAuliffe but still juggling,” she says.

Both Nichols and Mitchell say they don’t define themselves by party, and both are avid supporters of their county supervisor, Martin E. Nohe, a Republican who has held the Coles District seat for a decade.

“We’re a true microcosm,” says Nohe, who runs a family-owned appliance store in Woodbridge. “I live in a nice, middle-class, older neighborhood, just down the street from a development I’ll never be able to afford. But the issues are all the same. We probably differ on the Affordable Care Act and whether we should fight in Syria, but on the things people really care about — reducing class size, protecting open space and the number one issue, how can we get our commutes shorter — we’re pretty much on the same page.”

Nohe has a Cuccinelli sign in his yard, but he shares his neighbors’ frustration that “on the bread-and-butter issues that people here care about, we haven’t heard much from the gubernatorial candidates.” Instead, what voters hear is attack ads from both sides about personal ethics and social issues.

Although Nohe shares Cuccinelli’s antiabortion position, the county supervisor notes that “no one is going to be persuaded based on social issues. People have their beliefs, and the candidates just use social issues to drive out their base.”

The one voter who expressed enthusiasm for either candidate was Desi Arnaiz — yes, his real name — who owns a small security and computer installation business. He and his wife live in Buckhall, a still-rural area where geese rest on wide fields, horses graze beneath white oaks and pickups sport bumper stickers that say, “I Don’t Believe the Liberal Media!” and “I Love Being a Bible Thumper!”

“We’re still mostly Republican where we are, because we’re in a pretty heavily protected area,” Arnaiz says. “We all have well water, and we all have septic tanks, and that protects us from development, and it separates the Republicans from the Democrats. The Democrats want government water and government sewage. We like it the way it is.”

Arnaiz, who is 76 and spent 25 years in the Air Force, likes Cuccinelli because “Ken’s very heavy up on pro-life, and where we are is heavily Catholic. Abortion, free love and same-sex marriage don’t sell well to us. McAuliffe is a frickin’ loser and a carpetbagger. Nobody here likes to be taxed. Nobody here likes to be pushed around.”

Although Arnaiz believes that Cuccinelli will prevail in Coles and across the state, he nonetheless agrees with neighbors of different ideologies that the issue that will decide the election is jobs. “My employees could care less about Syria,” Arnaiz says. “They’re interested in one thing: Do I have a job, and can I buy stuff?”

As Anderson moved from door to door, reminding constituents that he, too, is on next month’s ballot — running against Democrat R. Reed Heddleston, a financial consultant and retired Air Force colonel — he did hear about the economy. But mostly people wanted to talk about the dysfunction in Washington.

At Tony Smathers’s door, Anderson hears an earful about the shutdown and about Cuccinelli’s criticism of a University of Virginia professor’s research on global warming. “I don’t really know or care much about McAuliffe,” Smathers says. “I just don’t want Cuccinelli — strongly.”

Anderson replies: “This is a moderate district, and I’m a moderate guy. I believe when the majority has spoken, the issue is settled. We’ve got to find a civil way forward.”

Smathers isn’t hearing it. “You’re still one of them,” he says."
http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/opinions/2013/12/13/worst-year-in-washington/,2013-12-13 00:00:00,"['Story By', 'Illustration By']",Worst Year in Washington,"Second-term presidencies are tricky. The pace of modern politics and the desire of journalists (scourges!) to always look ahead to the next campaign put a reelected incumbent in a race against irrelevancy from the second he is sworn in again. Scandals tend to creep in or escalate — Watergate, Iran-Contra, Monica Lewinsky — and investigations follow, often drifting far afield. Momentum toward any meaningful achievement fades.

Usually, a president has until the midterm elections of his second term to get big things done; after that, attention moves on to deciding who will next occupy 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. But Obama may not have the luxury of even that truncated timeline. The split control in Congress — Democrats in charge in the Senate, a Republican majority in the House — combined with the tea party’s continued demand for conservative purity from its elected officials and the politicization of just about everything makes it hard to imagine that 2014 will afford Obama any chance to move his agenda through Congress. And his addition of John Podesta, a vocal advocate of taking executive action to end-run lawmakers, to the White House staff suggests that the president has effectively given up trying to work with the Hill.

All of which makes what happened — or more accurately, what didn’t happen — in 2013 that much more dire for Obama’s chances of leaving a lasting legacy on his party, Washington and politics more broadly.

Let’s start from the beginning, or a bit earlier. Despite a tenuous economic recovery and an unpopular health-care law, Obama surged to a convincing win in November 2012. The victory gave him a mandate to continue in the vein of his first four years, as well as providing a damning assessment of the GOP’s ability to attract any voters other than white men.

Obama used that momentum to cut a favorable deal with Republicans to avert the “fiscal cliff,” and he was able to unite the country after the horrific murder of 20 children and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.

On Jan. 1, then, it wasn’t difficult to imagine the passage of a broad gun-control measure, an immigration reform package, and a series of bills addressing the country’s debt and spending issues. The reasons none of these things came to be all lead back to Obama."

But now this city, which is in the midst of a trial to determine whether it is eligible for bankruptcy protection, is set to elect its first white mayor since 1974, Mike Duggan, and by an overwhelming margin. Recent polls show Duggan up by a nearly 2-1 margin over his opponent, Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon, in a city that is 82% African American.

Duggan’s lead is seen as a signal that the residents of long-struggling Detroit are ready for a change in leadership — someone who hasn’t served the city in politics before. After all, still fresh in voters’ minds is the case of former Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, who three weeks ago was sentenced to 28 years in prison for corruption.

The winds of change, however, may also be fueled by the nation’s willingness to elect a black president.

Minister Malik Shabazz, president of the Marcus Garvey Movement/New Black Panther Nation in Detroit, is one of Duggan’s most vocal supporters. Shabazz admits that having President Obama in the White House changes things.

“In the last two national elections, African Americans have asked the nation to choose the best person for the job and not get caught up in color. And twice, Barack Obama has won,” he said. “Now, in Detroit, in 2013, the best man running is a white brother, and that’s OK.”

The political establishment in Detroit did not make Duggan’s road to Tuesday’s ballot an easy one. The onetime hospital executive, who moved to Detroit from the affluent, mostly white suburb of Livonia, was kicked off the Aug. 6 primary ballot after opponents raised a court challenge questioning whether he met residency requirements.

A frustrated Duggan withdrew from the race — until supporters persuaded him to run as a write-in candidate. He won more than 50% of the vote that way, despite a crowded ballot and despite his opponents’ bid to confuse voters by mounting the candidacy of a barber named Mike Dugeon.

“He became this folk hero. It just kind of took on a life of its own,” said Bill Ballenger, editor of Inside Michigan Politics, a popular political newsletter.

Duggan’s background appeals to voters in a city that is desperately trying to turn itself around, where street lights don’t work and police can take hours to respond to violent crimes. He was once the deputy executive of Wayne County, where he helped overhaul the bus system, served as a county prosecutor and is widely credited with helping to turn around Detroit Medical Center with its eight hospitals.

He’s received endorsements from unions including Service Employees International Union Healthcare Michigan and from African American religious leaders including the Rev. Jim Holley of the city’s Historic Little Rock Baptist Church.

“Mike Duggan has a reputation, deserved or not, as a Mr. Fix-it, a turnaround artist,” Ballenger said.

Duggan’s opponent, Sheriff Napoleon, has impressive credentials as well. His campaign literature shows a younger Napoleon, wearing a bulletproof vest, carrying a small child away from a home where the boy’s family had been held hostage. He has played up his Detroit roots and long law enforcement career, at one debate saying that he “put on a bulletproof vest, a .40-caliber Glock and patrolled this city” as Duggan slept in Livonia.

Napoleon, 61, has snagged endorsements from major law enforcement groups such as the Detroit Police Officers Assn. and from unions including the city’s largest, Michigan’s American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees Local 25.

The new mayor, whoever he is, will not have too much responsibility when he first takes office. Detroit is being run by Kevyn Orr, an emergency manager appointed by the state, who has taken the reins from current Mayor Dave Bing. The law that allowed Orr to be appointed sets up a potential exit route for him in a year.

Many Detroiters seem to be focusing on who will best be able to run the city when Orr leaves. Few want to replicate what happened in Flint, Mich., which had an emergency manager, got rid of him and then needed another one when its finances again tanked.

Some voters see Napoleon as part of the old political establishment that wasn’t able to help the city.

“Duggan represents change; Napoleon does not,” said Joe Darden, a professor at Michigan State University who has studied race relations in Detroit. “Napoleon essentially represents a continuation of the status quo.”

Phil Pugh, 73, has lived in Detroit his whole life; like many other African Americans here, his family moved to Detroit from the South in the early part of the 20th century. He says he has seen many friends leave as they seek a safer place to raise families or after their grown children persuade them to move away.

Safety is so much on Pugh’s mind that he has three dogs, saying it’s the only way he can live in Detroit. He also says he has called the city many times to get help with keeping his neighborhood safe and free of blight. Every time, he says, he was rebuffed.

On a recent morning walk through his neighborhood near the Boston Edison section of the city, where boarded-up houses dot the block, Pugh talked about how difficult it had become to live in the city.

“I think it’s time for a change, and that change is Duggan,” he said.

Wife of 2012 GOP presidential nominee sits down for first solo post-election interview

Ann Romney was credited with softening her husband%27s edges

President Obama defeated Mitt Romney by about 4 percentage points

WASHINGTON — Ann Romney said mistakes were made by both sides in the 2012 presidential election, but has no regrets about the grueling campaign or its outcome.

""You'd always love to turn the page back and go back and say, 'Boy, if we had the crystal ball, wouldn't it have been nice to have done things a little differently.' But I still think, you know, every campaign makes mistakes. Both sides make mistakes,"" Romney said on CBS This Morning.

Thursday's session with CBS News was the first solo interview that Romney, wife of GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, has given since the election. The Romneys have been doting grandparents and done some traveling since President Obama defeated the former Massachusetts governor in November.

Romney was viewed as an integral part of the 2012 campaign, helping to soften her husband's edges and delivering a key speech on his behalf at the Republican National Convention last summer in Tampa. Those efforts, however, did not sway women voters, who overwhelmingly chose Obama over Romney. The 20-point gender gap was the largest measured by Gallup since 1952.

Romney blamed the gender gap on the way her husband was portrayed as a ""ruthless businessman"" and on the ""negative nature of the campaign.""

""Mitt and I did everything we could,"" she said.

Looking ahead to the 2016 presidential race, Romney said she and her husband are ""very, very partial"" to his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, and hope the Wisconsin congressman makes his own White House bid.

As for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who toured his storm-ravaged state with President Obama a week before the election, Romney said she has no ""bitterness"" toward one of Mitt Romney's most vocal surrogates.

""We're fine,"" she said.

http://news.yahoo.com/one-obama-lawn-sign-tore-community-apart-234121157.html,,[],How One Obama Lawn Sign Tore This Community Apart,"Yes, that sounds like a parody movie trailer. But unfortunately this is a real story based on real things that happened in real life instead of brilliant satire. The Washington Post has an amazing story about how an Obama lawn sign ignited an intense legal battle in a Virginia neighborhood.

RELATED: Farewell to Los Angeles's House of Davids

Sam and Maria Farran put an Obama election sign up in their yard leading up to the 2008 election. But what seems like a harmless political statement allegedly violated the stipulations of the homeowners association that governs the sleepy Virginia neighborhood where they live. The sign, it turns out, was four inches too tall. One particularly overzealous neighbor filed a complaint with the association and the Farrans were asked to take it down. Instead, they had a batter idea. They cut the sign in half. The homeowners association didn't appreciate the couples' humor, though, and fined them $900 for the infraction.

RELATED: Obama's Mortgage Aid Plan Steals Yet Another Republican Idea

The association board believed they were operating within Virgina law, but the Farrans saw this as a violation of their free speech by a group of proto-communists trying to run their neighborhood like 1940s Russia. After the board rejected the couples' proposal for roof and deck renovations under less than legitimate seeming circumstances, the Farrans filed a lawsuit against the association. The battle lines in the neighborhood were drawn. And these people take their legal battles very seriously:

The Farrans said HOA backers told them to move. They found bullets in their yard. Someone implored a priest at their church to prevail on the Farrans to stop the lawsuit. A local real estate agent said the infighting was scaring off some home buyers.

What followed is a legal battle that's still ongoing, and a homeowners association that's been left bankrupt because of it. Is this homeowners association fight as interesting or flashy as the one that killed LA's 'House of Davids'? No, but it's still crazy. You can and should read the whole story over at the Washington Post."

Seemingly always working — she has a book out next September — Ms. Gillibrand nonetheless leaves the office promptly at 5 every night to pick up her children from school. If there is a vote at that hour, she has developed a system to signal her aye or nay from a doorway off the Senate floor — where children are not permitted — so she can hold onto her 5-year-old’s hand. “She is ubiquitous,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, “and I mean that as a compliment. I don’t know how she does it.”

Some of Ms. Gillibrand’s Democratic colleagues are less enamored, likening her zeal to that of the Tea Party Republicans who hew to a belief and won’t let it go, ignoring some of the structural protocols of seniority.

“She is unwilling to knuckle under to demands for deference,” said Eugene R. Fidell, who teaches military justice at Yale Law School. “It is very rare that you see a relatively junior member of the Senate staking out a position and sticking by it.”

Ms. Gillibrand’s taste for a fight was presaged in her decision to run for the House in 2006, when she took on Representative John E. Sweeney in a Republican-rich district in upstate New York.

When she approached Howard Wolfson, a Democratic strategist, for help, he told her she could not win. “She told me she was going to run, was going to win, and I would either be the winning consultant or someone else would be,” he said. “I took the race.”

The campaign was one of the nastiest of the cycle, with a spate of negative ads that depicted Ms. Gillibrand as alternately dippy and a war profiteer for investing in war bonds, and ended with the release of a police report that detailed a domestic violence call made from Mr. Sweeney’s home. Ms. Gillibrand won over 50 percent of the vote. “She never wavered, never faltered,” Mr. Wolfson recalled."

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/29/mitch-mcconnell-reelection-campaign_n_3178608.html,2013-04-29 00:00:00,"['Senior Political Correspondent', 'Yahoo']",Mitch McConnell Reelection Campaign Hoping To Close Data Gap By Bringing In New Blood,"WASHINGTON –- Mitch McConnell does not seem like an obvious choice to help lead the GOP out of the digital wilderness it has found itself in when it comes to political campaigns.

The Senate minority leader most often emerges into the public eye from the floor of the Senate, formally debating Democrats in the chamber or dryly answering (or completely ignoring) reporter questions in the halls. Flashy he is not.

Yet McConnell's aides have noticed that the Republican conversation about catching up to Obama's data-driven, clinic of a campaign in 2012 is mostly focused on doing so by 2016. That doesn't help McConnell, who is up for reelection in 2014.

And so the attitude among aides to the fifth-term Kentucky Republican is that while some in the GOP are holding soul-searching panel discussions and others are fighting over who gets to control the data and the money in 2016, they're going to run a cutting-edge, digital-savvy campaign in 2014 that shows their party how it's done.

""We have no doubt the GOP will be ready for the 2016 presidential cycle, but in the meantime, we plan to set the standard here in our campaign and establish best practices other conservatives can emulate,"" said Jesse Benton, McConnell's campaign manager.

McConnell may not have a Democratic opponent yet; he has so far managed to intimidate a long list of Democrats from taking him on, all while avoiding a primary challenge from his right flank. But McConnell has struggled with a low approval rating. Some polls have shown him as low as 36 percent, though his aides point to other surveys showing him closer to 50 percent. And the fact that he is running a full-throttle reelection campaign is a sign to some that he knows he remains vulnerable.

So McConnell is bringing some relatively new blood into an establishment campaign. He has hired a small firm called Crowdverb to run his campaign's data operation. For digital strategy, McConnell is turning to Vincent Harris, a 24-year-old digital specialist who worked for Sen. Ted Cruz's (R-Texas) campaign and on the presidential primary runs of Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga).

Throw in Benton, the 35-year-old former campaign manager for former Rep. Ron Paul's (R-Texas) 2012 presidential campaign, and the message is clear: McConnell may be 71-years-old and look the part of a local chamber of commerce president, but he is taking an approach to personnel that embraces outsiders and innovation.

Crowdverb's co-founder, Cyrus Krohn, is someone who has been ""largely ignored in Republican circles,"" Benton said. The 42-year-old Krohn is of the tech world, not of the GOP political establishment, said Josh Holmes, the 34-year-old McConnell adviser who runs the senator's district office in Washington and was Krohn's connection to McConnell.

Krohn, who is based in Seattle like Crowdverb co-founder Todd Herman, has done some work for the Republican party, in a two-year stint as digital director at the Republican National Committee during the 2008 election. But he fell victim at the RNC to ""myth of the savior"" thinking, one senior Republican digital strategist told The Huffington Post on background. The RNC, led by then-chairman Mike Duncan, expected Krohn to ""work magic"" but did not give him the resources or the authority to do so, the strategist said.

Krohn spent a few years at CNN in the early '90s before helping to start Slate Magazine, where he eventually became publisher. All told, he spent a decade at Slate, and then from 2004 to 2007 Krohn worked for Microsoft and Yahoo in the world of online video, primarily in politics.

""One of the things that has bothered me most about the political industry is that everyone knows how to talk a good game but very few do anything remarkable or unique. Nowhere is that more prevalent than the world of data and online strategy,"" Holmes, the McConnell adviser, told The Huffington Post in an e-mail. ""Most of the people selling data-based products or online strategy to the political world are from the political world, which immediately disqualifies them in my view. I wouldn't hire an accountant to be our press secretary so why would we hire a political strategist to handle our data?""

""I spent about a year talking to a lot of vendors. Very few of them invented the technology, wrote code, understood data analytics, or applied algorithms. Most of them know politics and they have a widget to sell,"" Holmes said. ""[Krohn] and his team invent technology, write code, understand analytics, create algorithms, and build usable dashboards. They don't write ad copy and they don't even seem to have an opinion on the political application of their findings. When you're up in the air it's really comforting to know that the guy flying the plane is a pilot.""

Crowdverb is harvesting massive amounts of data from publicly available information on the web, in cooperation with its partner BehaviorMatrix, and using it to enhance the McConnell campaign's voter file, to measure public sentiment about McConnell moment by moment and to track how its different messages and tactics are impacting persuadable voters.

""What we're focused on really is the inherent need for dynamic data to complement traditional campaign tactics,"" Krohn said. ""What can you glean from the live web to understand in real time, based on people's emotions, to get them to take an action on the campaign's behalf: opening an e-mail, making a donation.""

Krohn gave an example.

""Let's say it's a Sunday talk show in Kentucky and it's a call-in program. All of the audio from that program is digitized for closed captioning. We're able to score what was said, gauge how it played with the electorate, and then determine what the implications were in terms of how people perceived that content via broadcast, and then respond,"" he said.

Crowdverb measures the response, in part, by ""maintaining records of individuals who have publicly available profiles, and mapping that back to the voter database.""

""We can say, 'We've identified that the comments from this program affected people emotionally in these ways' through predictive modeling as well as actual commentary, and that informs geographically how to communicate with them,"" Krohn said.

Benton said the campaign has ""about 41 percent of voter file matched to what they consider a detailed online profile,"" which includes ""things like social media handles, mobile phone number, preferred method of internet browsing, general internet activity, how people prefer to use social networks, and then also certain behavioral things or sentiment things about issues.""

He continued, ""This is what the Obama machine did.""

That may be a stretch. The Obama campaign, according to Sasha Issenberg's reporting, began the 2012 election ""confident it knew the name of every one of the 69,456,897 Americans whose votes had put him in the White House,"" and then worked to identify more potential supporters and recruited them one by one with individualized outreach.

If McConnell has 40 percent of the voter file identified, they may be on their way to doing some of what Obama did.

Benton explained how the real time feedback from Crowdverb will help the McConnell campaign monitor how the electorate is moving, and will then inform how to respond.

""Because the boss is always getting attacked, we're seeing a little bit more cycnicism about the boss than we'd like to see. They show us what they think is a critical level of cynicism that would start to hurt, and at this point in time we are below that,"" Benton said. ""But if we start to see a cynicism indices indicate a rise and that would tell us there could be a problem there, we would try to encourage our netroots people to make phone from home calls to people where their cynicism indexes are rising … with a sincerity message.""

That element of engaging grassroots supporters to influence their friends was a key component of the Obama campaign ground game.

Harris' job in running the campaign's digital strategy is not so much the harvesting and organizing of data as it is the promotion of the candidate through new media.

""Usually campaigns have a communications plan centered only on traditional media but Team McConnell believes in the emerging Buzzfeed culture: memes, web videos, and persuasion by entertainment,"" Harris said. ""They understand that when given a choice, many people would prefer to look at cat photos than engage with their elected officials. So we're working hard to ensure the senator's message breaks through what has become a cluttered medium.""

The McConnell team was eager to talk about their burgeoning digital operation, in an obvious attempt to project strength to potential opponents and hopefully keep the field clear as long as possible. Yet, it's not a bluff. McConnell, as always, is playing for keeps."

On Capitol Hill, the powerful eat in.

He who can leave for an extensive lunch is not writing a bill, strong-arming a senator, hectoring a committee witness or doing a spot on Fox Business Network. Let the low-level staff members trek to Seventh Street for pizza. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, has his lunch (usually chicken) brought in from the Senate dining room. (That’s a double power play: the dining room is for senators only, yet a staff member carts food to him.)

And so the sprawling Capitol complex is both our nation’s legislative center and its food court. While House members often repair to their partisan clubs for lunch, coffee and post-vote martinis, and senators can sometimes be found eating and drinking at the Monocle restaurant, which has fed generations of them, lawmakers are largely too busy to eat out. For them and their staffs — and the tour guides, reporters, art restoration experts, hairdressers and others among the cast of thousands who work on Capitol Hill — lunch is generally a quick in-house affair.

There are more than a dozen restaurants, cafes, sandwich bars and formal dining rooms on the Hill — most of them prosaic, some a little weird and almost all good for people watching, when you can get in. (The House and Senate dining rooms are generally reserved for members and their guests; many others are open to the public, but those in the Capitol building require an escort from someone who works there.)"

(CNN) – Mitt Romney has had some time to reflect on what went wrong last November. His main conclusion: the Hispanic community didn’t understand his immigration stance well enough.

""The largest strategic error was not investing sufficiently, particularly in Hispanic TV and Hispanic outreach to help Hispanic voters understand that ours is the party of opportunity,"" Romney told CNN’s Jake Tapper of the lesson to be learned for GOP presidential campaigns of the future.



Romney lost the Hispanic vote by 40%, a loss seen to be in large part spurred by the perception of the Republican Party as antithetical to immigration reform.

""I think my position and the position of our party is not well understood at the Hispanic community,"" said Romney. ""I want to see immigration reform. I said that during the campaign. I want to make sure we have a legal immigration system that brings, in my view, more people legally to our country. I'd like to do that.""



Exclusive: Romney disagrees with House GOP ‘tactics’ on Obamacare

Romney’s comments offer some of the most revealing insight into his thoughts on immigration and its role in his 2012 defeat to President Barack Obama.

Debates on how the GOP should adapt itself in the years to come have found a split between elements who think Republicans need to reach out better to Hispanic voters and those who view any immigration reform or pathway to citizenship as amnesty for lawbreakers.

The GOP has a long way to go if it wants to attract Hispanic voters, according to a new poll released Friday.

Half of Hispanics identify with the Democratic Party, according to the Public Religion Research Institute poll, compared to the 15% who identify with the GOP.

But the problem is more than just party identification, says the survey. Forty-three percent of Hispanics identified that the phrase ""cares about people like you"" more appropriately describes the Democratic Party, while 12% say the same for the GOP.

(CNN) - Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday in an interview with CNN that she still has ""absolutely no plans to run"" for president but added she's looking forward to more ""adventures"" down the road.

""I am lucky because I've been very healthy. I feel great. I've got enormous amounts of energy that have to be harnessed and focused, so I'm very fortunate,"" she told CNN's Jill Dougherty and Elise Labott. ""I'm looking forward to this next chapter in my life, whatever it is.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Pressed further on whether she has ruled out another White House bid, Clinton said; ""I have absolutely no plans to run.""

""I don't know everything I'll be doing. I'll be working on behalf of women and girls, hopefully writing and speaking, those are the things that I'm planning to do right now,"" she added.

She also appeared unaware that a super PAC, ""Ready for Hillary,"" had formed recently in support of a possible run.

""Is there really?"" Clinton asked.

Her successor, Sen. John Kerry, was confirmed by the Senate Tuesday afternoon.

When Clinton official leaves her post, she'll be capping a run of public service that includes being a first lady, U.S. senator, presidential candidate and the nation's top diplomat.

Asked what it will feel like to suddenly have some free time, Clinton said it's ""going to take some adjustment.""

""I've been talking to colleagues who left the government earlier, and the most common thing they say to me is don't make any decisions, you have no idea how tired you are,"" she said.

Clinton has repeatedly brushed aside questions about a potential presidential run and has yet to be specific about her plans. While she has previously said she was not interested in running at all, her answers of late have been less firm.

But Clinton said for now, she's ready for some rest.

""I know it sounds vague because I have never done this before in my life…to have the luxury of nowhere to go nothing to do, no frantic call about calling some leader about some impending crisis,"" Clinton said. ""I'm actually interested to see how that goes.""

Her husband, former President Bill Clinton and daughter Chelsea, are both involved in philanthropic and public service efforts. Asked about their plans as a family, Clinton said she's not sure what the next few years will look like.

""I think we'll work all that out, it's going to be fun to talk about what our next adventures might be,"" she said.

Finishing up the wide-ranging interview, Clinton thanked Dougherty and Labott, two reporters who have covered Clinton extensively over the last four years at the State Department.

""We'll have some adventures and maybe the two of you will come along again sometime,"" she said.

The 66 to 34 vote fell just short of the two-thirds majority required to approve a constitutional amendment and submit it to the states for ratification. It marked the latest setback for congressional attempts to supersede Supreme Court decisions in 1989 and 1990. Justices narrowly ruled that burning and other desecrations of the flag are protected as free speech under the First Amendment.

As expected, three Republicans -- Robert F. Bennett (Utah), Lincoln D. Chafee (R.I.) and Mitch McConnell (Ky.) -- voted against the amendment. Fourteen Democrats voted for it. The House approved the measure 286 to 130 last year.

GOP congressional leaders have offered up several measures in recent weeks that are important to their conservative political base -- including an amendment banning same-sex marriage and further cuts in the estate tax -- culminating with yesterday's vote on flag burning.

Polls show that most Americans want flag desecration outlawed, and the amendment's proponents said they were trying to stop justices from thwarting the public's will. They said that burning a U.S. flag in public -- while rare these days -- is a reprehensible insult to the nation's founders and a dishonor to the Americans who died fighting tyranny.

The amendment's opponents agreed that flag burning is repugnant, but argued that U.S. troops died to preserve freedoms that include controversial political statements.

Flag burning ""is obscene, painful and unpatriotic,"" Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii), who lost an arm in World War II, said in a floor speech yesterday. ""But I believe Americans gave their lives in the many wars to make certain that all Americans have a right to express themselves -- even those who harbor hateful thoughts.""

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) summarized the proponents' views. The flag's special symbolic status, she said, makes its desecration different from holding a sign denouncing the president. Burning an American flag in anger, she said, is ""conduct, not speech"" because the flag is ""the symbol of our democracy, our shared values, our commitment to justice, our remembrance to those who have sacrificed to defend these principles.""

Behind the constitutional rhetoric were cold political considerations. Republicans are eager to energize conservative voters this fall, and the flag initiative -- even if doomed to fail -- is seen as a sure-fire way to inspire them, especially a week before Independence Day.

The vote is the closest that advocates have come to banning flag desecration in many years of trying. In 2000, the Senate fell four votes short, and supporters had hoped the GOP's 55 to 44 majority -- there is one independent, James M. Jeffords (Vt.) -- would put them over the top this year.

The GOP-controlled House has repeatedly approved the amendment by wide margins, and advocates say they could have handily obtained ratification by three-quarters of the states if the Senate had followed suit.

The debate divided senators along unusual lines. Opposing the amendment was McConnell, the Senate's second-ranking GOP leader, and Bennett, a quiet, mainstream Republican. Democratic supporters includedMinority Leader Harry M. Reid (Nev.) and Sen. Evan Bayh (Ind.), a presidential hopeful. Maryland's Democratic senators voted against the amendment and Virginia's Republican senators voted for it.

The amendment's chief sponsor, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), disputed assertions that the measure was politically motivated and was an unwise use of the Senate's time in the face of war in Iraq, high gasoline prices and a growing federal deficit.

""Fifty state legislatures have called on us to pass this amendment,"" Hatch told colleagues.

He and his allies had tried for days to pick up one more vote. But virtually all senators had stated their positions publicly, making efforts at negotiation or persuasion fruitless.

The Constitution was last amended -- for the 27th time -- in 1992, when the states belatedly ratified a 1789 bid by Congress to regulate lawmakers' pay increases.

Overturning a Texas law in 1989, the Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 that burning an American flag in protest is a form of political speech protected under the First Amendment. Congress later passed a federal anti-flag-desecration law, and the high court invalidated it on the same grounds.

Ever since, lawmakers have debated whether flag burning is an unsavory cost of political freedom or something more akin to intolerable hate speech or monument defacement.

""All rights enshrined in the Constitution have certain limits,"" said Sen. Mel Martinez (R-Fla.). ""There is no such thing as unlimited rights. Although we treasure and value our right of free speech . . . we protect our national monuments,"" including the flag.

But Russell Feingold (D-Wis.) said Congress must ""defend the right of all Americans to express their views about their government, however hateful or spiteful or disrespectful those views may be.""

The proposed amendment said simply: ""The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States.""

Before the final tally, the Senate voted 64 to 36 to reject an alternative measure designed to provide political cover for those who opposed Hatch's legislation. The measure -- a proposed statute, rather than constitutional amendment -- was offered by Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) and was strongly endorsed by Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.), a possible presidential candidate who has sought a middle ground in the flag-burning debate.

The proposal would have outlawed flag desecration if the perpetrators were also damaging federal property, trying to incite violence or trying to intimidate someone. Opponents called Durbin's measure a political fig leaf that the Supreme Court would rule unconstitutional.

Hours before the votes were taken, Sen. George Allen (R-Va.) thrust the issue into his reelection campaign. Noting that Democratic challenger James Webb had said he opposed the amendment, Allen's campaign issued a press release linking Webb to Sens. John F. Kerry and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who voted against the amendment. The release said Webb is ""totally beholden to the liberal Washington senators"" who backed him in this month's primary."

(AP Photo/Charles Dharapak, File)

Just a few days after being notably absent from President Barack Obama's second inaugural ceremony, former presidential candidate Mitt Romney will head to Washington, D.C. to attend a reception in his honor.

As the National Journal first reported, Romney and his wife, Ann, are scheduled to attend a business luncheon Friday at Washington’s J.W. Marriott Hotel hosted by two of his campaign's top fundraisers. Romney rejoined the board of directors at Marriott International after losing the election last year.

CNN reports that the Romneys will also attend Saturday night's black tie Alfalfa Club Dinner while in Washington. Obama spoke at last year's event.

Romney has done his best to remain out of the spotlight following his loss to Obama. He ate lunch with the president after his defeat in November, and has been spotted in various places, but for the most part has remained largely out of the public eye.

On Monday, an aide told NBC News that Romney was at his beach home in La Jolla, Calif., during Obama's inauguration. While Romney reportedly had ""no big plans,"" the aide said it was ""doubtful"" that Romney would watch the ceremony.

Romney was the first losing presidential candidate not to attend the inauguration since Michael Dukakis in 1989. Dukakis reportedly opted to remain in Massachusetts, watching the day's events on television while eating a tuna sandwich. He did, however, send a telegram to the White House, offering incoming President George H.W. Bush his congratulations."

Washington (CNN) - Does Marco Rubio have an Iowa problem?

If Sam Clovis is any barometer, the answer is an unmitigated yes.



Clovis is a mustachioed, suspenders-wearing college professor from Sioux City who's running for Senate in Iowa, as a Republican. He’s not the favorite to win the nomination, but he’s no slouch either.

He also happens to be a popular conservative talk radio host who speaks the language of grassroots Republicans and has a keen sense of what motivates them.

So the fact that Clovis posted a low-budget web video Wednesday trashing Rubio for his work on the Senate immigration reform bill is an ominous sign for the Florida senator and would-be presidential candidate.

Despite recent hand-wringing about the flawed nature of the Iowa caucuses, the state is all but assured to keep its leadoff position in the 2016 nomination process. If Rubio runs, he'll have to make nice with Iowa conservatives. They just might not be nice to him.

“I might have expected this out of John McCain,” Clovis says of the immigration bill. “But we certainly didn’t expect this out of Marco Rubio. Marco Rubio was elected by conservatives in the state of Florida and he was supported by conservatives all over the United States. And there is nothing conservative in this bill.”

Like any self-styled member of the tea party movement, Clovis labels the bill “amnesty,” says it fails to adequately secure the border with Mexico and claims it will impose a heavy financial burden on state and local governments.

Clovis punctuates the video with a straightforward admonition: “Shame on Marco Rubio.”

Bottom line: If midterm Republican candidates in Iowa think they can score points with conservative voters by attacking Rubio and tying him to President Obama and reborn pragmatist John McCain, Rubio’s got some critical repair work to do on the right."

(Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)

Republican Patrick Mara is pushing back against criticism of his support for Mitt Romney in last year’s presidential race, saying his endorsement pales in comparison to those made by Democratic candidates.

In an interview this week, Mara stood by his endorsement of Romney, saying he knew the 2012 GOP presidential nominee was never going to carry the District’s three electoral votes.

“We all knew he wasn’t going to win in the District of Columbia, but supporting him was an important part of growing a two-party system in the District of Columbia and growing a check and balance,” said Mara, who served as a Romney delegate at last year’s GOP national convention and contributed money to his campaign.

Mara faces five other candidates in the April 23 special election for an at-large seat on the D.C. Council. Several of the other candidates, including incumbent Anita Bonds (D-At large) and Democrat Elissa Silverman, have questioned whether Mara’s past support for Romney proves he’s out of touch with the city’s heavily Democratic electorate.

Mara shot back this week by accusing Silverman of endorsing former council chairman Kwame R. Brown and council member Marion Barry (D-Ward 8) when she wrote the City Paper’s Loose Lips column in 2004.

“She has endorsed a whole bunch of people, and that impacts a heck of lot more people than being a delegate for Mitt Romney,” Mara said. “The folks who supported [politicians] locally have done a lot more harm to the District than Mitt Romney has.”

But it’s debatable whether Silverman really supported Brown, who resigned last year after pleading guilty to bank fraud, and Barry in 2004.

According to a review of Silverman’s past writings, she urged readers to support Brown in the general election. But in the Democratic primary earlier that year, Silverman was sharply critical of Brown and urged readers to support his opponent, Sam Brooks.

“In the election that really counted, I didn’t endorse Kwame,” Silverman said in an interview.

Mara’s charge that Silverman supported Barry also appears questionable. In the primary that year, Silverman wrote she “cannot support another Barry comeback, and neither should Ward 8 voters.” But after Barry won the primary, Silverman made what appears to be a light-hearted endorsement of the former mayor.

Barry was running against Republican Cardell Shelton, a perennial candidate with a thin record.

“LL picks unfit over absurd,” Silverman wrote.

Despite that back-handed nod to Barry, Silverman blasted Mara’s attempt to tie her to him.

“This is him trying to deflect off Pat Mara being a true Republican, not a liberal, fiscally sound one,” Silverman said. “There are plenty of Republicans I know who voted for Barack Obama because they did not think Mitt Romney reflected their Republican Party, but Pat helped get Mitt Romney on the ballot.”

Mara counters that city voters don’t care who a D.C. Council member supports in a national campaign.

“The beauty is, that really is the only thing they are attacking me for,” Mara said. “At the end of the day, who cares what people do at the national level.”"

Some Republicans want a delay on Chuck Hagel vote until more information is provided

Obama spokesman calls delaying tactics %22unconscionable%22

White House attorney sends letter to three senators about Benghazi events

Senate Republicans blocked a confirmation vote Thursday on Defense Secretary nominee Chuck Hagel, even as Democrats and the White House blasted the prospect of a historic filibuster.

""These delaying tactics are unconscionable and they should end right away,"" said White House spokesman Josh Earnest, adding that the nation and the world need a leader in the Pentagon as soon as possible.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., called a procedural vote Thursday to end debate and allow a vote on the nomination, but GOP opposition prevented him from getting the 60 votes necessary.

Republicans want to delay Hagel's nomination until after the President's Day recess but leading senators have pledged to allow an up or down vote when the Senate returns the week of Feb. 25.

""I will vote in favor of cloture on the day we get back,"" said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who echoed the majority view of GOP senators Thursday who said they would oppose any effort to end debate and vote on the nomination this week.

""Senators have questions -- we have a right to have answers,"" said Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn. ""I think in the end you should vote up or down on cabinet nominees, but I don't think you should prematurely cut off debate of the United States Secretary of Defense nomination two days after it comes out of committee.""

In protesting the delay, Reid noted there has never been a filibuster of a Defense secretary nominee, and he called the potential development ""shocking"" and ""tragic.""

Republicans senators said they have a variety of concerns and requests for more information.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., cited reports that Hagel said in a 2007 speech that the State Department was controlled by Israel. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has sought more information on Hagel's financial records.

Republicans have also sought more specific information from President Obama about the deadly Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya.

""We voted for Sen. Kerry on the same day because we were comfortable,"" Graham said. ""We are not all comfortable here. This is a controversial nominee and a party line vote. There is a desire to not end debate now.""

Hoping to coax some Republicans, the White House counsel's office sent a letter on Benghazi to three key Republican critics, Sens. Graham, John McCain of Arizona and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire.

The letter said that President Obama did not call Libyan President Mohamed Magariaf on the day of the Benghazi attack, Sept. 11, but had Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton call the Libyan leader; Obama spoke to Magariaf the next day, Sept. 12.

Throughout the confirmation process, some Republicans have criticized Hagel -- a former GOP senator from Nebraska -- by saying he has been too critical of Israel and too soft on Iran and its nuclear ambitions. Some also cited what they called Hagel's poor performance during his confirmation hearing.

That said, Graham predicted Hagel's eventual confirmation unless some ""bombshell"" emerges.

During his confirmation hearing, Hagel -- who would replace retiring Defense Secretary Leon Panetta -- said he supports Israel's national security, and would work to block Iran from obtaining the means to make a nuclear weapon.

Hagel clearly has the votes to be confirmed, Reid said, but Republicans are seeking excuses to delay this and other Obama initiatives. ""The pattern has been clear for months,"" Reid said, ""as soon as President Obama's administration responds to one request, Republicans devise another, more outlandish request.""

At the White House, officials said the Pentagon faces challenges that require a new Defense secretary.

Earnest noted that the military faces massive budget cuts as part of the $85 billion budget sequester set to take effect March 1 unless the White House and Congress reach a new debt reduction deal.

Global defense ministers are scheduled to meet in Brussels next week to discuss the Afghanistan withdrawal, Earnest said, and ""we need our new defense secretary to be there.""

The administration has consulted closely with senators from both parties on the Hagel nomination, Earnest said, including more than 10,000 pages of documents. ""Ten different congressional hearings on Benghazi in particular have been held,"" he said.

White House officials said Republicans are only re-litigating the debate over the Iraq War, which Hagel initially supported and then turned against.

Earnest pointed out that Hagel is a Republican now being blocked by Republicans, and that does not send ""a favorable signal"" to the world.

""It's difficult to explain to our allies exactly what's happening,"" Earnest said.

It was time, he told them, for him to speak to the nation about the Trayvon Martin verdict, and he had a pretty good idea what he wanted to say.

For the next 15 minutes, according to a senior aide, Mr. Obama spoke without interruption, laying out his message of why the not-guilty ruling had caused such pain among African-Americans, particularly young black men accustomed to arousing the kind of suspicion that led to the shooting death of Mr. Martin in a gated Florida neighborhood.

On Friday, reading an unusually personal, handwritten statement, Mr. Obama summed up his views with a single line: “Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago.”

That moment punctuated a turbulent week marked by dozens of phone calls to the White House from black leaders, angry protests that lit up the Internet and streets from Baltimore to Los Angeles, and anguished soul-searching by Mr. Obama. Aides say the president closely monitored the public reaction and talked repeatedly about the case with friends and family."

Mr. Christie wanted Mr. Rosenthal to vote for the map put forward by the Republicans on the commission, but instead he chose the Democrats’ plan, saying it offered more stability.

Under the proposal, applicants would be required to submit a drug test if they disclose that they have used illegal substances. The proposal was first introduced in the spring, but pressure from opponents led Gov. John Kasich to squash the bill in May. Virginia Republicans are also reviving a bill that was shelved earlier this year. The 2012 version failed after the state estimated it would cost $1.5 million to implement while only saving $229,000. The bill’s sponsor, Delegate Dickie Bell, has not introduced the updated version yet, but says he’s found more cost effective options.

Looking at the range of drug testing-for-benefits bills being pushed in state legislatures across the country, you almost have to suspect Republicans of some kind of urine fetish. In addition to all the states that are debating or have passed bills requiring people applying for unemployment insurance benefits to pee in cups, drug-testing bills aimed at welfare applicants are being introduced in three states. The specifics would be ripe for comedy if we weren't talking about a concerted effort by the powerful to stigmatize vulnerable people as drug addicts, as if that's the only reason a person might need help in an economy in which there are still more than three job-seekers for every job opening:Those would have to be some pretty damn significant changes to the cost structure to erase a nearly $1.25 million deficit. Virginia wasn't the first to run into that kind of problem; a Florida law mandating drug-testing of welfare applicants cost the state money because so few people's tests were positive, leaving the cost of the tests higher than the savings from denying people benefits. And that's leaving aside the cost of the lawsuits for a law that was ultimately found unconstitutional.

Both Ohio and Kansas legislators are trying to pretend the goal is to help people rather than to associate welfare recipients with drug abuse in the public debate, claiming that they just want to be sure people get the help they need. Bear in mind that in Florida, just 2.6 percent of applicants didn't pass their drug tests. So when you have Republican legislators who don't show any signs of wanting to help any kind of working-class or middle-class people, even, suddenly dripping with concern for welfare applicants ... well, you just have to call bullshit."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2013/05/29/king-katzenberg-crowned-obama,2013-05-29 00:00:00,['Breitbart News'],Report: Hollywood Mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg Gave $30 Million to Re-Elect Obama,"When the subject of Hollywood and President Barack Obama comes up, most people think of the celebrities who cut videos supporting the leader’s two runs for the White House.

Others might name check movie producer Harvey Weinstein, one of Obama’s most vocal backers.

They all pale in comparison to studio mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg of DreamWorks fame, who Mother Jones dubs the Kingmaker of the Democrat party. That hardly describes Katzenberg’s impact on two presidential elections, particularly the 2012 contest.

Katzenberg gave $3.15 million to Democratic super-PACs during the 2012 cycle–almost 30 times more than his total reported giving in 2008. (There’s no telling how much he might have given to other groups that don’t disclose their donors.) He steered millions more to Priorities–his friend and business partner, Steven Spielberg, gave $1 million, for instance. He hosted numerous fundraisers for Obama and raised more for the president than anyone else in California. All told, Katzenberg gave or raised more than $30 million to reelect Obama, helping Hollywood make up for Wall Street’s plummeting financial support of the president.

Of course, all that money means Katzenberg can get a few favors done when the need arises. And when his movie studio wanted to branch out into China, all those donations came in handy.

Obama officials say they respect Katzenberg not only for his fundraising, but also because he has no specific “ask”–no ambassadorship to Switzerland, no regulatory tweak, no nights in the Lincoln Bedroom. Even so, being Hollywood’s liaison to Washington has its perks: Obama takes Katzenberg’s calls, and he and his political adviser, Andy Spahn, visited the White House almost 50 times between them during Obama’s first term. (Not all of Spahn’s visits had to do with Katzenberg.) It has also left him well positioned to advocate for his industry’s and his company’s interests in China’s booming film market.

Hollywood stars like Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis deplore the impact of unfettered cash on the political process. They even made a movie about it–The Campaign.

Will they consider a sequel targeting King Katzenberg? Don’t count on it. Money is only evil when it props up the wrong (read: right) politicians."

""I remain excited about the future and the challenges ahead,"" he said, ""but the time has come to pass on the mantle of leadership.""

Perry, who has not ruled out another presidential run, added that he will ""pray and reflect and work to determine my own future path,"" during a San Antonio event with supporters billed last week as an announcement of ""exciting future plans.""

The Texas governor pledged to continue his work in Texas for the remainder of his term, focusing on his work at the helm of ""a strong pro-life, pro-family, pro-freedom state.""

“I will spend the next 18 months working to create more jobs, opportunity and innovation. I will actively lead this great state,” he said to applause.

Perry’s announcement comes almost 18 months after he ended his bid for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination, a campaign marred by the Texas governor’s much-ridiculed gaffes.

But since his previous presidential ambitions died out with a whisper in January of last year, Perry has worked to rebuild his national profile, pushing his home state’s pro-business agenda in a recent East Coast tour while leading a high-profile fight against legislators at home who support abortion rights.

The Texan, who underwent major back surgery just weeks before announcing his presidential run at a conservative confab in August 2012, has since attributed his rocky political performance to lingering health problems after the procedure. He’s also indicated regret at getting into the 2012 race much later than his competitors, leaving him little room for error in the early state jostling.

While his infamous inability to recall the three federal agencies he proposed to axe during a November primary debate was the most memorable of Perry’s mistakes, earlier mediocre debate performances and campaign infighting had taken the sheen off his once promising candidacy weeks before his “oops” moment.

Appearing on Fox News Sunday last weekend, Perry indicated that another presidential run was “an option out there” but declined to talk further about his political future.

On Monday, Perry said he would continue to concentrate on his home state as he completes his term.

""Any future considerations I will announce in due time, and I will arrive at that decision appropriately.,"" he said. ""But my focus will remain on Texas.”"

But though she is well-schooled in the basics -- firm handshake, straight-ahead manner and careful talking points -- Grimes launched her campaign without a website, position papers, staff or much of anything else.

Team Mitch unloaded with derision and precision, posting an online video portraying Grimes as Barack Obama's dancing partner (the president isn't popular in Kentucky) and a tree-hugging foe of the state's powerful coal industry.

But a Senate race is a long-distance affair, especially in Kentucky, where polls show that McConnell, the Senate minority leader, is weak, at a time when voters everywhere despise Congress and Washington. And now in the second furlong, evidence is beginning to emerge that Grimes may turn into a surprisingly formidable foe for a man who is more than twice her age.

In her first major appearance before national party leaders, Saturday on Martha's Vineyard, Grimes wowed Democratic senators, Senate candidates and donors alike at the party's annual private summer fundraising retreat.

Each year the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee invites top donors to schmooze with senators, especially those up for reelection, and inspect the merchandise of challengers who will take on Republican incumbents.

Grimes spoke to the group Saturday morning and brought the jaded and normally undemonstrative crowd to its feet in wild applause, said one top donor, who had been deeply skeptical of the idea that McConnell could be knocked off by anyone. He and another attendee spoke to The Huffington Post on the condition that their names not be used.

Grimes' feisty talk, the sources said, mixed a commitment to a Democratic job-creation agenda with a pedal-to-the-metal attack on McConnell.

""I've been going to these for years, and I have never, until this morning, seen a candidate get a standing O,"" said the donor, who is among the top 100 contributors to the committee over the last five years. ""It was amazing.""

Clearly, dislike of McConnell -- a shrewd, remorseless combatant in the Senate and in GOP circles nationally -- is one reason why Grimes was so well-received in Martha's Vineyard. It's also well-known that former President Bill Clinton, who is close to Grimes' father, encouraged her to enter the race.

But another reason that she was a hit, an attendee said, was that she exceeded expectations with a good speech, strong presence and youthful appeal. ""She's attractive, by the way,"" the donor said. ""Doesn't hurt."""

If the situation were a movie, one donor said, it would be titled: “He’s Just Not That Into You.”

Now, with political givers viewing the McAuliffe campaign as a way to curry favor should Hillary Rodham Clinton decide to run for president in 2016, the chatter among the donor class is about the striking contrast between the Obama and Clinton approaches.

“It’s a whole different shtick,” said Arthur L. Schechter, a Houston-based lawyer whose support for Mr. Clinton led to an ambassadorship in the Bahamas and who has also raised money for Mr. Obama. ""The Clintons have a way of making people feel like they’re part of something and important to what’s going on, and I found that lacking in the Obama team,"" he added.

Several donors declined to speak for attribution because they did not want to anger the president. One called Mr. Obama’s White House holiday events “cuckoo clock parties,” because “he comes down, gives a speech, poses for some photos and pops back inside.”

David Plouffe, who served as Mr. Obama’s campaign manager in 2008, said the ethos of fund-raising started with Mr. Obama’s earliest donors in 2007. “It was about the campaign and the mission, not what they would get out of it,” he said. “That may be unusual, but it was a privilege to witness and it was successful.”"

“I know from past experience that the gentleman is all hat and no cattle,” O’Malley said of Perry during a pre-dinner reception at a Maryland Democratic Party gala in Greenbelt.

In advance of Perry’s visit, a Texas group has started airing radio and television ads in Maryland knocking O’Malley for raising taxes and inviting Maryland companies to consider coming to a more business-friendly state. Perry narrates the ads.

“We’re going to treat him with great Maryland hospitality, and then we’re going to give his high hat the high hand and send him packing,” O’Malley told the reception crowd.

About three hours later, when O’Malley’s turn came to address the Democratic dinner, Perry was still on his mind.

The Maryland governor rattled off a series of statistical measures on which Maryland fares better than Texas, including median income, poverty rates and upward mobility.

O’Malley also shared with the crowd of more than 600 that he had once debated Perry, a reference to a 2011 forum hosted by Politico. At the time, O’Malley was chairman of the Democratic Governors Association and Perry was leading the Republican Governors Association.

Michael Wilson in the picture above, with myself and Anthony, served on the Vallejo City council and ran for California Assembly in 2010.



Michael Wilson is a sitting member of the Vallejo City Council and a candidate for the State Assembly in the 7th District. Michael is a strong progressive Democrat who has a fair-minded business background – making him well suited to deal with the financial insolvency within Vallejo and the State’s fiscal crisis. His primary political engagement for the past several years has also been a personal fight. He and his husband Peter have been fighting for same sex marriage rights. In 2008 they had a wedding performed by Senator Patricia Wiggins. The courts upheld their marriage, but because of Prop 8 other gay couples do not have the same right to a wedding certificate. From his website for his 2010 Assembly run: Wilson For Assembly 2010

Congratulations to Katy Miessner, and I'm looking forward to working in her capacity as member of the Vallejo City Council. Katy is a good Democrat and has been a strong voice in Vallejo for human rights and fiscal responsibility. In upcoming diaries I will continue to blog about this election where mostly all Democrats were running.

His Column About Congress', 'Pkcapitol', 'Appears Throughout The Week']","McConnell, Republicans gear up for 2014 with hopes of taking control of the Senate","Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the number of seats Democrats will be defending in 2016. It will be 10, not 20. This version has been corrected.

A GOP-friendly electoral map, along with a spate of retirements among red-state Democratic senators, has once again favorably positioned Republicans to take control of the Senate in 2014.

But Republican operatives are working feverishly to ensure that the bitter split between the party establishment and insurgent tea party conservatives does not lead to a squandered opportunity and GOP disappointment for the third consecutive cycle of elections.

Democrats must defend 21 seats in 2014, including six in states that President Obama lost in 2012 by double-digit margins, while Republicans are defending 14. In addition, veteran Democrats John D. Rockefeller IV (W. Va.), Carl Levin (Mich.) and Tom Harkin (Iowa) — whose appeal at the ballot box will be hard for their party to replace — are retiring.

Republicans need to pick up six seats to retake the majority they lost in 2006, and recent history suggests that the task is doable, if difficult. More concerning for Republicans, however, is whether they will again have to endure nasty primaries that produce either triumphant insurgents with limited appeal or establishment survivors who underperform with conservative voters in the general election.

There are already declared and potential candidates that the GOP establishment sees as less than desirable, including Reps. Paul C. Broun and Phil Gingrey of Georgia, Rep. Steve King (Iowa), Rep. Justin Amash (Mich.) and former congressman Jeffrey M. Landry (La.).

Senate Republicans have conducted an internal review of their recent failures to better prepare themselves for the pitfalls ahead, both in defending incumbents and in playing offense in winnable races.

The review is similar to the “autopsy” that the Republican National Committee performed after Mitt Romney’s disappointing loss to Obama last year.

The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) surveyed candidates, staff and consultants involved in 20 Senate races over the past three elections. The single biggest problem identified was poor communication support in dealing with the fast pace of modern campaigns, GOP strategists said.

For example, when candidates made gaffes in debates or local interviews, it would sometimes take days to repair the damage. The NRSC dispatched senior media advisers from Washington to stumbling campaigns in places such as North Dakota and Wisconsin in 2012 and Nevada and Kentucky in 2010.

They lost three of those races, and the NRSC postmortem determined that by the time the top advisers got to the states, it was too late to fix the problems. In 2014, they hope to avoid falling behind and to use the disparity in the number of seats up for grabs to their advantage.

2012 surprise

But for Democrats, playing defense will be nothing new.

In November, they had to defend 23 of the 33 Senate seats up for grabs in 2012. They could afford to lose only four seats to maintain a majority, and several of their veterans retired after long runs representing conservative states.

But instead of losing ground, Democrats gained seats —which seemed unthinkable in March 2011 — by holding all 23 and picking off two from Republicans.

Moreover, in the past four elections, just two Democrats lost reelection bids, while 12 GOP incumbents fell.

The NRSC is planning at least eight boot camps for staff in states with competitive races. Kevin McLaughlin, a veteran operative hired to work with campaign staff around the country, will run the communications schools with an eye toward preventing mishaps. He will also be in charge of a kind of campaign fire department, charged with quickly putting out blazes once mistakes are made.

NRSC officials say they are also taking a new approach to contested primaries.

In 2010, the committee endorsed preferred candidates, only to see five of them defeated. In 2012, the NRSC chose to make no endorsements and provided only behind-the-scenes guidance to its preferred candidates.

This time, the committee intends to stay neutral unless a particularly undesirable nominee begins to emerge. In addition, if Democratic groups wade into GOP primaries to help a candidate they deem weaker and easier to beat, the NRSC promises to fight back.

This neutrality approached will be vigorously tested in several places. Already, former South Dakota governor Mike Rounds and Rep. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia — early establishment front-runners to claim seats being vacated by retiring Democrats — are being targeted by GOP outside groups that say they are not conservative enough despite having no declared opponents. The Club for Growth has made it known that it doesn’t like Capito, and the Senate Conservatives Fund announced Tuesday that it will seek an alternative to Rounds.

At the same time, conservatives recoiled at the news that legendary GOP strategist Karl Rove was starting a group to challenge their influence and to nominate more “electable,” candidates.

Mitch McConnell

In 2012, Republicans needed just three seats and a Romney victory to take control of the Senate but came up short. Instead, Democrats got a chance to boost their margin going into 2014 and are eyeing 2016, when they think the election map will finally tilt in their favor; Republicans will be defending 24 seats to the Democrats’ 10.

For Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, 2014 may be his chance to realize a 50-year-old dream of becoming majority leader, and one of the key races that will decide that question is his reelection contest in Kentucky.

Should McConnell, 71, cruise to a sixth term without a real primary challenge from the right, it could signal that Republicans have broken the spell of their damaging internal feuds and are positioned for the majority.

Democrats, however, are betting that McConnell is vulnerable to the kind of conservative primary challenge that has hobbled the GOP in recent elections.

This week, the much anticipated Democratic candidacy of actress Ashley Judd fizzled as she abandoned the race before it started. With Judd out, Democrats are turning to Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, 34, whose father was state Democratic chairman and a friend of former president Bill Clinton.

Still the most important Kentucky politician of his generation, McConnell is already running hard against whoever eventually emerges to challenge him.

In 2011 and 2012, when he wasn’t even up for reelection, McConnell raised more than $7.5 million — as much money as his Kentucky colleague, Rand Paul (R), spent in his entire 2010 Senate race. That Paul win was a tea party triumph that signaled its ascendancy against the establishment. McConnell, for his 2014 race, has hired Paul’s campaign manager, Jesse Benton, to help navigate the tea party waters during his reelection effort. As a whole, the party has decided it needs to take similar action beyond Kentucky if it is to press its numbers advantage over Democrats.

“We’d rather be us than them, but . . . it’s early, and it’s incumbent upon us to capitalize on the opportunity,” said Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for the NRSC.

NJ) in the special election against Newark Mayor Cory Booker (D. NJ) on Wednesday:

http://www.buzzfeed.com/...



In the final weeks of the race, Lonegan has increasingly sought that momentum from the Tea Party, a loud but likely small block of voters in a state that has voted for Democratic presidents since 1992 and Democratic senators since 1979. The event Saturday was just past the Ocean County line, one of New Jersey’s reliably conservative areas; Mitt Romney, John McCain, and George W. Bush all did well in this South Jersey Republican stronghold. The crowd, receptive to Lonegan’s stump speech lines about the Revolutionary War, hawked standard-fare Tea Party flags in the air — “Don’t Tread on Me” and “Liberty or Death” were two — and held up signs that called for the president’s impeachment. A singer who took the stage before the speakers to perform live warned attendees of a possible “U.S.S. of A” — the United Socialist States of America. “They’ll own our banks, our healthcare too. They’ll own our houses, they’ll own our food. They’ll own the cars we all will drive, they’ll own every aspect of our lives,” she crooned. “They’re takin’ away our liberty, it’s a nightmare, don’t you see?” The event, Lonegan’s biggest yet, was sponsored in part by the bus tour group, Tea Party Express, and by Palin’s political action committee, Sarah PAC. Lonegan, who also received endorsements from Sen. Rand Paul and Gov. Rick Perry last month, has more recently focused his campaign on the partisan gridlock in Washington that shutdown the federal government two weeks ago. In a debate with Booker last week, Lonegan said he’d “like to see the government open,” but at the racetrack, he had a different message. “Tell Republicans in Washington, D.C., to hold the line,” Lonegan said, speaking before Palin. “Hold the line! Hold the line! Hold the line!” Palin downplayed the negative impacts of the shutdown. “They’re callin’ it the government shutdown — I think it should be called the slim-down,” she said during her 15-minute speech. “Because really it’s only 17 percent of our bloated, burdensome, out-of-control federal government that has even slowed down this week.” - BuzzFeed, 10/13/13

But the best part of the rally was Palin's ""Oops, I did it again"" moment:

http://www.opposingviews.com/...



According to Buzzfeed.com, while speaking to a crowd of two thousand people at the New Egypt Speedway in New Jersey on Saturday, Palin yelled, “We need a leader not a tweeter! That was poem-worthy!"" ""Leader not Tweeter,"" was written on one of Palin's hands, tweeted Buzzfeed.com writer Ruby Cramer. “New Jersey, just know that the eyes of America are on you right now,” stated Palin. “Something big is happening here. And it’s exactly clear, it’s called momentum.” However, Newark, N.J. Mayor Cory Booker (D) is leading Lonegan by 53-41 percent, according to a recent poll by Quinnipiac University. During his Saturday rally, Lonegan expressed his support with the unpopular government shutdown: ""Tell Republicans in Washington, D.C., to hold the line. Hold the line! Hold the line! Hold the line!” - Opposing Views, 10/13/13

Oh Sarah, you truly are the gift that keeps on giving. What's also funny is while Lonegan is cheering on the shutdown, Palin was trying to shift blame from the Republicans:

http://www.nj.com/...



""Bottom line, guys: The politicians are using the military as pawns,"" she added.

""Thank you for you being here. You who have the Jersey fight — you who are here for love of country,"" she said, to cheers and applause. - The Star-Ledger, 10/12/13

Meanwhile, Booker remains the favorite on Wednesday night to win but he's not taking any chances. He's been hitting back at Lonegan's former lead campaign aide, Rick Shaftan's ridiculous rant about Booker's Twitter conversation with a Portland stripper:

http://talkingpointsmemo.com/...



Shaftan's ribald diatribe was the latest in a series of intense attacks on Booker from the Lonegan campaign, which has accused him of having owned a ""crackhouse"" in Newark, mocked him for being effeminate, and criticized him from focusing more on becoming a celebrity than on his constituents. Speaking to TPM on the campaign bus, Booker accused Lonegan of running a race consistently filled with ""nastiness."" ""I didn't know Steve Lonegan at all. My staff had to remind me, my first knowledge of him was when he, on Martin Luther King Day, did a protest. Chose that day to do a protest on the front steps of City Hall against affirmative action,"" said Booker. ""But it didn't take long for the campaign to start. It was first with that tweet and calling sections of my city, I can't remember the nations he picked. ... Next thing you know, I have him saying that you're not a real man. ... This has been a constant theme for him of this kind of stuff."" Along with statements seemingly designed to raise questions about Booker's sexuality, on several occasions, the Lonegan campaign has painted Newark as a crime-ridden urban nightmare. These jabs included the aforementioned tweet, which showed a map labeling some of Newark's poorer neighborhoods as third world countries. They also included a comment Lonegan made during a debate last week referring to Newark as a ""big black hole,"" and a press conference where Lonegan promised to ""address the interests of suburban New Jerseyans"" that he said Booker ""ignores."" At his first speech Saturday in Newark, Booker accused Lonegan of exploiting ""tired tropes."" ""When I stood up there in the last debate and he referred to Newark as, I think it was a black hole or a big black hole ... where he talked about dead bodies in the river, floating in the river. ... With all the things that are going on in our city for the positive, to have somebody there disrespect our city. ... It was painful for me as one of the city fathers to have somebody talk about the community that they love,"" Booker said. ""But worse than that, they were playing into these tired tropes that there are many different New Jerseys. You know, there are some people that say there's an urban New Jersey and a suburban New Jersey. Some people say there's a minority New Jersey and a non-minority. Some people would say that there's a South Jersey and a North Jersey. Some people even say there's a Republican New Jersey and a Democrat New Jersey. Well, anybody who's fought in this battle like we all have knows one truth fundamentally; we are one state, with one destiny, and we all need each other, and that's how we get strong."" - TPM, 10/12/13

Booker's also been out on the campaign trail slamming Lonegan and the GOP government shutdown:

http://newyork.cbslocal.com/...



Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez joined Booker on Sunday. As WCBS 880′s Jim Smith reported, Booker told a crowd at the annual Bergen and Passaic Counties Hispanic Rally that New Jersey voters have a special opportunity by voting during the government shutdown. “We’re the only election for the United States Congress that is happening during this shutdown,” he said. Booker said New Jersey voters can “endorse the tea party and their shutdown politics” or say, “No, not here in New Jersey, not in this nation.” Wasserman-Schultz said voters should help make sure the tea party is “squelched.” “We are apparently, not any closer, to reopening the government,” she said. - CBS New York, 10/13/13

This is good becuase Booker for a long time avoided attacking Lonegan but had a missteps along the campaign trail:

http://tv.msnbc.com/...



The shift, to many observers, was a clear sign of worry, especially when New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s Political Action Committee stepped in to spend $1 million for ads in support of Booker. Many Democrats have privately grumbled that missteps, including some self-inflicted wounds, have opened up opportunities Lonegan has exploited. The Democrat was dinged late last month after it was revealed he had exchanged direct messages with an Oregon stripper. Booker said it was just part of his active social media life, and he hadn’t scrutinized her profile. The accuracy of other anecdotes he’s used on the trail, including a story of a former drug dealer, “T-Bone,” he later befriended, have been called into question. Booker’s also faced questions over his stake in an internet video company and payouts he received from his former law firm, who got contracts with the city. Booker’s campaign says the race was always going to tighten, and said the drop in polls was only natural. “When we looked at this race early on there was a level of support among Republicans that, in this environment, was not going to be sustainable,” said Booker spokesman Kevin Griffis. While Booker may have put this race at least within Lonegan’s grasp, the conservative activist is no Scott Brown — or even Chris Christie, who he challenged from the right in the 2009 gubernatorial primary. Lonegan hasn’t poised himself as able to take advantage of a Democrat’s missteps in a special election with such a conservative record in the solidly blue Garden State. - MSNBC, 10/13/13

""We have interviewed a lot of candidates this year and Matt Bevin is one of the very best. He's principled, passionate, and has Ted Cruz-like courage,” said Matt Hoskins, the group’s executive director, referring to Cruz, the U.S. senator from Texas, who led the fight to shut down government in an effort to defund the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

After the Republican New Jersey Senate candidate she supported lost Wednesday night, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin suggested that Kentucky might be her next project. [...] ""We're going to shake things up in 2014,"" Palin wrote. ""Rest well tonight, for soon we must focus on important House and Senate races. Let's start with Kentucky —which happens to be awfully close to South Carolina, Tennessee, and Mississippi — from sea to shining sea we will not give up. We've only just begun to fight.""

The Senate Conservatives Fund, a conservative political action committee founded by Heritage CEO Jim DeMint when he was in the U.S. Senate, has endorsed Kentucky businessman Matt Bevin, who is running a tea party challenge against Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in the Kentucky GOP Senate primary next May. Louisville Courier-Journal: So, if Kentucky Republicans are looking for the second coming of Ted Cruz, SCF says Matt Bevin is their man. And it appears as though he'll make his case with Sarah Palin on his side (emphasis added):Palin didn't specifically mention Bevin, but it's clear from the context that she was talking about endorsing him. As far primaries are concerned, Palin's 2012 track record was decent—she made five endorsements in contested Senate primaries and her preferred candidate won in four of those cases, though she also endorsed Newt Gingrich's presidential campaign, and we all know how that turned out.

Bevin has yet to show any major fundraising or polling success, but he has been willing to put at least some of his money into the campaign—he's loaned more than a half-million dollars so far to his effort. Still, there's six months to go before the primary, and primaries tend to not take shape until the last few weeks of the campaign, so even though Mitch McConnell claims he's focused on Democratic candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes (who leads McConnell in the latest polling) it's clear he's still got a primary race ahead of him."
http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/12/02/landrieu-under-attack-for-filibuster-vote/,2013-12-02 00:00:00,"['Tampa Tim', 'Rudy Nyc', 'The', 'Compassionate', 'Gop Solution', 'Posted By']",Landrieu under attack for filibuster vote,"7 years ago

(CNN) - A conservative group says it's spending six figures over the next two weeks to run a TV commercial in Louisiana that criticizes Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu over her support of Presidential Barack Obama's judicial nominees.

""Mary Landrieu voted for every one of Obama's liberal activist judges,"" the narrator says in the 30-second spot by the Judicial Crisis Network.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='psteinhausercnn']

The group also goes after Landrieu, who could face a challenging re-election next year, for supporting a measure that lowered the threshold for ending Republican-led filibusters in the Senate.

""Landrieu even helped change the rules to pack a key court with new liberal judges who will review Obamacare, the EPA, the IRS, and agencies Obama is using to push his unconstitutional job killing agenda,"" adds the narrator.

Under the old rules, it took 60 votes to break a filibuster of presidential nominees. The change means a simple Senate majority of 51 now suffices in the chamber that Democrats currently control with a 55-45 majority. The change affects presidential executive nominations such as ambassadors and agency heads, along with judicial nominations except for Supreme Court nominees. It does not include filibusters of legislation.

""The latest blatantly false attack ad by the Judicial Crisis Network attacks Sen. Landrieu for voting to confirm judicial nominees, whom were confirmed with bipartisan majorities, while shockingly claiming that Landrieu voted to confirm two nominees that never received a vote, and were never even confirmed,"" said an email by Landrieu's campaign, in response to the new commercial.

""The ad goes on to accuse Sen. Landrieu of packing the court with liberal judges, another completely false claim that has already been slammed once by Politifact as 'false.' ""

This is the second recent ad by the Judicial Crisis Network to go after a vulnerable Democratic Senator up for re-election in 2014 in a Republican-leaning state. They went up with a spot last month that targeted Sen. Mark Pryor of neighboring Arkansas.

(CNN) - Democratic Senate Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin is making clear he is fed up with Republicans dragging their feet on Chuck Hagel's nomination for Defense Secretary, and now says he will schedule a vote soon, even over Republican opposition.

""We can't not vote because there is dissatisfaction on the part of people because that could be endless,"" said Levin, D-Michigan.



""We're going to schedule a vote as soon as we're ready to have a vote.""

[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Levin, who had hoped to vote as early as Thursday, put it off after more than two dozen Republicans pressed Hagel to provide additional financial information about corporations and other organizations he's been associated with since leaving Congress.

""He's been asked for things no prior candidate has been asked for,"" Levin said. ""He has provided all the financial information the rules of the committee require.""

Levin said he will send a letter to those Republicans informing them of his view and then schedule a vote.

Levin said he is ""confident"" Hagel will be confirmed and complained Republicans are trying to use their ""imagination"" and ""political creativity"" to block Hagel.

""The ranking member said he would do everything he can to stop the nomination. So, I take it this is one of the things he's doing to stop the nomination,"" Levin said, referring to Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma.

Hagel is on Capitol Hill Thursday meeting with as many as seven Democratic senators, a source familiar with the confirmation told CNN. The meetings were long planned and did not come as a result of the decision not to hold the committee vote today.

Among the senators who met with Hagel are: Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Tom Harkin of Iowa.

By the end of the week, Hagel will have met with about 75 senators to press his case, the source said.

No surprise that Democrats would be focusing 2014 efforts on Michele Bachmann.

That means running ads on the airwaves and online, as well as working social networks and local media in advance of the general election. [...] Democratic super PACs played an influential role in 2012, but only later in the cycle as their fundraising accelerated and their political operations ramped up to full speed. This is the first campaign in which super PACs on the Democratic side will have the opportunity to play at this scale so early in the election cycle.

Republican gerrymandering means it's going to be hard for Democrats to take back the House in 2014. And that in turn means that if Democrats are going to have any chance to do it, they can't just relax until later in the cycle—the campaign against potentially vulnerable Republicans has to keep going. Which is what House Majority PAC is planning, announcing an initial target list of 10 Republican House members:The campaign will target Colorado's Mike Coffman, New York's Michael Grimm, Minnesota's Michele Bachmann and John Kline, Illinois' Rodney Davis, Pennsylvania's Mike Fitzpatrick, Nevada's Joe Heck, Ohio's David Joyce, Florida's Steve Southerland, and California's Gary Miller. Bachmann, of course, needs no introduction. Coffman is a birther who took less than 48 percent in a district that went for Barack Obama. Grimm has had some seriously questionable finances and his district rather unexpectedly went for Obama. Gary Miller is in a Democratic-leaning, heavily Latino district but managed to have no Democratic opposition in the general thanks to California's top-two primary system.

There is as yet no more specific word on what House Majority PAC will be doing in these districts and when—no example of an ad and information on the size of the buy, for instance—but the group says this is just an initial list that will be expanded through the cycle."

(CNN) —

I bet that Paul Ryan is not typically serenaded by mariachis.

But then, this week was anything but typical for the Republican congressman from Wisconsin.

Ryan traveled to Chicago–and across the aisle–to appear alongside Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, perhaps Congress’ most vocal proponent of immigration reform.

Courtesy San Diego Union Tribune Ruben Navarrette Jr.

The two men gave a joint presentation at the City Club of Chicago, where – even in that bluest of blue cities – the business friendly audience probably favors many of Ryan’s economic policies.

Before that, the two lawmakers went into a Hispanic neighborhood to meet with activists, members of the clergy and immigrant advocates. It was there that the mariachis greeted them. In the crowd, a man appreciatively held up a banner with Ryan’s photo on it and the words: “Gracias, Ryan.”

For immigration reform advocates, there is a lot for which to be thankful these days. At a time when more and more Republicans in Congress are expressing skepticism about a Senate bill that combines border security with a guest worker program and legal status for the undocumented, Ryan is doubling down on his support. He thinks the current system is failing us. He told the crowd that what we’re doing now is bad for national security, bad for business, bad for communities and bad for families.

Right you are, congressman. On all counts.

During the visit, Ryan told reporters: “I would say for the sake of our national security, we want to modernize our immigration laws. We do not even know how to track people who overstay their visas. We need a modern immigration system that helps us not only protect our border but protects national security in all of its aspects. So if anything, I would say this is an argument for modernizing our immigration laws. We need it for national security, we need it for our economy.”

And when Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, talks about the economy, he is on familiar terrain.

“If you take a look at contributions that immigrants make to society … it produces faster economic growth, which brings in more revenue to the federal government,” he said. “So if you look at this issue in its totality, immigration is a net positive contributor to the economy.”

The congressman also knows his way around the immigration issue. In 2005, as Gutierrez reminded the crowd, Ryan co-sponsored an immigration reform bill in the House that was ultimately voted down. He has said he is especially concerned that employers, including the kinds of farmers and ranchers who populate his home state, have access to the labor they need to stay in business.

In fact, over the last decade, Ryan has supported or co-sponsored what the anti-immigrant group, NUMBERS USA, disdainfully called “various amnesties to give illegal aliens a path to citizenship.” It’s one reason that the group – which advocates both an end to illegal immigration and a dramatic reduction in legal immigration, to pre-1965 levels – gave Ryan’s career in Congress a “C.” That grade puts him in the bottom 10% of all current Republican members of Congress, according to the group’s executive director, Roy Beck. And, conversely, it puts him in the top 10%, as far as many Latinos are concerned. You see, it only helps build Ryan’s “street cred” that he’s not popular with groups that attract so many anti-Latino nativists.

The 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee is almost certain to run for the top job in 2016 as part of what could turn out to be a crowded field. Other contenders for the Republican presidential nomination could include Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.

With that kind of lineup, you can expect immigration to be a top issue in the GOP primary. Rubio is the de facto spokesman for the 844-page comprehensive immigration reform bill cobbled together by the Senate’s “gang of eight.” Cruz is a vocal critic of the plan. Lately, Jeb Bush seems to have cornered the market on just about every position imaginable on a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants.

Ryan needs to get his ducks in a row. Was this week’s trip to Chicago the kick-off of his 2016 Hispanic outreach efforts? If so, will it work?

It could, if it is followed up by other visits and more speeches and continued attention to Latino concerns. It’s a start. If Ryan talks less, and listens more, he’ll stand out from other politicians and could impress Latino voters as someone whose interests, on some issues, align with theirs.

The GOP is doing a lot of soul-searching these days trying to figure out how to get Latinos to show them some love. There are strategy sessions and focus groups and smarty-pants consultants with their pie charts and bar graphs. But folks make this stuff harder than it really is.

In the world of Latino outreach, sometimes, it’s the little things that count for a lot. Like a Republican congressman from Wisconsin taking an unexpected detour to say his piece and pay his respects to a constituency poorly served by both parties, despite the likelihood that he’ll be hammered by some in his own party.

Like the man said – Gracias, Ryan.

http://news.yahoo.com/texas-senator-ted-cruz-blazing-trail-washington-060210411.html,,[],New Texas Senator Ted Cruz blazing a trail in Washington,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - For new U.S. senators, the drill typically goes something like this: Keep quiet once you arrive in Washington, learn how things work and then begin asserting yourself. That is not exactly the path Ted Cruz is taking. He has been in office for barely six weeks, but already the senator from Texas, a favorite of the conservative Tea Party movement, has shown a provocative, in-your-face style that has won him criticism and praise. Cruz, 42, has been chided by Democrats and even fellow Republicans who say he trampled Senate etiquette during contentious hearings in which he went after former Republican Senator Chuck Hagel, Democratic President Barack Obama's nominee for defense secretary. While some Republican leaders have sought to broaden the party's appeal with a more moderate tone on a range of issues, Cruz has unabashedly - and often dramatically - cast himself as a hard-line conservative with a distaste for compromise. He was one of only three senators to vote against Secretary of State John Kerry's confirmation, and sponsored a doomed-to-fail bill to repeal Obama's healthcare overhaul, which some conservatives view as socialized medicine. Cruz voted against both a Hurricane Sandy relief package and raising the government's debt ceiling. Cruz, the son of a Cuban immigrant, has also expressed ""deep concerns"" about a bipartisan Senate plan to give many of the nation's 11 million illegal immigrants a possible path to U.S. citizenship. All of which have made Cruz an intriguing player in Washington at a time when some Republicans are emphasizing social programs and compassionate immigration policies to try to win over Hispanics, who voted overwhelmingly for Obama in the November election. Cruz's early influence in Washington was evident on Tuesday, when a Senate committee hearing on Hagel's nomination as defense secretary essentially became a discussion of Cruz's tactics. In recent weeks, Cruz has suggested that Hagel's nomination was endorsed by Iran, and that Hagel was not being forthcoming enough about his finances. Before the Democratic-led Senate Armed Services Committee voted to back Hagel's confirmation on Tuesday on a party-line, 14-11 vote, Cruz angered lawmakers in both parties by suggesting, without giving evidence, that Hagel might have taken money from countries such as North Korea. That drew a rebuke from Democratic Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, who said Cruz had ""gone over the line."" It also prompted a warning to Cruz from a fellow Republican, John McCain of Arizona, who had sharply questioned Hagel during the hearings and was about to vote against Hagel's nomination. ""No one on this committee at any time should impugn his character or his integrity,"" McCain said of Hagel, a fellow veteran of the Vietnam War. 'A POLITICAL PHENOMENON' Cruz's aggressive approach has made him a favorite conversation piece in Washington, where headlines in recent days have referred to him as an ""attack dog"" and a ""chicken hawk"" - a term used by critics for those who take a strong pro-defense stance but have served little or no time in the armed forces. CNN broadcaster Wolf Blitzer chided Cruz during an interview about the need to compromise. MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, a former Republican congressman from Florida, refused to utter Cruz's name while denouncing the senator's questioning of Hagel at his confirmation hearing as a ""clown show."" Cruz, who declined through an aide to be interviewed for this story, has been unapologetic. ""I view all of that as a sign that maybe we're doing something right,"" he said recently on conservative Glenn Beck's radio show. Cruz's ambition and no-holds-barred style have made him a hero among conservative activists and raised talk that Cruz - like Florida Senator Marco Rubio, another Hispanic rising star among Republicans - might run for president as soon as 2016. ""He's a political phenomenon, and he has managed to become a national figure in a very short period of time,"" said Steve Munisteri, chairman of the Texas Republican Party. ""I have no doubt that a year from now, virtually every Republican activist in the country will know who Ted Cruz is."" But some analysts said Cruz's confrontational approach also put him at risk of being marginalized and portrayed as a political bomb thrower in a gridlocked Congress. ""He talks about issues from an ideological perspective. But has shown no sign of being someone who could sit down and work out a solution to a complicated problem,"" said political scientist Cal Jillson of Southern Methodist University in Dallas. Norm Ornstein, a congressional analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, said Cruz had been pushing the limits on standards of behavior in the tradition-bound Senate. GRASS-ROOTS SUPPORT ""In the modern, cable television-talk radio media age, the more outrageous you are, the more attention you get,"" Ornstein said. ""And Cruz is no dummy. He's a smart, articulate guy. You'll be seeing and hearing him a lot."" Cruz captured his Senate seat after upsetting Texas Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst, the choice of the state party establishment, in the Republican primary. That followed months of political spade work at small county meetings around the state that won Cruz a dedicated grass-roots following. ""I see Ted as someone who gives a voice and representation to people like me, who feel like they have had no voice and no power,"" said Katrina Pierson, founder of the Grassroots Texans Network and a board member of the Dallas Tea Party, who was an early Cruz supporter. But Cruz, a Harvard Law School graduate who was a clerk for former Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist and served as Texas solicitor general, has also built bridges with more established Republicans eager to court the party's conservative wing and promote a rising Hispanic star. Party leaders gave him a plum speaking slot at last year's national convention, and sought-after appointments to the Senate Judiciary and Armed Services committees once he was elected. They also made him vice chairman of the Senate Republican campaign arm, which will recruit and back candidates in the 2014 elections. The top two Senate Republicans, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and John Cornyn of Texas, both hope to avoid primary challenges from conservatives next year and have sought to strengthen their relationships with Cruz. Cruz accompanied McConnell on a congressional visit to Israel and Afghanistan last month and won an admirer in the process. McConnell told the National Review Online afterward that Cruz was ""ready for prime time on day one, which is pretty unusual for somebody who just got sworn in."" Republican leaders also have been eager for Cruz, whose father was born in Cuba and came to Texas in 1957, to help them gain support among Hispanics. But Cruz refused to back a bipartisan Senate immigration plan, putting him at odds with Rubio and with the views of most Hispanics, who polls show support a broad path to citizenship. ""To allow those who came here illegally to be placed on such a path is both inconsistent with the rule of law and profoundly unfair to the millions of legal immigrants who waited years, if not decades, to come to America legally,"" Cruz said in a statement after the Senate immigration plan was made public. Trey Martinez Fischer, a Democratic state representative in Texas and head of the state's Mexican-American Legislative Caucus said Cruz represented the ""extreme conservative, highly partisan"" wing of the Republican Party. ""I would caution anybody who looks to Senator Cruz as a role model for Hispanics,"" Martinez Fischer said. ""There is a difference between being the Hispanic candidate and being the candidate who happens to be Hispanic. He's the latter."" (Editing by David Lindsey and Peter Cooney)"

Thursday, with over 100,000 supportive signatures from the Daily Kos community in hand, I was in the audience at the U.S. Capitol while Sen. Harry Reid gave his victory speech following the successful nuking of the filibuster.

As epic as it was to defeat Joe Lieberman seven years ago, Thursday's gutting of the filibuster was a much bigger victory for the progressive netroots. Here's why:

The key similarity

What makes primarying Joe Lieberman over his support for the Iraq war and nuking the filibuster both epic netroots victories is that both campaigns were conceived and incubated entirely within the progressive blogosphere and netroots.

When they started in 2005 and 2009 respectively, no one in traditional media, establishment progressive advocacy, or the Democratic leadership considered these campaigns to be in the realm of the possible (often, not even within the bounds of polite conversation). It was just a bunch of cheeto-munching bloggers and professional left types who embraced the ideas and slowly pushed them into the mainstream.

The key difference

In 2006, when Joe Lieberman returned to the Senate following his defeat in the primary, he was famously given a standing ovation by his Democratic colleagues.

Yesterday, the entire national Democratic congressional leadership, the heads of several major progressive advocacy organizations, and numerous big-time center-left media types were on hand to give Harry Reid a standing ovation for nuking the filibuster. Here is the video I took of that ovation with my phone:

This time, despite suffering repeated setbacks over several years, we eventually broughtin the Democratic - progressive ecosystem with us.

The result will be thoroughgoing, long-lasting change as the doors to the judicial branch of government are finally unlocked and thrown open to progressives. All the destructive court decisions we have recently suffered through on reproductive rights, on rights at work, on Citizens United, on the Voting Rights Act, on making the expansion of Medicaid optional to states and so much more—we now finally have a path to reverse all of that damage.

You did this, all 271,514 member of the Daily Kos community who collectively took nearly 1,000,000 actions relentlessly urging Senate Democrats to reform the filibuster. This is your victory. You were the pebbles that started this avalanche. You have made change happen.

Now please, take a bow, and never again doubt if the actions you take really make a difference.

CNN gives credit where credit is due:



What was known as the nuclear option yesterday is known as the Reid Rule today. Time will only tell if the Reid Rule is productive or destructive. But we'll leave that to the historians.



As for how it became the Reid rule, it took a coordinated and sustained effort from an unlikely place -- progressive activists on the blogosphere.

Our very own David Waldman, aka Kagro X, gets some tremendous and well-deserved credit in that article. He really was the first pebble in all this."

Supreme Court decision gives imprimatur to tough new voting laws

Supporters say the laws will guard against fraud

Critics say they will make voting more diffiicult for minorities

WASHINGTON -- The 50th anniversary of the historic March on Washington is being commemorated amid moves by some states to impose restrictions on one of its central goals: the right to vote.

Two months after the Supreme Court declared a key section of the 1965 Voting Rights Act unconstitutional, Southern states that had been covered by the act are taking steps they say will guard against voter fraud — but which critics say will make voting more difficult for minorities.

The court's 5-4 ruling tossed out the formula Congress used to decide which states and municipalities had to clear changes in voting procedures with the federal government. The fallout has reached from the campuses of historically black colleges to the nation's halls of justice.

""This has been a really, really tough summer for race and civil rights, and people are really hurting,"" says Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. ""As we approach the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s historic March on Washington, we are reminded that the fight for equal rights is far from history.""

Backers of a North Carolina law that Hillary Rodham Clinton said this month ""reads like the greatest hits of voter suppression"" argue, however, that the changes are needed to ensure the integrity of the election system.

""We think these are just common-sense reforms,"" says state Rep. David Lewis, who chairs the House Election Law Committee. ""It's never been our intent to restrict people from being able to exercise their right to vote.""

The North Carolina law, enacted two weeks ago, eventually will require government-issued photo identification at the polls, reduce early voting by seven days and end both same-day registration and a program that registers students ahead of their 18th birthdays. It has spawned three lawsuits already.

In Texas, one of the nation's toughest photo-ID laws was put into effect following the high court's decision, prompting Attorney General Eric Holder last week to file suit against the state and seek to put Texas back under the Voting Rights Act's pre-clearance requirement.

In Alabama, Mississippi and elsewhere, Republican state officials vowed to implement similar voter identification laws that had been awaiting federal approval. Officials from the National Conference of State Legislatures anticipate more voting restrictions once lawmakers return to state capitals in 2014.

Republican state officials defend the trend, as well as their right to run their states without federal interference.

""Eric Holder is wrong to mess with Texas,"" state Attorney General Greg Abbott said last week. ""All of this is really an effort by the Obama administration to circumvent the recent United States Supreme Court decision.""

The state-by-state skirmishes have spawned lawsuits by the NAACP, American Civil Liberties Union and others, charging that the new restrictions are racially motivated. Democratic lawmakers from several states have formed an alliance aimed at combating what Georgia state Rep. Stacey Abrams fears will be a ""contagion effect"" among states.

To veterans of the 1963 march who want Congress and the courts to step in, it's déjà vu.

""There are people out there trying to turn back the clock because they don't like the results,"" says Frank Smith, a marcher who now runs the African American Civil War Memorial and Museum in Washington. ""There is a direct correlation between these marches and demonstrations, and Congress passing remedial actions.""

The flurry of activity could have political as well as legal repercussions. Because restraints on voting tend to affect minorities, the poor and students more than others, they could aid Republicans and harm Democrats in the 2014 elections — and the next battle for the White House in 2016.

Clinton, one of the potential candidates in that election, denounced the trend away from expanded voting rights in a speech to the American Bar Association earlier this month.

""In the weeks since the ruling, we've seen an unseemly rush by previously covered jurisdictions to enact or enforce laws that will make it harder for millions of our fellow Americans to vote,"" she said. ""Anyone who says that racial discrimination is no longer a problem in American elections must not be paying attention.""

ACT'S SUCCESS LED TO DOWNFALL

The battle lines have formed because five of nine Supreme Court justices decided June 25 that the Voting Rights Act's toughest remedy against racial discrimination no longer is justified. Their decision suggested that the 1963 March on Washington and the many protests it spawned had accomplished its goals, and it was now time to move on.

The justices noted that the South has, in many ways, surpassed the North in terms of equality for African Americans. Black turnout exceeded white turnout nationally in the 2012 election, including in most of the states originally placed under federal oversight.

Moreover, about 12,000 blacks have been elected to political office nationwide, including some of the largest numbers in Southern states such as Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana, which have the largest black populations. That's partially because the Justice Department insisted on the creation of legislative districts with black or ethnic majorities.

""There is no doubt that these improvements are in large part because of the Voting Rights Act,"" Chief Justice John Roberts acknowledged. ""The act has proved immensely successful at redressing racial discrimination and integrating the voting process.""

So successful, in fact, that Roberts declared outdated and unconstitutional the law's geographic coverage formula, which penalized mostly Southern states with a history of racial discrimination. Within hours, officials throughout the South vowed to implement voter-identification laws and other policies that had been blocked by the federal government.

Abbott, a Republican, announced plans to implement a Texas voter ID law previously blocked by the Voting Rights Act. Mississippi Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann said implementation of his state's voter ID law, which had been awaiting Justice Department approval, would begin immediately. Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley said his state's new voter ID law no longer needed federal approval.

Other states also prepared to move ahead with legislation requiring new forms of ID at the polls, limiting early voting hours or restricting voter-registration drives. But no state acted as quickly and comprehensively as North Carolina.

The Tar Heel State's new law requires government-issued photo ID, lacked by a higher percentage of blacks than whites. It reduces from 17 to 10 the number of days for early voting, which also helped blacks more than whites in 2008 and 2012 — though it instructs local boards of elections to maintain the same number of hours and locations.

It eliminates same-day registration, requiring instead that registrants sign up at least 25 days before an election. And it eliminates a high school civics program that registers students ahead of their 18th birthdays.

""Photo ID has become a part of our everyday life,"" North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory said in a YouTube video after he signed the state's new law, noting it's even needed to purchase Sudafed. ""Our right to vote deserves similar protection.""

McCrory criticized ""the extreme left"" for being ""more interested in divisive politics than ensuring that no one's vote is disenfranchised by fraudulent ballot.""

Lewis says North Carolina is simply catching up with other states that require photo ID. Eleven states have put into effect similar laws and eight others are awaiting implementation; included among them are Southern states such as Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi and Virginia.

Since the law was passed -- it will be phased in from 2014 to 2016 -- some county officials have sought to stop the widespread practice of allowing college students to vote on campus. The overall effort by Republicans prompted state Sen. Ellie Kinnaird, a Democrat, to resign her seat.

The lawsuits in North Carolina, like those in Texas, may be joined by the Justice Department. ""I do anticipate their involvement at some point,"" says Allison Riggs, staff attorney for the Southern Coalition for Social Justice. ""We intend to hold Attorney General Holder to his word.""

The broader concern among civil rights groups is that other states will follow North Carolina's lead in 2014. ""We're going to see more of this,"" predicts Dale Ho, director of the Voting Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, which has sued the state. ""North Carolina's a harbinger.""

'CONDEMNED TO REPEAT PAST'

The 1963 marchers who return to the nation's capital this week to mark the anniversary will have a new cause: pressuring Congress to fortify the weakened Voting Rights Act to eliminate what Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in dissent were ""second-generation barriers"" to voting.

""The court criticizes Congress for failing to recognize that 'history did not end in 1965.' But the court ignores that 'what's past is prologue,'"" she said, quoting William Shakespeare. ""And those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.""

What preceded the Voting Rights Act were a series of events no one wants to repeat: literary tests and poll taxes designed to block blacks from voting; beatings and jailings for those who defied racist authorities.

In his opinion, Roberts noted that two southern cities with particularly woeful pasts — Philadelphia, Miss., and Selma, Ala. — now have black mayors. Philadelphia Mayor James Young credited his election to the changes brought about by the Voting Rights Act.

""Due to the history, without the federal intervention, we would not have what we have today,"" he told USA TODAY in February. ""Whether it's overbearing now, I'm not here to judge. I'm just here to say I am a recipient of what fair-voting laws should do, and that is give every individual a level field.""

To the court's majority, Young's election and similar changes in the South are reason to declare a lasting victory for the Voting Rights Act. To civil rights veterans, continued federal vigilance is essential.

""North Carolina is the warning bell for what is to come,"" says Judith Browne Dianis, co-director of the Advancement Project, a civil rights advocacy group. ""State legislatures that have wanted to keep and maintain control through manipulating voting laws are doing exactly that. And now there's no check on it."""

At 42, he is also the youngest in more than a century.

With musical groups about to perform on the park stage and food trucks lining the sidewalks, the free festivities will continue until 10 p.m.

In his speech, Garcetti called L.A. “a place where you can’t be pessimistic even if you want to be” and pledged to keep crime in check, boost education and meet with Fortune 500 executives to find new ways to create jobs. Garcetti also spoke of ending runaway production and making Los Angeles more attractive for the entertainment industry.

The oath of office was administered by Kenia Castillo, an eighth-grader at Luther Burbank Magnet Middle School. She said she was 4 when she encountered Garcetti outside City Hall at a Justice For Janitors rally. She attended that event with her mother, a janitor, and more recently volunteered for his mayoral campaign.

Hours before the swearing in, Garcetti signaled that he plans to give former rival Jan Perry a senior role in his administration.

Perry, whose 12 years on the City Council end Sunday, won nearly every precinct in South Los Angeles in the March mayoral primary but did not make it into the May runoff.

“Twelve years of elected service does not mean the end of her service, mark my words,” Garcetti told parishioners at First African Methodist Episcopal Church in South L.A., one of the city’s most prominent African American churches, on Sunday. “I’ve got plans for her.”

Perry, the only African American among the top contenders for mayor, declined to comment. She backed Garcetti in his runoff against Wendy Greuel, the city controller.

In his morning appearance, Garcetti cast himself as a champion of the underprivileged.

“I wanted this city to understand that I know the power comes from you, from the least among us, from the most humble, from the forgotten, from those voices and those faces who aren’t even in the pews today,” he said.

BOSTON -- Gallup, the company that has faced intense criticism after its polling consistently understated President Barack Obama's support during the 2012 campaign, shared details of its ongoing review of its election polling methods on Saturday.

Over a four-week period before the November 2012 election, Gallup's daily tracking poll showed Republican opponent Mitt Romney leading by margins ranging from 1 to 7 percentage points, including a 4-point Romney lead just 10 days before the election. Obama defeated Romney by a 51 to 47 percent margin.

Shortly after the election Gallup's editor-in-chief Frank Newport pledged to conduct an internal review of Gallup's telephone survey methodology. As promised, Newport reviewed on Saturday the kinds of studies conducted on issues including drawing samples, interviewing voters, and how to weight data and select the likely electorate. The company pledges to make the findings of its ongoing review publicly available.

Although much analysis is now complete and set to be unveiled June 4, the investigation awaits ""a major experiment"" in conjunction with the gubernatorial campaigns in the fall.

""We take it seriously"" when polls misfire, Newport explained on Saturday. ""We've been doing presidential polling since 1936 which is what put George Gallup on the map ...The results [in 2012] certainly were not what we wanted them to be from Gallup's perspective.""

Newport's remarks came during a private, on-the-record briefing in Boston attended by The Huffington Post, and a handful of other pollsters and academic researchers at the annual American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) conference.

Michael Traugott, a University of Michigan political scientist and survey methodologist retained by the company for the review, said he recommended broadening the scope and timing of the inquiry.

""Early on,"" Traugott said, ""Frank and I had a conversation, about trying to learn what we could from an investigation of the data"" collected during the 2012 campaign, ""but then using that information to design a series of experiments going forward.""

Traugott also said he recommended reviewing all of Gallup's methods and assessing the data collected before the 2012 campaign. ""We have been assembling data on presidential approval back to 2002 as a benchmark to look at the Gallup data in relations to other data and also party identification data going back.""

His analysis confirms, for example, that by ""a small but consistent amount,"" ratings of President George W. Bush ""were a little bit higher than the average"" of other pollsters ""and the Obama ratings were a little bit lower than the average."" Those findings are consistent with a Huffington Post investigation of Gallup's results published in June 2012.

Traugott also clarified that Gallup ""has agreed to make all of this information publicly available."" He stressed that both he and Newport, as former presidents of AAPOR ""are firmly committed to transparency. And this is an ongoing part of our relationship as well.""

When pressed on whether that included releasing raw respondent-level data, Newport said that although they are ""still making the final decisions, we think we'll try to make the data available as well."" Such data will allow other scholars and researchers to attempt to replicate Traugott's findings and test other theories. On Saturday, Newport also asked assembled AAPOR researchers for further input on a list of 20 specific parts -- virtually every aspect -- of Gallup's methodology included in the review.

While Newport declined to reveal specific findings from the review ahead of the June 4 announcement, he shared some new information.

One of the experiments, for example, checked on potential bias associated with the Gallup brand name by running a full ""shadow"" sample to a recent Gallup poll in which respondents were told the polster was ""Selection Research Incorporated,"" rather than Gallup. ""The Gallup name significantly increased the response rate,"" Newport said, but without producing differences in the demographics of the resulting sample.

Newport also explained that earlier this year, the company changed how it asks respondents to describe their race, replacing yes/no questions critiqued in last year's Huffington Post investigation with a question in which respondents could select more than one in a list of potential answers. That change allowed for a related modification to Gallup's weighting procedure. ""We think that's already had some impact on our data,"" Newport said.

It is difficult, Traugott explained, to reconstruct Gallup's problems ""retrospectively"" using the data collected last fall. Instead, he convinced Gallup to conduct experiments to determine if alternative methods would have produced different and more accurate results.

Because such experiments only make sense ""in the context of a campaign,"" Traugott explained, they decided to undertake them during the upcoming gubernatorial campaigns in Virginia and possibly New Jersey. He stressed that the experiments would only be used for further analysis, and would not be released publicly before the election.

Three academic survey methodologists are joining Traugott in the investigation: Chris Wlezien from Temple University, an expert in likely voter models; James Wagner from the University of Michigan, an authority in telephone survey operations; and Frauke Kreuter from the University of Maryland, an expert on sampling and weighting.

Shortly after the election, Newport speculated that ""it is likely that we could see significantly fewer polls conducted in the 2016 election."" Asked Saturday if he was signaling Gallup's intention to withdraw from polling in the next presidential race, Newport replied, ""Well, check back with us in 2016. I don't know what any polling organization is doing in 2016,"" given the increasing challenges to traditional pollster methods.

However, despite the months of criticism, Newport was upbeat about the potential for improvements with advances in technology. He spoke favorably about a future in which ""polling is augmented by non-probability data, administrative data, social media data.""

""I think it is an exciting time,"" he said later. ""Rather than doing things the same way in any business, it's always exciting when technology in particular opens up all these other opportunities."""

He Began His Column With The Post In', 'He Received The Pulitzer Prize For Commentary In His Latest Book', 'The Conservative Sensibility', 'Was Released In June']","George F. Will: Robert Sarvis, Virginia’s other choice for governor","When William F. Buckley, running as the Conservative Party’s candidate for mayor of New York in 1965, was asked what he would do if he won, he replied: “Demand a recount.” Robert Sarvis, Libertarian Party candidate for governor of Virginia, will not need to do this.

Hours before Gallup reported record nationwide support — 60 percent — for a third party to leaven politics, Sarvis was declared ineligible for the final debate for gubernatorial candidates because he fell a tad short of a 10 percent average in recent polls. None of this disturbed his leisurely enjoyment of a tuna-burger lunch before sauntering off in search of free media, about the only kind he can afford.

Equanimity is his default position and almost his political platform: WhyF be agitated when your frenzied adversaries are splendidly making your case about the poverty of standard political choices? The Democratic and Republican candidates, Terry McAuliffe and Ken Cuccinelli, each say that no good can come from electing the other fellow; Sarvis amiably agrees with both.

In Sarvis, the man and the moment have met. He is running at a time of maximum distrust of established institutions, including the two major parties. He has little money, but McAuliffe and Cuccinelli have spent millions of dollars on broadcast ads making each other repulsive to many Virginians, who surely feel as Will Rogers did: “You got to admit that each party is worse than the other.” Furthermore, the partial shutdown of the government especially annoyed Sarvis’s state, which has the nation’s second highest per-capita federal spending (Alaska is first) — Northern Virginia is a dormitory for federal workers and southern Virginia’s military installations include the world’s largest naval complex.

At the national level, the most potent third-party candidates have had vivid personalities and burning issues: Theodore Roosevelt in 1912, taming corporations; Strom Thurmond in 1948, asserting regional grievances relating to race; George Wallace in 1968, venting class and cultural resentments; Ross Perot in 1992, shrinking the federal deficit. Sarvis is more bemused than burning.

The heated race for Virginia governor pits Republican Ken Cuccinelli against Democrat Terry McAuliffe. But there is another guy: Libertarian Robert Sarvis. The Post’s Lee Powell is on the campaign trail with Sarvis, who is pushing what he calls more “rational policy.” (The Washington Post)

During an intermission in the telecast of a notably disagreeable McAuliffe-Cuccinelli debate, viewers heard from their television sets a woman’s voice asking, “Can’t vote for these guys?” Then Sarvis’s voice:

“Like you, I can’t vote for Ken Cuccinelli’s narrow-minded social agenda. I want a Virginia that’s open-minded and welcoming to all. And like you, I don’t want Terry McAuliffe’s cronyism either, where government picks winners and losers. Join me, and together we can build a Virginia that’s open-minded and open for business.”

McAuliffe is an enthusiast for, and has prospered from, government “investments” in preferred industries, which is a recipe for crony capitalism. Cuccinelli is a stern social conservative, an opponent of, among other things, gay marriage. Marriage equality interests Sarvis (whose mother is Chinese) because his wife is African American, so his marriage would have been illegal in Virginia before the exquisitely titled 1967 U.S. Supreme Court decision Loving v. Virginia .

Sarvis, who is 37 and may look that old in a decade or so, graduated from Harvard with a mathematics degree, earned a law degree from New York University and clerked in Mississippi for a judge on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. After a spell as a mathematics graduate student at Berkeley, Sarvis worked for a San Francisco tech startup, then earned a master’s degree in economics at George Mason University. In 2011, he ran as a Republican against the state Senate majority leader, a 31-year incumbent. Outspent 72-to-1, Sarvis got 36 percent of the vote.

He must scrounge for media attention because he fares poorly in polls that reinforce the judgment that he is not newsworthy. But he is.

William Buckley won only 13.4 percent of the 1965 mayoralty vote, but he energized a growing constituency and legitimized the practice of voting outside the confines of traditional political choices. Five years later, the New York Conservative Party’s U.S. Senate candidate — Buckley’s brother Jim — was elected with 38.8 percent of the vote in a three-way race.

Third-party candidacies are said to be like bees — they sting, then die. Still, Sarvis is enabling voters to register dissatisfaction with the prevailing political duopoly. Markets are information-generating mechanisms, and Virginia’s political market is sending, through Sarvis, signals to the two durable parties.

But after Election Day in November, huge political success met financial opportunity. The people in their 20s and 30s from the Obama tech team had seen others just like them get incredibly rich on innovations (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) that were as transformational as anything they could hope to achieve in government. Now they started to think about what innovations they could bring to the market.

A.M.G. may be the most baldly commercial of the new crop of companies coming out of the cave, but they are all trying to translate what they learned there into future success. A few weeks ago, Wagner announced he was starting a new firm called Civis Analytics with an investment from Eric Schmidt, the Google executive chairman, who was a technology adviser during the campaign. As Wagner described it to me, he would use analytics to help nonprofit and for-profit companies reach out to segments of the population they were struggling to connect with. One of his first clients is the College Board, which runs the national SAT test. Civis will identify “kids who are low-income, high-achieving but not meeting their college potential.” The “commercial applicability is wide,” he said, so the company will not be averse to working with big, for-profit companies of all kinds.

Carol Davidsen was also recruited by A.M.G., but she decided to take the lessons of the Obama campaign in a different direction. If anything, her approach is almost anticorporate, even though she said she was not against getting rich if she could. Her company, called Cir.cl, which she founded with a campaign programmer, Joshua Thayer, endeavors to find people with complementary interests who may have reason to do business with each other, like parents with baby equipment to dispose of and parents-to-be in the market for that equipment. She calls it “recommerce.”

“I have a lot of friends with kids,” she said one recent Friday at her new office, a bouncy-ball and Mac-strewn onetime closet space in an industrial building in Downtown Brooklyn. “There’s this little plastic play house. Does every single one of those need to go into a garbage dump? Why did we give up on doing business with each other? Why is it always to big corporations? It doesn’t have to be.” Explaining her choice to me, she said, “I don’t want to spend my time optimizing for Coke.”

When I talked to Chauncey McLean in Brooklyn in April, he walked me through how the campaign’s technological achievements could translate into services provided to private businesses, like Caesars. The casino had gobs of data on its customers. “We have a giant list of people, and we need to make a model of likely customers,” he said. A.M.G. would break them down along a range of Caesars Scores, à la Wagner’s persuadable scores. Then A.M.G. could work through it and direct advertising toward those whose visits had fallen off: find what they watch via Rentrak in the greatest concentrations and then ply them with TV advertising.

Over several meetings with McLean and his young A.M.G. staff members, I asked them to talk about the switch in mission from getting Obama elected to helping Fortune 500 companies sell stuff. Will St. Clair, who helped write the campaign’s Facebook program, said he saw himself as a programmer first and foremost and only joined A.M.G. after deciding that he didn’t want “to play the Internet start-up billionaire game, which is a lot less fun than it looks on paper.” Gaurav Shirole said he was considering a job in the Treasury Department when McLean approached him. “I’m a Silicon Valley kid, so the start-up bug has been there forever.”

Frommann acknowledged having ventured into politics with a certain idealism. “We’ve all watched ‘The West Wing,’ like, four times, and we want to do our small part to change the world,” he said. Politics, he said, was emotionally satisfying. Corporate clients meant new data sets, “stuff I haven’t worked with before, intellectually that’s interesting to me.”"
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/10/22/New-Poll-Confirms-What-Republicans-Have-Known-For-Months-Cuccinelli-is-Losing-Virginia-Governor-s-Race,2013-10-22 00:00:00,['Michael Patrick Leahy'],New Poll Confirms Cuccinelli is Losing Virginia Governor's Race,"Rasmussen Reports released a poll on Tuesday that shows Democrat Terry McAuliffe leads Republican Ken Cuccinelli by 17 points, 50% to 33%, in the race to become Virginia’s next governor. Libertarian candidate Robert Sarvis is in third place with 8%. The poll of 1,000 likely Virginia voters was conducted on October 20 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3%.

Though McAuliffe’s lead in Tuesday’s poll was significantly higher than in previous polls, it was just the latest information that confirmed the bad news Virginia Republicans have known for several months. It is clear that the Cuccinelli campaign is headed towards a disastrous outcome in November unless dramatic changes are undertaken. But, with only two weeks remaining until election day, it may be a case of too little, too late.

Conservatives and Tea Party activists have been sounding the warning bells with the consultants running the Cuccinelli campaign for months. Given the extraordinary vulnerabilities of the Democratic candidate, Terry McAuliffe, mired as he is in dual investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Homeland Security of GreenTech Automotive, many Virginians are wondering how a candidate so beloved by the conservative base has run such a weak campaign.

McAuliffe’s campaign has succeeded in framing the election around social issues by outspending Cuccinelli at least two to one in television advertising. The pace of that outspending appears to have accelerated recently. Several Virginia residents told Breitbart News on Tuesday that Cuccinelli has been hammered mercilessly over the past several weeks with an onslaught of highly negative attack ads, while his own mild responses have been seen but not remembered.

McAuliffe has also benefited from significant spending on his behalf by outside liberal interest groups, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s recent endorsement.

Tea Party activists in Virginia are not surprised that the Cuccinelli campaign has performed so poorly. The problem, they believe, began when Cuccinelli hired a campaign team staffed heavily by Washington insider Republican consultants.

That error by itself could have been overcome, but the Cuccinelli team then proceeded to give Tea Party activists and groups around the Commonwealth the cold shoulder. Eager to help Cuccinelli win by providing the power and energy of a vigorous ground game, Tea Party activists were given no opportunity to be involved in the campaign.

This fundamental strategic error drew all of the energy out of the Cuccinelli campaign, and was compounded on August 15 by Cuccinelli’s own ill-advised criticism of the grassroots for their lack of interest in volunteering for his campaign. Activists throughout the Commonwealth saw Cuccinelli’s comments as a public slap in the face, and many have subsequently washed their hands of both the candidate and the campaign team.

Rather than working with the grassroots on the development of a ground game and get-out-the-vote infrastructure, the Cuccinelli campaign has relied on television ads and press releases. Some of these press releases have been considered sophomoric by Tea Party activists.

An “RRR” spoof poll released by the Cuccinelli campaign in late August is the most visible example of the campaign’s communications missteps. In an effort to counter the polls released by the PPP company, a well known left leaning polling firm, all of which show McAuliffe with a strong lead and Cuccinelli with high negatives, the Cuccinelli campaign has issued a series of press releases about phony polls conducted by the fake “RRR” (Republican Republican Republican) polling firm that purportedly show Cuccinelli with a significant lead.

Tea Party activists in Virginia are reluctant to publicly criticize the Cuccinelli campaign because of their loyalty and affection for Cuccinelli personally. However, they have been eager to offer suggestions to Attorney General Cuccinelli on how he can turn his campaign around. Unfortunately, few, if any of them have been able to even obtain a hearing from the Cuccinelli campaign team to communicate these views.

Larry Nordvig, Executive Director of the Richmond Tea Party, told Breitbart News last month that “conservatives are highly concerned about Obamacare, immigration, and moral decline, and are looking for reassurance and leadership in those areas. Attorney General Cuccinelli has not taken a hard stand on those issues. The net effect is that he’s not exciting his base, which dampens campaign volunteer activism. “

But for Nordvig when he spoke with Breitbart in September, “re-engaging his base” was “even more critical for Attorney General Cuccinelli.”

“Cuccinelli is not going to win the money race,” Nordvig said. “That means he will stand, or fall, based on grassroots support. He has got to start reassuring conservatives that he will fight for their deepest-held beliefs. Oh, and it wouldn’t hurt to court the Tea Party a little more,” Nordvig added. “We’re the major component of the grassroots support he needs to win.”

Unfortunately for Cuccinelli, it is virtually impossible to mount an effective ground game on just two weeks notice. Such an effort requires months to develop an infrastructure of volunteers and systems.

“I hate to say this,” one Virginia source told Breitbart News on Tuesday, “but unless grassroots lightning strikes in the next two weeks, get used to saying ‘Governor McAuliffe’ . . . and ‘President Clinton.’ “"
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/21/senate-nears-possible-vote-on-curbing-filibusters/,2013-11-21 00:00:00,[],Senate Dems weaken GOP power with major filibuster rule change,"Senate Democrats bowled over Republicans on Thursday to win approval for a highly controversial rule change which would limit the GOP's ability to block nominees, in a move Republicans called a ""raw power grab.""

""It's a sad day in the history of the Senate,"" Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said after the vote.

Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., moving quickly following days of speculation, used the so-called ""nuclear option"" to pass the change. Typically, major changes like this take 67 votes, but he did it with just a simple majority.

With Republicans fuming, the change weakens the power of the minority to stall nominations for top positions. Instead of needing 60 votes to break a filibuster, the change means Democrats will now need just 51.

President Obama, speaking Thursday from the White House briefing room, said the change was needed to deal with Republicans' ""unprecedented pattern of obstruction.""

He cited, among other stand-offs, the bid by Republicans to filibuster his nomination of Chuck Hagel, a former GOP senator, for Defense secretary. ""For the sake of future generations, we can't let it become normal,"" he said.

Republicans charged that Democrats were merely trying to shift focus away from ObamaCare with the move.

""Today we face a real crisis in the confirmation process, a crisis concocted by the Democrat majority to distract attention from the ObamaCare disaster and, in the process, consolidate more power than any majority has had in more than 200 years,"" Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said in a statement immediately following the historic vote.

""It sounds to me like Harry Reid is trying to change the subject and if I were taking all the incoming fire that he's taking over Obamacare, I'd try to change the subject too,"" House Speaker John Boehner said.

Reid won approval for the change on a 52-48 vote.

Regardless of Reid's underlying motivations, the vote Thursday marks a major change in Senate rules. The filibuster, for better or worse, has been a defining feature of the Senate for decades. While this makes the Senate one of the slowest-moving legislative bodies in the world, it also prevents legislation and appointments from moving too fast.

The vote on Thursday vastly reduces the power of the minority to stall nominations and makes it easier for federal judges to get lifetime appointments.

Even Democrats have supported the right to filibuster in the past. The late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said in 2010 that changing the rules would ""destroy the uniqueness of this institution.""

""In the hands of a tyrannical majority and leadership, that kind of emasculation of the cloture rule would mean that minority rights would cease to exist in the U.S. Senate,"" he said.

The change applies to nominations for federal court and other top positions, though not for the Supreme Court.

Reid got the ball rolling on the rule change late Thursday morning. Frustrated by Republicans' stonewalling of numerous Obama nominees, he cast the shift as vital to the Senate's survival.

""The Senate is a living thing, and to survive it must change,"" he said on the Senate floor.

But the maneuver itself threatens to make the bitter atmosphere on the Hill even more toxic, imperiling the prospect for future agreement on everything from immigration to the budget.

McConnell charged that Reid's attempt proves the Democrats are willing to ""do and say just about anything"" to get their way.

The change is the most far-reaching to filibuster rules since 1975, when a two-thirds requirement for cutting off filibusters against legislation and all nominations was eased to the 60-vote level. It delivers a major blow the GOP's ability to thwart Obama in making appointments, though Republicans have promised the same fate would await Democrats whenever the GOP recaptures the White House and Senate control.

The clash occurred as Democrats have grown increasingly irritated by the GOP's derailing of Obama's selections for top jobs, including three picks for pivotal judgeships in recent days.

Republicans say they are weary of repeated Democratic threats to rewrite the rules. They say Democrats similarly obstructed some of President George W. Bush's nominees and argue that the D.C. Circuit's caseload is too low, which Democrats reject.

Nomination fights are not new in the Senate, but as the hostility has grown the two sides have been edging toward a collision for much of this year.

The latest battle is over Obama's choices to fill three vacancies at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Since Halloween, GOP filibusters have derailed the president's nominations of District Judge Robert L. Wilkins, law professor Cornelia Pillard and attorney Patricia Millett for those jobs, which are lifelong.

The D.C. Circuit Court is viewed as second only to the Supreme Court in power because it rules on disputes over White House and federal agency actions. The circuit's eight judges are divided evenly between Democratic and Republican presidential appointees.

Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, on Monday sent blistering letters to the network bosses, calling their decision to air Clinton projects just as the 2016 White House campaign is heating up “disturbing and disappointing.” And if the shows go forward, the GOP will cut CNN and NBC out of Republican debates during primary season leading up to the election.

NBC last week announced a miniseries called “Hillary” with Diane Lane playing the former first lady and secretary of state. CNN is planning a documentary about Hillary Clinton’s life.

“Out of a sense of fairness and decency and in the interest of the political process and your company’s reputation, I call on you to cancel this political ad masquerading as an unbiased production,” Priebus wrote NBC Entertainment chairman Robert Greenblatt. (You can read the letters in their entirety here.)

A NBC spokesman said the network had no comment.

But CNN, which plans to run the Clinton documentary in 2014 following a theatrical run, issued a statement bashing the RNC.

“This documentary will be a non-fiction look at the life of a former First Lady and Secretary of State,” the statement said. “Instead of making premature decisions about a project that is in the very early stages of development and months from completion, we would encourage the members of the Republican National Committee to reserve judgment until they know more.

“Should they decide not to participate in debates on CNN,” the statement added, “we would find it curious, as limiting their debate participation seems to be the ultimate disservice to voters.”

Both networks have a long history of run-ins with the GOP. Conservatives frequently derided CNN as the “Clinton News Network” during the 1990s, when it was run by Rick Kaplan, a close friend of President Clinton and his wife, both Democratic leaders. Many Republicans have also felt that NBC News has been tainted by longstanding liberal bias and its association with sister network MSNBC, now a bastion of left-wing opinion during prime time.

“My message is this: get off your ass,” Rove told nearly 500 Republicans gathered for a convention luncheon at a downtown hotel. “Get back in the game and fight. Don’t give in to what the other side wants.”

The gathering is taking place as the state GOP is at a crossroads. A Republican politician has not been elected to statewide office in seven years, GOP voter registration has plummeted, and the party is mired in debt.

But Rove said it was possible to turn the situation around and pointed to his experience in Texas. When he moved there, he said, no Republican had been elected statewide in more than a century, and only 13 members of the 150-member house were Republicans. Now, 101 members of the House are Republican and in 1998, when George W. Bush was reelected governor, Republicans swept all 28 statewide offices, he said.

Rove said that rebuilding must not simply focus on the tactical, such as getting voters to the polls on election day or opening GOP clubs on college campuses. Rather, he said, Republicans must change how they communicate their principles and adapt to the times.

He said it would not be easy, but a strong Republican Party is vital for not only California’s health but also for the nation’s.

“You’ve got a big task….It’s going to be tough,” he said. “You can keep going in the direction you’re going, and we in Texas will be grateful for the businesses and, more importantly, the people you send us, because you’re sending your best and brightest…. Or you can get up off the matt and throw yourself back into this contest. Think smart, be active, be committed, rebuild the organization and ask for votes in the right way, and speak boldly and proudly about our principles.”

(CNN) - Some social conservatives are blasting Utah's ruling striking down part of that state's law banning polygamy.

The suit was brought by the stars of the television reality series ""Sister Wives,"" and a federal judge's ruling Friday throws out the law's section prohibiting ""cohabitation,"" saying it violates constitutional guarantees of due process and religious freedom.





Judge strikes down part of Utah polygamy law in 'Sister Wives' case

Former Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum - who a decade ago came under fire for comments indicating polygamy would become legal if courts banned anti-sodomy laws - responded to the ruling over the weekend.

""Sometimes I hate it when what I predict comes true,"" the former U.S. senator tweeted Sunday.

Some times I hate it when what I predict comes true. http://t.co/JmIPiiJiyn — Rick Santorum (@RickSantorum) December 15, 2013

The Family Research Council, led by prominent social conservative Tony Perkins, also weighed the Utah statute, warning of ""serious consequences of redefining marriage.""

""Throughout history, marriage has been future-oriented, focused on the next generation and the best interests of children. The reality is that society needs children, and children need a mom and a dad,"" Perkins said Monday.

""However, redefining marriage to fulfill the desires of same-sex couples or polygamists only moves society away from this vital public interest and creates social chaos.""

In striking down the section of the law Friday, Judge Clark Waddoups used a 2003 Supreme Court landmark gay rights case Lawrence v. Texas, which ruled that anti sodomy laws were unconstitutional.

During that Supreme Court ruling a decade ago, Santorum told the Associated Press that bans on sodomy would open the doors to a ""right to polygamy"" and other sexual acts.

""If the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual (gay) sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery. You have the right to anything,"" Santorum said in 2003.

But Waddoups' ruling keeps in place the ban on bigamy ""in the literal sense - the fraudulent or otherwise impermissible possession of two purportedly valid marriage licenses for the purpose of entering into more than one purportedly legal marriage.""

Some religious groups also criticized the ruling.

""This is what happens when marriage becomes about the emotional and sexual wants of adults, divorced from the needs of children for a mother and a father committed to each other for life,"" said Russell Moore, of the Southern Baptist Convention.

""Polygamy was outlawed in this country because it was demonstrated, again and again, to hurt women and children. Sadly, when marriage is elastic enough to mean anything, in due time it comes to mean nothing.""

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/07/17/mccain-orchestrates-another-gop-surrender,2013-07-17 00:00:00,['Mike Flynn'],McCain Orchestrates Another GOP Surrender,"Sen. John McCain spent the weekend negotiating with Majority Leader Harry Reid on a deal to avert Reid’s threatened use of the “nuclear option” to change Senate rules to eliminate filibusters on Presidential nominations. Through his efforts, McCain was able to secure a complete GOP capitulation on 7 pending nominations. Reid secured all the benefits of exercising the “nuclear option” without the political cost of actually using it.

Under the McCain deal, the GOP will provide enough votes to secure the 60 votes needed for cloture and proceed to final consideration of the 7 nominees. In exchange, Reid agreed to replace two current union attorney nominees with two alternative union attorney nominees. McCain’s swift surrender ensures that the “nuclear option” is a permanent fixture of the nomination process.

GOP objections to many of the pending nominations were not minor. The first nomination to be approved under the McCain deal was Richard Cordray to be the first Director of the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB was enacted under the Dodd-Frank legislation and holds sweeping powers over all aspects of the financial and credit sector.

When Cordray was first nominated two years ago, McCain and all but 2 GOP Senators signed a letter vowing to block any nomination unless reforms were made to the agency. A major concern was that Congress was specifically prohibited from exercising any oversight over the Agency’s budget. The promise to block that nomination wasn’t prompted by concerns about a specific nominee, but a fundamental political principle. McCain’s deal is further confirmation that principle are cheap in Washington.

Theoretically, McCain’s surrender preserves the right of Republicans to filibuster future nominations. Practically speaking, however, that right has been permanently ceded. If the GOP is willing to fold when it has serious objections to pending nominations, it will easily surrender again in the future the next time Reid threatens the “nuclear option.” If the GOP isn’t willing to draw a line over flawed nominees like Cordray or Thomas Perez, it never will be.

Reid believed that he could eliminate the filibuster for nominations with a simply majority vote. Democrat Sen. Carl Levin on Tuesday said he believed the change required 67 votes and stated he would vote against Reid’s rule change. It would have been better for the GOP to force Reid to vote on the change. Senators would have had to go on record whether they supported Reid or Levin’s interpretation of the rules. With a number of vulnerable Democrats up for reelection next year, a vote could have carried political consequences.

McCain, however, helped the Democrats avoid a risky political vote. He also ensured that he is on Harry Reid’s speed-dial the next time the GOP raises objections to an Obama nomination."

What Benghazi is all about.

Every scandal the right manufactures has something simple at its core: a stained blue dress, a long-form birth certificate, a Budhist temple. What is with Benghazi? I haven’t figure it out yet.

The glib (and accurate) answer is "" Hillary Clinton 2016 "". You don't have to be a rocket scientist (or super-genius Jason Richwine ) to crack that code. But even pretend scandals have some sort of narrative to tie them together. You know, the Clintons killed Vince Foster, Obama's birth certificate is forged, yadda yadda yadda.

But with this Benghazi thing ...

Best I can gather, it goes something like this: ""Obama knew the attacks were carried out by terrorists even as he was saying they were a result of a YouTube anti-Islamic movie.""

To that, the crazies respond with shit like this:



SUSAN RICE LIED HILLARY LIED OBAMA LIED AMERICANS DIED

There is, of course, hilarious irony to this, given that this is the same crowd that didn't give a fuck about Bush's genuine lies that got people genuinely killed. And lots of them. But even assuming their version of ""reality"" has any semblance of truth, it doesn't follow that any administration lies would've cost any lives. At worst, using their own facts, the administration misled the public for a week following the attacks. At worst. Only with wingnut logic does a post-event misstatement create a time vortex in which people lose their lives in the past.

But in reality, Obama called the attacks a terrorist attack the day after the attacks. Remember, it was this alternate wingnut version of reality that got Mitt Romney in trouble with the iconic ""please proceed, governor"" moment during the second presidential debate.

Yet the alternate wingnut reality persists. Maybe that's inevitable. After over four years of the most scandal-free administration since forever, conservatives have to hang on to some semblance of malfeasance to continue justifying their pathetic hysteria, and given the failure of their Fast and Furious hysteria, maybe this Benghazi thing can become the new scandal of the century. If they keep screaming about it enough, perhaps people will suddenly start believing in time vortexes as well."
http://news.yahoo.com/obama-cory-booker-ad-145955582.html,,[],Obama appears in campaign ad for Cory Booker,"With just two days left in the race and his lead in the polls shrinking, New Jersey Senate hopeful Cory Booker released a short campaign ad featuring a high-profile supporter: President Barack Obama.



""On Wednesday, voters in New Jersey have the opportunity to vote for a leader with uncommon character, Cory Booker,"" President Obama says in the one-minute ad endorsing the Newark mayor for U.S. Senate. ""New Jersey also has an opportunity to send a message to the entire country about what kind of leadership we expect from our representatives in Congress. We're better than the shutdown politics we've seen in Washington.""



The release of the ad comes two days after former Alaskan governor and tea party favorite Sarah Palin appeared at a rally in New Jersey to stump for Steve Lonegan, Booker's opponent in Wednesday's special election to fill the seat vacated by Sen. Frank Lautenberg's death in June.



A poll released last week by Quinnipiac University showed Booker's lead over Lonegan — which was 28 points in August — had been cut to 12 points. And according to a poll released Monday by Monmouth University, Booker's lead is down to 10.



Booker, Obama says, ""has spent his entire life bringing people with different perspectives together, regardless of party, to take on tough challenges. Take it from me: Now more than ever before, that's the kind of leader we need in the Senate.""



The Newark mayor was one of Obama's earliest supporters. But during the 2012 presidential election, Booker slammed an Obama campaign ad criticizing Mitt Romney's record as the head of Bain Capital and called for an end to ""nauseating"" attacks from both sides.



""I have to just say from a very personal level, I'm not about to sit here and indict private equity,"" Booker said. ""To me, it's just we're getting to a ridiculous point in America. Especially that I know I live in a state where pension funds, unions, and other people invest in companies like Bain Capital. If you look at the totality of Bain Capital's record, they've done a lot to support businesses, to grow businesses.""



Booker was forced to clarify his comments.



""I will fight hard for Obama to win,"" Booker wrote. ""But just as his '08 campaign did, I believe we must elevate [and] not denigrate. This is the Obama I know."""

(CNN) —

If you want to know why there’s little cooperation in Washington these days, I’d start with a campaign promise made in 1988 by presidential candidate George H.W. Bush.

“Read my lips: No new taxes.”

So, when he raised taxes two years later, quite naturally, voters, particularly conservatives, were upset.

If you want to know why so little is being accomplished in Washington these days, I’d start with that broken promise and what Bush did in an attempt to get those conservatives back.

He carried Rush Limbaugh’s bags.

That’s right. In 1992, President Bush invited Limbaugh for a sleepover and personally brought his guest’s bags into the Lincoln bedroom for him

ESPN LZ Granderson

They were not friends.

In fact, Limbaugh didn’t care for Bush that much, and “41” knew it. But Bush was seeking re-election. He was saddled with a slumping economy and locked in a tough battle with Gov. Bill Clinton and businessman Ross Perot.

He believed he needed Rush Limbaugh.

The party has been carrying Limbaugh’s bags ever since.

So, if you want to know when Washington became so polarized, maybe we should circle August 1, 1988, exactly 25 years ago. That was the day a satirical talk show host syndicated his act and, in the process, made a lot of money and became one of the most influential figures in American politics today.

“Have any of you heard of an individual by the name of LZ Granderson?” Limbaugh asked on his show in June 2012. “Snerdley? He has not heard of LZ Granderson. Dawn, have you? Brian, have you heard of LZ Granderson? Prior to last night I had not heard of LZ Granderson.”

Which isn’t true.

In June 2011, Limbaugh brought me up on his show as well, going so far as to say, “You can blame me, LZ Granderson, all you want, and I’ll take it.”

It only takes a few seconds on “The Rush Limbaugh Show” website to find out those facts. But Limbaugh isn’t on the air to provide facts, he’s there to entertain. Many of his listeners understand that.

And many of them don’t.

A 1994 New York Times article leading into the midterm election called Limbaugh “a kind of national precinct captain for the Republican insurgency of 1994” and documented caller after caller legitimately asking the Mahi Rushie – he calls himself that on occasion – for guidance.

Not much has changed.

During the Affordable Health Care Act debate, callers were actually asking Limbaugh, a shock jock in the mold of Howard Stern, what was in the bill. He even threatened to move to Costa Rica if it was implemented, which seemed counterintuitive, considering Costa Rica has universal health care.

But it’s moments like that when you remember that Limbaugh’s purpose isn’t to provide thoughtful political discourse. It’s to vent on his listeners’ behalf, to appeal to their censored side. The side that wants to hear a white man say “nigga” in public or call a woman a “slut” without getting fired.

If that makes you laugh, then he’s doing his job.

If that disgusts you, well that’s his job, too.

Limbaugh has had us on this yo-yo since the moment he assumed the role of Gabriel in the Kingdom of Reagan 25 years ago. Back then, it was only offensive, because he was the party’s megaphone, warning listeners about the impending invasion of welfare queens with his mixture of righteous indignation and half-truths. It became destructive when listeners and politicians alike made him its spokesman: a pseudo-politician free from the burden of actually having to do anything.

Like use facts.

In rebutting the legitimacy of climate change, Limbaugh once told listeners the United States had more acreage of forest land today than at the time the Constitution was written. That wasn’t true, of course, but it sounded good.

Not too long ago, he read what he believed to be passages from Obama’s senior thesis, passages that expressed a disdain for the U.S. Constitution. Sadly, the whole thing was made up by a blogger. And while Limbaugh did sheepishly tell listeners what he had read earlier was false, the host still found a way to justify reading it by saying, “We know he thinks it.”

Some folks eat that kind of stuff up.

Some get riled up about it.

And the folks in Washington? Well, after 25 years, they’re still not quite sure what to do with it or him. If you’re a Democrat, do you ignore him? If you’re a Republican, do you carry his bags? I imagine it’s like that feeling you get when someone tells you something that you can’t determine is a joke or not. You just stand there half-smiling like an idiot.

So, if you want to know what the folks in Washington are doing about the economy, I’d start there.

Chris Christie called Tuesday for a special election later this year to decide who will fill the seat of the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg, though he did not say whom he might appoint in the interim.

The Republican governor, during a press conference in Trenton, said he wants to make sure New Jersey voters have a ""voice and a choice""

He set the primary for Aug. 13 and the general election for Oct. 16.

The announcement ended some -- but not all -- of the speculation about Christie's handling of the open seat. Lautenberg, a Democrat and the oldest member of the U.S. Senate, died Monday after complications from viral pneumonia at age 89. While colleagues paid tribute to the legacy of the World War II veteran, political observers launched into heavy speculation on how the popular Republican governor would move to fill the position.

Christie faced conflicting state laws in deciding when to have the election. He could have waited until November 2014, or possibly this November. But Christie said Tuesday it was worth the expense to the state to hold a special election earlier.

""The citizens of New Jersey need to have an elected representative to the United States Senate and have it as soon as possible,"" he said.

With the special election set, Christie will not have his appointee of choice in the Senate for a full 18-month span. However, the governor ensured that a high-profile Democratic Senate candidate would not be running at the top of the ticket this November, when he and other Republicans are running in the main general election. Such a candidate on the ballot could help attract support to other Democrats running for lower-level office.

As for whom he would appoint in the short-term to fill the seat, Christie said he hasn't decided -- but that he wasn't putting ""preconditions"" on that decision.

""I don't dawdle,"" he assured, saying he'd make the call ""relatively quickly.""

Christie, despite his reputation as a brash, no-nonsense executive, has a complicated political profile that makes his decision hard to read.

He's considered a possible contender in the 2016 presidential race, but his status as one of the best-known GOP governors is no guarantee he'll tap a fellow Republican for the seat, according to some analysts.

New Jersey has not elected a Republican to the Senate since 1972. And it hasn't had one serve there at all since 1982, when Republican Gov. Tom Kean appointed Republican Nicholas Brady to finish the term of Democrat Harrison Williams, who resigned amid scandal.

If Christie picks a Republican, he risks upsetting voters who chose a Democrat for the seat.

Yet if Christie picks a Democrat, it may not play well with Republican presidential primary voters, who could see him as disloyal to his party in the run-up to the 2016 primary season.

One New Jersey Republican political consultant told FoxNews.com there's almost no way the governor picks a Democrat.

""It is a sure bet he will pick a Republican,"" the source said. The source said there are ""several short lists"" of GOP candidates to choose from -- of current GOP lawmakers, of non-lawmakers like the sitting lieutenant governor and of former dignitaries.

State Senate President Stephen Sweeney, a Democrat, said Christie should appoint a Democrat, because the seat was held by an elected one. But he said he thinks Christie may be reluctant to appoint a Democrat.

Despite the risks, Christie could consider appointing Newark Mayor Cory Booker, a Democrat who announced earlier this year plans to run for Lautenberg's seat in 2014, said Brigid Harrison, a political scientist at Montclair State University. The move could backfire, she said, but it would help Christie's image with New Jersey Democrats and African-Americans across the country -- especially since history shows it's hard for a Republican to win a Senate seat in New Jersey.

Political analysts say the list of Republican possibilities includes state Sen. Tom Kean Jr.; U.S. Rep. Chris Smith; former Gov. Christie Whitman; state Sen. Joe Kyrillos, who ran for the U.S. Senate last year; state Sen. Kevin O'Toole; or Bill Baroni, the deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

Another possibility could be Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, which would open a spot on Christie's re-election bid ticket this fall for another Republican.

No one has yet begun campaigning for the job publicly.

With Lautenberg's death, the Senate now has 52 Democrats, 45 Republicans and two independents who caucus with the Democrats.

Harry Reid and Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer were not invited by former President George W. Bush to Thursday's high-profile ceremony unveiling his presidential library, Capitol Hill sources told HuffPost.

Hoyer, the Democratic House whip who represents southern Maryland, complained privately to colleagues about the slight earlier Thursday, HuffPost was told. A second House source confirmed the lack of an invitation to Pelosi and Hoyer, and a Reid aide said that the Senate majority leader was not invited.

""I wanna welcome members of Congress here,"" Bush said Thursday, opening his speech in Dallas. ""I thank the speaker for coming.""

The snub is a reminder of the tense relationship that Bush had with Democrats as president. Reid famously called him a ""liar,"" and Pelosi made no attempt to conceal her contempt for him. Bush, for his part, showed little interest in a relationship with congressional Democrats, preferring to marshal only Republican votes on behalf of his agenda.

""Guess there is no section in the library about the failed effort to privatize Social Security,"" quipped one top Democratic aide.

Along with Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), Bush also invited all the living former presidents and the current White House occupant, as well as a host of former top foreign leaders -- Australia's John Howard, Britain's Tony Blair, Israel's Ehud Olmert and Italy's Silvio Berlusconi, who left office in disgrace."

Enzi, a family friend of the Cheneys, appeared caught off-guard. Speaking in Washington, he said he received no heads-up before the announcement. “She said that if I ran she wasn’t going to run, but obviously that wasn’t correct,” Enzi told reporters in the Capitol. “I thought we were friends.”

Enzi’s colleagues were quick to rally to the incumbent, vowing to place the party’s campaign machinery behind his reelection bid. Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said he would use party resources to back Enzi in the primary, even if that meant diverting money from the GOP’s larger effort to win control of the Senate in the fall.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said he would support Enzi, as did his Wyoming colleague, Republican Sen. John Barrasso, who stood by Enzi’s side during his impromptu news conference.

Cheney, the elder of two Cheney daughters, is “very talented and has a bright future,” Barrasso said, but Enzi “is a tremendous senator” deserving of another term.

Enzi, who won office in 1996, has a history of easy reelections, though he conceded he has never been a strong fundraiser. Money shouldn’t be a problem for Cheney, who has both nationwide name recognition and the benefit of the extensive political network her father, a former Wyoming congressman, built over the decades.

Cheney has long been an informal advisor to her father and an outspoken voice in conservative circles, especially on defense and foreign policy issues. During the administration of President George W. Bush and her father, she worked in the State Department and the Agency for International Development in Washington. Shortly after her announcement, Fox News said it would end her role as a paid on-air commentator.

The contest, which promises to be a marquee race in 2014, is unlikely to affect the balance of power in the Senate. Wyoming is a staunchly Republican state, and the winner of the primary seems almost certain to win the general election.

“A bright, shiny object” was how Jennifer Duffy, an analyst with the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, described the contest: Interesting but ultimately a diversion from more important races.

Pollak'],"With 60 Minutes Joint Interview, Obama Suggests Republicans Surrender","Beyond the media fawning over the spectacle of President Barack Obama and outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sitting down for an interview together on 60 Minutes–old rivals, reunited!–there is a message that the president wants to send. Not just the fact that Vice President Joe Biden will not be his first pick for 2016, but also the signal that Republicans ought to forget about a revival in four years: liberalism is here to stay.

Republicans seem to have concluded that their overall revival depends on finding the right candidate to win. If so, they may be in for a long wait. Clinton is so popular right now–with Republicans as well as Democrats–that she is easily the favorite to win in 2016. Freshman Rep. Tom Cotton (R-AR) welcomed her during last week’s Benghazi hearings by telling her he had wished her to win the 2008 Democratic primary; even Paul Ryan suggested on Meet the Press that a President Clinton might have solved the debt crisis by now.

Clinton’s popularity is partly due to the fact that she is so different to Obama. She is not as hostile to opposition, and gives more direct-sounding answers to tough questions, even when she is being just as evasive. She once gave the impression of being more centrist, as well, famously voting in 2002 to authorize the Iraq War–a vote that her rival punished her for on the campaign trail in 2008, claiming he would have voted differently.

In truth, there is not much daylight between the Alinskyite pair. Clinton not only carried out the Obama administration’s awful foreign policy–she did so with enthusiasm. She lectured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for 45 minutes over construction in Jewish parts of Jerusalem, for example, and launched an abortive “reset” in relations with Russia (a gesture that failed even in its theatrics; the button read “overcharge”).

Obama and Clinton are also closely bound together in the Benghazi failure, a scandal whose details are still being kept from the public, even though it is broadly clear that the White House chose not to intervene to save U.S. personnel, and at the same time engineered a cover-up in which both Obama and Clinton agreed to a fraudulent alibi that blamed the deadly attack on an anti-Islam video on YouTube that few had seen.

Yet the two have avoided accountability, since the media failed to pursue the Benghazi scandal before the election (or actively suppressed it), and now that the election is long gone, most have adopted the “what difference does it make?” attitude displayed by Clinton on Capitol Hill last week. She ought to be haunted by those words, and those four dead Americans, for the rest of her career; chances are, however, that she will not.

Obama’s joint interview was likely planned as a gesture of support and unity as the Benghazi scandal returned–however briefly–to the headlines. Yet it also serves a political purpose for the president, as he moves forward with an aggressive and confrontational agenda designed to divide and marginalize opposition and lay the foundation for radical changes, not just for the next four years but the in years beyond.

President Obama wants Republicans to know that the left’s moment is not fleeting; that the changes he makes today will be ratified by the electorate, through Clinton, in 2016 and possibly 2020; in short, that there is no hope for a resurgence and they may as well yield. Whether he succeeds may depend less on how Republicans rebuild themselves, and more on whether Biden–and other Democrats–disrupt the Obama-Clinton alliance."
http://news.yahoo.com/casinos-pot-secession-among-us-ballot-measures-215238421--politics.html,,[],"Casinos, pot, secession among US ballot measures","Voters faced ballot measures Tuesday including whether to approve seven casinos in New York and the fate of Houston's iconic Astrodome. Some of the questions:

___

MARIJUANA AND ALCOHOL

COLORADO: Voters approved a 25 percent tax on newly legal recreational marijuana to fund school construction. Opponents argued the tax rate would benefit black market sales.

MAINE: Voters in Portland, Maine's largest city, declared victory on a measure to legalize possession of recreational amounts of marijuana.

MICHIGAN: Voters in the cities of Ferndale, Jackson and Lansing approved proposals offering some legal protection to users of small amounts of marijuana.

UTAH: Residents in Hyde Park voted to allow beer sales in a proposal that divided the conservative, mostly Mormon city, which had been one of a handful of dry towns left in the state. The ordinance, which passed with 64 percent of the vote, only allows the sale of beer with the alcohol content of 3.2 percent.

___

SECESSION

COLORADO: Eleven rural Colorado counties delivered a divided vote on an effort to form a 51st state called North Colorado. Six counties voted against the idea — including Weld County, whose commissioners spearheaded the effort, citing frustration with the Democrat-led state government that they claim neglects rural interests. Five counties voted for it.

___

GAMBLING

NEW YORK: New York voters bet big on casino gambling as an economic energy shot, agreeing to let seven Las Vegas-style gambling palaces be built around the state, including eventually in New York City.

MASSACHUSETTS: Voters in Palmer rejected Mohegan Sun's plan for a $1 billion resort casino and entertainment complex. And Suffolk Downs says it will reassess plans to build a resort casino at the 78-year-old thoroughbred race track after voters in a Boston neighborhood rejected its proposal and residents of a neighboring community approved it.

___

ASTRODOME'S FUTURE

TEXAS: Voters rejected a plan to authorize bonds to turn the Houston Astrodome, the world's first multipurpose domed stadium, into a giant convention and event center and exhibition space. The outcome means the stadium is likely to be torn down.

Story continues

___

MINIMUM WAGE

WASHINGTON STATE: Early returns showed voters in the small Seattle suburb of SeaTac were passing a measure that would raise the minimum wage for workers at Seattle-Tacoma Airport and nearby large hotels to $15 an hour. Washington state already has the highest minimum wage at $9.19. Washington has a vote-by-mail system in which ballots must be postmarked by Tuesday, so more are left to count.

NEW JERSEY: Voters approved a constitutional amendment raising the state's minimum wage by $1, to $8.25 an hour, and to provide for automatic cost-of-living increases, as 10 other states already do.

___

HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT

MAINE: Residents of South Portland rejected a proposal aimed at blocking the flow of tar sands oil from western Canada to the city. Environmentalists say the thick, gooey oil is more difficult to clean up than conventional crude oil, contains harmful chemicals and releases more greenhouse gases. Supporters of a pipeline say a ban would hamper the growth of existing petroleum-based businesses.

WASHINGTON STATE: A measure that would require mandatory labeling of genetically engineered foods was failing with more than 980,000 ballots counted in unofficial returns. Washington would be the first state to put such requirements in place, and the campaign has shaped up to be one of the costliest in state history. Washington has a vote-by-mail system in which ballots must be postmarked by Tuesday, so more are left to count.

___

GAY RIGHTS

MICHIGAN: Residents of the Detroit suburb of Royal Oak approved an ordinance making it illegal to discriminate based on sexual orientation and a number of other factors.

___

SCHOOL FUNDING

COLORADO: A kindergarten-through-12th-grade school-finance overhaul was rejected; it would have increased income taxes about $1 billion a year and revived a progressive income tax structure abandoned in the 1980s."

On Tuesday, the Washington Examiner reported that unnamed “key Republican operatives” were eager to enlist Robertson to run in a special election for the seat being vacated by departing Rep. Rodney Alexander (R-La.). The congressman represents Louisiana’s 5th district, which includes Robertson’s hometown of West Monroe.

But in a visit later that afternoon to Fox News’ “The Five,” Robertson shot down the rumor, which, regardless of its veracity, has popped up at a convenient time: “Duck Dynasty” returns to A&E for a fourth season Wednesday at 10.

“I heard today that I was doing that,” he said, regarding the supposed plan to get him to enter the race. “Interesting. It’s news to me.”

“I’m kinda busy right now,” he added. “I’ve got a lot of stuff going on.”

When reached for comment by The Times, Alexander’s office would say only that the congressman, who has met both Robertson and his Uncle Si, is a fan of the series and is “proud of the positive attention” it has brought to Ouachita Parish.

While Robertson may not have his sights set on a D.C. career just yet, he did not shy away from talking politics during his appearance.

He expressed his hope that Republican Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal would run for president in 2016, calling him “my guy.”

This is not the first time Robertson’s name has been floated in connection with politics: As an avid hunter and gun owner, Robertson was reportedly under consideration earlier this year for the board of the National Rifle Assn.

On “The Five,” he expressed support for background checks -- a viewpoint that might displease some members of the powerful gun rights group.

“I have a lot of weapons, and every time I have to fill out the paperwork,” he said matter-of-factly.

When asked, Robertson also said he had been offended by then-presidential candidate Barack Obama’s 2008 remarks saying some Americans in depressed areas “cling to guns and religion” in lieu of economic opportunity.

Ultimately, though, Robertson seemed more interested in striking a bipartisan note than in waging a political fight, pointing to the far-reaching success of his own show -- the most popular program in the history of A&E and one of cable TV’s biggest hits -- as evidence that Americans can still agree on some things.

“I see people more together. I see ‘em liking ‘Duck Dynasty,’ so that brings the country together. It really does, ‘cause this show, it’s funny, it breaks through all the demographics,” he said.

(CNN) – President Barack Obama expressed gratitude last week to former President Jimmy Carter's grandson, who had a role in leaking secretly-recorded video of Mitt Romney's infamous ""47%"" comments, James Carter said Thursday on CNN.

Obama met James and his cousin, Georgia state Sen. Jason Carter, last week when the president was in Atlanta for a post-State of the Union visit.

""After (Jason) got his picture taken, he told Obama that I was the one that had found the 47% tape,"" James Carter said on CNN's ""The Situation Room.""

""Then Obama said, 'Hey, great, get over here.' And then he kind of half-embraced me, I want to say, put his arm around me, and we shook hands. He thanked me for my support, several times,"" he said.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

In the video, Romney argued at a private fundraiser in Florida that nearly half of Americans were victims ""dependent"" on the government and would vote for Obama ""no matter what.""

""There are 47% of people who are with him, who are dependent on government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, you-name-it,"" Romney said on the tape.

Adding to his argument about entitlement, Romney said his ""job is not to worry about those people.""

The moment caught on camera is still noted as a major turning point in the race and cited-even by Republicans-as one of the main reasons Romney lost the election. Many potential GOP 2016 contenders have sought to distance themselves from those comments.

Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, for example, said a week after Election Day that in order for the GOP to be ""competitive,"" it has to ""go after 100% of the votes, not 53%. We need to go after every single vote.""

James Carter, an opposition researcher, said he found the video online and got the person responsible for the tape in touch with a writer for the left-leaning magazine Mother Jones.

Asked by CNN's Wolf Blitzer if the person who filmed the video was a guest or a waiter at the event, Carter said, ""It wasn't one of the people who had paid $50,000 to be there. But I'm not going to say anything more than that.""

Carter added he had only seen a small portion of the hour-long tape at the time and had no idea it would blow up as much as it did last September.

""I obviously hoped that everything that I found would make a difference,"" he said. ""It ended up being way beyond my wildest dreams.""

Carter's grandfather, Jimmy Carter, bragged about his grandson's efforts in a separate interview to air Thursday on CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight.""

The former president said he thought the video was a ""pivotal moment"" in the election.

""It was something (Romney) could not deny and it stuck with him for the rest of the election and I think it was a major factor, if not the major factor,"" he said.

""Carter won Obama the election,"" Morgan joked.

""I think so,"" Carter said, laughing.

Carter added he was not at last week's Atlanta event himself, as he was giving his own speech in the same city, but was invited.

Last year, the former president told Morgan that he didn't have much of a relationship with Obama.

Asked if that had changed, Carter said it was ""about the same.""

""He and I respect each other,"" he said.

He Left The Post In April']",Is it 2016 already?,"Jan. 1, 2016, is 859 days away. But, judging from the headlines about the 2016 presidential race blaring across news Web sites and cable channels this August, you might think it were next month.

Hillary Rodham Clinton (along with her husband and daughter) is trying to raise $250 million for the family’s philanthropic foundation prior to 2016, in hopes of avoiding bad optics if she runs for president. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) spent last weekend in Iowa and was in New Hampshire on Friday. Vice President Biden’s political team is making clear that he is thinking seriously about the next presidential contest, and he’ll be in Iowa next month to show just how serious he is.

All of the early machinations by Republicans and Democrats who want to be the next president — even though President Obama won reelection just 292 days ago — have spawned a cottage industry of people wondering whether this is the earliest start ever for a presidential race and whether that’s a good or a bad thing. (Almost everyone, The Fix most definitely excluded, says it’s a bad thing.)

While the 2016 race may have started earlier than most, American presidential politics have been governed for some time by what we like to call The Fix’s Iceberg Theory. Here’s the theory in a sentence: Like an iceberg, the bulk of a presidential race happens underwater, or, out of sight of the average person.

Now, for the longer explanation.

Most regular people — even those living in states such as Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina that play an outsize role in picking presidents — are paying absolutely no attention to what the people who might run in three years’ time for the nation’s highest office are doing right now.

That lack of interest tends to drive a narrative that what happens now simply does not matter for the 2016 race. That’s wrong. Simply because the average voter isn’t aware of what’s happening in presidential politics at the moment doesn’t mean it doesn’t matter.

The truth of presidential races is that the dominant story line for each of the potential candidates is built out of sight of the average voter, crafted years in advance of the political iceberg popping above the surface for everyone to see.

It was during the 2006 midterm elections that buzz started to build around Barack Obama, the freshman senator who was drawing massive crowds everywhere he went to stump or raise money for Democratic candidates.

It was during his 1998 Texas gubernatorial reelection campaign that George W. Bush built and honed the “compassionate conservative” message that he rode to the Republican nomination and the presidency in 2000.

On the other side of the equation, it was in 2006 that then-Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.) was cast as a vanilla centrist, a characterization that played a major part in his decision not to run for president in 2008. Biden battled the perception that he was not serious enough to be the nominee throughout the 2008 race, an impression drawn from years of blunt/impolitic comments.

Fast-forward to the present day. Is Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) a conservative who can broaden the Republican Party’s reach to crucial Hispanic voters or a moderate in conservative’s clothing, as evidenced by his key involvement in the Senate immigration bill? Is New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) a blunt-talking problem solver or a bullying blowhard? Is Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.) a danger to the GOP or its savior? Is Clinton the inevitable nominee or the same flawed politician that Obama exposed during the 2008 Democratic primaries?

All of these questions will be answered — or come close to being answered — before a single vote is cast — and, in many cases, before the average person even begins to think about the 2016 presidential race.

And it’s not just narratives that get formed years in advance of actual votes. Building a national fundraising operation that can collect tens — if not hundreds — of millions of dollars takes massive amounts of time. Constructing a political team that has the right combination of experience and fresh-eyed insight can be the work of a political lifetime. Courting key activists in Iowa or New Hampshire or South Carolina or Nevada is an arduous process in which time spent can make all the difference.

Ignoring the iceberg nature of the presidential race then can have huge negative consequences. In 2008, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee (R) became the momentum candidate after winning the Iowa caucuses. But because he and his team either didn’t understand or ignored the iceberg theory, he was unable to build on that momentum in New Hampshire, where he finished a distant third. After a runner-up showing in South Carolina, Huckabee’s chances at the nomination vanished.

Smart candidates — and their campaigns — understand that the bulk of the work that goes into winning the presidential nomination happens well out of sight of a single voter. Momentum still matters — a lot — but without a structure to take advantage of that momentum, it can peter out as quickly as it comes. And if the primary fight drags out — a la the 2008 Democratic primaries or the 2012 Republican fight — what a candidate and his/her campaign team did years before when no voters were watching can be the difference between winning and losing.

If you remember one thing about the presidential race then, remember this: What’s going on below the surface can — and almost always does — make or break the candidates."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/04/28/in-first-black-voter-turnout-rate-passes-whites/,2013-04-28 00:00:00,[],Voter analysis shows Obama would have lost in 2012 if black turnout had mirrored 2008,"America's blacks voted at a higher rate than other minority groups in 2012 and by most measures surpassed the white turnout for the first time, reflecting a deeply polarized presidential election in which blacks strongly supported Barack Obama while many whites stayed home.

Had people voted last November at the same rates they did in 2004, when black turnout was below its current historic levels, Republican Mitt Romney would have won narrowly, according to an analysis conducted for The Associated Press.

Census data and exit polling show that whites and blacks will remain the two largest racial groups of eligible voters for the next decade. Last year's heavy black turnout came despite concerns about the effect of new voter-identification laws on minority voting, outweighed by the desire to re-elect the first black president.

William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, analyzed the 2012 elections for the AP using census data on eligible voters and turnout, along with November's exit polling. He estimated total votes for Obama and Romney under a scenario where 2012 turnout rates for all racial groups matched those in 2004. Overall, 2012 voter turnout was roughly 58 percent, down from 62 percent in 2008 and 60 percent in 2004.

The analysis also used population projections to estimate the shares of eligible voters by race group through 2030. The numbers are supplemented with material from the Pew Research Center and George Mason University associate professor Michael McDonald, a leader in the field of voter turnout who separately reviewed aggregate turnout levels across states, as well as AP interviews with the Census Bureau and other experts. The bureau is scheduled to release data on voter turnout in May.

Overall, the findings represent a tipping point for blacks, who for much of America's history were disenfranchised and then effectively barred from voting until passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965.

But the numbers also offer a cautionary note to both Democrats and Republicans after Obama won in November with a historically low percentage of white supporters. While Latinos are now the biggest driver of U.S. population growth, they still trail whites and blacks in turnout and electoral share, because many of the Hispanics in the country are children or noncitizens.

In recent weeks, Republican leaders have urged a ""year-round effort"" to engage black and other minority voters, describing a grim future if their party does not expand its core support beyond white males.

The 2012 data suggest Romney was a particularly weak GOP candidate, unable to motivate white voters let alone attract significant black or Latino support. Obama's personal appeal and the slowly improving economy helped overcome doubts and spur record levels of minority voters in a way that may not be easily replicated for Democrats soon.

Romney would have erased Obama's nearly 5 million-vote victory margin and narrowly won the popular vote if voters had turned out as they did in 2004, according to Frey's analysis. Then, white turnout was slightly higher and black voting lower.

More significantly, the battleground states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Florida and Colorado would have tipped in favor of Romney, handing him the presidency if the outcome of other states remained the same.

""The 2012 turnout is a milestone for blacks and a huge potential turning point,"" said Andra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University who has written extensively on black politicians. ""What it suggests is that there is an `Obama effect' where people were motivated to support Barack Obama. But it also means that black turnout may not always be higher, if future races aren't as salient.""

Whit Ayres, a GOP consultant who is advising GOP Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a possible 2016 presidential contender, says the last election reaffirmed that the Republican Party needs ""a new message, a new messenger and a new tone."" Change within the party need not be ""lock, stock and barrel,"" Ayres said, but policy shifts such as GOP support for broad immigration legislation will be important to woo minority voters over the longer term.

""It remains to be seen how successful Democrats are if you don't have Barack Obama at the top of the ticket,"" he said.

------

In Ohio, a battleground state where the share of eligible black voters is more than triple that of other minorities, 27-year-old Lauren Howie of Cleveland didn't start out thrilled with Obama in 2012. She felt he didn't deliver on promises to help students reduce college debt, promote women's rights and address climate change, she said. But she became determined to support Obama as she compared him with Romney.

""I got the feeling Mitt Romney couldn't care less about me and my fellow African-Americans,"" said Howie, an administrative assistant at Case Western Reserve University's medical school who is paying off college debt.

Howie said she saw some Romney comments as insensitive to the needs of the poor. ""A white Mormon swimming in money with offshore accounts buying up companies and laying off their employees just doesn't quite fit my idea of a president,"" she said. ""Bottom line, Romney was not someone I was willing to trust with my future.""

The numbers show how population growth will translate into changes in who votes over the coming decade:

-- The gap between non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black turnout in 2008 was the smallest on record, with voter turnout at 66.1 percent and 65.2 percent, respectively; turnout for Latinos and non-Hispanic Asians trailed at 50 percent and 47 percent. Rough calculations suggest that in 2012, 2 million to 5 million fewer whites voted compared with 2008, even though the pool of eligible white voters had increased.

-- Unlike other minority groups, the rise in voting for the slow-growing black population is due to higher turnout. While blacks make up 12 percent of the share of eligible voters, they represented 13 percent of total 2012 votes cast, according to exit polling. That was a repeat of 2008, when blacks ""outperformed"" their eligible voter share for the first time on record.

-- White voters also outperformed their eligible vote share, but not at the levels seen in years past. In 2012, whites represented 72 percent of total votes cast, compared to their 71.1 percent eligible vote share. As recently as 2004, whites typically outperformed their eligible vote share by at least 2 percentage points. McDonald notes that in 2012, states with significant black populations did not experience as much of a turnout decline as other states. That would indicate a lower turnout for whites last November since overall voter turnout declined.

-- Latinos now make up 17 percent of the population but 11 percent of eligible voters, due to a younger median age and lower rates of citizenship and voter registration. Because of lower turnout, they represented just 10 percent of total 2012 votes cast. Despite their fast growth, Latinos aren't projected to surpass the share of eligible black voters until 2024, when each group will be roughly 13 percent. By then, 1 in 3 eligible voters will be nonwhite.

-- In 2026, the total Latino share of voters could jump to as high as 16 percent, if nearly 11 million immigrants here illegally become eligible for U.S. citizenship. Under a proposed bill in the Senate, those immigrants would have a 13-year path to citizenship. The share of eligible white voters could shrink to less than 64 percent in that scenario. An estimated 80 percent of immigrants here illegally, or 8.8 million, are Latino, although not all will meet the additional requirements to become citizens.

""The 2008 election was the first year when the minority vote was important to electing a U.S. president. By 2024, their vote will be essential to victory,"" Frey said. ""Democrats will be looking at a landslide going into 2028 if the new Hispanic voters continue to favor Democrats.""

------

Even with demographics seeming to favor Democrats in the long term, it's unclear whether Obama's coalition will hold if blacks or younger voters become less motivated to vote or decide to switch parties.

Minority turnout tends to drop in midterm congressional elections, contributing to larger GOP victories as happened in 2010, when House control flipped to Republicans.

The economy and policy matter. Exit polling shows that even with Obama's re-election, voter support for a government that does more to solve problems declined from 51 percent in 2008 to 43 percent last year, bolstering the view among Republicans that their core principles of reducing government are sound.

The party's ""Growth and Opportunity Project"" report released last month by national leaders suggests that Latinos and Asians could become more receptive to GOP policies once comprehensive immigration legislation is passed.

Whether the economy continues its slow recovery also will shape voter opinion, including among blacks, who have the highest rate of unemployment.

Since the election, optimism among nonwhites about the direction of the country and the economy has waned, although support for Obama has held steady. In an October AP-GfK poll, 63 percent of nonwhites said the nation was heading in the right direction; that's dropped to 52 percent in a new AP-GfK poll. Among non-Hispanic whites, however, the numbers are about the same as in October, at 28 percent.

Democrats in Congress merit far lower approval ratings among nonwhites than does the president, with 49 percent approving of congressional Democrats and 74 percent approving of Obama.

William Galston, a former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton, says that in previous elections where an enduring majority of voters came to support one party, the president winning re-election -- William McKinley in 1900, Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936 and Ronald Reagan in 1984 -- attracted a larger turnout over his original election and also received a higher vote total and a higher share of the popular vote. None of those occurred for Obama in 2012.

Only once in the last 60 years has a political party been successful in holding the presidency more than eight years -- Republicans from 1980-1992.

""This doesn't prove that Obama's presidency won't turn out to be the harbinger of a new political order,"" Galston says. ""But it does warrant some analytical caution.""

Early polling suggests that Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton could come close in 2016 to generating the level of support among nonwhites as Obama did in November, when he won 80 percent of their vote. In a Fox News poll in February, 75 percent of nonwhites said they thought Clinton would make a good president, outpacing the 58 percent who said that about Vice President Joe Biden.

Benjamin Todd Jealous, president of the NAACP, predicts closely fought elections in the near term and worries that GOP-controlled state legislatures will step up efforts to pass voter ID and other restrictions to deter blacks and other minorities from voting. In 2012, courts blocked or delayed several of those voter ID laws and African-Americans were able to turn out in large numbers only after a very determined get-out-the-vote effort by the Obama campaign and black groups, he said.

Jealous says the 2014 midterm election will be the real bellwether for black turnout. ""Black turnout set records this year despite record attempts to suppress the black vote,"" he said."

You're an average voter in Pennsylvania. The night before Election Day, your wallet goes missing, leaving you without immediate access to any of the identification you'll need to vote at your local precinct the following morning. This would be a problem under <a href=""http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/elections/voter-id.aspx#PA"" target=""_hplink"">Pennsylvania's proposed photo ID law</a>, since <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pennsylvania-voter-id-ruling_n_1919187"" target=""_hplink"">blocked by a state judge</a>. While many people in this situation may have backup forms of identification, <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pennsylvania-voter-id-law_n_1652469"" target=""_hplink"">studies have shown</a> that a significant percentage of would-be voters don't. The state's safeguard against the immediate disenfranchisement of people in this situation would be a provisional ballot cast on the day of the election. But this doesn't mean your vote counts, yet. Anyone who casts a provisional ballot is required to ""appear in person at the county board of elections"" within six days of the vote to provide proof that their ballot was valid. If you're able to take time away from your job to do this, the process still requires a would-be voter to either show up with valid ID -- a replacement driver's license <a href=""http://www.dmv.state.pa.us/fees/index.shtml"" target=""_hplink"">would cost $36</a> and considerable time -- or to sign an affirmation that you are indigent and not able to afford the fees associated with acquiring a photo ID. Even if you make a rapid and somewhat expensive turnaround to get a replacement ID -- or alternatively swear under oath that you are too poor to pay for such a document -- there is no guarantee that your vote will end up counting. Many elections are largely decided before provisional voters have a chance to verify their validity, which could serve to discouraging them from following up with election officials or leave them effectively disenfranchised. In 2008, <a href=""http://www.eac.gov/assets/1/Documents/2008 Election Administration and Voting Survey EAVS Report.pdf"" target=""_hplink"">only 61.8 percent</a> of all provisional ballots cast were fully counted.

Mr. Reid, a former policeman, eagerly displayed his sportsman’s enthusiasm to the voters.

It turned out his solidarity with the N.R.A. extended to quietly inserting an amendment that year into President Obama’s health care reform law that restricted the ability of physicians to gather data about their patients’ use of firearms.

The provision, reported last month in The Washington Post, reflected the N.R.A.’s long-running obsession with preventing gun-related deaths and injuries from being studied as a major public health problem that should be controlled the way government monitors risks connected to automobiles, airplanes and consumer products. For decades, lawmakers have let the gun lobby block financing for and limit gun research by the National Institutes of Health and other agencies.

Mr. Reid’s office insisted the amendment was intended to head off N.R.A. opposition to health care reform. In any case, mass shootings as a public health threat should be a major part of the debate over gun reform taking shape after the massacre of schoolchildren and teachers in Newtown, Conn. An adviser to Mr. Reid, who will be at the center of any Senate action, told CNN that the senator is now “in a different place” on the gun control issue."

People aren’t turning out for primaries because they work for a living, and those who do turn out are professional activists. Today, if you have somebody who ultimately gets through the obstacle course, they’re going to lack the one ingredient in such need today: authenticity.

That he won a rousing reelection is more than icing on the cake, it is affirmation that Obama has changed our Nation in a profound way for all time.

But, it is quite clear that President Obama is looking for more than this regarding his legacy. Does he still have dreams of ""transforming"" politics—what I have derisively referred to as the Post Partisan Unity Schtick? It seems not.

Then what can he be hoping to achieve in terms of legacy?

Well, as the philosopher Yogi Berra has taught us, it's hard to make predictions, especially about the future. But the intrepid amongst us do so without fear. (And if you are a Washington pundit, with no reason to fear. Being wrong about everything is a feature, not a bug for the DC pundit.)

Obama's Legacy

History and legacy are strange things. They are more malleable than conventional wisdom would have. One of the subjects that has been of interest of mine has been the Lost Cause, especially its relationship to the reputation of Robert E. Lee, both as a general and as a human being. While this subject should be the topic of a series of posts, I merely note for this post that Robert E. Lee's legacy was the vehicle of a political movement, as well as a question of pride. But to prove the malleability of history, Lee's reputation as a general has suffered greatly when separated from the political motivations that spurred the creation of the Marble Man.

President Obama's legacy will, in the short term, be a political football. If the economy is in good shape come 2016, Democrats will be rushing to burnish it as much as possible. But over the longer term, burnishing President Obama will become secondary to burnishing whatever part of the policy legacy President Obama is able to create is conducive to successful Democratic politics.

FDR is still an icon to Democrats 80 years after the commencement of his presidency because his policy legacy, especially Social Security, is the centerpiece of what the Democratic Party is thought to be about. In addition, FDR's realignment of national politics stood for a very long time. President Obama's legacy will be viewed from this twin perspective.

The Bully Pulpit

President Obama once controversially said:



I don't want to present myself as some sort of singular figure. I think part of what is different is the times. I do think that, for example, the 1980 election was different. I think Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not. He put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it. They felt like with all the excesses of the 60s and the 70s and government had grown and grown but there wasn't much sense of accountability in terms of how it was operating. I think he tapped into what people were already feeling. Which is we want clarity, we want optimism, we want a return to that sense of dynamism and entrepreneurship that had been missing.""

I understood his point, though I think it was inartfully delivered. Ronald Reagan changed the political conversation in the country. And the point goes to the power of the bully pulpit, properly understood. Too many have misunderstood the argument of the bully pulpit as being the power to force congresspersons from the opposing party (or even from the president's party) to bend to the president's will.

That is a faulty assumption. The power of the bully pulpit is to drive the national political conversation. Of course, some presidents are not good at this part of the job and have only fleeting influence. Some are constrained by their times (Obama made this point as well.)

But sometimes presidents change the political conversation in a lasting and meaningful way. Reagan did that. (Bill Clinton did not and could not because of the times in which he governed. Clinton's achievements did not include changing the national political conversation in a lasting and meaningful way.) What Reagan did was make Calhounism the dominant ideology of the Republican Party.

Can President Obama change the national political conversation? Is he trying to? I think he is. So does Ross Douthat, in reaction to President Obama's Second Inaugural Address:



This does seem like a sense in which, come what may in 2016 and beyond, Obama is already more like Reagan than he is like any other recent president of either party. His substantive achievements are still open to question, but he really has succeeded in pushing a philosophical reorientation of American domestic politics—tentatively in 2008, explicitly in 2012, and triumphantly in Monday’s address—that neither Bill Clinton nor George W. Bush ever really attempted.

If the President does have a lasting effect on the political conversation regarding government, this would be a huge legacy item.

Policy Legacy

The Supreme Court

A president's second term does not often offer significant policy legacy opportunities. Mostly, a president's second term is an exercise in attempting to consolidate and defend policy victories of the first term. However, there is one area that has offered presidents legacy shaping opportunities—the Supreme Court. Will Obama have such opportunities? We should never wish ill health on anyone, but the fact is Obama's legacy shaping opportunities regarding the Court are entirely dependent on the health of its extreme right wing justices. They certainly will not retire voluntarily. (I believe the older non-conservative members (Ginsburg and Breyer) should retire to enable the President to name two younger persons for the Court.)

Can President Obama positively shape the Court in an unexpected way? We can't know for sure, but justices with innovative progressive ideas about the Constitution are not likely to be nominated in this term for the simple reason that such a nomination might not be confirmed. It is not fair to ask the President to risk it in my view.

But there is nothing special about this legacy. The opportunity either arises or it does not. It is out of the president's control.

The Affordable Care Act

What is in his control? Not everything or in toto, ANYTHING. But he can do a lot. Consider his most important substantive new policy—the Affordable Care Act. For the most part, the ACA has not been implemented. In my view, this should be the ""new"" policy priority for the Obama Administration. The longevity of ACA is not assured at this time. Successful implementation is critical to having ACA stand for a significant time (and to improving it in progressive ways.) If the second term of President Obama's presidency does nothing ""new"" except successfully implement ACA, it will have accomplished a big f*cking deal.

Future Political Success for the Democratic Party: A Third Democratic Presidential Term

I place this in policy goals because the most important protection to President Obama's legacy will come from delivering political success to the Democratic Party in the near future. Especially holding the White House in 2016.

But what can President Obama do to help there? The answer is obvious—everything he can to help average Americans in these times of economic uncertainty and difficulty. Yes, for politics, it is the economy, stupid.

Of course this is an incomplete list of of policy initiatives and goals that the second term of the Obama presidency can impact, but I do think it includes the most important that are achievable (climate change is more of a bully pulpit goal it seems to me, though it should be noted the president promised EPA action if the Congress did not act. But, as I state above, the most important accomplishment the president can achieve regarding climate change in his second term is to positively impact the future political success of the Democratic Party.)

Assessing the Legacy of the Obama Presidency

As I stated at the outset, the historic nature of the Obama presidency is assured. It will remain its most important legacy no matter what he accomplishes. That said, President Obama clearly is aiming for more than that, and rightfully so.

In terms of achievements, additions to the first term successes seem unlikely, However, successfully preserving and implementing these successes is essential. Absent that, the Obama legacy will be light in terms of policy.

The most important achievement of an Obama second term will be the creation of a political climate that will put the 2016 Dem candidate for President in a good position to win a third Democratic term.

As Markos has noted, Hillary Clinton is well positioned to win that third term. But there are no guarantees in life or politics, and, oddly enough, the most important legacy issue for the second Obama term will be his successor. Helping average Americans in these hard economic times will have the biggest impact on that."

Period. They define who they are by how much that hate Obama. Good luck working with that.

Saying Obama should ""Show more leadership"" is like saying he should be more pro-active and think outside the box, its' meaningless bullshit designed to shift the blame from the hardline psychosis of the GOP onto the President, who somehow has the power to make Republicans stop acting insane but just won't use it. And I will remind you that nearly every hack journalist that is saying Obama should ""Show more leadership"" are the same people who praised Bush's leadership while he was creating the problems that Congressional Republicans refuse to allow Obama to address in any way at all.

This diary started as a tweet and deserved more, but the title explains itself. Barack Obama is the President of the United States, he is not the Asshole Whisperer. He can not force Republicans to abandon a set of policies that has destroyed their own brand, nor can he force them to abandon a set of policies that even the Pope is against at this point. Obama can not force the GOP to grow up and moderate from the platform Romney/Ryan lost so badly on, but maybe, just maybe, if those journalists calling on Obama to ""show leadership"" would explain to their audiences how and why the GOP are filibustering everything they can just to defeat Obama despite the pain it causes average Americans, maybe that would help. But who the hell am I kidding, that would require lazy journalists to place blame on Congressional Republicans, and that just isn't going to happen anytime soon.

So we have a broken Government that can do nothing because that is how Mitch McConnell and John Boehner like it. Blaming Obama on Republicans being Republicans is just stupid. Maybe instead of holding Obama accountable for Congressional Republicans bad behavior we could try doing what Ceaser Milan does, and by that I mean that every time Congressional Republicans shit the floor journalists should rub John Boehner's nose in it instead of looking at Obama like it is his fault that Republican Cujo predictably mauled the economy again.

Oops, no, you missed it.","Oh. Oh dear. (Right Wing Watch)

Approximately 100 conservative activists gathered in front of the White House on Tuesday for a kickoff of what organizers call ""the second American revolution."" The event could easily have been mistaken for a tea party rally, with American and Gadsden flags, a smattering of biker jackets and a few lawn chairs. Freedom Watch founder Larry Klayman, who emceed the event, told attendees if President Barack Obama does not resign by Nov. 29, conservative activists will meet in Philadelphia to elect a shadow government.

Oh, heavens, whatever shall become of our fair republic Two people per state? That's not a revolution, that's a Senate. If this shadow government is going to contain a full House as well, they're going to have to start appointing pets and toasters.

You have probably heard of Larry Klayman before. If not, no worries—but I should clarify that this is the loudmouthed neorevolutionary wingnut that has not been arrested for possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms, not the one who has. Yes, it can get confusing. While the other revolutionary is all about being able to carry guns wherever you want because you never know when the mushrooms will kick in, this one is still on the whole Obama is possibly a Kenyan kick, plus also ""Benghazi-gate"" and the shutting down of our precious war memorials, etc., and so forth.

Alright, so Mr. Klayman has said that if President Obama does not resign by the sacred date of Black Friday, he and other likeminded crackpots will immediately meet, perhaps on what shall henceforth be known as Honky Saturday, to elect their own shadow government. One that is not from Kenya, and is not a secret Musslim and so forth:



Bishop Dan Johnson of the Heart of Fire Church in Louisville, Ky., prayed with ralliers, asking God to ""cause [elected officials] to get on their knees, not to Allah, but to God almighty."" In his prayer, Johnson denounced homosexuality, permissive parenting, pornography and welfare.

""We have a scoundrel living in that building,"" [Former Rep. Bob Barr] said, pointing at the White House, ""and need to do something about it.""

In addition to a bewigged George Washington impersonator and the editor of conspiracy website World Net Daily Joseph Farah because, well, duh, there was also a former congressman on hand to lend the proceedings another few shovelfuls of skin-crawling creepiness.Ew, I thought that fellow had died. I suppose he might have, and his speech could have just been gas escaping—please get on that hypothesis, Mr. Farah, America demands an answer.

So there you go: the revolution is upon us, at least once they decide between Denny's and Olive Garden for the ceremonies. Never have so few given so little to scream so loudly—true patriots, all. Someday each one of them will be commemorated on trading cards, a little paperboard sea of revolutionary flags and trucker hats.

God speed, heroes, and remember to leave the 'shrooms at home.

Both were financed with independent donations not controlled by the candidates.

Villaraigosa, who has not made an endorsement in the race, said a TV ad from the super PAC Lots of People Who Support Eric Garcetti falsely portrayed Greuel as a supporter of Proposition 187, the 1994 state ballot measure that sought to deny illegal immigrants access to public education and other services.

“That commercial is out of line, out of step with a diverse city and has no room in politics,” he said.

FULL COVERAGE: L.A.'s race for mayor

Villaraigosa also assailed a Spanish-language commercial financed by a Greuel backer for making “outrageous claims” about Garcetti’s ancestry. The mayor said it wrongly linked Garcetti with Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the Arizona law enforcement official who has supported crackdowns on illegal immigrants.

“I know Eric Garcetti. Eric Garcetti does not support the policies of self-deportation or the policies of Sheriff Joe Arpaio,” Villaraigosa said.

The mayor’s comments came as Garcetti sought to energize Democratic voters by campaigning with one of President Obama’s top advisors, David Axelrod, an apparent effort to counter Greuel’s endorsement by former President Clinton. Clinton, a hugely popular figure among Democrats, has appeared with Greuel and been featured in ads supporting her candidacy.

Obama has stayed neutral in the race between two Democrats. But at an Eastside rally, Axelrod underscored Garcetti’s ties to the current president. He recalled meeting Garcetti on a cold day in Iowa, where the young councilman had gone to support Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.

“Eric has become a tremendous ally for the president,” the former White House advisor said, noting that Garcetti promoted Obama’s healthcare and immigration reform agenda around the country. He credited Garcetti with leading a revival of the Hollywood, Echo Park and Silver Lake communities. “The best record of job growth in L.A. city,” he said.

Garcetti had hoped that Axelrod would be the focus of the day. But he found himself starting the day by defending his opponents’ record against the television ad created by the super PAC supporting his election.

“During the anti-immigrant era of Pete Wilson, Wendy Greuel was a Republican,” the ad says, and seeks to tie Greuel to Proposition 187.

Advertisement

Rick Jacobs, co-chairman of the independent group airing the ad, said he would not remove the anti-Greuel spot because it is accurate. “Wendy Greuel was a Republican for not one, not two but 13 years. She was a Republican when Pete Wilson ran for governor and won. Had he not won in 1990, there would not have been a Prop. 187,” Jacobs said. Greuel said she did not vote for Wilson in the 1990 gubernatorial election.

Garcetti denounced the ad on Twitter, stating: “I trust Wendy Greuel when she says she was not for Prop. 187. I hope everybody inside and outside the campaigns will act responsibly.”

Greuel said that wasn’t enough. She criticized Garcetti for refusing to join her request for all groups to halt all negative ads. “He said no, and I can see why,” Greuel said after speaking to the Sherman Oaks Chamber of Commerce. “Because … we’ve seen in the last few days that they’re trying to mislead the public, particularly in the Latino community.”

Greuel, for her part, faced questions about another independent ad directed at Latinos, which questions Garcetti’s loyalty to Latinos and shows him sneering while surrounded by flames. Dr. Feliciano Serrano, who paid for the ad, did not return a call seeking comment.

Backers of Garcetti said that it is Greuel’s supporters who have misled the Latino community by sending mailers in Spanish and English, saying that she will enact an increase in the minimum wage from $8 to $15 per hour. The Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, which has put $560,000 into a super PAC supporting Greuel and other candidates, has targeted Latino voters with the minimum wage message.

At the Sherman Oaks meeting, Greuel again took time to correct the record, saying she only supports a $15 hourly wage for workers in large hotels.

The back and forth Thursday illustrated the challenges for candidates in a campaign in which their biggest financial supporters — independent outside groups — are prohibited from coordinating with them but advance attacks that force them to alter their own tactics and messages.

You can be sure that Republicans are sharpening their talking points for the upcoming campaigns. We’ll likely be hearing all about a supposed lackluster economy, tepid employment picture, and that demonic “Obamacare.” Now is the time, therefore, for Democrats and progressives to hone their arguments and talking points to counter those of the Republicans and, better yet, to drive the conversation from the get-go. Here are three words to use against the Republicans:

“They Did Nothing.” It’s that simple. The Republicans on the economy? “They did nothing.” On jobs? “They did nothing.” Rebuilding America’s crumbling roads and bridges to help businesses move their products? “They did nothing.” Immigration? “They did nothing.” Bringing American jobs back home instead of shipping them overseas? “They did nothing.” Keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, terrorists and the mentally ill? “They did nothing.”* The list goes on and on. And to be clear, the Democrats must articulate their positive agenda. In fact, President Obama has taken to the road to do just that. Saying the Republicans did nothing only makes sense if Democrats clearly explain what solutions they stand for and on which the Republicans should work, with some compromise and cooperation by both sides.

Surely, you say, Republicans and conservatives will argue that their lawmakers have done something, and we need to be prepared for that defense. Okay, here’s what Republicans in Congress have done: abortion bills. Votes to repeal “Obamacare.” Phony ""scandals."" Budgetary hostage taking. Filibustering and blocking even the basic functions of our democracy. That’s during the few days in between their lengthy taxpayer-paid vacations when they’re even in session. And if you want to see what the extreme Republicans (yes, ""extreme"" should be used frequently to modify ""Republican"") do when they have the votes, look no further than Republican-run states like Texas.

So feel free to begin the 2014 election argument. You have a good one to make.

*If you use the phrase out of context, such as on a bumper sticker, simply replace “They” with “Republicans.”

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']",Supreme Court may strike new blow to campaign funding laws,"WASHINGTON — In what may be Act 2 in the decline and fall of campaign funding laws, the Supreme Court appears poised to lift the lid on the total amount the wealthy can give directly to all candidates and political parties.

Increasingly, the money that funds election races for Congress and the presidency comes from a small sliver of the very rich, what the Sunlight Foundation called the “elite class that serves as gatekeepers of public office in the United States.” The nonpartisan group has tracked how a growing share of election money comes from the top 1% of the wealthiest Americans.

In the first major case of its new term, the court could give those donors even more clout with lawmakers and their parties. The issue is whether federal limits, not on contributions to individual races but on how much a donor can give to all candidates for Congress or party committees in a particular election cycle, violate the right of free speech.

Three years ago, the current court under Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said in the Citizens United case that “independent” spending on election races was protected free speech and struck down long-standing bans on such spending by corporations and unions.

But until now, the court’s conservatives have not joined together to strike down the Watergate-era limits on how much donors can give directly to candidates or party committees.

That has left the law in an odd posture. Wealthy people who want to influence campaign races can give millions of dollars to “super PACs” and other groups that pay for “independent” election ads, but they are barred by law from giving more than $48,600 total to all members of Congress or more than $74,600 to various party committees.

That may be about to change. On Oct. 8, the Supreme Court will take up an appeal from the Republican National Committee, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Alabama businessman Shaun McCutcheon, who say contributions should be treated as “core political speech.” If they win, wealthy Republicans or Democrats could each give as much as $3.6 million total by giving the maximum amount to all of their party committees and candidates. This money could be funneled by party leaders into a close race or races, tipping the balance of power in Congress.

Defenders of the election laws have been sounding the alarm. “It would be terrible for our democracy … if one politician could directly solicit $3.6 million from a single donor,” said Lawrence Norden, an election law expert with the Brennan Center, a liberal legal advocacy group in New York. “That is 70 times the median income for an American family. It would mean a tiny, tiny group of donors would wield unprecedented power and influence.”

But the total limit on contributions stands on shaky ground. In recent opinions, Roberts has said the government may not try to “level the playing field” between candidates or prevent well-funded candidates from using their financial advantage to dominate the airwaves. The only justification for limiting contributions, the court has said, is to prevent “corruption or the appearance of corruption.”

And the challengers say there is no threat of corruption if one wealthy person gives the maximum $5,200 to each of more than 460 candidates who run for the House and Senate next year.

“This is a limit on how many candidates you support, not on how much you give them,” said James Bopp Jr., an attorney for the Republican National Committee. He cites the case of McCutcheon, an Alabama man who gave a total of $33,000 to various Republican candidates for Congress last year and wanted to give $21,000 more. He was stopped by the legal limit on total contributions to candidates, which now stands at $48,600.

McCutcheon “holds firm convictions on the proper role of government” and “opposes numerous and ill-conceived and overreaching laws,” he told the court, and he wants more “federal officeholders who share his beliefs.”

Bopp said a court decision lifting the total contributions limit would not give an unfair advantage to either side in American politics. “There are as many rich liberal people as rich conservative people,” he said.

Lee Drutman, a researcher at the Sunlight Foundation, disagrees. “The data shows there are more big donors on the right than on the left,” he said.

But a win for McCutcheon and the Republican National Committee would seemingly affect only a few thousand generous givers. Last year, about 1,700 donors bumped up against the limit on contributions to party committees. And only about 600 donors hit the maximum of $48,600 in contributions to all candidates.

The partisan divide on the campaign funding limits is stark and clear. The Republican campaign committees have joined in urging the court to strike down the limits, while House Democrats have joined the Obama administration in defending them. The court has been similarly divided, with the five Republican appointees joining recent rulings to strike down limits, while the four Democratic appointees dissented.

Fred Wertheimer, a longtime champion of the campaign funding laws, remains optimistic that the limits will survive — and because of Roberts.

Roberts “is likely to be the key vote in deciding this case,” Wertheimer said, and he “has a different record on campaign finance issues than his conservative colleagues.”

Wertheimer added, however: “If the Supreme Court reverses its past position and strikes down the long-standing aggregate contribution limits, it will open the door wide to corruption of our federal officeholders and government decisions.”

The source of the argument seems to boil down to what it means to be a true conservative in the modern Republican Party, and whether the party needs to change in order to broaden its appeal, particularly to Latino voters.

Disagreement boiled over most publicly when a few hundred delegates attempted to seat a convention chairman who would help them remove Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) from the party. Graham, who has earned a place in Washington as one of the key players in the party establishment and a frequent critic of the Obama administration’s foreign policy, faced resistance from conservatives upset with his work to overhaul the nation’s immigration laws and his support for President Obama’s Supreme Court nominees.

Graham is up for reelection next year, but many of his critics hope a more genuinely conservative candidate will emerge to challenge him in a primary.

The senator acknowledged his critics when he spoke onstage, but warned them: “We’re going to end up in the same boat, whether you like it or not, because there’s holes in the other boat.”

When he turned to immigration, Graham framed the forthcoming debate as critical to ensuring the nation’s security — and the future of the GOP. Citing the immigration status of the suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing, he said the Obama administration had poorly enforced current laws and failed to notice that one of the suspect’s friends had overstayed a student visa.

The crowd appeared to be in step with Graham until he began discussing what to do about the legal status of more than 11 million illegal immigrants. Almost immediately, several in the crowd shouted: “No amnesty!”

“No amnesty, I’ve got it,” he said, cutting them off. “Now here’s the question: After 2012, the question for this party is: Do you believe that we can grow the vote among all sectors of this country?”

Graham’s message was clear: Reforming the nation’s immigration laws is critical to increasing GOP support among the fast-growing Hispanic population, which generally espouses the socially conservative views held by Republicans anyway and could very well eventually support the party’s candidates.

“Conservatism is an asset, not a liability,” Graham said. “You don’t have to be embarrassed about your social conservatism. You just have to talk about it in ways that we can grow this party.”

Finding a way to expand the party’s appeal was clearly on the minds of delegates Saturday, with many conflicted over who should lead the party into the future.

“They have to be strong, honest, able to stand up for what you believe in and not be intimidated,” said Stephanie McKay, a legal aide from Bishopville, S.C. “Without someone like that, nothing’s going to change.”

Dorian Bucholz, a first-time delegate from Charleston, S.C., said determining the party’s next presidential nominee will be difficult “because there aren’t really faces sticking out being strong conservatives. But we’ve got to get our act together because 2016 is going to come fast.”

Almost to a person, the delegates agreed that they want new blood.

“Our party’s ‘it’s your turn’ attitude is over for presidential candidates,” said Walter Whetsell, a GOP political consultant who has worked for several presidential candidates. “It’s never paid dividends for us. These young, fresh faces have a legitimate shot at winning over these people.”

One of those newer faces is freshman Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), who fueled speculation about his own ambitions by speaking Friday at the state party’s annual Silver Elephant Dinner. Pacing the stage like a televangelist, he earned loud applause by discounting his Harvard Law education, joking about the missteps of Vice President Biden and blasting Obama for his health-care law and the Justice Department’s botched Fast and Furious gun-running operation.

Clearly wooing the home-state crowd, Cruz recounted the stories of William Travis and James Bonham, two South Carolina-born officers who led the ill-fated Battle of the Alamo.

“Thank you for the support South Carolina has given, then and now, as we fight side by side,” he said.

By Saturday morning, however, several people said Cruz should wait.

“He’s only been in office about five months,” said Randall Wallace of Myrtle Beach. “I feel like you have to have some experience before you go after the top job.”

Jumping into the 2016 race would mean Cruz is “trying to replicate Barack Obama,” said Peggy Geraghty of Hilton Head Island, S.C. “I never agreed with Obama going for president so soon.”

Geraghty said she’s more interested in Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.), but worries he might not have broad appeal. As for Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), another name often mentioned for president, she said she’ll reserve judgment, but added: “He does have sparkle, so if you have to have the sparkle, I suppose he’d be good.”

Still reminiscing about last year’s GOP losses, Samantha Rogers of Bishopville suggested that Rep. Paul Ryan (Wis.), a former vice-presidential contender, should give it a go: “I actually enjoyed him more than Romney,” she said. “I like the values that he pushed.”

Even Graham acknowledged the party’s shifting demographics in his speech, referring to himself as “a little, short, white guy” in a crowd of rising stars, including the state’s 41-year-old governor, Nikki Haley, an Indian American, and Sen. Tim Scott (S.C.), 47, one of two African Americans in the U.S. Senate.

As Graham concluded, he made another bid to satisfy his critics: “The only thing I’m good at is being me.”

“I don’t believe enough in myself to think that I’m always right and that anyone who disagrees with me is always wrong,” he added. “But I do believe, and I owe it to you, my party and my country to be honest: We need to regroup, rethink and come out anew with a conservative message that will allow this party to grow.”

Most of the crowd rose to its feet and cheered, but about 100 people sat quietly in a dark, back corner of the room, still unimpressed by what they had heard.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/03/11/Yes-Ted-Cruz-Likely-Eligible-to-be-President,2013-03-11 00:00:00,['Ken Klukowski'],"Yes, Ted Cruz Likely Eligible to be President","On Mar. 8, reporter Carl Cameron on Special Report on Fox News Channel was surveying potential GOP 2016 presidential candidates. Then he raised Ted Cruz–one of the most brilliant constitutional lawyers ever to serve in the Senate–the new 41-year old Hispanic senator from Texas.

Cameron added, “But Cruz was born in Canada and is constitutionally ineligible” to run for president. While many people assume that, it’s probably not true.

Cameron was referring to the Constitution’s Article II requirement that only a “natural born citizen” can run for the White House.

No one is certain what that means. Citizenship was primarily defined by each state when the Constitution was adopted. Federal citizenship wasn’t clearly established until the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified in 1868. The Constitution is not clear whether it means you must be born on U.S. soil, or instead whether you must be born a U.S. citizen.

Cruz was born in Canada, but his mother was a lifelong American, born in Delaware. (His father was a political refugee from Cuba.) So under federal law, Cruz was born an American citizen by virtue of his mother. His family moved back to Texas, where Cruz grew up, and lived his entire life except the years he spent in New Jersey attending Princeton, Massachusetts attending Harvard Law School, and Washington, D.C., clerking for Chief Justice William Rehnquist at the Supreme Court and later serving in the Bush administration. So this former Texas solicitor general was born an American citizen and has spent almost all his life in America–usually serving his state or nation.

It would be better to report, “Some constitutional experts say he would be ineligible,” or more accurate still, “A small minority of constitutional experts say he would be ineligible.” But no one can make the unqualified claim that the Constitution declares Ted Cruz is unable to run for president.

There’s never been a court case to decide this issue, and there are only a few law review articles written by professors. The only professor I know of who thinks Cruz in ineligible to run for president also said John McCain was ineligible to run for president because he was born on a U.S. Navy base in Panama. I don’t recall any media outlet reporting John McCain was ineligible to be president.

The most likely meaning of the national-born clause is that you must have been an American citizen at birth, so that you would not have greater loyalty to some foreign nation. Cruz was born an American citizen, and has spent most of his life serving this nation with unabashed patriotism.

If Cruz runs for the White House, then one of his opponents in the primary would have standing to sue in federal court to argue Cruz is ineligible. But the smart money would be on a court agreeing that Cruz is as eligible as anyone else who was born an American citizen.

""Today, I'm proud to stand next to a great New Yorker and throw my support behind him,"" Thompson said.

""I am proud to stand here today and support Bill de Blasio to be the next mayor of the city of New York,"" Thompson continued.

Thompson announced he would concede during a press conference Monday morning. Rep. Charlie Rangel (D-N.Y.) and Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) were among who attended the event.

Thompson addressed issues with vote counting during the announcement, saying it's a ""disgrace"" that there were issues with voting machines and paper ballots. He said he'd ""fight until the very last vote"" if this were a general election, but said he was putting his support behind de Blasio because he wants to ""return a progressive to City Hall.""

N.Y. Gov. Andrew Cuomo praised Thompson during the press conference, saying ""it can be much harder to step back than step forward"" and praising the Democrat for putting aside his ""personal ambition"" for the benefit of New Yorkers.

United Federation of Teachers President Michael Mulgrew, who supported Thompson and publicly mocked de Blasio for saying he wasn't burdened by union support, said he's now backing de Blasio.

""Clearly we need to change direction,"" Mulgrew said, citing the explosion in the number of kids in homeless shelters. ""Something is horribly wrong in [this] city.""

Republican mayoral candidate Joe Lhota has said he would continue current Mayor Michael Bloomberg's education policies.

""That's all I need to know once I hear that,"" Mulgrew said, explaining his support for de Blasio.

NEW YORK — New York City mayoral candidate Bill Thompson conceded the Democratic primary race to front-runner Bill de Blasio on Monday, averting a potential runoff and clearing the way for de Blasio to campaign for the general election.

Thompson endorsed de Blasio at City Hall, saying he was proud to support him as the party's nominee.

The potential runoff had loomed as another act in the Democratic drama over choosing a successor to three-term Mayor Michael Bloomberg – a fight that would keep Democrats tilting at each other while Republicans and independents looked ahead to the general election. With Thompson, the Democrats' 2009 mayoral nominee, out of the race, de Blasio will face Republican nominee Joe Lhota on Nov. 5.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo played a role in brokering the deal, according to two people familiar with Thompson's decision who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of the announcement.

""New York will be an even greater city under the leadership of Mayor Bill de Blasio,"" Cuomo said at the City Hall event.

In unofficial returns with 99 percent of precincts reporting, de Blasio had had 40.3 percent of the vote – slightly more than the 40 percent threshold needed to win outright. Thompson was second with 26.2 percent.

A runoff had long been expected in the crowded Democratic race. But after last week's unofficial returns put de Blasio above the 40 percent mark, Thompson faced pressure to concede and spare the party further division ahead of the general election.

He had said as recently as Sunday he would wait until the official tally was finished.

""I think that's important. We want to see every vote counted,"" he said then.

Thompson called the Rev. Al Sharpton, an important city power broker, to inform him early Monday of his decision, according to a person close to Sharpton who was not authorized to speak on his behalf and thus spoke on condition of anonymity.

Sharpton endorsed his longtime friend Thompson during his 2009 mayoral bid but stayed on the sidelines this race, depriving Thompson of a loud advocate in his bid to win the majority of African-American voters. De Blasio and Thompson ran even among African-American voters, according to exit polls.

Sharpton was not expected to attend the morning rally but will likely endorse de Blasio in the coming days, according to the person.

Currently the city's elected public advocate, de Blasio has been riding a wave of momentum that built during the last month of his campaign, which he billed as ""a progressive alternative to the Bloomberg era.""

After lagging in the polls, de Blasio got voters' attention by protesting a hospital closing – and getting arrested – and airing ads in which his teenage son gave voice to his liberal platform and showed New Yorkers de Blasio's interracial family.

Thompson, a former city comptroller and the only African-American in the race, has run a more centrist campaign, offering himself as a seasoned, thoughtful manager.

Thompson hadn't led in polls of the crowded Democratic field this year, but supporters noted that he had been underestimated in the past: Thompson came much closer than polls predicted to unseating Bloomberg in 2009, despite being vastly outspent.

De Blasio has said Thompson had every right to want the official count.

On Friday, elections officials began checking vote totals from more than 645,000 ballots cast via lever machines that were hauled out of storage for the primary, after the elections board worried it wouldn't be able to reprogram the city's newer, optical-scanner devices for a potential runoff. That count was finished Sunday night and was to be announced Monday afternoon.

The elections board was beginning to count some 78,000 absentee and other paper ballots Monday.

While a runoff had been anticipated, trying to figure out who would be in it had been something like Parcheesi for politics junkies.

City Council Speaker Christine Quinn was the front-runner for months and was jousting with Thompson for second place in polls as recent as early September. Ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner leaped to the front of the pack for a time after getting into the race in May, before the public learned that his X-rated exchanges with women online continued even after similar sexting spurred his 2011 resignation from Congress.

Regardless of the mayor's race, Democrats still will be asked to go to the polls again on Oct. 1. There's a runoff between City Councilwoman Letitia James and state Sen. Daniel Squadron for the party's nomination to succeed de Blasio as public advocate.

If de Blasio's final vote count ends up below 40 percent, the mayoral primary will also be on the ballot, because Thompson missed the Friday deadline to have it removed.

Lhota ramped up his general election campaign over the weekend and was expected to address de Blasio's nomination later Monday. Adolfo Carrion Jr., a former Bronx borough president running as an independent, will also be on the November ballot.

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) won the Conservative Political Action Conference straw poll on Saturday, marking an early indicator of conservative support ahead of the next presidential election in 2016.

Paul topped the list and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) came in second, according to Ian Bishop.

Former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) came in third place this year, with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- who was notably not invited to this year's conference -- coming in fourth.

Paul received 25 percent of the vote, with Rubio in a close second with 23 percent. Santorum received eight percent, and Christie took seven percent of the vote.

The annual straw poll came at the conclusion of the high-profile conference, which featured dozens of notable conservative speakers over three days at National Harbor near Washington, D.C.

Last year, Mitt Romney came out on top in the CPAC poll, foreshadowing his eventual nomination as Republican presidential candidate.

In it's letter of Secession, which was sent immediately after the Election of President Abraham Lincoln, even before he took Office, Texas stated the following:



We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States, and of the confederacy itself, were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable. That in this free government all white men are and of right ought to be entitled to equal civil and political rights [emphasis in the original]; that the servitude of the African race, as existing in these States, is mutually beneficial to both bond and free, and is abundantly authorized and justified by the experience of mankind, and the revealed will of the Almighty Creator, as recognized by all Christian nations; while the destruction of the existing relations between the two races, as advocated by our sectional enemies, would bring inevitable calamities upon both and desolation upon the fifteen slave-holding states

It was merely theof a President from a Party that endorsed Abolition, even if that President at the time DID NOT make accomplishing that party of his platform or an agenda item of his administration - that drove the South in ato begin to dismantle the nation State by State.

And now today we see more and more Tea Partiers - while also overreacting to an election they lost - slowly endorsing the legitimacy of a new secession and further - of ABSOLUTE rights of the BUSINESS OWNER over their EMPLOYEES (as well as CLIENTS) in everything from denying them a living wage and working conditions to Dictating Whether they can have access to Preventive Services in their HealthCare, impose llfetime caps, and openly discriminate against those who had the temerity to previously GET SICK.

Apparently Modern Confederate Tea Partiers think the cruelty of that system is just ""Fine"".

Wither is Freedom then, eh?

In the last few years there have been a rising of Pro-Confederacy Groups who've written such amazing revisionist history such as this.



Southerners have less reason to be loyal to the collective enterprise that is the United States than does any group of citizens. The South was Invaded, laid waste, and conquered when it tried to uphold the original and correct meaning of the Declaration of Independance and the Constitution.

Yeah, right, the South was """" - so much for those pesky letters of Secesion and that little Ft Sumter thing. Sure.

And this happened merely because they felt they had the economic Right to continue practices such as this.



Slavery was Evil. It was pure Economic Evil. Human Cruelty for Wealth and Profit. The Confederates were trying to Protect and Continue that system of Cruelty, of The THEFT of Freedom, Free Will and Choice for their own enrichment.

But this is what they are, what they've always been. They know it in their hearts, and this is why they truly FEAR - deeply in their bones - an African American President such as Barack Obama. It is beyond their comprehension that he isn't racked with a deep desire for Vengence against Whites.

How could it not be?



It was this type of deep atavistic fear that even affected Barack Obama's own grandmother, Toot. In his book,he recounts how his grandmother while working in Texas following WWII had befriended a black janitor, Mr. Reed, who worked in the same building. They had a cordial friendship, yet another - white - secretary working in the building proceeded to angrily scold them both for their familiarity telling Toot she should never, ever ""call no'Mister'"".

Years later in Hawaii, when Barack was a boy living with his grandparents to attend High School in the U.S. while his mother worked overseas, his grandmother encountered a particularly aggressive beggar who frightened her. A black beggar. Despite knowing the character of Barack's father, and of Barack himself - she was still terrified of him because she knew and had seen in Texas the kind of cruel mis-treatment people like him had received. She had a understanding of the righteous anger that that person could potentially feel, and she feared it.

That beggar was not Mr. Reed. But another 20 years later, it very well could have been - and he would have be duly justified in his outrage. Gramps - Toot's husband - angrily scolded her for her reaction to the beggar, his feeling had always been the individuals are individuals not some collective mass of angst, not some open racial sore that refuses to be healed. For all of this, Barack had a ring-side seat. He witnessed both Yin and Yang.

Unlike Toot who was sympathetic to those who suffered from bigotry, identified with their outrage - and recognized it's legitimacy - what the Modern Tea Party-Confederate feels is something worse.

Guilt!

No, not their own personal guilt, but the collective guilt of centuries of cruelty. They constantly try to wipe it away, ignore it, deflect it, disguise it, but it continues to come right back because they in their own heart of hearts simply don't believe that any Nigger should ever, EVER be called ""Mr. President"".

It's fear driven by that guilt that also drove the Confederates, as it drives the Tea Party, and now- the Republican Party.

So of course, they have to Do Anything Necessary to prevent this cruel retribution from being inflicted on the Good White people... um, I mean the American People. They have to SHUTDOWN THE GOVERNMENT, because that is the limited leverage they have with a majority in the House.

They have to rail that Obamacare is a Complete and Total Failure even as Hundreds of Thousands successfully send in their applications despite initial website glitches, and are finding they can get better care for far less than they were previously spending.

They have to DENY Reality, again and again and again.

Obama was never a Slave. None of his Ancestors, on his father's side, were Slaves. Most of what he knows about what it means to be historically ""Black In America"" came from his White Grandparents and their experiences during the 40's and the 50's as recounted to him. He has studied Langston Hughes and Baldwin and W.E.B. Debois to better understand the ""Black Experience"". He lived it within his own skin, in LA whlie attending Occidental College, in New York while working for a Non-Profit, in Chicago working with communities to help incrimentally improve their lives. He's seen it from just about every possible angle, and he's not racked with Anger

He's not driven to seek Devine Retribution against the Ills of the White Race.

ObamaCare is not Punishment for the Wickedness of Long Dead White People. Some of those White people, going all the way back to the Revolutionary War, are his own Ancestors.

Obama is not a Kenyan. Not a Socialist. Not a Muslim. Not a Mau Mau Anti-Colonialist. Not a Fist Pumping Black Power Enthusiast. He's not Mr. Reed, nor is he the Beggar.

He's our American President. He's doing the best he can, under his power, to improve the lives of All American Citizens. As did President Lincoln before him.

Some day the Tea Party-Confederates will learn that lesson. But apparently, not today.

Routinely, senators give unanimous consent to waive the rule so the committee can carry out the chamber's—and the country's—business. But today, Republicans refused unanimous consent to let the Judiciary Committee meet. The committee has a busy schedule, with votes scheduled for 15 judicial nominees who have testified before the members and answered follow-up written questions. Among those are nominees for vacancies designated as judicial emergencies by the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts. Each one of the nominees has been fully vetted and has the support of their home state senators, including Republicans Mark Kirk (IL), Pat Roberts and Jerry Moran (KS), Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker (TN), Roy Blunt (MO), and Pat Toomey (PA). [...] If the committee is not able to meet until next week—the last week the Senate is expected to be in session—and Republicans force the nominees to be held over, then they'll be stuck in committee at year's end. Since that will be the end of a session of Congress, absent unanimous consent to do otherwise, Senate rules require the nominees to be sent back to the president for renomination in the next session. That would force all of these nominees to repeat the committee voting process all over again, where once again the GOP could find new ways to slow them down.

Senate Republicans aren't just forcing all night sessions to exact their revenge on Democrats for invoking the nuclear option and ending the filibuster on nominations, they've escalated the fight to preventing the Judiciary Committee from even meeting Can anyone doubt that Republicans will continue to do anything they can to force these nominations to expire before the end of the year? They'll do whatever possible to block these nominees for as long as possible. This means that Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), chair of the Judiciary Committee, is going to have to be willing to establish new rules, or ignore existing ones as much as is in his power to do so.

That's going to include ending the ""blue-slip"" tradition. That's the tradition of asking the home state senators of a nominee to support the nomination by signing off on a ""blue slip."" Leahy says that he intends to continue to honor the tradition because he ""assume[s] no one will abuse the blue slip process like some have abused the use of the filibuster to block judicial nominees on the floor of the Senate."" If they're going to abuse the rules to keep his committee from meeting, they're going to abuse blue slips. Leahy is going to have to act to allow his committee to function again."

Budget showdown, government shutdown, debt ceiling debacle–the stakes are real but the establishment seems to feed off the chaos they create as a means to foment fear and outrage and translate it into campaign donations for themselves.

Look closely and you’ll see that something seismic is going on under the surface of the manufactured chaos in D.C.

Washington has morphed into an extortion racket, a place where members of the permanent political class threaten to inflict legislative and regulatory pain to extract campaign donations that they can then siphon into the pockets of themselves and their family members.

In a new book featured this Sunday on 60 Minutes titled Extortion: How Politicians Extract Your Money, Buy Votes, and Line Their Own Pockets, Peter Schweizer explains how Washington politicians use a set of mafia-style legislative tactics to extort people and industries into donating to them out of fear of political and legal reprisals.

Schweizer interviewed former Chairman of Apache Corporation Ray Plank. Plank said campaign cash and lobbying contracts now function as “protection money” to keep lawmakers and regulators from going after you.

“It’s what you expect from the mafia,” said Plank. “They basically come to you and say, ‘We are going to shove this bat up your ass and give you an enema. You better play ball.’ We saw a great deal of it. It’s an insidious blight.”

There are left-wing progressives on Wall Street and in the high-tech world who bankrolled President Obama’s campaign because they love his radical agenda. But as Schweizer points out, many gave because they know they have to; if they don’t, Obama will come after them.

That’s a lesson the Tea Party knows all too well. After the Tea Party’s historic 2010 midterm victory, Obama unleashed Attorney General Eric Holder to go after the oil and gas sector, which had given four times as much to Republicans as to Democrats. As Obama said in October 2010, “We are going to punish our enemies and we’re gonna reward our friends who stand with us on issues that are important to us.”

Of course, not everyone gets subjected to these Godfather-style shakedowns. Case in point: Obama bundler and former New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine of MF Global shame. After “losing” $1.6 billion of MF Global customer money, Corzine walked away without a scratch. In Extortion, Schweizer publishes a devastating quote from Lisa Timmerman, a 17-year MF Global employee who served as the firm’s assistant comptroller for five years, saying: “Corzine is a major Obama fundraiser [which] is keeping prosecutors from bringing criminal charges against him.”

But what about the rest of us? What about the average American mom and dad just trying to stay afloat in the disastrous Obama economy? We don’t have the funds to throw “protection money” at the political extortionists in Washington who are eager to foist things like Obamacare on us. Only Obama’s union cronies and members of the permanent political class are given Obamacare waivers and spared the pain of the policies D.C. inflicts on the rest of us. Big business got an Obamacare exemption that Obama refuses to give ordinary individuals who can’t even sign up for Obamacare on the broken exchange websites, but they’ll still be fined for not doing so!

And what about the GOP establishment? Why haven’t they been able to clean up the extortion racket in Washington? You have to ask yourself, has the party machine fought this corruption or does it participate in it? As a senior House Republican told Fox News on Thursday, it’s “highly unlikely” Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) will be challenged because few have the muscle to match his ability to “raise money.”

In fact, the ability to raise money is apparently key to all the power in Washington. Here’s how bad it’s gotten: the Democratic and Republican Parties actually have a secret price list–officially known as “party dues”–that tells members of Congress how much money they must extract from donors in order to win a chairmanship or a top slot on a powerful Congressional committee. Schweizer somehow obtained the top-secret lists and included the never-before-published documents in Extortion.

But fundraising isn’t the only thing D.C. employs to keep people in line. Over in the Senate, Democrats like Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) use thug tactics on Tea Party members and activists who stand in their way. In a devastating chapter on Harry Reid, Schweizer includes a quote from Reid’s former chief of staff Susan McCue, who in 2005 said Reid seizes on a person’s weaknesses to “disarm, to endear, to threaten, but most of all to instill fear.”

The fact that these strong-arm tactics take place in Washington doesn’t surprise me at all. I’ve fought this type of corruption my entire political career. And those who disagreed with me politically used thug-like tactics to try to bankrupt my family with frivolous lawsuits in Alaska, and it hasn’t stopped to this day.

It’s time for Washington to stop threatening citizens and scaring up dollars through an endless extortion scheme of manufactured crises. It’s time for leaders to lead. That means doing right by voters without requiring them to pay protection money in advance.

You have to wonder whether Constitutional rule of law even exists when separate rules apply for powerful and well-connected men like Jon Corzine. And you have to wonder whether we really have government of the people, by the people, and for the people when the only way We the People can be heard is if we grease the palms of the ruling class.

Enough is enough. If the permanent political class won’t drain the swamp, we will. We should follow the advice in the title of Schweizer’s last book and “Throw Them All Out.” 2014 is just around the corner."

It was a seemingly wistful moment at the halfway mark of his presidency, before the celebratory parade and the evening's galas.

Shortly after exhorting the United States to continue its ""never-ending journey"" to live up to the ideals of its founders, on his way off the platform at the West Front of the Capitol, President Barack Obama stopped to drink in the scene before him.

""I want to take a look one more time,"" he told those surrounding him. ""I'm not going to see this again.""

24 seconds on the chilly Monday afternoon, letting the crowd that had joined him for his formal, public second inauguration file past. And so, with his oath of office taken -- again -- and the speech delivered , the president stood aside for24 seconds on the chilly Monday afternoon, letting the crowd that had joined him for his formal, public second inauguration file past.

It was one of the few quiet moments on an otherwise jam-packed day. Obama stole another such moment with his wife, at the first of two official inaugural balls they were scheduled to attend Monday night.

Following performances by Alicia Keys, Brad Paisley and the Mexican rock group Mana, the first couple danced as Jennifer Hudson sang the classic song, ""Let's Stay Together,"" by Al Green.

First lady Michelle Obama wore a floor-length, custom, ruby-colored chiffon and velvet gown designed by Jason Wu, the same designer behind her 2009 inaugural dress.

The celebrations came a day after Obama was sworn in on the constitutionally required date in a low-key ceremony at the White House. The flag-waving crowd that watched Monday's event was noticeably smaller than the throng that turned out for his first oath in 2009 but still packed the National Mall for blocks.

The waving flags, the red-white-and-blue bunting and the heralding trumpets marked the 57th such ceremony in the history of the nation, with the peaceful extension of power based on last November's election that returned Obama to the White House.

The Sousa marches, the ceremonial guns and the voices of James Taylor, Kelly Clarkson and Beyonce having faded away, Obama headed into the Capitol for a luncheon with members of Congress. Then he led the traditional parade up Pennsylvania Avenue, stopping near the White House to walk a few blocks of the route with the first lady to the cheers of those lining the sidewalks.

""You've got to come out for this,"" said Nick Pignone, a Washington resident. ""Everyone's excited -- good vibes right now.""

Also publicly sworn in for a second term was Vice President Joe Biden, who, like Obama, also took his official oath Sunday. Justice Sonia Sotomayor performed the honors for Biden at his home at the Naval Observatory in Washington, where the vice president's extended family and a few Cabinet officials gathered to watch the ceremony.

Biden and his wife, Jill, also took some time to walk part of the parade route, with a grinning Biden periodically jogging over to the sidelines to shake hands with people across the barricades. Once both couples and their families were seated at the White House reviewing stand, one of the first acts to pass was the marching band from Honolulu's Punahou School, Obama's alma mater.

What followed included dozens of military and school bands, Native American dance troupes whirling in traditional dress, war veterans, Civil War re-enactors, kilted firefighters blowing bagpipes and Montana's governor and congressional delegation on horseback and in cowboy hats.

Obama, the first African-American president and the 17th to win a second term, used a pair of Bibles in Monday's ceremony -- one from Abraham Lincoln, the other from Martin Luther King Jr. His roughly 2,000-word inaugural address hearkened back to both.

""I did everything possible today to keep from crying,"" said U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia, a onetime lieutenant of King. He called the sight of Obama using King's Bible ""very moving, unreal -- almost unbelievable.""

Monday is also the federal holiday commemorating the birthday of King, who was assassinated in 1968.

The loudest cheer of Obama's address came when he said the nation's journey remained incomplete ""until our wives, our mothers, and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts,"" and ""until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law.""

Obama begins the second half of his presidency with the opportunity to make it more historic but facing some of the same challenges that he struggled with in the first four years.

Americans ""have the power to set this country's course,"" he said, urging people to fulfill their citizenship by meeting ""the obligation to shape the debates of our time -- not only with the votes we cast, but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring ideals.""

On the Mall, Carlos Arieta and his wife, Sharon, took in the scene after driving from Atlanta to witness history. The former Washington residents said it was the first time they had attended an inauguration.

Surprised by the throngs gathered a few hours before the speech on a clear morning with temperatures just above freezing, Arieta said ""it's nice to see all the different kinds of people.""

Even some of those who didn't support Obama's November re-election turned out to watch. Don King, 27, and his 21-year-old brother Matthew said they don't agree with the president on taxation, debt and other fiscal issues but didn't want to miss this bit of history.

""It's the second inauguration for Obama, and it's pretty amazing if you think back to the 1800s and later during the civil rights era, that we're here,"" Don King said.

A new CNN/ORC International poll released Monday indicated less excitement this time than four years ago, when nearly 2 million people crowded the Mall despite frigid weather for Obama's historic first inauguration.

In January 2009, nearly seven in 10 Americans questioned in a CNN survey said they were thrilled or happy that Obama was about to take office. Now, according to the new, that number is down 18 points, to 50%.

Back then, six in 10 saw Obama's inauguration as a celebration by all Americans of democracy in action, with just 39% saying it was a political celebration by the supporters of the winning candidate.

Now, the numbers are nearly reversed, with 62% saying the second inauguration is a celebration by those backing the president, and 35% saying it's a celebration of democracy.

""The thrill is gone, along with the hope that the start of a new presidential term of office will bring a divided nation together,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.

Reality of second-term presidencies

The smaller crowd this time around reflects the reality of second-term presidencies, when the novelty and expectations of a new leader have been replaced with the familiarity and experiences of the first act.

For Obama, that difference is even sharper. His historic ascendancy to the White House in 2008 came with soaring public hopes and expectations for a new kind of governance that would close the vast partisan gulf developed in recent decades.

However, a litany of challenges, including an inherited economic recession and repeated battles with congressional Republicans over budgets and spending, only hardened the opposing positions in Washington.

Obama's signature achievements, including major reforms of the health care industry and Wall Street, became symbols of political division, with opponents constantly accusing him of hindering needed economic recovery.

For his second term, Obama has vowed to press for an overhaul of the nation's immigration policies and new ways to boost the sputtering economy, proposals that are bound to spark battles with his Republican rivals, and oversee the implementation of Obamacare.

And the shootings at a Connecticut elementary school last month put the divisive issue of gun control on his immediate agenda.

CNN polling released Sunday showed a majority of Americans -- 54% -- believe Obama will be an outstanding or above average president in his second term, while 43% said he'd be poor or below average.

And while overall, seven in 10 Americans hope the president's policies succeed, only four in 10 Republicans feel that way, with 52% hoping that Obama will fail.

But House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, told CNN, ""Today is the day for all of us in this country to come together.""

""I think the president did a fine job, certainly, laying out what he would like to see happen as far as the future of the country,"" Cantor said. ""There are areas of disagreement, but there are also some things fundamentally we agree on, and that is this country is one of opportunity. And sort of the way we get there to help everybody, there are some differences. Hopefully, we can bridge those differences."""

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney discussed Friday’s ruling that President Obama violated the constitution when he bypassed the Senate last year to fill vacancies on a labor relations panel. Carney says the White House “strongly disagrees” with the decision. (The Washington Post)

President Obama exceeded his constitutional authority by making appointments when the Senate was on a break last year, a federal appeals court ruled Friday. The court’s broad ruling would sharply limit the power that presidents throughout history have used to make recess appointments in the face of Senate opposition and inaction.

A unanimous three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit flatly rejected the Obama administration’s rationale for appointing three members of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) while the Senate was on a holiday break.

Chief Judge David B. Sentelle sharply criticized the administration’s interpretation of when recess appointments may be made, saying it would give the president “free rein to appoint his desired nominees at any time he pleases, whether that time be a weekend, lunch, or even when the Senate is in session and he is merely displeased with its inaction.” He added, “This cannot be the law.”

The issue seems certain to end up before the Supreme Court, which ultimately could clarify a president’s authority to fill his administration and appoint federal judges when a minority of the Senate blocks consideration of his choices.

Although recess appointments have been made throughout the nation’s history, they have been more commonly made by modern presidents who face partisan opposition that has made it hard for nominees to even receive a vote in the Senate.

Additionally, Friday’s decision casts doubt on hundreds of decisions the NLRB has made in the past year, ranging from enforcement of collective-bargaining agreements to rulings on the rights of workers to use social media.

The ruling also raises questions about the recess appointment of former Ohio attorney general Richard Cordray to head the fledgling Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and about the actions taken by the agency during his tenure, including major new rules governing the mortgage industry. Obama named Cordray at the same time as the NLRB nominees, and his appointment is the subject of a separate lawsuit in D.C. federal court.

The White House criticized the court ruling. “The decision is novel and unprecedented, and it contradicts 150 years of practice by Democratic and Republican administrations,” White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters Friday. “We respectfully but strongly disagree with the ruling.”

Presidents from both parties have made hundreds of recess appointments when the Senate has failed to act on nominations. Ronald Reagan holds the record with 243. Obama’s predecessor, George W. Bush, made 105, and it was during his term that Senate Democrats began holding pro-forma sessions, some lasting less than a minute, when the Senate went on break. They contended that that kept the Senate in session and did not allow Bush to make recess appointments.

Republicans took up the practice when Obama was elected. But Obama decided to challenge it in January 2012, when the Senate was on a 20-day holiday but holding pro-forma sessions every three business days to block presidential action.

Obama moved ahead with the nomination of Cordray, who many Republicans considered overly antagonistic toward business, and three NLRB members — Sharon Block, Terence F. Flynn and Richard F. Griffin Jr.

At the time, the NLRB had only two members and was thus unable to take any official action. Some Republicans were worried that the board under Obama would be too pro-union.

Obama said he had the authority under the Constitution’s recess appointments clause, which grants power for such appointments “during the Recess of the Senate,” when senators are unavailable to provide their advice and consent.

Sentelle, joined by Judges Karen LeCraft Henderson and Thomas B. Griffith, said that the Constitution’s reference to “the Recess” means that appointments are allowed only during the recess between sessions of the Senate, not when the Senate is simply on a break. It was not up to the president to decide what constitutes a recess, Sentelle said.

The ruling noted that another federal appeals court has read the Constitution differently, which adds to the likelihood the Supreme Court will have to settle the issue.

Sentelle and Henderson went where apparently no other court has gone. They said that the president has the authority to make appointments only to vacancies that arise during a recess, which would drastically limit a president’s ability to make use of the recess appointment power.

A senior administration official who was granted anonymity to discuss White House legal strategy said it was unlikely that the White House would ask the full D.C. Circuit court to take up the case. The official said it might be better to wait for other courts around the country to rule on similar cases and then seek Supreme Court review.

Senate Republicans said the decision was a victory for the separation of powers.

“Today’s ruling reaffirms that the Constitution is above political party or agenda, despite what the Obama administration seems to think,” said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah).

Some Democrats said the ruling will encourage Senate Republicans to block Obama’s nominees by refusing to allow them to come to a vote.

“Today’s circuit court decision is not only a radical departure from precedent, it ignores the fact that President Obama had no choice but to act,” said Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa). Harkin said that “throughout his presidency, Republicans have employed unprecedented partisan delay tactics and filibusters” to block Obama’s nominees.

The case was brought by Noel Canning, a company in Washington state that challenged an NLRB ruling by saying the three Obama board members were not properly appointed. The court’s ruling on Noel’s behalf leaves hundreds of decisions in which the three members have participated open to court challenge. Block and Griffin continue to serve. Flynn resigned last year.

NLRB Chairman Mark Gaston Pearce said the board, which now has only three members, will continue with business as usual.

“It should be noted that this order applies to only one specific case, Noel Canning, and that similar questions have been raised in more than a dozen cases pending in other courts of appeals,” Pearce said in a statement on the board’s Web site.

But labor unions were alarmed. “Chaos” is the way Pamela Allen, legal director of National Nurses United, described the effect of the court ruling. She said, “It’s a field day for the employers. This decision will be appealed, but to a [Supreme] Court that hasn’t always been friendly to labor over the years.”

Allen said that hundreds of NLRB rulings might be contested by employers. One example, she said, was a recent ruling to force a rural California hospital to award back pay to union activists and to accept a vote by its nurses to let the union bargain on their behalf.

Charles I. Cohen, a former NLRB member and senior counsel in the labor and employment practice of the law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, said the result of the court ruling was “a cloud” over the NLRB that would “present a quandary for employers about how to comply with the law.”

The work of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau could also be in jeopardy because the law requires the agency to have a director in place before it can exercise its power to write regulations and enforce them.

In the past three weeks alone, the bureau has issued seven rules changing the way that homeowners interact with the mortgage industry by limiting upfront fees, providing free appraisals and curtailing harmful practices such as interest-only payments, among other things.

“There will be lots of lawsuits, lots of uncertainty about what the rules of the road are, and lots of taxpayer money wasted on things that potentially turn out to be invalid,” said Andrew J. Pincus, an attorney who represents the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Cordray’s recess appointment expires at the end of this year. Obama renominated him on Thursday, but GOP leaders have said they continue to oppose him.

""We need to be in the event business. I think you're going to hear that from every broadcast network,"" said Bob Greenblatt, NBC Entertainment chairman.

Though Clinton hasn't announced her intention to seek the Democratic nomination for president, Greenblatt spoke as if her candidacy is expected.

""Hillary"" could air before Clinton announces her decision, but the timing has yet to be determined, he said.

The four-hour miniseries ""Hillary,"" starring Diane Lane as the former first lady and secretary of state, is one such bid for distinctive programming, Greenblatt said.

The goal is to woo viewers who are increasingly drawn away by cable TV's eye-catching, critically acclaimed fare like ""Mad Men"" and ""Breaking Bad"" and other media choices.

Broadcasting's audience is shrinking by 4 percent to 7 percent annually, Greenblatt told a meeting of the Television Critics Association.

""Anything that can shake up the landscape and say, `we have something special""' would be considered part of the varied group of event projects, he said.

At NBC, that ranges from the new fall game show ""Million Second Quiz"" to big-ticket scripted fare including ""Hillary"" and other projects announced Saturday: ""Rosemary's Baby"" a four-hour version of the Ira Levin novel that was adapted as a 1968 movie; an adaptation of ""Stephen King's Tommyknockers,"" and ""Plymouth,"" about the Pilgrim's journey and settlement in America.

A six-hour miniseries about Cleopatra is in development, Greenblatt said.

He didn't address how a Clinton miniseries, which will track her life and career from 1998 to the present, might affect the presidential contest.

The part of former President Bill Clinton has yet to be cast. Lane's credits include the feature films ""Unfaithful"" and ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" and the TV movie ""Cinema Verite.""

Other networks seeking to stem audience erosion are jumping on the event bandwagon, especially in light of the success of another King adaptation, CBS' summer series ""Under the Dome."" Announced plans include a Fox's remake of the ""Shogun"" miniseries based on James Clavell's novel.

Greenblatt argued that NBC, which finished the last September-to-May season in fourth place in total viewers, is in better shape when the entire year is taken into account, especially among advertiser-favored young adult viewers.

He credited the popular talent contests ""The Voice"" and ""America's Got Talent,"" as well as dramas ""Grimm"" and ""Hannibal.""

NBC has high hopes for the fall sitcom that brings Michael J. Fox back to TV but is prepared for a big tune-in for the debut episode that might not be sustainable, Greenblatt said."

Washington (CNN) - Does Marco Rubio have an Iowa problem?

If Sam Clovis is any barometer, the answer is an unmitigated yes.



Clovis is a mustachioed, suspenders-wearing college professor from Sioux City who's running for Senate in Iowa, as a Republican. He’s not the favorite to win the nomination, but he’s no slouch either.

He also happens to be a popular conservative talk radio host who speaks the language of grassroots Republicans and has a keen sense of what motivates them.

So the fact that Clovis posted a low-budget web video Wednesday trashing Rubio for his work on the Senate immigration reform bill is an ominous sign for the Florida senator and would-be presidential candidate.

Despite recent hand-wringing about the flawed nature of the Iowa caucuses, the state is all but assured to keep its leadoff position in the 2016 nomination process. If Rubio runs, he'll have to make nice with Iowa conservatives. They just might not be nice to him.

“I might have expected this out of John McCain,” Clovis says of the immigration bill. “But we certainly didn’t expect this out of Marco Rubio. Marco Rubio was elected by conservatives in the state of Florida and he was supported by conservatives all over the United States. And there is nothing conservative in this bill.”

Like any self-styled member of the tea party movement, Clovis labels the bill “amnesty,” says it fails to adequately secure the border with Mexico and claims it will impose a heavy financial burden on state and local governments.

Clovis punctuates the video with a straightforward admonition: “Shame on Marco Rubio.”

Bottom line: If midterm Republican candidates in Iowa think they can score points with conservative voters by attacking Rubio and tying him to President Obama and reborn pragmatist John McCain, Rubio’s got some critical repair work to do on the right."

The WorldNutDaily columnist and frequent Faux News guest is out with a new column that calls for Obama to be overthrown ""by any means necessary""--even if they aren't legal.



I have said previously that if a preponderance of Americans suddenly became aware of what I and a few others know (not “believe,” but know), they would stream into our nation’s capital by the millions, concern for personal safety cast aside in light of that which is at stake. They would demand the resignation of those in this administration, as well as many who have facilitated its crimes. Seeing this, these ruling class elites would have no choice but to retreat – or to attempt to forcibly quell the movement. Such action at that point would undoubtedly fail, given the determination of so large and motivated a host. This administration, much of the Congress, and the creatures who support the same in blissful, belligerent ignorance must be neutralized if this nation is to survive in any semblance of its intended form. And it must be done by any means necessary, because such criminals have proven that they are not dissuaded by trifles like legality. The law, in our President’s estimation, is what he says it is. This has been proven time and again. So Obama and his cabal, and in all likelihood a substantial segment of Congress must go. We must also extricate the radicals and Islamists whom Obama has so kindly insinuated into high places in our government. And the culture of our government must change. Indeed, it will take some time and sacrifice, but America has never faced a threat such as this. In truth, I don’t think any nation has.

Rush maintains that nothing short of a coup is necessary to pull the country from ""the brink of totalitarianism."" The best that can be said about this sentiment is that Rush is blind in his right eye. After all, we now know that a substantial element of the GOP deliberately planned to defund Obamacare knowing full well it would cause a shutdown. Tell me how that isn't undemocratic.

Moreover, Rush is the last person to wring his hands about authoritarian excess. Before the 2012 election, he claimed that the first priority for a Romney administration should have been to arrest Democrats and journalists for treason--a claim that he reiterated back in July. In the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombings, he called for all Muslims to be lined up and shot.

I really have to wonder--what does it say about Faux News and WorldNutDaily that this guy is still associated with them?"

""Today, I'm proud to stand next to a great New Yorker and throw my support behind him,"" Thompson said.

""I am proud to stand here today and support Bill de Blasio to be the next mayor of the city of New York,"" Thompson continued.

Thompson announced he would concede during a press conference Monday morning. Rep. Charlie Rangel (D-N.Y.) and Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) were among who attended the event.

Thompson addressed issues with vote counting during the announcement, saying it's a ""disgrace"" that there were issues with voting machines and paper ballots. He said he'd ""fight until the very last vote"" if this were a general election, but said he was putting his support behind de Blasio because he wants to ""return a progressive to City Hall.""

N.Y. Gov. Andrew Cuomo praised Thompson during the press conference, saying ""it can be much harder to step back than step forward"" and praising the Democrat for putting aside his ""personal ambition"" for the benefit of New Yorkers.

United Federation of Teachers President Michael Mulgrew, who supported Thompson and publicly mocked de Blasio for saying he wasn't burdened by union support, said he's now backing de Blasio.

""Clearly we need to change direction,"" Mulgrew said, citing the explosion in the number of kids in homeless shelters. ""Something is horribly wrong in [this] city.""

Republican mayoral candidate Joe Lhota has said he would continue current Mayor Michael Bloomberg's education policies.

""That's all I need to know once I hear that,"" Mulgrew said, explaining his support for de Blasio.

NEW YORK — New York City mayoral candidate Bill Thompson conceded the Democratic primary race to front-runner Bill de Blasio on Monday, averting a potential runoff and clearing the way for de Blasio to campaign for the general election.

Thompson endorsed de Blasio at City Hall, saying he was proud to support him as the party's nominee.

The potential runoff had loomed as another act in the Democratic drama over choosing a successor to three-term Mayor Michael Bloomberg – a fight that would keep Democrats tilting at each other while Republicans and independents looked ahead to the general election. With Thompson, the Democrats' 2009 mayoral nominee, out of the race, de Blasio will face Republican nominee Joe Lhota on Nov. 5.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo played a role in brokering the deal, according to two people familiar with Thompson's decision who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of the announcement.

""New York will be an even greater city under the leadership of Mayor Bill de Blasio,"" Cuomo said at the City Hall event.

In unofficial returns with 99 percent of precincts reporting, de Blasio had had 40.3 percent of the vote – slightly more than the 40 percent threshold needed to win outright. Thompson was second with 26.2 percent.

A runoff had long been expected in the crowded Democratic race. But after last week's unofficial returns put de Blasio above the 40 percent mark, Thompson faced pressure to concede and spare the party further division ahead of the general election.

He had said as recently as Sunday he would wait until the official tally was finished.

""I think that's important. We want to see every vote counted,"" he said then.

Thompson called the Rev. Al Sharpton, an important city power broker, to inform him early Monday of his decision, according to a person close to Sharpton who was not authorized to speak on his behalf and thus spoke on condition of anonymity.

Sharpton endorsed his longtime friend Thompson during his 2009 mayoral bid but stayed on the sidelines this race, depriving Thompson of a loud advocate in his bid to win the majority of African-American voters. De Blasio and Thompson ran even among African-American voters, according to exit polls.

Sharpton was not expected to attend the morning rally but will likely endorse de Blasio in the coming days, according to the person.

Currently the city's elected public advocate, de Blasio has been riding a wave of momentum that built during the last month of his campaign, which he billed as ""a progressive alternative to the Bloomberg era.""

After lagging in the polls, de Blasio got voters' attention by protesting a hospital closing – and getting arrested – and airing ads in which his teenage son gave voice to his liberal platform and showed New Yorkers de Blasio's interracial family.

Thompson, a former city comptroller and the only African-American in the race, has run a more centrist campaign, offering himself as a seasoned, thoughtful manager.

Thompson hadn't led in polls of the crowded Democratic field this year, but supporters noted that he had been underestimated in the past: Thompson came much closer than polls predicted to unseating Bloomberg in 2009, despite being vastly outspent.

De Blasio has said Thompson had every right to want the official count.

On Friday, elections officials began checking vote totals from more than 645,000 ballots cast via lever machines that were hauled out of storage for the primary, after the elections board worried it wouldn't be able to reprogram the city's newer, optical-scanner devices for a potential runoff. That count was finished Sunday night and was to be announced Monday afternoon.

The elections board was beginning to count some 78,000 absentee and other paper ballots Monday.

While a runoff had been anticipated, trying to figure out who would be in it had been something like Parcheesi for politics junkies.

City Council Speaker Christine Quinn was the front-runner for months and was jousting with Thompson for second place in polls as recent as early September. Ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner leaped to the front of the pack for a time after getting into the race in May, before the public learned that his X-rated exchanges with women online continued even after similar sexting spurred his 2011 resignation from Congress.

Regardless of the mayor's race, Democrats still will be asked to go to the polls again on Oct. 1. There's a runoff between City Councilwoman Letitia James and state Sen. Daniel Squadron for the party's nomination to succeed de Blasio as public advocate.

If de Blasio's final vote count ends up below 40 percent, the mayoral primary will also be on the ballot, because Thompson missed the Friday deadline to have it removed.

Lhota ramped up his general election campaign over the weekend and was expected to address de Blasio's nomination later Monday. Adolfo Carrion Jr., a former Bronx borough president running as an independent, will also be on the November ballot.

Her activism has reignited the conversation about her political future which could include a run for governor. ""Of course it forces a second look, but I am not taking that look right now,"" Davis said in an interview with NBC News. ""Right now, I'm working to try to be very strategic, and a member of the team that has to work very hard in the next few weeks to defeat this bill.""

But asked directly whether she would rule out serving as Democrats' candidate for governor in 2014, Davis responded: ""I cannot rule that out.""

Davis's story is now well-known: the former single-mother-turned-Harvard-Law-grad stood and spoke for hours on end in opposition to a law that would effectively ban most abortions in Texas after the 20th week of pregnancy, and shutter most of the clinics in the state where abortions are performed. Her speech felled the abortion bill after the deadline by which it must have been passed expired.

That fight is about to escalate beginning on Monday, when a special session called by Texas Gov. Rick Perry, R, meets in Austin to work toward reconsidering and passing that abortion law. And all eyes will watching to see how Davis — who has emerged not just as a chief adversary to Perry, but also as a rising national Democratic star — proceeds.

""What I can say is, I don't underestimate at all the power that people have brought to this conversation,"" she told NBC News in a phone interview. ""And I will not underestimate the impact that they can have in the Capitol. And I expect they're going to be there, working hard alongside people who share their values.""

The Texas proposal, which is tentatively slated for a final vote in the state Senate next week, is likely to pass this time. Republicans in the legislature will not repeat their mistake of leaving the abortion law until the final moments of their session, the deadline which Davis used to fell the law with her filibuster. (Davis did suggest, though, that she has heard ""rumblings"" that some state lawmakers might reconsider their votes given the national attention to the debate now.)

Perhaps more significantly, the coming weeks might set the stage for a marquee showdown between Davis and Perry — who is yet to say whether he'll seek a fourth term as governor — in the 2014 governor's race.

Though Davis had previously said she planned to run for re-election to her state Senate seat, she acknowledged on Sunday that the national outpouring she's received has forced her to reconsider a showdown against Perry, or another Republican candidate.

If she were to run, Davis would be riding a wave of liberal enthusiasm behind her candidacy. Progressive blogs quickly hailed her filibuster with hopes that she would run, and heavyweight Democratic groups like the pro-abortion rights Emily's List have encouraged Davis to run in the past.

Davis said that in the days since the June 25 filibuster, she has been inundated with calls from support from fellow Democrats. Governors and senators have called with their well-wishes, Davis said. And House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who tweeted in support of Davis during her filibuster, sent the state senator flowers the day afterward.

If Davis were to challenge Perry, it could result in a Texas-sized showdown that would upend Republican dominance in Texas. There is already a fair degree of rancor after Perry, speaking last week at the National Right to Life Convention, singled Davis out and, referring to her pregnancy as a teenager, said it was ""unfortunate that she hasn’t learned from her own example.""

A Republican strategist close to Perry dismissed the idea that Davis could threaten the three-term governor. Democrats have been shut out of statewide elected office since 1994.

""Wendy Davis is not a threat to any statewide office in Texas. She will be lucky to hold her own senate seat in 2014,"" the Republican said. (Davis's district is one of the few competitive ones in the Lone Star state, and could be redrawn by redistricting set to move forward after last week's Supreme Court decision about the Voting Rights Act.)

The Republican argued that few Texans of any political party share Davis's views about abortion. ""It's not a winning hand for a non presidential year turn out election,"" said the strategist.

Democrats are hopeful, though, that they can turn the tide with a prominent figurehead like Davis at the top of their ticket. Changing demographics in Texas — namely, the growth of the Latino population — has prompted some observers to argue that the state would become more competitive in future elections. And groups like The Lone Star Project have been working to rebuild the state party's aged infrastructure to help Democrats.

As to whether she thinks Perry is ultimately beatable in 2014, Davis demurred.

""I just can't predict that,"" she said. ""Is he vulnerable? Yes."""

Chris Christie will reshape New Jersey’s political landscape, have poured tens of millions of dollars into a record-breaking outside spending campaign that has transformed the state’s election season.

The effort, designed to preserve Democrats’ dominance of the State Legislature and complicate Mr. Christie’s plans to build a record of legislative achievement as he considers a presidential bid in 2016, has inundated some legislative districts with millions of dollars in negative ads on a scale never before seen in New Jersey.

As of last Thursday, according to the state’s election law enforcement board, outside spending for candidates had topped $35 million, twice the amount spent when Mr. Christie, a Republican, was elected in 2009 and the highest recorded by any state except California.

The surge of spending is likely to be replicated around the country next year, as outside groups from both parties signal increasing interest in influencing state-level contests."
http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/ickes-returns-to-democratic-committees-rules-and-bylaws-panel/,2013-08-27 00:00:00,"['Jonathan Martin', 'Topics.Nytimes.Com Top Reference Timestopics People M Jonathan_Martin Index.Html']",Ickes Returns to Democratic Committee’s Rules and Bylaws Panel,"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — The Democratic National Committee’s summer meeting here late last week was starkly different from the gathering of its Republican counterparts earlier in the month. There were no surefire news-making speakers like Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey or former Speaker Newt Gingrich, nor was there consideration of any made-for-cable-news resolutions, like one that tried to bar a pair of television networks from sponsoring future presidential debates.

Rather, it was a sedate gathering where routine party business was conducted routinely by national and state Democratic officials in a suburban Phoenix resort.

But when Harold M. Ickes walked into the Rules and Bylaws Committee meeting on Thursday afternoon and rejoined the panel, at least one longtime Democratic strategist raised her eyebrows.

“He predated the Clinton era, but when I saw Harold reappointed to the D.N.C., he surely, in my judgment, symbolizes the return of the Clintons,” said Donna Brazile, a fellow member of the rules committee.

Mr. Ickes said he was put back on the committee by Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the national committee and herself an ardent advocate for Mrs. Clinton in 2008, but he also acknowledged that he “actively sought” the seat.

“It is in my view the most important committee at the D.N.C. because of its role in shaping the nomination process,” he said, adding a bit mischievously, “The goal is to design rules to nominate the strongest candidate for the general election.”

That, he added, would be up to the voters but there is no question who he believes that candidate is.

Mr. Ickes, 73, is a fixture in the Clinton’s world. He ran Bill Clinton’s New York campaign in the 1992 Democratic primary and served as a deputy chief of staff in Mr. Clinton’s White House. He was a top adviser to Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign, and Mrs. Clinton’s chief liaison at the D.N.C. during her primary battle against Barack Obama. From his perch on the rules committee he memorably railed against a compromise on disputed delegates in the waning days of the Democratic primary.

At a notably less sedate national committee meeting in late May 2008, Mr. Ickes argued in vain against what he called the “hijacking” of Mrs. Clinton’s delegate share from two disputed state primaries. “I am stunned that we have the gall and the chutzpah to substitute our judgment for 600,000 voters,” Mr. Ickes said at the time.

A few weeks later, Mrs. Clinton conceded the race to Mr. Obama. The following year, with Mr. Obama as party leader, Mr. Ickes left his rules committee post. According to party records, he had served on the rules panel since at least 1992.

“I was not reappointed after the 2008 election for some pretty obvious reasons,” Mr. Ickes said.

Now, five years later — with Mr. Obama a lame duck and speculation soaring about whether Mrs. Clinton will seek the White House again — her procedural maven is back in his old position at the national party. The rules committee is tasked with setting the guidelines governing the presidential nominating process.

Mrs. Clinton does not lack for support among national committee members — that much was obvious by the rate in which unofficial campaign buttons promoting her for 2016 were sold in the hallway outside the conference room here.

But with Mr. Ickes, a canny tactician with decades of presidential campaign experience, again on the rules committee, she has a strategist on a key committee who could advocate for her interest.

As one party official put it, Mr. Ickes not only knows how the party works but effectively “wrote the rules” for the national committee over the years, at least until he was thwarted by Mr. Obama.

Mr. Ickes said he did not rejoin the committee at the behest of either Mr. or Mrs. Clinton but conceded that he understood the meaning of his reappearance as Democrats begin to consider life after Mr. Obama.

“I was on the rules committee for years and years, but, yes, I can understand people reading it that way,” he said."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/02/22/Left-Sucessfully-Targets-Voter-Integrity-Champion,2013-02-22 00:00:00,['J. Christian Adams'],Virginia Judges Block Voter ID Advocate from Electoral Board,"In Virginia, the Fairfax Democratic Party is gloating over the effective removal of voter integrity advocate Hans von Spakovsky from the electoral board of the largest county in the state.

As the end of von Spakovsky’s current term on the board approached its end, Fairfax Republicans submitted his name and two others as nominees for two of the board’s three seats (since Republican Bob McDonnell currently serves as governor, his party gets the majority of seats). In an unprecedented move, Fairfax County Circuit Judges rejected von Spakovsky for the position, even though Republicans designated him as their preferred nominee.

Because of his fight against voter fraud, local Democrats and national left-wing journalists targeted von Spakovsky, a Heritage Foundation fellow and Breitbart contributor, for removal from the board. These critics asserted that von Spakovsky and other conservatives hoped to disenfranchise voters by supporting election integrity measures like Voter ID in 2012.

Cesar del Aguila, chairman of the Fairfax Democratic Party, and his attorney John Farrell demanded these judges remove von Spakovsky. These judges are themselves appointed by a partisan legislative body and capitulated to the demands of the Democrats. Reporter Robert McCartney amplified the Democrats’ complaints on the pages of the Washington Post.

Aguila and Farrell claimed von Spakovsky acted in a “partisan” way on the board. However, of von Spakovsky’s 224 votes, he made 221 in unison with the board’s Democrat commissioner. Only three votes were split 2-1.

The refusal to appoint the top designee of the Republican Party was entirely unprecedented in Virginia and promises to bring legislative scrutiny on the actions of Chief Judge Dennis Smith. It may also incite Republicans to scuttle the designees of the Democrat party in the future.

Von Spakovsky is one of the nation’s leading voices against voter fraud, and his removal has serious ramifications for clean elections in the swing state of Virginia.

The Fairfax Democrats reveal a larger national identity crisis within the Democratic party; rational centrist elements have been pushed aside by loud fringe elements led by activists such as Aguila and Farrell. Nearly the entire Democratic legislative delegation from Fairfax and all of the Democrat county supervisors consider Aguila and Farrell to be rough and unhinged but are powerless to tame them.

Von Spakovsky invited the wrath of the radical left when he stopped the distribution of literature published by the ideologically charged League of Women Voters in government election offices. In fact, he stopped literature distribution by all third-party groups. The response by the Democrat party reveals the integration of purportedly non-partisan election advocacy groups like the League with party priorities.

Farrell also resented that von Spakovsky was adamant that Fairfax County comply with the Help America Vote Act of 2002, a federal election law. That law requires that the names of provisional voters be kept confidential, but the Democrat party wanted to harvest that data.

Jay McConville, Chairman of the Fairfax County Republican Party, responded to Friday’s events:

It is disappointing that the judges would bow to political pressure and allow partisan gamesmanship to win the day. More than that, it is shocking that the Fairfax County Democratic Party would challenge the capabilities of Mr. Von Spakovsky, who has served this community so well and with great dedication during his previous term. Clearly the FCDC is more interested in partisan fights than in the proper functioning of the electoral system or the integrity of the vote.

Unfortunately, the righteous indignation of the Republican Party was too little and too late. The GOP must quickly learn that election administration issues are a blood sport to the left. Anyone who stands in their way is personally targeted and polarized. Until Republicans start fighting back just as hard, the left will keep bloodying those courageous Americans preserving the integrity of our electoral process. Until the GOP engages the fight at the outset and fiercely attacks the attackers, the administration of American elections will be dominated by the narrative of the left.

Chris Christie listens to a question as he announces his ""Hurricane Sandy Flood Map Regulations"" Thursday, Jan. 24, 2013, in Seaside Heights, N.J.

When former White House physician Dr. Connie Mariano expressed concern that Chris Christie's weight may make him unfit for office and could be a deciding factor in his potential presidential candidacy in 2016, the New Jersey Governor came out swinging.

During an interview with CNN, Mariano said that Christie could suffer a heart attack or stroke during his tenure. ""I'm worried about this man dying in office,"" she said.

His response? Take a family history. According to an AP and HuffPost report, Christie told the doctor to ""shut up"" unless she had personally examined him and learned about his family history of heart risk. Undeterred, Mariano responded (via an interview with Bloomberg), saying that ""you don't have to be a doctor to see that he is obese.""

Who is right? And is it possible to be healthy and obese? As Christie said on The Late Show with David Letterman, ""I'm basically the healthiest fat guy you've ever seen in your life.""

""Obesity leads to an increase risk of diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol. Those are risk factors for heart disease, but so is smoking and family history,"" Dr. Robert Michler, chairman of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery at Montefiore Medical Center, told HuffPost. ""Hundreds of thousands of people who are obese reach old age and even die without having a heart attack or stroke.""

It's an important distinction: Obesity is not a condition that causes heart attacks directly. Instead, it increases the risk of developing chronic conditions like major heart disease, high cholesterol and hypertension and those, in turn, often result in heart attack and stroke. Does the obese Christie, 50, have a higher chance of developing one of these conditions and of subsequently dying of a cardiac event? Yes. But that doesn't mean he will.

According to New York University's Langone Weight Management Center, about 300,000 Americans die each year from obesity-related complications, though 35.7 percent of the U.S. population is obese (about 112 million people), according to the latest estimates from the CDC.

And, as a recent study in the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine found, obesity in and of itself is not a good predictor of health status. They found that during a six year period, obese study participants were no more likely to die than their healthy-weight counterparts if they didn't have one of the chronic diseases associated with obesity, like Type 2 diabetes or hypertension.

Early death may not be the primary outcome of obesity, but illness abounds. Obesity is associated with heart failure, coronary heart disease, hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, sleep apnea and other respiratory problems, and even some cancers. It also exacerbates other conditions, like asthma, for which Christie has previously been hospitalized.

Although we don't know the governor's BMI or weight information, it is relevant to his overall heart attack risk. According to NYU Langone, an obese person has an average of six times the heart disease risk as a non-obese person. And that risk increases depending on how obese you are. In the Framingham Heart Study, a famous, longitudinal study of overall cardiac risk, researchers found that for every increment increase in an adult man's BMI, there was an associated five percent increased risk of heart failure.

What's interesting is that obese heart failure patients have better outcomes and are less likely to die than heart failure patients with a healthy weight -- something that doctors refer to as the ""heart failure paradox,"" explains Michler.

Stroke risk, which Mariano also expressed concern about, increases with BMI, as well: for every increment increase of BMI, the risk of ischemic stroke goes up four percent and the risk of hemorrhagic stroke increases six percent.

Despite his bluster and understandable dismay that a doctor who hasn't examined him would speculate about his health, it seems as though the risks of remaining so profoundly overweight have begun to sink in. ""I have been remarkably healthy,"" Christie told Letterman. ""My doctor continues to warn me my luck is going to run out relatively soon. So, believe me, it is something that I am very conscious of."""

(CNN) – Republican U.S. Senate candidate Gabriel Gomez is calling on his Massachusetts opponent, Democratic Rep. Ed Markey, to take down a web video showing him on screen with Osama bin Laden.

""Career Politician Ed Markey has started his campaign with a textbook despicable political attack to attempt to connect me with Osama bin Laden in the minds of voters,"" Gomez said Saturday.



The former Navy SEAL called the video an ""insult to my service and an insult to the intelligence of the people of Massachusetts,"" demanding his opponent take the video down immediately.

But Markey's campaign sees things differently, pointing to Gomez's past work for the special interest group called Special Operations OPSEC Education Fund, which accused President Barack Obama of ""politically capitalizing on U.S. national security operations and secrets"" after the bin Laden raid.

""Gabriel Gomez is now attacking Ed Markey for a web video containing video footage of Gomez's own advertisement that accused President Obama of politicizing the death of Osama bin Laden, and risking Americans' lives,"" Markey's campaign said responding to Gomez's demand for the ad to be taken down.

In the web video, titled ""Meet Gabriel Gomez: Just Another Republican"" shows a clip from MSNBC where Gomez and an image of the September 11, 2001, terrorist mastermind are displayed side-by-side. In the clip, Gomez is seen defending the group.

In denouncing the video, Gomez's campaign sent out a release Saturday with Medal of Honor Recipient Thomas Hudner calling Markey's ad ""dishonorable"" but Markey's campaign suggests their opponent is being hypocritical.

The controversy comes just days after each candidate won his party’s nomination to contest for the open Senate seat left vacant when John Kerry became secretary of state.

The two will compete in the special election on June 25. William ""Mo"" Cowan is currently serving as interim senator, appointed by Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick.

The race has been overshadowed by the Boston Marathon bombing that left three people dead and more than 260 others injured.

The candidates suspended campaigning for nearly a week following the attack. Though the campaigns are up and running again, media attention continues to be saturated with the bombing investigation.

Dorset%2C Minn. re-elected its 4-year-old mayor

Bobby Tufts was only three when he won last year%27s race

He plans to raise money for the Ronald McDonald House Charities in Fargo%2C N.D.

DORSET, Minn. (AP) — Robert ""Bobby"" Tufts hasn't made it to preschool yet, but he's already been elected twice as mayor of a tiny tourist town in northern Minnesota.

Mayor Tufts' name was picked Sunday during annual Taste of Dorset festival to be mayor of Dorset for a second term. It has no formal city government and has a population of 22 to 28, depending on whether the minister and his family are in town.

Anyone could vote as many times as they like — for $1 a vote — at any of the ballot boxes in stores around town. The proceeds go toward organizing the festival.

Bobby was only 3 when he won election last year. His mother, Emma Tufts, said she and her son, who turns 5 in October, got choked up when his name was pulled for re-election Sunday.

The boy picked a random man out of the crowd to pick the name out of a clear tub. and the man was blindfolded twice, she said.

While this was happening, Bobby told the crowd how to musky fish, she said.

""He's been going since 3 o'clock yesterday with cameras on his face,"" she said Sunday afternoon. ""He's having a long day but he's done really well. I'm surprised.""

Asked how he felt during a phone interview, a tired Bobby made clear he was done answering questions. ""I want to be with the boys,"" he told his mother.

They were on their way to dinner and then planned to go fishing or have a bonfire to celebrate. Bobby, of nearby Nevis, starts preschool this fall.

Emma Tufts said her son's agenda includes raising money for the Ronald McDonald House Charities of the Red River Valley in Fargo, N.D., and a new welcome sign for Dorset, which bills itself as the Restaurant Capital of the World.

They already raised $750 from a walk this summer and planned to donate half the proceeds of Sunday's T-shirt sales to the charity. He wants to do a snowshoe scavenger hunt this winter to raise money, she said."

Perry, whose endorsement in the May runoff election could be significant, was aiming her remarks at City Controller Wendy Greuel, who benefited from heavy financial support from organized labor on her way to a second-place finish in Tuesday’s primary. Greuel will face City Councilman Eric Garcetti in a May 21 runoff election.

Perry, a City Council member who finished fourth in the primary, declined to say whom she would support in the race’s final round. But she disparaged Greuel’s record, asserting that the controller owes too much to labor leaders she may have to face across a contract negotiating table.

Perry, an African American, represents a significant swath of South Los Angeles. She was the top vote-getter in that part of the city and among black voters — two voting blocs Garcetti and Greuel hope to attract in the runoff.

Garcetti and Greuel also are competing to attract conservative supporters of entertainment lawyer Kevin James, who finished third in Tuesday’s mayoral voting. The onetime federal prosecutor was scheduled to meet with Greuel on Friday and with Garcetti over the weekend.

In her first sit-down interview since the election, Perry was clear about her lack of admiration for Greuel, her onetime colleague on the City Council.

Greuel received $2.8 million in support from independent campaign committees, much of it from union workers at the city’s Department of Water and Power. The day after the election, she was endorsed by another union representing 10,000 civilian city employees. She also has the backing of the city’s police and fire unions.

That should be cause for deep concern, Perry said.

Voters “need to examine what that will mean to them,” Perry said. “They should look at where the money in this campaign comes from and think about if they want to have greater control of their public utility, for instance. Otherwise, if they don’t pay attention, they will be completely rolled over.

“Because that is what is at risk here, at great risk,” she continued. Having someone too closely allied with employee unions in the mayor’s office could mean “the death of independent politics altogether. It could mean the only way you get elected in this town is if you get money from unions.”

Greuel said she has demonstrated a willingness to confront those who aren’t performing for taxpayers. “I am proud to have both business and labor support,” she said. “I have demonstrated as controller that I am willing to take on my allies. I am going to be an independent person for the voters of Los Angeles.”

Greuel’s aides noted that Garcetti has also received public-employee unions support, including an endorsement from United Teachers of Los Angeles and the unions that represent airport and port police officers. Garcetti also sought the support of other city unions, which went to Greuel.

Perry argued that Greuel has received much more financial support from labor groups and alleged she would push out the city’s chief budget official, Miguel Santana, who has been at odds with union leaders. Santana is “bright, gifted and a truth-teller” whose removal would be “tragic,” Perry said.

Greuel said she has never said she would replace Santana. “I have been consistent and said I would look at every general manager when I become mayor of Los Angeles. And the bottom line is that I, ultimately, would be responsible.”

Perry’s rift with Greuel goes back at least to the mayoral campaign’s early days. The councilwoman contends Greuel sought to undermine her candidacy by spreading rumors that Perry would drop out of the race. The accusation is untrue, Greuel said.

Perry also said she was “amazed and appalled” when Greuel sent a mailer to voters noting that Perry had filed for personal bankruptcy and warning, “Don’t let her bankrupt L.A.” The financial troubles, Perry said, stemmed from her former husband’s law practice — a contention he backed up when the bankruptcy was first reported in the press.

Greuel “went and bought those ads and said I was covering something up,” Perry said. “I never covered anything up.”

Greuel said that the mayoral candidates’ lives were thrown open during the campaign and that financial failures were fair game.

Perry — who worked at City Hall for 23 years, most of them as a council aide — also spoke about her time in City Hall and her plans for the future. Among the things she learned in the mayoral campaign is the city remains racially polarized, despite some progress, she said.

People “told me early on that I could go out to the Valley all I wanted and that nobody there would change their mind,” she said. “I thought that was a sad commentary.” She said she was heartened that some voters, including conservatives, heard her out and liked her message.

She said she was moved that many voters empathized with her personal story — growing up in Ohio, the daughter of two civil rights activists who once had a cross burned on their lawn. “A lot of people even saved the mailer on that,” Perry said. “That meant a lot to me.”

The struggle for equal opportunity continues, she said, recalling an election-day tour of South L.A. housing projects. Many young men were milling about, without jobs or meaningful activities to keep them occupied, she said. “That has got to change, and it can still change,” Perry said. “I am looking for the candidate who can do something about that.”

She said she already has fielded calls about job possibilities. “Whatever I choose to do, I will have to have some passion for it,” she said.

She wistfully described driving out of the City Hall garage and seeing a man holding up her mailers. “You are my candidate! I am going to vote for you!” he declared.

But that was Thursday, Perry said, two days after the election.

After the bruising debt-ceiling fight — as well as Standard & Poor's subsequent downgrade of the nation's credit rating — Obama's job approval rating has sunk to a low of 44 percent, a 3-point drop since July. His handling of the economy stands at a low of 37 percent. And only 19 percent believe the country is headed in the right direction, the lowest mark for this president.

Perhaps most ominously for Obama, a majority of poll takers — 54 percent — think he's facing a longer-term setback from which he's unlikely to recover. Back in January, just 39 percent agreed with that assessment.

Indeed, that 54 percent is virtually identical to George W. Bush's score on the same question in the Nov. 2005 NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, which was released just months after Bush's widely criticized handling of Hurricane Katrina.

""When [Obama] addresses the American public, he is going to have one more chance to provide some sense of hope and optimism that he ... can provide answers to what is a woeful economy,"" said Democratic pollster Peter D. Hart, who conducted the survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff.

But both Hart and McInturff contend that Obama wasn't the only party damaged by the debt ceiling debacle. A whopping 82 percent now disapprove of the job Congress is doing. In the history of this poll, it's an all-time high level of dissatisfaction with Capitol Hill.

In addition, when asked who is most to blame for the S&P downgrade, a plurality points to congressional Republicans. And a majority of respondents say they would vote out every single member of Congress if they could.

""Everybody in Washington is taking a substantial hit,"" McInturff said.

Silver linings for Obama

Yet Obama, in particular, took a gut punch. According to the poll, just 42 percent give the president high marks for possessing strong leadership qualities. That’s a 12-point drop from May (in the days following Osama bin Laden’s death).

In addition, his high marks for being a good commander in chief have plunged 10 points (from 51 percent in May to his current 41 percent rating); his high marks for having the ability to handle a crisis have dropped 14 points (from 53 percent to 39 percent); and his high marks for achieving his goals have declined another 14 points (from 41 percent to 27 percent).

If there's a silver lining for Obama, it's that a combined 70 percent of respondents still find him likeable (though nearly six in 10 say they disapprove of many of his policies). And 50 percent approve of his handling of foreign policy, which Hart says is significant because it suggests that the public doesn't think that everything Obama touches can be viewed negatively.

What's more, in a hypothetical general election contest, Obama leads Texas Gov. Rick Perry by five points, 47 percent to 42 percent. And he leads former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney by one, 46 percent to 45 percent, though that margin is down five points since June.

But for the first time in the poll, more say they'd probably vote for a generic Republican candidate (44 percent) than say they'd probably vote for Obama (40 percent).

""Obama is no longer the favorite to win re-election,"" Hart said, explaining that a head-to-head score will usually conform to the generic one, especially when so many believe the country is headed in the wrong direction.

Perry takes commanding GOP lead

And there's a new favorite in the race for the Republican presidential nomination.

Heading into the post-Labor Day sprint and the NBC News/Politico-sponsored debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library on Wednesday, Perry is the first choice among 38 percent of GOP voters — followed by Romney at 23 percent, Texas Rep. Ron Paul at 9 percent and Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann at 8 percent.

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and ex-Godfather’s Pizza CEO Herman Cain are tied with 5 percent of GOP voters each, while former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum gets 3 percent and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman gets 2 percent.

The NBC/WSJ survey is the latest poll to show Perry leading Romney nationally. In recent days, Gallup, Quinnipiac and CNN have had Perry out in front.

On the 'super committee' and 9/11

Also this week, Congress returns to work, and topping the agenda is the start to the 12-member Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction — better known as the “super committee.”

In the poll, 60 percent say it would be acceptable if the ""super committee"" considers reducing the deficit by ending the so-called Bush tax cuts for families earning $250,000 or more per year. Moreover, 56 percent say it would be acceptable if it considers reducing the deficit by a combination of tax increases and spending cuts.

By comparison, just 37 percent believe it’s acceptable for the committee to reduce the deficit by only cutting spending and not raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy. And only 20 percent say it’s acceptable to lower the deficit by reducing spending on Medicare.

Finally, this Sunday will be the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks. According to the poll, 42 percent believe the U.S. is now safer than it was before the attacks — a 9-point increase from Aug. 2010.

Thirty-six percent think the U.S. is about as safe as it was before the attacks, and 21 percent say it’s less safe.

But, by more than a 2-to-1 margin, respondents maintain that the 9/11 attacks had less of a personal impact to them than the economic recession did.

Forty-six percent cited the recession as the event that had the greatest effect on them, versus 20 percent who cited the 9/11 attacks.

The NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll was conducted of 1,000 adults (200 reached by cell phone) from Aug. 27-31, and it has an overall margin of error of plus-minus 3.1 percentage points.

Some Florida Republicans are reportedly growing concerned that a new bill curbing the use of mail-in voting could end up backfiring on the party. After Florida's state legislature recently passed a bill to place new restrictions on mail ballots, some Republicans in the state are ""reacting with alarm,"" The Washington Post reports. After all, the bill will be ""curtailing a practice that millions of state Republicans use,"" the Post writes, and Republicans are worried their ""political fortunes are in peril"" as a result. The bill, for example, requires that voters reapply for mail ballots each two-year cycle, whereas the current law requires them to reapply every four years, and it also restricts the use of drop boxes, the report notes. The state legislature moved to enact the changes following the 2020 presidential election, during which former President Donald Trump attacked the use of mail-in voting. But almost 35 percent of GOP voters in Florida cast their ballots by mail in 2020, and Republicans fear the bill will ""further undercut the party's ability to encourage mail voting,"" the Post writes. ""Donald Trump attempted to ruin a perfectly safe and trusted method of voting,"" a Republican consultant told the Post. ""The main law that we pass when we pass election bills in Florida is the law of unintended consequences."" One former state party official expressed particular concern that military personnel ""might not think they have to request a ballot"" and seniors ""might not know the law has changed, and they might not get a ballot."" Some Republicans reportedly discussed trying to exclude these two groups from the requirement to request mail ballots each cycle but were told this would ""raise equal protection problems."" Republican State Sen. Joe Gruters denied to the Post that the bill will ""hurt anybody, Republicans or Democrats,"" arguing ""people are going to understand the changes that we me made long before another election comes around.""

Here is a map of the whole state:

District 1: Mike Kelly (R-Butler)

Demographics: 94/3/2/1 (White/Black/Hispanic/Asian, all in VAP)

Prez 2008: 51-47 McCain

This district is improved for Kelly by including all of Butler County, which neatly drowns out Erie County. It also includes all of Crawford and Venango Counties, most of Mercer County, and a small part of Lawrence. SAFE R.

Southwest Pennsylvania:

District 2: Mike Doyle (D-Pittsburgh)

Demographics: 75/19/2/3

Prez 2008: 67-32 Obama

This district takes in all of Pittsburgh and most of its more Democratic inner suburbs. It’s quite similar to Doyle’s current district. This is one of the few Democratic districts in my map. SAFE D.

District 3: Keith Rothfus (R-Sewickley)

Demographics: 94/3/1/1

Prez 2008: 55-45 McCain

This district includes parts of Lawrence and Beaver Counties, the northern suburbs of Pittsburgh, NW Westmoreland County, and all of Armstrong County. Jason Altmire lives here, and could be a strong candidate for the Democrats, however this district is trending away from us, and it would be hard to dislodge an incumbent here. LEAN R with Altmire, SAFE R without Altmire

District 4: Tim Murphy (R-Upper St. Clair)

Demographics: 95/3/1/1

Prez 2008: 55-44 McCain

This district takes in the southern parts of Beaver and Allegheny Counties, and most of Washington and Westmoreland Counties, and then dips a finger into Cambria County to pick up Johnstown. This district is trending away from us, and Tim Murphy is a popular, entrenched incumbent. SAFE R.

District 5: Bill Shuster (R-Hollidaysburg)

Demographics: 94/3/1/1

Prez 2008: 56-43 McCain

This district takes in all of Greene, Fayette, Somerset, Bedford, Fulton, and Franklin Counties, as well as most of Cambria and parts of Washington, Westmoreland, and Indiana. This is actually the most Republican district in the state, which goes to show just how well I have gerrymandered the state. Shuster doesn’t actually live in this district (he lives in Blair County), but he would run here. The additions of Bedford, Fulton, and Franklin Counties to this district, which otherwise is similar to John Murtha’s old district, make it totally unwinnable for us. SAFE R.

District 6: Glenn “G.T.” Thompson (R-Bellefonte)

Demographics: 94/2/2/2

Prez 2008: 52-47 McCain

This district takes in vast, mostly rural section of northern and central Pennsylvania. It then stretches an arm out to Lackawanna County to pick up some Democrats there, with the goal of eliminating Matt Cartwright. Despite this, Thompson is a popular incumbent and can win Dem-leaning Centre County, so he is safe. SAFE R.

District 7: Tom Marino (R-Williamsport) and Matt Cartwright (D-Moosic)

Demographics: 92/3/3/1

Prez 2008: 54-45 McCain

This district slashes through the center of the state in an effort to crack Lackawanna County. It stretches from Scranton to Altoona, with lots of rural Republican areas in between. Marino may not be particularly well liked, but he doesn’t have to be, since Cartwright has no chance of winning here. SAFE R.

South-central Pennsylvania:

District 8: Lou Barletta (R-Hazleton)

Demographics: 93/2/4/1

Prez 2008: 52-47 McCain

This district also slashes through the center of the state, but its center of gravity is more to the north, where it takes in all of Luzerne County. It then goes all the way to the Maryland border where it takes in Adams County and Gettysburg. This district’s only blue area is Wilkes-Barre, and Barletta can do well there since he is from Luzerne County. SAFE R.

As a side note, this district also takes in part of Schuylkill County. When I drew this map, one of my first considerations was to ensure that a Tim Holden comeback does not happen. To this end, I split Schuylkill County into not two, not three, but FOUR pieces, each with a large chunk of the county’s voters. Holden has nowhere to run under this map.

District 9: Scott Perry (R-Carroll Township)

Demographics: 84/9/5/2

Prez 2008: 52-47 McCain

This district is quite similar to Perry’s current district. It contains all of York County, the city of Harrisburg, some suburbs in Cumberland County, and a small slice of Adams County. Perry is completely safe here, as Obama outperformed most Democrats in York County in 2008. SAFE R.

District 10: Open Seat

Demographics: 88/4/4/2

Prez 2008: 54-45 McCain

This district is the open seat that results from the dismantling of Matt Cartwright’s district. It begins in Wayne County, takes in Pike, Monroe, and Carbon, slices through Schuylkill, includes the Republican parts of Dauphin County, takes in a small slice of Cumberland County, and then finishes with heavily Republican northern Lancaster County. I’m not quite sure who would run here, but the winner of the election would definitely be a Republican. SAFE R.

Southeast Pennsylvania:

District 11: Charlie Dent (R-Allentown)

Demographics: 82/4/11/2

Prez 2008: 55-44 Obama

This district is similar to Dent’s current district. It includes all of Lehigh, most of Northampton except for Easton, a slice of Schuylkill including Pottsville, and an arm into Montgomery that includes heavily Republican Franconia Township. Seeing as Dent survived the 2006 and 2008 waves with little difficulty, I don’t see him losing this district. Tim Holden actually lives here, but he is unknown in the Lehigh Valley, so Dent would probably beat him. LEAN R with Holden, LIKELY R otherwise

District 12: Mike Fitzpatrick (R-Levittown)

Demographics: 88/4/4/4

Prez 2008: 54-45 Obama

This district includes all of Bucks County, Easton, and parts of Northeast Philadelphia. Fitzpatrick is a popular incumbent who ran six points ahead of Romney last year, so he should be mostly safe. However, since the district is probably an Obama district with the addition of Easton, I think it’s LIKELY R.

District 13: Jim Gerlach (R-West Pikeland Township)

Demographics: 82/5/10/2

Prez 2008: 50-49 Obama

This district weaves its way around eastern and southeastern Pennsylvania, taking in the fourth slice of Schuylkill County as well as Lebanon County and parts of Berks, Lancaster, and Chester. Romney won this district last year, Democrats generally do worse here downballot, and Jim Gerlach is a strong incumbent, so this district is SAFE R.

District 14: Joe Pitts (R-Kennett Square)

Demographics: 85/5/7/3

Prez 2008: 52-47 Obama

This district takes in mostly Republican areas of Lancaster, Chester, Delaware, and Berks Counties, as well as Pottstown in Montgomery County. This district, even more than the 13th, is heavily Republican downballot, and even though Pitts is a right-winger and Obama won here in 2008, Romney won here in 2012, and we have no bench here. Pitts is safe. SAFE R.

District 15: Chaka Fattah (D-Philadelphia)

Demographics: 33/52/5/8

Prez 2008: 90-10 Obama

Although Bob Brady currently represents a substantial chunk of this district, I think Fattah would run here because this district is majority-African-American while the other Democratic district in Philadelphia is not. Either way, this is completely safe for any Democrat. SAFE D.

District 16: Pat Meehan (R-Drexel Hill)

Demographics: 84/6/4/5

Prez 2008: 56-43 Obama

This district stretches from central Delaware County to outer Berks County, with a substantial chunk of Montgomery in between. Obama performed significantly worse here in 2012 than in 2008, and Pat Meehan is a strong incumbent (he outperformed Romney by about seven points last year). Meehan could probably hold this district down in a neutral year, but he would be vulnerable in a wave year. LEAN R.

District 17: Bob Brady (D-Philadelphia)

Demographics: 32/44/17/6

Prez 2008: 88-12 Obama

This district is the other Democratic district in Philadelphia. It takes in part of North and Northeast Philly, as well as most of Lower Merion and Cheltenham Townships. Brady is safe here, but if he retires this district would be a prime opportunity for an African-American. SAFE D.

District 18: Open Seat

Demographics: 82/7/4/6

Prez 2008: 56-43 Obama

This is the riskiest district I drew. It stretches from South Philly all the way to Berks County, and is politically divided between its north and south segments. Republicans would need a strong candidate to win and hold this seat, but luckily for them they have many in the State Legislature, including State Representative Tom Murt (R-Upper Moreland Township). Democrats would probably have to run a Montco-based candidate if they wanted to win here. How this district will vote depends on the candidates, but just based on the map I’d say it is a TOSSUP.

So there we go. This map would create 14 Republican districts, one Tossup district, and only three Democratic districts in the entire state. We should all feel lucky that Republicans didn’t draw this map.

But wait, there’s more…

State Senate

I’m not going to talk about each individual district here like I did with the Congressional districts, but I’ll talk about each region of the state.

Southwest Pennsylvania:

First, freshman State Senator Sean Wiley (D) keeps his Erie-based seat. It wasn't worth trying to dismantle this one. However, this map is less merciful with other Democratic State Senators. Matt Smith (D-Mount Lebanon Township) was combined with another Democratic State Senator, and a second Pittsburgh Democrat was drawn out of their seat as well. In addition, State Senators Rich Kasunic (D-Dunbar) and Tim Solobay (D-Canonsburg) have been combined in a Democratic vote sink, while the district of John Wozniak (D-Johnstown) has been split into several pieces, each of which is far too Republican for Wozniak to win in.

South-central Pennsylvania:

Moving on to central Pennsylvania, Rob Teplitz (D-Susquehanna Township) has been placed in an unwinnable district, while all the other districts remain heavily Republican. The two Democratic districts in NEPA have been combined into one, and I also created a Democratic vote sink in the Lehigh Valley to ensure that all the surrounding districts are Republican. I also eliminated Sen. Judy Schwank (D-Fleetwood) by splitting her district into three pieces: Reading goes with northern Lancaster, Reading’s suburbs go with Lancaster’s suburbs, and a new, all-rural Berks County district is created.

Southeast Pennsylvania:

In SEPA, drawing the districts was more about keeping the current incumbents safe, since SEPA is already pretty gerrymandered. I maintained the Bucks County gerrymander, took Chester out of Dominic Pileggi (R)’s district to make him safer, and split the district of Andy Dinniman (D-West Whiteland Township) into three pieces, each of which is pretty Republican. I also created a swing district entirely in the city of Philadelphia.

So in total, this map has:

12 Safe D

1 Tossup

37 Lean, Likely, and Safe R

With this map, we’d be lucky if we got more than 15 Democrats in the State Senate, never mind a majority.

Is a gerrymander like this possible in the State House of Representatives as well? Yes, it is.

State House of Representatives

This section is going to be more maps than descriptions, since there are way too many districts (203) to go through.

Southwest Pennsylvania:

In general, I tried to combine Democratic areas into just one or two districts, and spread the moderate surrounding areas with conservative rural areas.

South-central Pennsylvania:

Other times, I went after particular incumbents, for example Rick Mirabito in Lycoming County. He’s a Democrat that represents a very Republican district. To get rid of him, I put his hometown of Williamsport in with heavily Republican Tioga County, because the voters there who don’t know him won’t vote for him.

Northeast Pennsylvania:

There are more swing districts in this map than in my other two maps. This was unavoidable; large areas of Pennsylvania are swingy, and sometimes, the districts just get too small to gerrymander.

Southeast Pennsylvania:

Many Republicans in SEPA represent districts that voted strongly for Obama in 2008, especially in Delaware County. I tried to protect these incumbents without sacrificing too many seats.

In a neutral year, Democrats would probably win around 65 of the 203 seats in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives with this map. We currently have 93 seats, so that's a very big drop.

It just goes to show that the Pennsylvania Republicans could have been a heck of a lot more ruthless with redistricting than they actually were, and we should definitely be thankful for that.

That moment marked a turning point in American history. It happened during the Eisenhower administration, when Susan would have been too young to appreciate its import.

But I think her choice of this question signals her belief that we are, once again, at a turning point when America will recoil in disgust having seen the true face of the threat to our liberty.

The McCarthy-Army hearings were notable for the fact they were the first hearings aired on TV. They had been going on for some time and could be followed on radio. But McCarthy's venality was not as obvious without the video. To give you an idea of how much of an impact these hearings had on popular culture, TV sales skyrocketed as people bought them to watch the hearings -- which dominated TV coverage for months.

The fact the NRA would target children shows how far out of bounds they are. Like McCarthy before them, they betray their wanton disregard for common decency. Hopefully, their fate will be that of McCarthy -- dying alone, forgotten, disgraced, and humiliated.

During the 2008 campaign, like many others, I harbored a dread for Obama's safety. It took me a long time to write about that, the pain of 40 year-old wounds ran deep. As I consider the depravity of the NRA's attack on the Obama children, I am shocked to realize how twisted these bastards are. As dark as the '60s were, no one ever seriously thought the Kennedy children were targets.

Searching my memory, I have a hard time finding a moment in history that could even come close to the nightmare these animals call forth with their dog-whistle. Unfortunately, I can think of such a time. The 16th Street Baptist Church Bombing in 1963. Remembering that event, it no longer shocks me that the NRA would conjure up that image. I would sooner be shocked that a rabid dog bit a child. At this point, there is only one thing left to do. We have to put them out of their misery, for our own protection:

With little actual legislation expected as the Senate winds down before its Christmas recess in less than two weeks, Democrats, who control the action on the floor, have decided to use their new power to push through dozens of presidential nominees for everything from high-profile positions like the secretary of homeland security to more obscure ones like ambassador to Albania.

But the two-century-old Senate rule book still offers the minority party plenty of avenues to stall even if the filibuster is not an option. Like a losing team using up all its timeouts before the end of a game, Republicans have started to take advantage of those alternatives and vowed on Tuesday to continue doing so as long as they could.

“It’s very important that we do what we think is necessary to bring home the point that they broke the rules,” said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. “They have basically violated everything I’ve known of as a member of the United States Senate. For us to say that’s fine, business as usual, is not something that we could possibly do.”

Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said flatly, “If the majority can’t be expected to follow the rules, then there aren’t any rules.”"

USA TODAY

Cruz%2C born in Calgary to an American mother%2C said he will renounce Canadian citizenship

Dallas newspaper had reported Texas senator had dual citizenship

Cruz released birth certificate amid speculation he could run for president in 2016

WASHINGTON -- The questions about Sen. Ted Cruz's citizenship may just be beginning.

Political analysts said Tuesday that Cruz may think he's tamping down a controversy by renouncing his previously unknown Canadian citizenship, but the situation may prove to be nettlesome — just like questions about President Obama's citizenship.

Dante Scala, a political scientist at the University of New Hampshire, calls it the ""nuisance factor.""

""If we learned anything from the allegations surrounding President Obama's citizenship, it's this: Facts may be stubborn things, but people's beliefs can be a lot more stubborn than the facts,"" Scala said. ""Many people believe what they want to believe, regardless of the facts, especially when it's about a public figure they do not like in the first place.""

Cruz, a Tea Party favorite still in his first year in the Senate, said Monday night he will renounce his Canadian citizenship, following a Dallas Morning News report that the Texas senator holds dual U.S. and Canadian citizenship.

Cruz has been making speeches to the GOP faithful in key states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, appearances that have helped land him on early lists of potential 2016 presidential candidates. Cruz released his birth certificate to the Dallas newspaper amid concerns about his eligibility to be president.

The document showed Cruz was born in 1970 in Calgary, Canada. His mother, Eleanor, was born in Delaware and was a U.S. citizen and his father, Rafael, was born in Cuba. Cruz had said in interviews prior to his Senate election that he is a U.S. citizen because his mother was born in the USA.

""Because I was a U.S. citizen at birth, because I left Calgary when I was 4 and have lived my entire life since then in the U.S., and because I have never taken affirmative steps to claim Canadian citizenship, I assumed that was the end of the matter,"" Cruz said in a statement released Monday.

""Now The Dallas Morning News says that I may technically have dual citizenship,"" Cruz continued. ""Assuming that is true, then sure, I will renounce any Canadian citizenship. Nothing against Canada, but I'm an American by birth and as a U.S. senator, I believe I should be only an American.""

Cruz will have to explain in writing why he doesn't want to be Canadian, fill out a four-page form and get clearance from Canada's spy agency, according to Reuters. The process could take up to eight months.

The U.S. Constitution says only a ""natural born"" citizen can be president. It has been the general rule that anyone born overseas to an American parent is eligible for the White House. Arizona Sen. John McCain, born in the Panama Canal Zone, had legal experts research his eligibility for president because questions came up.

Steffen Schmidt, a political science professor at Iowa State University, predicts the citizenship issue will linger for Cruz.

""I am certain that the issue of dual citizenship, which was never an issue with Obama, will percolate through the GOP herd of potential presidential contenders because politics is hardball at best and a contact sport at worst,"" Schmidt said. ""Any controversy such as birth and citizenship will be material for other Republicans aspiring to the White House to make hay with.""

Obama had insisted throughout his 2008 presidential campaign that he was born in Hawaii, but doubts about his citizenship and eligibility to be president bounced around on the Internet fueled by critics known as ""birthers."" Donald Trump persisted about Obama's birth certificate in the last presidential campaign.

Bowing to what he called ""silliness"" and distractions from ""sideshows and carnival barkers,"" Obama released his long-form birth certificate in 2011 that showed — as he had said all along — that he was born in Hawaii in 1961. That hasn't stopped some critics. Last year, for example, Maricopa County (Ariz.) Sheriff Joe Arpaio had volunteer investigators looking into the authenticity of Obama's birth certificate.

James Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin, said the stories about Cruz's dual citizenship could be perceived as the first big bump in the road for the new senator, who has been hailed by some conservatives for his willingness to challenge his own Republican Party.

The fact that Cruz said he would renounce his Canadian citizenship on the same day as the story first broke is right out of the ""Campaigns 101"" book, Henson said.

""Like a lot of things like this, they have a longer half life in part because of social media and the Internet. Things never quite go away,"" Henson said. ""I fully expected he would renounce his Canadian citizenship. They (Cruz and his team) did it very quickly in the same news cycle so as not to step on his message they want in Texas about repealing Obamacare.""

Cruz has not said whether he's interested in a White House bid, but that hasn't stopped the speculation. In a Granite State Poll released earlier this month, Cruz was in the single digits and finished well behind New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul in a survey of likely New Hampshire GOP voters about the Republican presidential nomination. Cruz won a straw poll last month conducted at the Western Conservative Summit, sponsored by Colorado Christian University.

(CNN) - The disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov and the sluggish economy have done President Barack Obama no favors, with a new poll showing just two in five Americans approve of his job performance.

According to the survey from the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, 41% of those polled approve of Obama’s job performance while 65% disapprove specifically of his handling of the economy.



Conducted October 30 through November 6, two days before the most recent job numbers were released, the poll shows that of the 2,003 individuals 18 and up interviewed by telephone, just 31% thought the President had done a good job in his handling of the economy.

Obama’s overall job approval rating represents a 14 point slide from where he stood last December, according to Pew. In the latest survey, 53% disapproved of Obama's handling of his job.

On health care, the survey indicates Americans are dissatisfied overall with Obama’s policies, 59% disapprove compared with the 37% who approve.

The approval rating is actually slightly higher than Obama’s Gallup numbers from earlier this week, which showed him nearing an all-time personal low at 39%. Those numbers have since ticked up slightly. Obama’s lowest Gallup approval rating came in 2011 when the number of Americans saying they approved of his job performance hit 38%.

Obama’s approval ratings are slightly higher than those of his most immediate predecessor at the same point, but they are much lower than two other presidents.

A year into his second term, Pew gauged President George W. Bush with a 36% job performance approval rating.

Former President Bill Clinton had a 58% job approval rating at this point in his second term. Americans under Ronald Reagan five years in said they approved of the Gipper’s job performance 62% of the time."

A small group called Carolina Conservatives United, one of dozens organized loosely under the flag of limited government, low taxes and strict adherence to the Constitution, sent out images last week of a milk carton bearing Mr. Graham’s face and asked Gov. Nikki R. Haley to issue the state’s version of an Amber Alert to find its missing senator.

“Lindsey Graham has not been seen in the state of South Carolina for most of the last two years,” said Bruce Carroll, the chairman of the group.

Conservatives in South Carolina are eager to oust Mr. Graham, who has enraged the far right for, among other things, reaching across the aisle on immigration and supporting President Obama’s nominations for the Supreme Court. Tea Party supporters called him a community organizer for the Muslim Brotherhood when, instead of heading home for the Congressional break this month, he went to Egypt at the request of the president."

What is written for the most part is second hand salvos coming from some who were told by others or news articles that make good and disturbing readings. Today however, I read

the article I am posting here in my city newspaper. It is written by State Rep. Chris Taylor (D-Madison)...who was there, ""at the American Legislative Exchange Council conference, the nation's most influential conservative policy organization (""ALEC"".

Here is her response:

).

I recently donned a conservative blue suit and suppressed my political ideals to attend an American Legislative Exchange Council conference, the nation's most influential conservative policy organization. As a Wisconsin Democratic legislator, I was able to see the ALEC agenda in action.

ALEC is mostly funded by large corporations. While most legislators who attended the conference received corporate funded ""scholarships"" covering their travel, hotel, conference registration and food, I forked over nearly $1,000 out of pocket to become a member of ALEC and attend its 40th anniversary conference in Chicago in August.

ALEC is a ménage à trois of wealthy corporations, conservative think tanks and right-wing state legislators. I was simultaneously fascinated and horrified by the degree ALEC policy infests our country, maximizing corporate profits and free reign. One keynote speaker, Wall Street Journal columnist and Club for Growth founder Stephen Moore, summed it up: ""What we really need is more rich people.""

ALEC develops model bills on ""free market"" topics that legislative members introduce in their states. State legislators, corporations and conservative think tank members comprise task forces that create model bills. Corporate money coughed up in exchange for task force membership greases ALEC's wheels. As a result, private members run the ALEC show. In rare instances where state legislators raised concerns about policy positions, I witnessed think tank representatives and corporate lobbyists shoot them down.

The Citizens for Self-Governance, a special-interest group that ALEC promotes, demonstrated how the process works. Legislators were entreated to organize to ""save the Republic"" by amending the U.S. Constitution to abolish the Supreme Court and otherwise drastically limit the power of the federal government. In exchange, we were promised the support of a grass-roots army of tea party activists and home-school advocates in addition to bundled campaign contributions.

ALEC is well underway to privatizing public education. According to the Center for Media and Democracy, in 2013, 139 ALEC model bills to fund private and religious schools with taxpayer money were introduced throughout the nation. At the education task force meeting, the pro-voucher American Federation for Children boasted 20 states now funding some form of private school K-12 vouchers.

Other model bills aim to gut workers' wage protection and benefits, limit collective bargaining rights, limit your rights to sue and curb states' power to regulate certain professions.

ALEC advances these policies shrouded in secrecy, with no public list of corporate members. Photo ID, name badges and sign-in sheets at every event rigidly controlled conference participation. I saw only one outside press camera during the entire conference. Although ALEC members insist on accountability and transparency in the public realm, they loathe it when applied to their own influence over legislation.

But ALEC has an Achilles heel. An ALEC think tank member solicited my opinion about a constitutional amendment strategy requiring congressional approval of federal regulations. I replied that I didn't think it would inspire people to amend the U.S. Constitution. He explained that with Republican domination in so many states, and guaranteed corporate support, the consent of the people is unnecessary.

This is where democracy can win over special interest influence. In ALEC nation, people are irrelevant and democracy a burden. When the people's interests are truly represented by policy-makers, and the origin of bills exposed, ALEC fails.

ALEC's corporate funders, who are also campaign donors to many ALEC members, have shrouded themselves in secrecy for this reason. ALEC cannot otherwise exist. Concerned policy-makers and the public must ensure that ALEC's promotion of corporate profits over the needs of actual people leads to the downfall of ALEC nation.

State Rep. Chris Taylor (D-Madison) will soon introduce the ALEC Accountability Act into the Wisconsin Legislature. Before being elected to the Assembly, Taylor, an attorney, served as public policy director for Planned Parenthood in Wisconsin.

http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/30/how-immigration-reform-and-demographics-could-change-presidential-math/,2013-04-30 00:00:00,['Nate Silver'],How Immigration Reform and Demographics Could Change Presidential Math,"A bill to allow unauthorized immigrants to gain citizenship carries electoral risks and rewards for the Republican Party. On the one hand, if the bill were passed, some of those immigrants would eventually vote. Roughly 80 percent of illegal immigrants are Hispanic, and about 10 percent are Asian — groups that voted heavily Democratic in the last two elections.

On the other hand, such legislation could plausibly improve the Republican Party’s brand image among Hispanics and Asian-Americans, perhaps allowing the party to fare better among these voters in future elections. Which of these effects would outweigh the other?

The answer is not necessarily obvious. As Harry J. Enten of The Guardian points out, such immigration reform is unlikely to create an electoral “bonanza” for Democrats, as some faulty attempts to analyze the question have concluded. But whether the legislation could be net-beneficial to the Republican Party depends on the assumptions you make.

So, I’ve designed a tool, in the form of an interactive graphic, that allows you to make different sets of assumptions about immigration reform, population growth and racial voting patterns. Although the graphic contains a number of simplifications, we hope it will be useful to experiment with.

The graphic begins with 2012 voting results as a baseline. In each state, and the District of Columbia, I’ve estimated the vote for Barack Obama and Mitt Romney in the five racial categories (white, black, Hispanic, Asian and “other”) that are tracked in exit polls.

Because the exit poll data is incomplete — 19 states did not have exit polls last year, and the polls often did not break down the results where a racial population was small (for instance, Asian-Americans in Montana) — I had to rely on various forms of extrapolation and interpolation to fill in the missing data points. My research suggests, for example, that the share of the Hispanic vote going to Mr. Obama in each state was modestly correlated with the share of the white vote he won in those states, while his share of the vote among African-Americans and Asian-Americans was not correlated with the white vote and instead was relatively constant from state to state.

The estimates are slightly more speculative in states where no exit polling was conducted in 2012. But because a complete set of exit polls were conducted in 2008, it was reasonably easy to extrapolate the results forward based on the overall shift in the vote in each state from 2008 to 2012, and the changes in national voting patterns among the different racial groups. The estimates are calibrated, however, so that the whole matches the sum of the parts: if you add up the estimated voting results among the five racial groups in each state, the results should exactly match the overall vote totals for Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney last year.

The interactive graphic then allows you to make three sets of assumptions to consider how the vote might change going forward.

Step 1: Population Growth

Immigration reform is being contested against a background of an increasingly nonwhite electorate. Seventy-two percent of voters were white in 2012, down from 74 percent in 2008 and 81 percent in 2000.

The graphic allows you to consider the effects of further population changes by entering growth rates for the five major racial groups. As a default, it assumes that the number of white voters will grow by 0.5 percent a year, the number of black voters by 1 percent a year, the number of Hispanic and “other” voters by 3 percent a year and the number of Asian voters by 3.5 percent a year. These figures represent a rough consensus of various population growth estimates.

Note that these changes are measured on an annual basis, rather than per election cycle, and that the changes will compound over time. If the number of Hispanic voters grows at 3 percent a year, for example, the total increase in Hispanic voters would be 12 to 13 percent by 2016.

The graphic also allows you to select the year in which the hypothetical election would be contested — population growth will have a larger impact the further you go out in time. (As a default, I’ve chosen 2028, which would be the first presidential election after the proposed 13-year path to citizenship.)

The calculation assumes that the growth rate among each racial population will be the same in each state — that is, if the Hispanic population grows by 3 percent a year nationally, it will grow by 3 percent a year in California, by 3 percent a year in Alabama, and so forth. However, because fast-growing racial groups represent a larger share of the population in some states, these states may grow faster over all. The graphic will automatically reapportion electoral votes based on these population growth estimates. (We may introduce the ability to make more sophisticated assumptions about population changes in future versions of the analysis.)

Step 2: Unauthorized Immigrants

The graphic also allows you to consider the effects of legislation that would introduce new citizens to the electorate. These changes are assumed to have a one-time effect: that is, they would affect the status of the roughly 11 million unauthorized immigrants who are already in the United States, but not future groups of immigrants. The calculation assumes that this impact is separate from the long-term changes in the voter population evaluated in the previous step.

The graphic requires you to estimate what percentage of that 11 million would become citizens under the new legislation, and what percentage of those new citizens would vote. Based on the research cited by Mr. Enten, we use 50 percent as a default value in each case. That is, half the unauthorized immigrants would become citizens, and half of those new citizens would vote, meaning that 25 percent of unauthorized immigrants would eventually become voters. But these assumptions can be changed.

You can also choose how to allocate the new citizens among the five racial categories. A majority of immigrants here illegally are Hispanic, but not all of them are. Instead, based on a variety of sources, I estimate that 80 percent are Hispanic, 11 percent Asian, 5 percent white, 2 percent black and 2 percent other races. The graphic assumes that once these immigrants became citizens, they would vote Democratic or Republican in the same proportions as other members of their racial group.

Step 3: Changes to Racial Voting Patterns

Finally, the graphic allows you to evaluate the effects of changes in the share of votes going to each party from each racial group. The changes are assumed to be uniform across states. So, for example, if your assumption is that the G.O.P. does five percentage points better with Hispanics nationally than it did in 2012, the Republican share of the Hispanic vote is assumed to grow to 44 percent from 39 percent in Florida, to 23 percent from 18 percent in Illinois, and so forth.

Note that the graphic can be used to evaluate the effects of any of these three steps independent of the others. For instance, if you are interested in seeing how the G.O.P. might have done in 2012 had it performed significantly better among Hispanics, but without considering the effects of population growth or immigration reform, you can set the election year to 2012 and zero out the values for the number of illegal immigrants who would become citizens.

One Potential Scenario

The most interesting application, however, is in seeing how the various positive and negative effects for Republicans might play out against one another.

Suppose, for example, that the voter population grows in accordance with the defaults assumed in the model. This would produce a net of 6.3 million new votes for Democrats by 2028.

And suppose that 25 percent of the immigrants currently here illegally gain citizenship and vote by 2028. The model calculates that this would provide another 1.2 million votes for Democrats.

But suppose also that, as a result of immigration reform, the Republicans go from winning about 28 percent of the Hispanic vote and 24 percent of the Asian vote (as they did in 2012) to 35 percent of each group by 2028. That would shift about 4.8 million votes back to the G.O.P. — about four times more than it lost from the immigrants becoming citizens and voting predominantly Democratic. However, it wouldn’t be enough to outweigh the Democratic gains from long-term population growth.

Different assumptions, naturally, will yield different results. In general, however, you should find that population growth and changes in racial voting patterns will have much larger effects than how the current group of unauthorized immigrants is treated.

The high-stakes question, in other words, is whether immigration reform would really allow Republicans to improve their vote share substantially among Hispanics and Asians, without costing them too many votes among white voters. If so, that is where the electoral “bonanza” might lie."

Some Florida Republicans are reportedly growing concerned that a new bill curbing the use of mail-in voting could end up backfiring on the party. After Florida's state legislature recently passed a bill to place new restrictions on mail ballots, some Republicans in the state are ""reacting with alarm,"" The Washington Post reports. After all, the bill will be ""curtailing a practice that millions of state Republicans use,"" the Post writes, and Republicans are worried their ""political fortunes are in peril"" as a result. The bill, for example, requires that voters reapply for mail ballots each two-year cycle, whereas the current law requires them to reapply every four years, and it also restricts the use of drop boxes, the report notes. The state legislature moved to enact the changes following the 2020 presidential election, during which former President Donald Trump attacked the use of mail-in voting. But almost 35 percent of GOP voters in Florida cast their ballots by mail in 2020, and Republicans fear the bill will ""further undercut the party's ability to encourage mail voting,"" the Post writes. ""Donald Trump attempted to ruin a perfectly safe and trusted method of voting,"" a Republican consultant told the Post.

Some Republicans reportedly discussed trying to exclude these two groups from the requirement to request mail ballots each cycle but were told this would ""raise equal protection problems.""

Updated x1,"From Stanford University's Hoover Institution Policy Review, an article by Tod Lindberg titled, Left 3.0 - Obama and the Emergence of a Newer Left:



...

Obama staked his legacy on patching the largest remaining hole in the New Deal social welfare safety net. Guaranteed lifelong access to affordable health care has been at the top of the Left’s policy agenda since fdr. Bill Clinton tried, failed, gave up for good. Obama would not give up. Despite an economy that continued to sputter contrary to his own expectations and those of his advisors, despite public opinion polls that early turned against the reform effort, despite ominous electoral signals, and despite having to abandon the Left’s cherished “public option,” he persisted. And he prevailed. It was a political risk on the order of the one Ronald Reagan took in cooperating with Fed Chairman Paul Volcker’s successful effort to wring inflation out of the economy in 1981–82 at the cost of a brutal recession. Obama lost Democrats their House majority in doing so. Not that they thought it would happen, but in the view of many on the Left, health care reform on the scale Obama was able to achieve, though imperfect, would be worth losing a House majority. The remainder of Obama’s first term would be a domestic policy desert if not worse, entailing various capitulations to the gop, at least in the eyes of many on the Left at the time. But he had his signature achievement, subject to validation by the Supreme Court and the ability to sustain enough Democratic political power in Washington to prevent its repeal.

...

The new media environment has been very favorable to Left 3.0. Vibrant websites abound, some of them extraordinarily influential: The “netroots” have been a formidable force. The sorting of the political parties into left and right has an analogue in the sorting of the consumption of political opinion. It has never been easier to avoid encountering opinions with which one might disagree. The effect of this on the Left side of the political spectrum has helped promote the solidarity of Left 3.0 and the Democratic Party: The victors in the internal political debate were those advocating for “the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party.”"

On a day that echoed with refrains from the civil rights era and tributes to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Mr. Obama dispensed with the post-partisan appeals of four years ago to lay out a forceful vision of advancing gay rights, showing more tolerance toward illegal immigrants, preserving the social welfare safety net and acting to stop climate change.

At times he used his speech, delivered from the West Front of the Capitol, to reprise arguments from the fall campaign, rebutting the notion expressed by conservative opponents that America risks becoming “a nation of takers” and extolling the value of proactive government in society. Instead of declaring the end of “petty grievances,” as he did taking the oath as the 44th president in 2009, he challenged Republicans to step back from their staunch opposition to his agenda.

“Progress does not compel us to settle centuries-old debates about the role of government for all time — but it does require us to act in our time,” he said in the 18-minute address. “For now decisions are upon us, and we cannot afford delay. We cannot mistake absolutism for principle or substitute spectacle for politics or treat name-calling as reasoned debate. We must act.”"

Will Weatherford, speaker for the Florida House of Representatives, stands against his party's efforts to

skew the will of voters by rigging the electoral college to favor the GOP.

While Republicans ponder their plans to rig the system so that a Democratic presidential candidate who wins a state's popular vote in 2016 won't win a majority of the Electoral College votes in that state, two prominent members of the party in Florida are saying no way. If the system had been arranged in 2012 the way leading Republicans intend for the future, Mitt Romney would now be sitting in the Oval Office despite having lost the popular vote by nearly five million ballots.

Republicans in states where they hold majorities in the legislature but where President Obama won the popular vote, and thus the electoral college vote, want to award the latter's votes by how things went in GOP-gerrymandered congressional districts. If that system had been in place last year in the six target states—Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, Florida, Virginia—it would have shifted as many as 64 electoral college votes, yielding a close victory for Romney. Republicans are most definitely not proposing to introduce the same plan in states like Texas. There Obama lost the popular vote but would have gained 12 additional electoral votes if the Republican congressional district plan had been in effect.

This isn't some phantom threat of election theft. It's been endorsed by many Republicans, including Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus. It's not the sleaziest ace-up-the-sleeve trick Republicans have ever played, but it ranks high on the list.

However, there are a few Republicans who think the plan reeks:



Virginia State Sen. Ralph Smith (R) has come out against a proposal to apportion electoral votes in the state by Congressional district, warning it could set off a chain reaction of similar schemes around the country. Smith sits on the closely divided Privileges and Elections Committee that is examining the bill, meaning his opposition likely ensures the proposal doesn't reach the floor for a vote.

""To me, that's like saying in a football game, 'We should have only three quarters, because we were winning after three quarters and the beat us in the fourth,'"" Weatherford [...] told the Herald/Times. ""I don't think we need to change the rules of the game, I think we need to get better."" [...] Not only is Weatherford opposed to the idea, fellow Republican and Florida Senate President Don Gaetz is decidedly cool to it. When asked about changing the way Electoral College votes are apportioned, Gaetz thought the entire system should be scrapped. ""I think we should abolish the Electoral College but nobody in Washington has called to ask for my opinion,"" Gaetz said. ""If James Madison had asked me, and I had been there, I would have said a popular vote is a better way to do it."" Gaetz said the electoral college shrinks the presidential campaign to a handful of states as it did in 2012.

And Florida House Speaker Will Weatherford doesn't like the idea , and he isn't alone among the state's party leaders who take that stand:

That puts Gaetz in line with what many progressives say. The National Popular Vote project takes a kind of backdoor approach to breaking the back of electoral college with a system in which state legislatures enact laws guaranteeing that the presidential candidate who wins the popular vote nationwide gets the state's electoral votes, too, if enough states sign onto the compact. So far, states with a total of 132 electoral votes have signed on. Once the project encompasses enough states to reach electoral 270 votes, the system is activated.

If Gaetz and Weatherford are serious about their views, they ought to propose it formally in the Florida legislature. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who has also spoken in favor of the popular vote approach, could encourage her state legislature to do the same. Together, those states would bring the National Popular Vote project up to 172, nearly two-thirds of its goal. Making the NPV a success would stop this crooked scam in its tracks and turn the electoral college into an anachronistic appendage.

http://news.yahoo.com/young-gop-leaders-see-substantive-changes-082441549.html,,[],Young GOP leaders see need for substantive changes,"MOBILE, Ala. (AP) — Republicans hoping to reach beyond the party's white, aging core must do more than retool campaign strategy and tactics, say young GOP leaders pressing elected officials to offer concrete policies to counter Democratic initiatives.

""It's very easy to just say no, and there are times where it's appropriate to say no,"" said Jason Weingartner of New York, the newly elected chairman of the Young Republican National Federation. ""But there are times where you need to lead and present ideas on the issues of the day.""

Weingartner and other under-40 activists at a recent national young Republican gathering in Mobile said their party must follow an all-of-the-above approach. Their assessment goes beyond the more general prescriptions that many party leaders, including Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, have offered since November, when Republicans lost the popular vote for the fifth time in the past six presidential elections.

The latest loss was due in large measure to President Barack Obama's advantage over Republican nominee Mitt Romney among younger and nonwhite voters.

For the most part, Priebus has avoided policy recommendations for elected Republicans and says the Republican platform, a political document that's supposed to reflect the core values of the party, isn't the problem.

Weingartner and many of his colleagues agree with Priebus on the platform, and they praise the ""Growth and Opportunity Project"" that Priebus outlined in March.

But the young Republicans' ideas are more explicit than the chairman's blueprint and stand in contrast to a hyperpartisan Congress where many Republicans tailor their actions to please primary voters who loathe cooperation with Democrats.

Weingartner said House Republicans, who won't pass the Democratic-led Senate's version of an immigration overhaul, should pass their own version that at least ""streamlines and expands"" legal slots for foreign students and workers.

Story continues

For now, he said, that would sidestep Republicans who demand border security and Democrats who demand a citizenship path for immigrants already in the country illegally.

On health care, Weingartner said that besides regularly voting to repeal Obama's law, the GOP should emphasize its own ideas such as buying insurance across state lines, while better explaining the Affordable Care Act's cost shift onto younger, healthy individuals.

On same-sex marriage and abortion, young GOP leaders say Republicans should tolerate a range of views, even while maintaining a socially conservative identity. Some of these activists say their party must tread lightly after the Supreme Court recently threw out the most powerful part of the Voting Rights Act, the law that became a major turning point in black Americans' struggle for equal rights and political power.

""We don't have to lose our principles,"" said Angel Garcia, who leads the Young Republicans in Chicago, Obama's hometown. ""But we have to have a conversation on all these issues so we don't leave Democrats to say we're just old white men and racist, bigoted homophobes.""

Chris Reid, a Birmingham, Ala., lawyer, said the GOP has to become more inclusive. ""I get really sick listening to people say it's all or nothing in order to be a good Republican,"" he said.

The GOP still controls the U.S. House, holds 30 governor's seats and stands a reasonable chance of regaining control of the U.S. Senate in the 2014 elections. But 2012 presidential returns justify concern.

Whites, who represent a shrinking share of the electorate, accounted for about 9 out of 10 Romney votes. Obama won Latinos by about 44 percentage points and African-Americans by 85 points. Those groups together accounted for almost one-quarter of all voters.

Among whites, younger age ranges trended more toward Obama. Voters from 18 to 29 years old opted for the president over Romney by a 60-37 margin. Among those age 30 to 44, Obama claimed 52 percent, 7 percentage points more than Romney.

Some Republican strategists say that Obama, as the first black president, set the high-water mark for Democrats among nonwhite voters. Weingartner said the 51-year-old president twice faced much older opponents, a circumstance that could be reversed in 2016. Of several potential GOP candidates, only Texas Gov. Rick Perry, 63, is older than 50.

The Democrats' leading hopefuls are Vice President Joe Biden, 70, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, 65.

""We have youth and enthusiasm on our side this time,"" Weingartner said, though he added that it would be foolish to pin GOP hopes on age.

Speaking to delegates, Priebus promised a ""50-state strategy"" that involves hiring workers to engage minority communities. ""We can't win if we just show up four months before a presidential election every four years,"" he said.

Garcia, the Chicago Republican, said that model, patterned after Obama's use of neighborhood-based networks, will identify new supporters. But he said the outreach needs a foundation of specifics.

Expanding legal immigration, Garcia said, could make it harder for Democrats to frame Republicans as ""anti-immigrant,"" a label several Republicans said Romney cemented by advocating ""self-deportation."" After remaking legal immigration, Weingartner said House leaders could realize, as part of a border security plan, that the border will never be completely secure, while getting Democrats to consent to a ""path to legal status"" rather than a ""path to citizenship.""

That approach, both men said, would increase the likelihood that Latinos listen to Republican arguments for low taxes, light regulation and individual opportunity.

Darius Foster, a black business consultant in Alabama, said he encounters similar trust issues among African-Americans, who have overwhelmingly supported Democrats since the civil rights movement.

""I never have to defend Republican principles,"" he said. ""I have to defend Republicans."" That's even harder, he said, since neighboring Shelby County, south of Birmingham, successfully challenged part of the Voting Rights Act.

A strategy for social issues isn't as clear, given that younger voters generally are more liberal on those issues than is the GOP platform.

Of course, there's no guarantee of nuanced approaches from elected officials.

Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., told delegates that strong opposition to the Senate's immigration push will help Republicans win working-class votes because some wages would fall at first in an expanded labor pool.

Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley urged House Republicans to ""stand strong"" against Obama.

Rep. Martha Roby of Alabama, 37, told her fellow Young Republicans that a major problem is ""low-information voters ... who have not been exposed to our arguments."" She added: ""We win not by changing our policies but by spending more time and energy convincing people we are right.""

All three got standing ovations.

Republican Bradley Byrne sailed to victory in a special election for an Alabama seat in the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday.

Byrne defeated Democrat Burton LeFlore, claiming about two-thirds of the vote when the race was called by The Associated Press, with 64 percent of precincts reporting.

“Not fight and not name call, but to get real results,” Byrne said. “Fight hard against the Washington establishment holding our nation back. We are a great country, but we are not acting like a great country in Washington.”

Norquist told The Hill that he opposed allowing conservative talk radio hosts Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin to moderate the 2016 Republican presidential primary debates, saying it would not be “useful.”

Having conservative talk radio hosts Mark Levin or Rush Limbaugh host debates would be “not useful,” Norquist told The Hill. Talk radio hosts, he said, are primarily entertainers who would draw attention away from the candidates themselves. He also said the radio hosts, despite their popularity, did not necessarily represent the Republican mainstream. He pointed toward immigration reform as an example, saying that while Levin opposes comprehensive immigration reform fiercely, polls show most Republicans are amenable to it.

Someone close to the Limbaugh camp spoke to Breitbart News said, “It’s ironic that when everyone was jumping on the bash Grover bandwagon, Rush never said a word. He has too much class.” The source also noted that in the past Norquist has used Rush’s quotes on the ATR website to fundraise and promote his cause of the moment.

“Some friend, huh.”

During the vote at the last Republican National Committee meeting when members decided to oust CNN and NBC as potential networks to moderate primary debates over the airing of a Hillary Clinton movie, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus commented it would be a “very good idea” to have both Limbaugh and Levin as RNC debate moderators. “I actually think that’s a very good idea,” He said, adding, “I mean, there’s a lot of good people out there that can actually understand the base of the Republican Party, the primary voters.”

A GOP state party official agreed with Priebus telling Breitbart News, “[Limbaugh and Levin] should be moderators. Chris Matthews did the primary debate in 2008.”

Immediately after Priebus’s comments, Limbaugh said on his radio show, “I don’t see how I can, I’m too famous.” However, Limbaugh noted the debate would certainly get high ratings."

Des Moines, Iowa (CNN) - Vice President Joe Biden, widely assumed to be plotting a third presidential bid in 2016, shouldn’t bother booking any flights to Des Moines, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said.

“Biden is dead meat out here,” Branstad asserted Wednesday in an interview with CNN inside his office at the gilded state capitol building. “He is not going anywhere.”

Branstad, a 67-year old Republican, admitted his lack of familiarity with the passions of Iowa’s liberal Democratic caucus-goers, but he was unusually blunt when discussing Biden’s latest flirtation with the White House.

“Washington, D.C. is extremely unpopular,” he said. “Biden is so associated with this administration and all of its failures. He was unpopular before and he is even less popular now.”

Just 38% of Iowans approve of the job President Obama is doing, a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday found, a number Branstad cited repeatedly. It’s the President's worst performance ever in Quinnipiac surveys of Iowa, the state that launched his historic presidential campaign in 2008.

The poll did not measure Biden’s standing.

Branstad was more charitable when chatting about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, but he predicted that she, too, will be dragged down by her ties to Washington and the flagging popularity of the president if she decides to run.

“I am probably not the one to ask about a Democratic caucus because I have never been to one,” he said. “But in terms of the electorate here, I think that Washington D.C. is extremely unpopular, and she is associated with Washington D.C. and served in [Obama’s] administration.”

Unprompted, Branstad cited another Quinnipiac poll released this week that showed Clinton losing Iowa in a hypothetical 2016 general election match-up against New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Asked if Iowa Democrats might be open to someone other than Clinton, Branstad said there is “potential and possibility.”

“I saw some senator from Massachusetts that liberals are intrigued by,” he said, gesturing to his press aide for a clue.

“Elizabeth Warren,” the aide offered, naming the senator who ruled out a 2016 bid earlier this month, pledging to serve the remainder of a term that runs through 2018."

A filibuster of his nomination is still possible, a likely first for a cabinet nominee.

Editor’s Note: Gordon Stewart is former deputy chief speechwriter to President Jimmy Carter and the moderator of TheNextDeal.org, an online project to revise the U.S. social contract for the 21st century.

It’s a good bet that millions of Americans on Monday greeted President Barack Obama’s magnificent second inaugural address not just with applause and cheers of approval but with loud sighs of relief.

Gone were his first inaugural speech’s bizarre equal division of blame for the wreckage of real lives between the “greed of some” and the so-called “collective failure” of the rest of us. Instead, Obama rang out his commitment to equality for all, not the “shrinking few and lucky” who call the rest of us simply “takers.”

Nor did our president chide us to put away ”childish things” by seeming to describe deep differences over “perpetual war,” climate change, immigration, equal rights, voting rights, rights to decent wages for honest labor and rights to “basic measures of security and dignity” as “petty grievances.”

Gordon Stewart

This time around, Obama offered us not song and dance morals from an old Depression musical comedy to “pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off and start all over again,” but solid, specific support for the serious New Deal pillars of Social Security and Medicare.

Almost for the first time as president, he dared to utter the word “poverty” in a major address, and declared ”we must be a source of hope to the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the victims of prejudice.”

These moments and more earned his speech the warm response and respect it deserves. Now it will receive the careful analysis it cannot escape. This will reveal even more profound differences between Obama’s second inaugural speech and his historic appearance on the steps of the U.S. Capitol as the president of color few believed they would see elected in their lifetimes.

1. His first inaugural address was a puzzling disappointment after the passionate convictions he expressed so powerfully in both his primary and general election campaigns. Some suggested that his finest moment was Election Night in Chicago’s Grant Park. No one who followed his campaign, including his opponents, could have been surprised by his second inaugural speech.

2. Monday’s words were those of a leader who has chosen to fight for the change he believes in over flailing attempts to placate that only produced astounding charges that he was unwilling to compromise when in fact he had given so much in doomed efforts to do just that.

3. His repeated calls for “We the People” to work together were not-so-subtle warnings of who would be responsible if the U.S. government is unable to do so. No blame-splitting this time.

4. Even Obama’s delivery and demeanor conveyed conviction, not the sense that a press aide might soon emerge from Caesar’s tent beside the Rubicon to explain that his thinking is still “evolving.”

Opinion: How Obama made opportunity real in America

In this second inaugural address, Obama the Candidate became Obama the President without a trace of the bait and switch to which too many citizens have become so accustomed that in their cynicism they cease to vote at all. He spoke as a leader who has stopped splitting differences and is prepared to make choices and fight for them – together as We the People if possible, alone as Obama the President if not.

Opinion: Obama’s America, better than what Founders imagined

In fact, Monday’s speech felt as if after four frustrating years of trying to appease his opponents, Barack Obama had finally met Machiavelli one night in the Lincoln Bedroom and learned that when faced with two equally powerful opposing forces, a president must choose, or both will attack him. He sounded like a leader who knows now that the difference between making a choice and making love is that decisions don’t feel better the longer you can draw them out.

As Obama goes from celebration to celebration, his supporters and his opponents have a much clearer idea of what he will do tomorrow, and for the next 1,000-plus days he is president.

This time when he tells banks and insurance companies that “a free market only thrives when there are rules to ensure competition and fair play,” they will do well to believe him. Because even with all the cash he collected to fill the coffers of his campaign, Monday’s speech makes it clear he will not let it line the coffin of his presidency.

It betrays no security measures to mention that the Secret Service chooses oddly accurate code words for the presidents it protects.

After Obama’s first inauguration, that could have been “dancer.” After Monday’s address, it could legitimately consider ”leader.” If the president is able to act in accordance with his second inaugural address, it’s not impossible now to imagine “Lincoln.” He wasn’t afraid to fight when the nation would not stay together.

Christian Adams'],Virginia Judges Block Voter ID Advocate from Electoral Board,"In Virginia, the Fairfax Democratic Party is gloating over the effective removal of voter integrity advocate Hans von Spakovsky from the electoral board of the largest county in the state.

As the end of von Spakovsky’s current term on the board approached its end, Fairfax Republicans submitted his name and two others as nominees for two of the board’s three seats (since Republican Bob McDonnell currently serves as governor, his party gets the majority of seats). In an unprecedented move, Fairfax County Circuit Judges rejected von Spakovsky for the position, even though Republicans designated him as their preferred nominee.

Because of his fight against voter fraud, local Democrats and national left-wing journalists targeted von Spakovsky, a Heritage Foundation fellow and Breitbart contributor, for removal from the board. These critics asserted that von Spakovsky and other conservatives hoped to disenfranchise voters by supporting election integrity measures like Voter ID in 2012.

Cesar del Aguila, chairman of the Fairfax Democratic Party, and his attorney John Farrell demanded these judges remove von Spakovsky. These judges are themselves appointed by a partisan legislative body and capitulated to the demands of the Democrats. Reporter Robert McCartney amplified the Democrats’ complaints on the pages of the Washington Post.

Aguila and Farrell claimed von Spakovsky acted in a “partisan” way on the board. However, of von Spakovsky’s 224 votes, he made 221 in unison with the board’s Democrat commissioner. Only three votes were split 2-1.

The refusal to appoint the top designee of the Republican Party was entirely unprecedented in Virginia and promises to bring legislative scrutiny on the actions of Chief Judge Dennis Smith. It may also incite Republicans to scuttle the designees of the Democrat party in the future.

Von Spakovsky is one of the nation’s leading voices against voter fraud, and his removal has serious ramifications for clean elections in the swing state of Virginia.

The Fairfax Democrats reveal a larger national identity crisis within the Democratic party; rational centrist elements have been pushed aside by loud fringe elements led by activists such as Aguila and Farrell. Nearly the entire Democratic legislative delegation from Fairfax and all of the Democrat county supervisors consider Aguila and Farrell to be rough and unhinged but are powerless to tame them.

Von Spakovsky invited the wrath of the radical left when he stopped the distribution of literature published by the ideologically charged League of Women Voters in government election offices. In fact, he stopped literature distribution by all third-party groups. The response by the Democrat party reveals the integration of purportedly non-partisan election advocacy groups like the League with party priorities.

Farrell also resented that von Spakovsky was adamant that Fairfax County comply with the Help America Vote Act of 2002, a federal election law. That law requires that the names of provisional voters be kept confidential, but the Democrat party wanted to harvest that data.

Jay McConville, Chairman of the Fairfax County Republican Party, responded to Friday’s events:

It is disappointing that the judges would bow to political pressure and allow partisan gamesmanship to win the day. More than that, it is shocking that the Fairfax County Democratic Party would challenge the capabilities of Mr. Von Spakovsky, who has served this community so well and with great dedication during his previous term. Clearly the FCDC is more interested in partisan fights than in the proper functioning of the electoral system or the integrity of the vote.

Unfortunately, the righteous indignation of the Republican Party was too little and too late. The GOP must quickly learn that election administration issues are a blood sport to the left. Anyone who stands in their way is personally targeted and polarized. Until Republicans start fighting back just as hard, the left will keep bloodying those courageous Americans preserving the integrity of our electoral process. Until the GOP engages the fight at the outset and fiercely attacks the attackers, the administration of American elections will be dominated by the narrative of the left.

http://news.yahoo.com/senate-control-hinges-fate-southern-dems-183626132.html,,[],Senate control hinges on fate of Southern Dems,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans are counting on some Southern comfort to win Senate control next year.

The fate of Democratic incumbents in GOP-trending Arkansas, Louisiana and North Carolina, the ability of the 71-year-old GOP leader to hold his Kentucky seat and the eventual outcome of a Georgia primary will help decide whether Republicans gain the six seats necessary to grab power in the Senate for the final two years of Barack Obama's presidency.

Fifteen months before Election Day, the GOP has a genuine shot at the majority, especially with the midterm elections' traditional low turnout and possible Obama fatigue on the party's side. But both Republicans and Democrats stop short of writing off several Democratic incumbents who would have to lose for the GOP to regain power, and some Republicans worry about holding GOP seats in Kentucky and Georgia.

The transformation of the South from solidly Democratic to nearly all Republican in the half century since the 1964 Civil Rights Act has made the states generally inhospitable to Democratic politicians. And next year's elections will test whether the last remaining Southern Democrats can survive.

Overall numbers and geography favor the GOP — 21 Democratic seats are on state ballots compared with 14 Republican. Seven of the Democratic seats are in states that Obama lost in 2012 to Republican Mitt Romney, some by 15 points or more. Adding to the GOP bullishness: Democratic retirements in three of the seven states — West Virginia, Montana and South Dakota — and a few recruiting disappointments.

""There's a lot of hard work to be done, but we feel very comfortable about the progression of the 2014 map in our favor and the quality of Republican candidates expressing an interest in running in key states,"" said Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

Still, Republicans had a similar edge in 2010 and 2012, and failed to take control because of flawed candidates and ill-conceived remarks. The GOP list of lost opportunities is long — Delaware, Colorado, Nevada in 2010, Missouri, Indiana, North Dakota and Montana in 2012.

Story continues

""All of those prognostications were wrong,"" Guy Cecil, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said. ""One of the things that we demonstrated in the last election is that Senate races are about the two people who are on the ballot.""

Next year's Senate contests stand as perhaps the best chance for the GOP, especially since Republicans will have to defend 24 Senate seats to the Democrats' 10 in the presidential election year of 2016.

Currently, Democrats hold a 54-46 edge. Newark Mayor Cory Booker is expected to win next week's Democratic primary in New Jersey and the Oct. 16 special election, boosting the Democratic margin to 10.

BLUEGRASS BRAWL

The political ads and videos in Kentucky make it seem like five-term Sen. Mitch McConnell has three opponents — primary challenger Matt Bevin, Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes and Obama.

With close to $10 million on hand to make his case, McConnell is casting himself as the bulwark against the president's policies in a state that Obama lost by 23 percentage points last year. ""To Barack Obama and his allies, coal country represents a threat,"" McConnell intones in a video that repeatedly shows the president and never mentions Grimes by name.

McConnell is seeking not just another six-year term but also a shot at the prize of Senate majority leader. And he is taking no chances either politically or legislatively.

He has run four television ads since March, responding quickly to outside groups, promoting his own candidacy and seeking to define his rivals. McConnell has assailed Bevin over payment of taxes in two ads, with one airing even before the businessman announced his GOP primary candidacy.

In the Senate last week, McConnell voted with fellow Kentuckian and tea party favorite Rand Paul to cut U.S. aid to Egypt. The vote put McConnell on the opposite side of the powerful American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a rare place for a senator who has been a strong supporter of Israel.

On Thursday, in an embarrassment for McConnell, audio of a Jan. 9 telephone conversation revealed that his campaign manager said he was ""holding my nose"" while working for the candidate. In a brief telephone interview, Jesse Benton, who has deep tea party ties, didn't dispute the authenticity of the taping, saying he wasn't confirming it but wasn't denying it either. Separately, in a statement emailed to reporters, he said he believes in McConnell and is 100 percent committed to his re-election.

Economic Policy Journal posted the audio online.

If McConnell dispatches Bevin, who is on the air with his own ad hitting the senator for supporting the Wall Street bailout in 2007, Democrat Grimes has served notice that she'll be a tough competitor.

""I don't scare easy,"" she declares in a web video that criticizes McConnell as an obstructionist.

Republicans take heart in the senator's history of nail-biting wins. He prevailed by 5,169 votes in 1984 and survived another challenge in 2008.

LAST DAYS OF SOUTHERN DEMOCRATS?

Republicans are counting on two House members — one in office just seven months — to knock out moderate Sens. Mark Pryor in Arkansas and Mary Landrieu in Louisiana, two politicians with familiar family names.

Pryor stands as the most vulnerable after Arkansas voters soundly rejected a Democratic incumbent in 2010, Sen. Blanche Lincoln, and the GOP got a top recruit, freshman Rep. Tom Cotton, a 36-year-old Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran. Pryor welcomed Cotton to the race with an ad criticizing his House votes against a sweeping farm bill, the Violence Against Women Act and a student loan bill.

""Being able to draw that clear contrast is something that didn't happen in 2010,"" Cecil said. ""Now we have a record.""

Landrieu faces three-term Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy, a physician from Baton Rouge, in a state that has become more Republican and changed demographically since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. But Republicans and Democrats describe Landrieu as tenacious and point to past races that she won comfortably. She has $4.9 million cash on hand.

In swing-voting North Carolina, Republicans probably will have a tough primary race before picking a nominee to run against Sen. Kay Hagan. Thom Tillis, speaker of the North Carolina House, has announced, and state Senate leader Phil Berger may run.

GEORGIA ON MY MIND

Republicans nervously watch the Georgia primary free-for-all, which includes no less than three House members vying for the open Senate seat.

Conservative Rep. Paul Broun has said evolution and the Big Bang theory are ""lies straight from the pit of Hell."" Rep. Phil Gingrey, an OB-GYN since 1975, backtracked earlier this year after saying former Rep. Todd Akin was ""partly right"" when he said during his failed Senate race in Missouri last year that women's bodies can avoid pregnancy in cases of ""legitimate rape."" Rep. Jack Kingston, a conservative, has emerged as the moderate.

Other Republicans are expected to join the field.

Georgia rules set the primary for next June, but if no candidate gets 50 percent, a runoff occurs in early August, a late date that could leave the GOP with a roughed-up nominee.

Democrats recruited Michelle Nunn, daughter of former Sen. Sam Nunn and CEO of Points of Light, the volunteer organization founded by President George H.W. Bush.

Democrats hope the Nunn name still resonates in the state nearly 20 years after the senator retired. The challenge is clear: No non-incumbent Democrat has won a major statewide race in Georgia since Gov. Roy Barnes in 1998.

ON THE HORIZON

Republicans are awaiting word from 75-year-old Thad Cochran on whether the Mississippi senator will seek a seventh term in a state the GOP will have no problem holding.

Alaska, where Democratic Sen. Mark Begich is a top Republican target, could get another GOP candidate to join Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell and Joe Miller, the tea party favorite who won the 2010 GOP primary against Sen. Lisa Murkowski but then lost as she prevailed as a write-in. Alaska Department of Natural Resources Commissioner Dan Sullivan is expected to decide after he returns from a deployment in Afghanistan.

Among other potential GOP Senate challengers is Rep. Dave Camp, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, in Michigan. Republican Ken Buck, who lost to Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet in 2010, filed the necessary paperwork on Thursday for a run against Sen. Mark Udall.

(The Washington Post)

House Speaker John Boehner said Tuesday there were ""a lot of opinions about what direction to go"" on government shutdown negotiations after a meeting with House Republicans. (The Washington Post)

A campaign to persuade House Republicans to lift the federal debt limit collapsed in humiliating failure Tuesday, leaving Washington careering toward a critical deadline just two days away, with no clear plan for avoiding a government default.

Senate leaders quickly moved to pick up the pieces, saying they were “optimistic” that they could reach agreement to advance an alternative proposal that would raise the debt limit through Feb. 7 and end a government shutdown, now in its third week.

But it was unclear whether a deal struck by Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) could pass the Senate before the Treasury Department exhausts its borrowing power Thursday.

Meeting that deadline would be impossible if Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) or other conservative hard-liners chose to throw up roadblocks, Democrats said. Republican leaders were leaning on Cruz and his allies to avoid unnecessary delays.

“The clock is ticking,” said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the No. 3 Republican in the Senate. “Given the consequence of what we’re talking about here, . . . I would hope that we would have genuine interest among all parties in terms of trying to get this done as quickly as possible.”

View Graphic Finding common ground hasnt been easy for lawmakers during the Obama administration.

Any deal would also have to win approval in the House, where Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and his leadership team had once again lost all control of their majority. After a long day of trying with increasing desperation to cobble together a debt-limit plan that could win the support of 217 Republicans, Boehner and his top deputies gave up and abruptly canceled a scheduled vote on the measure.

(Related: Who controls the House GOP? No one.)

On Tuesday evening, they left the Capitol without further plan or explanation.

“We are done for the night,” a weary Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said as he left a marathon session in Boehner’s office that began as an airing of complaints from rebellious conservatives and soon ballooned into a full-blown emergency session of senior lawmakers and committee chairmen.

The chaos on Capitol Hill was already reverberating through the financial world. U.S. financial markets closed down slightly Tuesday, while Fitch Ratings, the third-largest credit-rating agency, took a step toward a potential downgrade of the government’s AAA rating. Fitch warned that “political brinksmanship and reduced financing flexibility” were elevating the risk of default.

Unless Congress acts by Thursday, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew will be left with just $30 billion in cash and a fluctuating flow of incoming tax revenue to pay the nation’s bills. While Lew is unlikely to begin missing payments immediately, independent analysts say he would run short of funds no later than Nov. 1.

Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) told reporters that aides to the two Senate leaders would work through the night to finalize details of the emerging Senate measure. “They had a basic agreement,” Durbin said of Reid and McConnell. “All pointing in the right direction.”

McConnell spokesman Don Stewart added in a statement: “Given tonight’s events, the Leaders have decided to work toward a solution that would reopen the government and prevent default. They are optimistic an agreement can be reached.”

In addition to lifting the $16.7 trillion debt limit, the emerging measure would fund the government through Jan. 15, delaying the next threat of a shutdown until after the holidays. It would set up a conference committee to hammer out broader budget issues, such as whether to replace deep cuts to agency budgets known as the sequester with other savings.

Republicans who shut down the government in a bid to undermine President Obama’s health-care program would win no major changes to the law. But they would get additional safeguards to ensure that people who receive subsidies to buy health insurance are in fact eligible.

Democrats dropped their demand to delay a new tax on existing health insurance plans, a change intended to benefit organized labor. And Republicans backed off their push to deny the Treasury Department flexibility to manage the nation’s books after Feb. 7, an aborted attempt to ensure that the short-term extension of the debt limit doesn’t somehow drag on into the spring.

Durbin, the Senate’s No. 2 Democrat and chief vote counter, predicted that the final package would easily pass the Senate with support from both parties.

“With McConnell’s name on it,” he said, “we feel it will get a good, strong vote.”

Its fate in the House, however, was uncertain. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has pledged the support of all 200 Democrats, meaning Boehner would have to supply almost two dozen votes.

Late Tuesday, Democrats — and some Senate Republicans — were urging Boehner to draft the emerging Senate deal into legislation and let the House vote as soon as Wednesday. Given a House-passed bill, Reid could move much more quickly to final passage in the Senate, sending a bill to Obama’s desk before the Thursday deadline if Cruz and his allies did not object.

House GOP officials said they had yet to decide how to proceed. Passing the Senate bill before the Senate had even taken a vote would amount to a complete capitulation to the upper chamber, the latest embarrassment in a speakership riddled with dark moments.

Ironically, the current debacle began with Boehner’s friends in the Senate — recognizing that McConnell was close to a deal with Reid — deciding to pause those talks to give Boehner a chance to consolidate his weakening hold on power.

If Boehner had been able to rally support for a measure more palatable to Republicans, it would have strengthened McConnell’s hand.

Boehner “would establish himself as the leader of the House, which is good for the country,” Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters as he left the Senate GOP’s weekly luncheon Tuesday afternoon. “This is offense for us,” Graham said optimistically. “This is a defining moment for the speaker.”

Graham, Saxby Chambliss (Ga.) and other GOP senators had pleaded with Boehner late last week to try to pass a bill that would give Senate Republicans leverage in their talks with Reid. On Monday, Boehner met with McConnell and several other Senate Republicans. And on Tuesday, Boehner was ready to go.

He started the day by convening a 9 a.m. meeting of his rank and file, a session that opened with a prayerful group sing-along to the hymn “Amazing Grace.” But as Boehner began searching for items to attach to the debt-limit bill, his majority quickly dis­integrated into squabbling ideological factions.

Boehner’s initial proposal was to include two provisions that would have given conservatives some small measure of satisfaction in exchange for ending the government shutdown and raising the debt limit. One would have delayed a tax on medical devices that helps finance the new health-care law. The other would have ended employer-provided health subsidies given to lawmakers and members of the executive branch, who are required to join the new health-care exchanges.

But conservatives quickly complained that it wasn’t enough. The bill would not cut spending, they said, or reform entitlement programs, or erase a clause in the health law that requires employers to provide coverage for contraception. And it clearly would not achieve their ultimate goal of ending the program they call Obamacare.

As the bickering continued, senior aides to rank-and-file Republicans resorted to watching the Twitter feeds of congressional reporters to learn who was demanding what.

By midafternoon, House leaders appeared to be rallying around a new measure. This one would not delay the medical-device tax, but it would add congressional staffers to the group of federal employees who would no longer receive any help from their employer to buy health insurance.

The proposal amounted to a $5,000 pay cut for those with individual coverage and a $10,000 cut for those with families. But conservatives theorized that Senate Democrats would have to approve it or risk looking as if they were protecting their own health benefits. And that would motivate them to reopen the health-care law, the theory went.

House leaders scheduled a vote for late Tuesday evening.

But in the end, that idea didn’t fly either. One by one, recalcitrant lawmakers were dragged to Boehner’s office. One by one, they emerged shaking their heads.

“I’ve got one vote and I’m a no,” Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), one of the most conservative House members, told waiting reporters.

Mainstream conservatives were also unhappy. After shutting the government down for 15 days, they would get nothing — not even the meager concessions McConnell and Reid had been discussing.

The final blow came shortly after 5 p.m., when Heritage Action for America, the powerful conservative group that drove Republicans to attack Obama’s health-care initiative, sent an e-mail urging lawmakers to vote no because the House bill “will do nothing to stop Obamacare’s massive new entitlements from taking root.”

Soon after, Boehner canceled the vote. An hour later, Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) issued an alert telling lawmakers that the House would be in session Wednesday. No specific legislation was listed for consideration.

As for the timing of any votes, Cantor advised: “TBD.”

That distinction goes, with some reluctance on my part, to Hillary Rodham Clinton. As has sometimes happened in her life, events got away from her.

A good politician, as Napoleon once said about military men, has to have luck — and this has not been a lucky year for Clinton. If she’s the next Democratic presidential candidate, she will have to follow a Democratic president whose approval ratings — once as high as 76 percent — are now scraping 40. As a former member of Barack Obama’s Cabinet, she has to defend the indefensible, kiss the ugly baby of Obamacare and smile for the cameras. She can do it — no one soldiers on better — but ugly is ugly, and the rollout of Obamacare has been just that.

Maybe time will prove Obamacare a success, which I suspect will be the case. But until that distant day, it will remain emblematic of governmental overreach and (supposedly arrogant) liberalism run amok. The catastrophic rollout has been followed by even more bad news — higher-than-expected premiums, lower-than-expected coverage or, worse, no coverage at all.

Things will get better, especially if more young people sign up, but the program has left an indelible impression of ineptitude and dishonesty. In short, it has become a vindication of everything conservatives say of liberal programs. Even liberals are wondering if the government can make such an extensive contraption work, and at a reasonable cost.

Of course, Hillary Clinton is not a conventional liberal — not nearly liberal enough for some people on the Democratic left. Among other things, her foreign policy — as much as it can be discerned — has been robust and muscular, not shying away from the use of force. That’s not terribly liberal, but it won’t matter in a general election. She will still be caricatured as the classic lefty, the architect of her own failed health-insurance program. That was a dreadnought of a bill (1,000 pages!) dubbed Hillarycare that was torpedoed by Republicans and even some Democrats and sank — but not quite without a trace. The GOP will refloat it for the next campaign, bringing those two frauds, Harry and Louise, back from retirement. By the time the malicious generalizers of the GOP are through, it will sound like one of Stalin’s five-year plans.

It remains to be seen if gender will play the role for Clinton that race did for Obama. Probably not. The prospect of a woman becoming president has an air of inevitability about it, rather than the gleeful surprise that accompanied Obama’s stunning rise. She, like him, would be a first — not to mention an about-time. But Obama was otherwise an unknown. It was easy to vote for him, hard to vote against him. He stood for all things good and opposed all things bad. (Who knew that, like a surgeon who can’t stand the sight of blood, Obama is phobic about politicians?)

Clinton, in contrast, is no ingenue. She has been around for a very long time. She’s been a senator from New York. She’s been secretary of state. What she has — and has in abundance — is experience and knowledge, plus a vast network of friends and associates, who could in a moment fill every available slot in the government. Clinton comes fully assembled, White House-ready. She has been her husband’s go-to person in times of crisis, and she possesses — even her critics would have to concede — a daunting intellect. The only politician I know who is smarter than her is also named Clinton.

Alas, in American politics, the good can be bad. Recent Democratic presidents, with the exception of the exceptional Obama, have come from statehouses — Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. They proclaimed themselves Washington outsiders and ran their campaigns down the middle of the road — Clinton even ran over Sister Souljah.

Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, is the quintessential Washington insider, a former secretary of state whose portfolio is devoid of a soaring triumph and whose name is attached not to some diplomatic doctrine but to a failed health-insurance plan. She might make a wonderful president, but she’s following a man who, by virtue of his failures, has made that harder. As in 2008, Barack Obama could wind up defeating her.

http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/hagel-defense-secretary-face-202509981--politics.html,,[],GOP senators hint Hagel’s in for tough confirmation fight,"Several Republican senators voiced their concerns on Sunday about President Obama's expected nomination of former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel for defense secretary over past statements the former Nebraska lawmaker made about Israel and gay rights--hinting Hagel's confirmation would not come without a fight.

On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham called Hagel an ""in your face"" choice by the president.

“Chuck Hagel, if confirmed to be the secretary of defense, would be the most antagonistic secretary of defense toward the state of Israel in our nation’s history,"" Graham said. “Not only has he said you should directly negotiate with Iran, sanctions won’t work, that Israel should directly negotiate with the Hamas organization, a terrorist group that lobs thousands of rockets into Israel. He also was one of 12 senators who refused to sign a letter to the European Union that Hezbollah should be designated as a terrorist organization.

""This is an in-your-face nomination by the president,"" Graham continued. ""And it looks like the second term of Barack Obama is going to be an in-your-face term.""

Hagel's nomination for the post is expected to be announced by the White House on Monday, according to Politico.

On ""Fox News Sunday,"" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said the reported choice of Hagel proves Obama was emboldened by his victory in November. ""This is a president who has drunk the tea,"" Cruz said. ""He's high on reelection right now.""

On ABC's ""This Week,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said he'd ""wait and see how the hearings go,"" and see ""whether Chuck's views square with the job he would be nominated to do.""

""Whoever's nominated for secretary of defense is going to have to have a full understanding of our close relationship with our Israeli allies, the Iranian threat and the importance of having a robust military,"" McConnell said. ""So whoever that is, I think, will be given a thorough vetting. And if Senator Hagel's nominated, he'll be subjected to the same kinds of review of his credentials as anyone else.

Story continues

McConnell added: ""He's certainly been outspoken in foreign policy and defense over the years. The question we will be answering, if he's the nominee, is 'Do his views make sense for that particular job?'""

In 2006, Hagel said that ""the Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people” in Washington, angering both its members and supporters.

In 1998, Hagel called U.S. Ambassador James C. Hormel “aggressively gay” after his appointment by President Bill Clinton. ""[American ambassadors] are representing our lifestyle, our values, our standards,"" Hagel said. ""And I think it is an inhibiting factor to be gay.""

Last month, Hagel apologized. “My comments 14 years ago in 1998 were insensitive,"" he said in a statement. ""They do not reflect my views or the totality of my public record, and I apologize to Ambassador Hormel and any LGBT Americans who may question my commitment to their civil rights.""

Last week on ""Meet The Press,"" President Obama dismissed concerns about Hagel's past.

""I know him. He is a patriot,"" the president said. ""He is somebody who has done extraordinary work both in the United States Senate, somebody who served this country with valor in Vietnam. And is somebody who’s currently serving on my intelligence advisory board and doing an outstanding job.""

""With respect to the [gay] comment,"" Obama added, ""he apologized for it. And I think it’s a testimony to what has been a positive change over the last decade in terms of people’s attitudes about gays and lesbians serving our country.”"

Are you running for governor?

""I am thinking about it,"" said Rauner, 57, a Republican who has spent decades working for school reform, has been an adviser to Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel and is a target of the Chicago Teachers Union and labor bosses.

""I'm doing some serious evaluation, meeting with people, getting ideas on how to do this. But I make decisions. And I'm going to decide soon.""

My translation? He's running.

He talked to me about bringing business back to Illinois, and jobs, and attacking the education mess and the pension debacle. He supports immigration reform, and he thinks Republicans should focus not on social issues but on shrinking government and fixing schools.

That sounds like a man running for governor. And he wouldn't have sat down for an interview with me and had his photo taken if he weren't close to it.

For weeks Rauner, the retired chairman of the private equity firm GTCR, has been meeting privately with Republican governors from Wisconsin's Scott Walker to Louisiana's Bobby Jindal to New Jersey's Chris Christie, as well as former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. He's been traveling across Illinois, speaking at Lincoln Day dinners and so on, and is putting a team together.

His twin passions are riding his Harley and bird hunting. He has two labs and a German wirehaired pointer. He wears an $18 wristwatch and drives a 10-year-old van. Like many people of real wealth, he's not flashy about it.

I had to ask him the Jesse Jackson Jr. question: You ever think about getting a $43,000 Rolex?

""Never,"" he said. ""I don't have a Rolls. I don't have a jet. That's not me.""

But he has millions to spend on his campaign. And that frightens other Republicans, and Democrats, too. Politicians like colleagues who can be leveraged.

There's something attractive about a candidate who can't be bought, especially in Illinois, where so many are for sale. But we've seen other wealthy candidates fail, in part because they were too defensive about their money.

Rauner isn't defensive about a thing, although he hasn't yet been scrubbed by investigative reporters, or dissected by opposition research teams on all his business dealings.

So he's already ordered up opposition research on himself, figuring that others will do it, whether it's Gov. Pat Quinn or Attorney General Lisa Madigan or Bill Daley among the Democrats, or state Treasurer Dan Rutherford or state Sen. Kirk Dillard among possible Republican candidates.

""I know that's coming in politics,"" he said. ""We've built more than 200 businesses, and it will all be scrutinized. Who was fired? What about contracts? I understand that. That's politics.""

Rauner's relationship with the Rahmfather will also be an issue. Rauner's firm worked with Emanuel on several business deals after Emanuel left the Clinton White House and became an investment banker in the 1990s.

""He came to me once for a job. I didn't hire him. I thought his name was Ron. I said, 'How are you doing, Ron?' And he said, 'It's Rahm, it's Rahm.'""

Though he's advised Emanuel, he's criticized him as well, and loudly, for getting rolled by the CTU in last year's teachers strike.

What's fascinating about Rauner is his independence. And an unapologetic candidate with his kind of wealth — he wouldn't say if he's worth more than a billion — threatens the political order.

""I think I'm going to be very dangerous to the people in Springfield,"" he said. ""I think they're going to be scared. They should be. Because I can't be bribed, influenced, intimidated, threatened. I just want the state fixed and I just want to do the right thing for the taxpayers. You're right, I've done well in business. I'm very proud of it. I've got the resources to do whatever it takes to win, and to do what it takes to help fix the state. ... And the powers down there that like the status quo, they should be very scared.""

The criticism of Rauner is that he's used to getting things done his way. That bull-in-a-china-shop mindset could hurt him in a campaign.

""I think it's a blessing and a curse,"" he said. ""I have my strong views and opinions. I really want to transform Illinois government because this state is failing the taxpayers and the children. It's going to take steel backbone to get it done. Because I don't care about a political career. I certainly don't need a job. Getting re-elected is not on my top 10 list. I'll be willing to do things that politicians won't do. Because I don't care who I upset.""

Republican consultants circle him, and the common wisdom is that they view him like a side of beef, eager to carve him up for dinner.

""These political consultants love business guys who've never been in politics to try and take advantage of them. I get that. What I'm going to do is try and study from the smartest governors. I'm a pretty disciplined investor and pretty disciplined buyer. I do my due diligence. I do my homework. I don't waste money.""

He has a great upside. He's direct and uncompromising. Illinois voters might be seeking such a candidate to fix their broken state.

But business is business and politics is politics. And Bruce Rauner is about to learn the difference."

What caught our eye today in politics

Sarah Palin has done it again. She has the Republican establishment scratching its head and asking ‘is she serious’?

Palin told Sean Hannity’s radio show Tuesday that she is indeed considering a run for Senate in Alaska. “I've considered it because people have requested me considering it, but I'm still waiting to see, you know, what the lineup will be and hoping that, there again - there will be some new blood, new energy - not just kind of picking from the same old politicians in the state that come from political families,” Palin said. “Sen. Mark Begich has got to be replaced.”

Mark Begich is the Democratic incumbent senator who is in a fight to hold onto the seat he won in 2008.

We reached out to Jennifer Duffy, who is the Senior Editor of the Cook Political Report, where she is in charge of ranking the U.S. Senate races.

Gut Check: What do you think of Sarah Palin considering a run for Senate in Alaska?

Duffy: I think it’s nuts. Let’s look at the polling; she was fairly unpopular among Alaska voters and she hasn’t spent that much time in Alaska lately.

Gut Check: She does have money and name ID.

Duffy: There are good candidates in this race already. This is one of Republican Party’s best opportunities to pick up a seat, but this is problematic for the GOP.

Gut Check: Isn’t it better for her then?

Duffy: Yes, because she tends to run outside the party. The worst thing she could do is run as an independent. The great irony for her is that she said there was a need for new blood and new faces, because she isn’t one.

Gut Check: You have the race ranked as a LEAN Democrat. (LINK) If Palin gets into this race for real, would it change your rating for the race?

http://cookpolitical.com/senate/charts/race-ratings

Duffy: There would be no change to the race rating unless she wins the nomination. There would be money - just not a lot from Alaska…Look, Democrats want this to happen; this is their dream for one of their most vulnerable incumbents; they will be her first contribution: ‘How can we help?’

Gut Check: Is it a bluff?

Duffy: With Sarah Palin you never know; this puts her back where she likes to be, in the media spotlight. It’s a 50-50 proposition.

Gut Check: Can you imagine a Senate with Sarah Palin?

Duffy: She’d make Ted Cruz look establishment.

TRIVIA ANSWER from @DanMericaCNN

When William Jennings Bryan heard of Tennessee's Scopes trial, a case that pinned believers in creationism and believers in evolution against each other, the three-time Democratic presidential candidate and outspoken evangelical helped argue in favor of creationism.

John Thomas Scopes, a young Tennessee teacher, was accused of teaching his class about evolution - an action that broke Tennessee's Butler Act, which made teaching evolution in any public school illegal. He – along with the help of the ACLU – challenged the law and the Scopes trial began on this day in 1925.

Bryan had long been a supporter of the Butler Act. After it was signed into law, he praised the bill, stating ""the Christian parents of the state owe you a debt of gratitude for saving their children from the poisonous influence of an unproven hypothesis.""

The trial drew hordes of media attention to the small town of Dayton, Tennessee.

After eight days of testimony, a jury found Scopes guilty and forced him to pay a $100 fine. Although the defense appealed the case to the Tennessee Supreme Court, the high court upheld the statute that forbade the teaching of evolution.

Decades later, though, in the case Epperson v. Arkansas, the United States Supreme Court ruled that laws like the Butler Act violated the Establishment Clause, making them unconstitutional.

A little over 20 million people watched President Obama's second inauguration on television, Nielsen reported Wednesday afternoon.

The ratings agency counted up the viewers across 18 different networks. It said that 20.552 million people watched coverage airing from 10 AM to 4:30 PM on Monday. (CNN was the top-rated cable news network, and NBC the top-rated broadcast network.)

The numbers were a steep drop from Obama's first inauguration, which drew 37 million viewers, and was the second-lowest rating for an inauguration since 1969, as the New York Times' Bill Carter noted.

This is not surprising: TV viewership is down for all programs, not just inaugurations, and second inaugurations are rarely as popular as first ones.

Obama did manage to easily beat George W. Bush, his immediate predecessor, who drew just 15.5 million viewers for his second inauguration. He was well behind the highest-rated second inaugural -- Richard Nixon's in 1973. That speech was watched by over 32 million."

John Morse Early Voting,"The early voting in one of the two recall elections in Colorado is not looking very favorable for the incumbent. Senate

President John Morse is in danger of getting thrown out for

his support for strict gun control laws passed in the 2013 session.

Early voting began Thursday, continued through Friday and Saturday and will resume Monday. The election is on Tuesday.

The recall initiative was launched by gun rights activists against the Colorado Springs Democrat John Morse and Sen. Angela Giron of Pueblo because of their votes for the gun laws that include limiting the size of ammunition magazines and requiring universal background checks.

The Denver Post reports that Republicans are dominating in the early voting in Morse’s district and Democrats will have a lot of votes to make up if they want to keep Morse in office.

The vote totals so far from the El Paso County clerk and recorder show that although Republicans only comprise 26 percent of Morse’s Senate District 11, they account for 41 percent of the early voting.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)

With 2013 just over two hours old, the Senate voted 89-8 on Tuesday to approve a last-minute deal to avert income tax hikes on all but the richest Americans and stall painful spending cuts as part of a hard-fought compromise to avoid the economically toxic “fiscal cliff.”

The country had already technically tumbled over the cliff by the time the gavel came down on the vote at 2:07 a.m.. The House of Representatives was not due to return to work to take up the measure until midday on Tuesday. But with financial markets closed for New Year's Day, quick action by lawmakers would likely limit the economic damage.

The lopsided margin belied anxiety on both sides about the deal, which emerged from barely two days of talks between Vice President Joe Biden and Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Among the “no” votes: Republican Senator Marco Rubio, widely thought to have his eye on the 2016 presidential race.

In remarks just before the vote, McConnell repeatedly called the agreement “imperfect” but said it beat allowing income tax rates rise across the board.

“I know I can speak for my entire conference when I say we don’t think taxes should be going up on anyone, but we all knew that if we did nothing they’d be going up on everyone today,” he said. “We weren’t going to let that happen.”

“Our most important priority was to protect middle-class families. This legislation does that,” Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said. But Reid cautioned that “passing this agreement does not mean negotiations halt. Far from it.”

Compromises on tax rates

Under the compromise arrangement, taxes would rise on income above $400,000 for individuals and $450,000 for households, while exemptions and deductions the wealthiest Americans use to reduce their tax bill would face new limits. The accord would also raise the taxes paid on large inheritances from 35% to 40% for estates over $5 million. And it would extend by one year unemployment benefits for some two million Americans. It would also prevent cuts in payments to doctors who treat Medicare patients and spare tens of millions of Americans who otherwise would have been hit with the Alternative Minimum Tax.



Story continues

The middle class will still see its taxes go up: The final deal did not include an extension of the payroll tax holiday. And the overall package will deepen the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars by extending the overwhelming majority of the Bush tax cuts. Many Democrats had opposed those measures in 2001 and 2003. Obama agreed to extend them in 2010.

Efforts to modify the first installment of $1.2 trillion in cuts to domestic and defense programs over 10 years -- the other portion of the “fiscal cliff,” known as sequestration -- had proved a sticking point late in the game. Democrats had sought a year-long freeze but ultimately caved to Republican pressure and signed on to just a two-month delay while broader deficit-reduction talks continue.

Debt-limit battle looms

That would put the next major battle over spending cuts right around the time that the White House and its Republican foes are battling it out over whether to raise the country's debt limit. Republicans have vowed to push for more spending cuts, equivalent to the amount of new borrowing. Obama has vowed not to negotiate as he did in 2011, when a bruising fight threatened the first-ever default on America's obligations and resulted in the first-ever downgrade of the country's credit rating. Biden sent that message to Democrats in Congress, two senators said.

Experts had warned that the fiscal cliff's tax increases and spending cuts, taken together, could plunge the still-fragile economy into a new recession.

Biden, evidently in good spirits after playing a central role in crafting the deal, said little on his way into or out of a roughly one hour and 45 minute meeting behind closed doors with Senate Democrats. ""Happy New Year,"" he said on the way in. Asked on the way out what his chief selling point had been, the vice president reportedly replied: ""Me.""

Biden's intervention; hurdles in the House

Hours earlier, a Democratic Senate aide told Yahoo News that ""the White House and Republicans have a deal,"" while a source familiar with the negotiations said President Barack Obama had discussed the compromise with Reid and Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and ""they both signed off.""

But the House’s Republican leaders, including Speaker John Boehner, hinted in an unusual joint statement that they might amend anything that clears the Senate – a step that could kill the deal.

“Decisions about whether the House will seek to accept or promptly amend the measure will not be made until House members -- and the American people -- have been able to review the legislation,” they said.



Biden, a 36-year Senate veteran, worked out the agreement with McConnell after talks between Obama and Boehner collapsed and a similar effort between McConnell and Reid followed suit shortly thereafter. With the deal mostly done, Obama made a final push at the White House.

“Today, it appears that an agreement to prevent this New Year's tax hike is within sight, but it's not done,” Obama said in hastily announced midday remarks at the White House. “There are still issues left to resolve, but we're hopeful that Congress can get it done – but it’s not done.”

""One thing we can count on with respect to this Congress is that if there is even one second left before you have to do what you’re supposed to do, they will use that last second,"" he said.

Obama’s remarks – by turns scolding, triumphant, and mocking of Congress – came after talks between McConnell and Biden appeared to seal the breakthrough deal.

“I can report that we’ve reached an agreement on all of the tax issues,” McConnell said on the Senate floor moments later. “We are very, very close to an agreement.”

The Kentucky Republican later briefed Republicans on the details of the deal. Lawmakers emerged from that closed-door session offered hopeful appraisals that, after clearing a few last-minute hurdles, they could vote on New Year’s Eve or with 2013 just hours old.

“Tonight, I hope,” Republican Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee told reporters. “It may be at 1, 2, 3, 4 in the morning. Oh, I guess that’s technically tomorrow.”

Reckoning with the 'sequester'

Republican Senators said negotiators were still working on a way to forestall two months of the “sequester” spending cuts, about $20 billion worth. And some expressed disquiet that the tentative compromise ran high on tax increases and low on spending cuts -- while warning that failure to act, triggering some $600 billion in income tax increases on all Americans who pay it and draconian spending cuts, was the worse option.

McConnell earlier had called for a vote on the tax component of the deal.

“Let me be clear: We’ll continue to work on finding smarter ways to cut spending, but let’s not let that hold up protecting Americans from the tax hike,” McConnell urged. “Let’s pass the tax relief portion now. Let’s take what’s been agreed to and get moving.”



House passage was not a sure thing: Both the AFL-CIO labor union and the conservative Heritage Action organization argued against the package.

The breakthrough came after McConnell announced Sunday that he had started to negotiate with Biden in a bid to ""jump-start"" stalled talks to avoid the fiscal cliff.

Under their tentative deal, the top tax rate on household income above $450,000 would rise from 35 percent to 39.6 percent -- where it was under Bill Clinton, before the reductions enacted under George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003.

Some congressional liberals had expressed objections to extending tax cuts above the $250,000 income threshold Obama cited throughout the 2012 campaign. Democrats were huddling in private as well to work out whether they could support the arrangement.

Obama responds to critics

Possibly with balking progressives in mind, Obama trumpeted victories dear to the left of his party. ""The potential agreement that’s being talked about would not only make sure the taxes don’t go up on middle-class families, it also would extend tax credits for families with children. It would extend our tuition tax credit that’s helped millions of families pay for college. It would extend tax credits for clean energy companies that are creating jobs and reducing our dependence on foreign oil. It would extend unemployment insurance to 2 million Americans who are out there still actively looking for a job.""

Obama said he had hoped for ""a larger agreement, a bigger deal, a grand bargain,"" to stem the tide of red ink swamping the country’s finances – but shelved that goal.

""With this Congress, that was obviously a little too much to hope for at this time,"" he said. ""It may be we can do it in stages. We’re going to solve this problem instead in several steps.""

The president also looked ahead to his next budgetary battle with Republicans, warning that “any future deficit agreement” will have to couple spending cuts with tax increases. He expressed a willingness to reduce spending on popular programs like Medicare, but said entitlement reform would have to go hand in hand with new tax revenues.

“If Republicans think that I will finish the job of deficit reduction through spending cuts alone … then they’ve another thing coming,” Obama said defiantly. “That’s not how it’s going to work.”

“If we’re serious about deficit reduction and debt reduction, then it’s going to have to be a matter of shared sacrifice. At least as long as I’m president. And I’m going to be president for the next four years, I hope,” he said.

The other “no” votes were: Michael Bennet (D-Col.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Rand Paul (R-Ken.), and Richard Shelby (R-Ala.). Republicans Jim DeMint of South Carolina and Mark Kirk of Illinois as well as Democrat Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey did not vote.

Ashley Judd hasn't uttered a public peep about running for the Senate in Kentucky, but she is already starring in two political ads put up by her potential opponents that mock the idea of the Democratic actress unseating longtime Republican Mitch McConnell, the Senate Minority Leader.

A highlight reel of celebrities in politics shows Republicans may have reason to be nervous rather than amused. Actors do pretty well when they decide to go out on the stump.

Former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Minnesota Sen. Al Franken and California Rep. Sonny Bono didn't exactly play Abraham Lincoln onscreen, but they got elected regardless. So did TV stars Fred Grandy of TheLove Boat and Ben Jones of Dukes of Hazzard, who both served in Congress. President Reagan needs no mention. It's harder to think of actors who've lost — like Nancy Kulp, who starred in the Beverly Hillbillies but lost a bid for Congress in central Pennsylvania in 1984.

Actors and athletes who have run and won say Judd's celebrity has a political payoff: She'll have no problem with name recognition, she'll be able to raise a lot of money, and voters won't suspect her of going into politics for personal gain. Then again, as Judd already knows, actor-candidates likely have a video trail that can be sliced and diced for attack ads. And their well-established persona may be at odds with what voters want.

""The advantage of being well-known was that when I started to run, it meant that very few people hated me, even if they couldn't support me,"" says Bill Bradley, who became a basketball star on the 1964 gold medal Olympic team and played 10 years with the New York Knicks before he ran for the Senate from New Jersey in 1978. ""If I was going somewhere to speak, 100 people would show up as opposed to 25. Which only means that it gave me a chance to succeed or fail to four times as many people.""

Money and the megaphone of fame can help overcome a bad image or a perceived lack of gravitas from years playing a goofy cruise ship purser named Gopher.

Grandy was still acting in The Love Boat when he started running in Iowa's 1986 congressional election, reading the Farm Bureau Spokesman newspaper in his trailer on the set.

Winning required closing ""the Gopher gap"" with voters, he says. While his celebrity ""pulled people into the tent, what got them to vote for me was 18 months of absolutely grinding retail politics, (going) to every bean feed and pork princess festival and nut fry that would have me.""

In California, opinion surveys initially showed that voters saw action star Schwarzenegger as ""a thug in a leather jacket,"" says George Gorton, a political consultant who worked on Schwarzenegger's campaign for governor in 2003. ""Even though (they thought) he was a likable thug, we had to undertake a pretty massive effort to change that image. ... (Voters) loved Arnold, but they just weren't going to vote for him for the longest time.""

The good, the bad, the ugly

Celebrities and athletes have to clear a ""take-me-seriously threshold,"" says Darrell West of the Brookings Institution, co-author of the 2002 book Celebrity Politics. ""But it's not that high. Voters don't know that much about public policy — so you have to be conversant with the major policy issues, but you don't have to be a brain surgeon to persuade voters that you're a serious candidate.""

Schwarzenegger, a Republican, was the lead campaigner for Proposition 49, a successful 2002 ballot measure which funded after-school programs. As such, he gained support from crucial groups in law enforcement and education and developed a public policy profile before he entered the recall election for governor against Gray Davis the following year.

Franken, the former Saturday Night Live cast member, had to overcome not just his self-absorbed characters on Saturday Night Live, but a salacious 2000 Playboy article called ""Porn-O-Rama"" that his campaign said was satire. Franken squeaked into office after a seven-month recount process.

Sometimes it takes more than one election to clear the bar. Singer and comedian Sonny Bono ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in 1992 before he won a seat in Congress two years later. For Bono, his celebrity was a mixed blessing — by the time he ran for office he had spent years being the butt of jokes by his then-wife, Cher, on their TV show.

His widow, former congresswoman Mary Bono Mack, who won his congressional seat after his death in 1998, says that had an impact at the start of his political career. ""Sonny being in comedy or the straight man was harder than had he played Moses parting the Red Sea,"" she says.

Judd, however, ""is always playing great strong female characters,"" Bono Mack says. ""She's schooled herself on what she's going to be in for and is known for being very bright — and I think Sen. McConnell could have a fight on his hands.""

Judd's past comments — opposing certain types of coal mining, in favor of starting a family through adoption rather than procreation, and critical of the patriarchal aspects of Christianity — have already been unearthed and criticized by conservative online media. There will likely be comments about Double Jeopardy, her 1999 hit film, Tooth Fairy, a 2010 box office success, or Missing, the now-canceled TV show for which she was nominated for an Emmy in 2012. Judd is also part of a famous family — mother Naomi and sister Wynonna are legendary country music performers.

Bono Mack points out that because of the Internet it's not only actors who have a searchable history. ""In the era of super PACs, whether you said something foolish as a celebrity or something foolish as the guy next door, it will be exposed,"" she says. ""And it can backfire, as we all know. You can hit that funny bone that constituents have of sympathy if you play it. More so if they like the (actor's) character to begin with.""

A Bluegrass battle looms

Kentucky has already elected a crossover politician: Republican Sen. Jim Bunning, the Hall of Fame pitcher, retired in 2010 after 14 years in Congress. On the other hand, Nick Clooney, father of movie star George and brother of singer Rosemary, failed in a 2004 race for Congress that his opponent, Geoff Davis, called ""Hollywood vs. the heartland.""

Judd has not made a decision on whether to run or even decided when she will make a decision, her spokeswoman Cara Tripicchio says. On Friday, Judd avoided the question when she spoke on public health at George Washington University in Washington. But she has been consulting state and national Democratic leaders in private.

Judd, who announced in December she is divorcing race car driver Dario Franchitti, was raised in Kentucky but lives in Nashville — though she continues to be a high-profile sports fan of the University of Kentucky, her alma mater. (A 1998 calendar photo of Judd in a UK hockey jersey and little else would probably pop up during a campaign, too.) She has met with prominent state Democrats to discuss the race, and is seeking to talk to more: the speaker of the Kentucky House said last week that Judd had called him for a meeting.

One of her biggest boosters is the state's sole Democratic congressman, John Yarmuth. ""She will get millions and millions of dollars' worth of earned media. She will be able to draw a crowd wherever she goes,"" Yarmuth says. ""She has the ability to galvanize most of the energy that is out there to unseat McConnell, and there is a lot of it.""

But McConnell's opponent will need to be a good fundraiser, as former Pittsburgh Steelers star Lynn Swann learned when he went up against an incumbent in the 2006 Pennsylvania governor's race. Swann got out-raised $10 million to $30 million and walloped at the polls, by Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell.

McConnell already has more than $7 million on hand, and American Crossroads, the Karl Rove-founded PAC that ran an online ad against Judd, appears willing to spend money on his behalf as well. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has also targeted the race.

""My expectation is Kentucky per capita will probably be the top state as far as spending by super PACs on both sides,"" says state Democratic chairman Dan Logsdon.

The end of 'celebrity'

Those who've been there say that if Judd makes it to Capitol Hill, she'll be in demand as a fundraiser again — this time for colleagues. Franken, for instance, has raised more than $32 million since 2008; through his Midwest Values PAC, he gave $1.6 million to other Democrats in the 2012 election.

Grandy, in the pre-PAC era, appeared at candidate fundraisers ""almost every weekend for the first couple of terms that I was a member,"" he says. ""And to be perfectly honest with you, I had an ulterior motive in mind, which was to get on the Ways and Means Committee."" He succeeded.

Otherwise, celebrities have made sure to keep their heads down both with the public — Franken stays out of the media except for Minnesota news organizations — and their colleagues.

""Being a freshman is a great equalizer,"" Bono Mack says.

Bradley says he waited five months before making a speech on the Senate floor. ""I made sure I didn't talk about basketball for the first three years,"" he says. ""(If) somebody asked me a question, I answered it. I wasn't reminiscing about the old days, even though I knew people were interested. I waited for them to initiate it.""

Winning an election is the beginning of the end for stardom. After the first success, you're a politician, not a celebrity. Bradley's presidential campaign did not last beyond the early primaries. Grandy lost a governor's race. Tom Osborne, the winningest football coach in University of Nebraska history, easily won election to Congress in 2000. But six years later, he lost a GOP primary challenge to incumbent Gov. Dave Heineman after Osborne said he would support a bill offering in-state tuition to illegal immigrants.

""There's a certain honeymoon period,"" Osborne says now. ""But at some point they really want to know what you can do, what you know, and what you can deliver.""

http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/07/02/first-on-cnn-perry-to-announce-political-future-on-monday/,2013-07-02 00:00:00,"['Tampa Tim', 'Rudy Nyc', 'The', 'Compassionate', 'Gop Solution', 'Posted By']",First on CNN: Perry to announce political future on Monday,"8 years ago

Washington (CNN) - Rick Perry is inviting close friends and supporters to an event next Monday in San Antonio where he is expected to announce if he plans to seek an unprecedented fourth full term as Texas governor, CNN has learned.

Perry ""will be making an announcement around mid-day in San Antonio concerning his exciting future plans,"" according to a ""Save the Date"" email obtained Tuesday by CNN. The announcement comes as Perry finds himself at the center of a high-profile legislative fight over abortion rights in his state.



""Please join his family and closest friends on July 8th,"" reads the email, which is being circulated to his political allies. ""Details to follow.""

Perry has long said he will make a decision about his political future after the conclusion of this year's legislative session, but because Democrats blocked the abortion measure with an attention-grabbing filibuster by state Sen. Wendy Davis last week, the governor was forced to call another session to tackle that issue and others.

Originally, Perry was supposed to announce his 2014 plans this week.

Most Texas political insiders don't expect Perry, who has held the state's top office since 2000, to run again, though many say he is considering another presidential run after his ill-fated 2012 effort.

As of the last financial reporting period, Perry, one of the Republican Party's top fundraisers, had just $6 million in his campaign war chest. The next Republican in line for the governorship, state Attorney General Greg Abbott, had $18 million.

But people close to Perry have also been reminding reporters in recent weeks that he has a knack for changing his mind.

""I don't think anyone knows what he is going to do until he gets up there and says it,"" Ray Sullivan, Perry's former chief-of-staff, when asked about next week's event.

Before seeking a third term in 2010, Perry said he was not going to run again before changing his mind and trouncing Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison in a titanic Republican primary fight. Perry said no to a presidential run for many months, before ultimately jumping into the race in August 2011.

Then, after saying he would suspend his campaign following a disappointing finish in the 2012 Iowa caucuses, Perry suddenly tweeted that he would continue on in South Carolina, which surprised many of his staffers.

Perry-watchers got a clue that he might be nearing an announcement about his latest plans earlier Tuesday, when a Texas radio host interviewing Perry about the special session said ""we get a few more weeks before we start badgering you about your future plans.""

Perry responded, ""Yeah, or less even, we may let you know a little bit before that."""

""Well, the same thing is true of the black population,” Cruz said.

Cruz also suggested how blacks and Hispanics should vote. “As a matter of fact, if we could communicate the truth, not only to the Hispanics but to the black population, all blacks should be Republican,"" he said.

“Highly religious, strongly pro-family, strongly pro-life” values and high military enrollment rates align Hispanics’ principles with the Republican Party’s, said Cruz.

Exit polls from the 2012 election, however, indicated that a majority of Latino voters, 59 percent, supported same-sex marriage, while an even larger majority, 66 percent, supported abortion rights. Fifty-two percent of black voters supported same-sex marriage, the polls showed.

Cruz has made headlines lately with similarly controversial comments. At an event sponsored by the gun rights advocacy group OK2A and the anti-government Tulsa 9.12 Project in November, Cruz claimed that God ordains capital punishment.

“You know, the Bible is so clear,"" he said. ""Go to Genesis Chapter 9 and you will find the death penalty clearly stated in Genesis Chapter 9 ... God ordains the death penalty!”

Cruz also argued that the legalization of same-sex marriage would lead to an unjustified outpouring of hate-speech accusations. “You preach Romans Chapter 1 in your church, you’re going to be called before a court for hate speech,” Cruz said.

In his February speech, Cruz promoted the abolishment of political correctness. “We have been guilty of following two things that we totally have to throw aside. Number one is political correctness,” Cruz said. “We have been destroyed by political correctness. And we must learn to tell the truth unequivocally.”

The 74-year-old tea party icon also attributed “all the civil rights” that African-Americans have achieved to Republicans.

“Let’s talk about the black population. All the civil rights that the African Americans have obtained have come from Republicans,” Cruz said. “But you know what, Democrats took the credit.”"

Chen'],"Assailing Bloomberg, Liu Enters Race to Replace Him","Mr. Liu joins other major Democrats who have officially entered the race. A week earlier, Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, who has been leading comfortably in early polls, announced her candidacy through Twitter and a video, then visited all five boroughs for a “walk and talk” tour. A month ago, Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, made his announcement outside his row house in Park Slope, Brooklyn, to emphasize his outer-borough appeal. William C. Thompson Jr., who lost a close race to Mr. Bloomberg in 2009, said in 2010 that he would run again.

Mr. Liu’s kickoff was far more raucous and chaotic, with the City Hall announcement as a microcosm. There were so many people trying to squeeze onto the City Hall steps that aides to Mr. Liu asked supporters to move aside, saying Mr. Liu, his wife and their son would be unable to pass through. Then Mr. Liu delivered his remarks twice — once for the people at City Hall, and then for several dozen more at City Hall Park who could not get closer. And finally, he held an unscheduled news conference, before answering even more questions, on his way to his next event, from reporters with Mexican and Chinese television stations.

Virtually every question was about the federal investigation into his fund-raising. On April 15, two associates, including his former treasurer, are scheduled to stand trial on fraud charges. And though Mr. Liu, 46, has not been accused of wrongdoing, court documents have left little doubt that prosecutors have questioned his conduct.

On Sunday, Mr. Liu maintained his defiant posture, saying, “People have said there’s a witch hunt; the problem is, there’s no witch.”

Asked if he was concerned about his fund-raising, which has lagged, Mr. Liu said: “What are you guys talking about? You guys don’t understand campaign financing at all, do you?”

Earlier in the day, at the Staten Island St. Patrick’s Day parade, Mr. Liu was speed-walking down the sidewalk and passed Mr. Bloomberg, who was walking in the street.

Selassie Samuel, 27, saw Mr. Liu coming with his small retinue of photographers, reporters and staff members. He turned, smiled and asked to have his picture taken with Mr. Liu. Afterward, Mr. Samuel asked a reporter, “Who was that?”"

Pelosi says she hopes to raise profile of women in business%2C politics

She launched women-based agenda this summer

ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- Nancy Pelosi said Saturday she hopes the legacy of women in Congress will be to raise the profile of women in every aspect of business and politics.

Pelosi, a former speaker of the House of Representatives and currently the House minority leader, was one of nine inductees into the National Women's Hall of Fame on Saturday in Seneca Falls, N.Y.

Pelosi said before the ceremony that she was proud to stand with the others being honored, including the late former first lady Betty Ford; Julie Krone, the leading female thoroughbred jockey of all time; Ina May Gaskin, known as the mother of midwifery; activist, writer and filmmaker Kate Millett; and Bernice Resnick Sandler, one of the biggest forces behind Title IX.

On July 19, the 165th anniversary of the Seneca Falls Convention for women's rights, Pelosi launched a women-based agenda calling for more equal pay, more health care coverage for all families, affordable child care, paid family leave and more opportunity. She said Saturday she has been traveling to support the cause.

""We think that will unleash the power of women,"" Pelosi said.

Pelosi, a Democrat from California, declined to speak extensively about the current partial federal government shutdown other than to say: ""Every day's a new day. I'm always hopeful that a solution will be found."""

[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']



(CNN) - It's one of the country's hallmark political slugfests. And on Saturday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was dealt a large portion of the blows.

At Kentucky's annual Fancy Farm picnic, politicians from the state gather at the event hosted by St. Jerome's Catholic Church in Graves County, tucked away in the southwest corner of the Blue Grass State.



Elected leaders and candidates give short speeches before a crowd of hecklers and supporters. Audience members can shout, jeer, boo and taunt as loud as they want. Only ground rules? No profanity, sexist or racist comments. Oh, and no artificial noisemakers.

""This isn't the World Cup,"" the moderator said Saturday before introducing the speakers. The event was recorded by CNN affiliate KET.

From the outside, it can be seen as a daunting task: Try to get your voice heard in a roomful of people who either admire you or want to see you crash and burn, with both sides trying to drown out the other.

But the candidates for next year's U.S. Senate seat in Kentucky seemed to embrace the tradition, especially McConnell's opponents from both the left and right, who delivered slam after slam to the five-term incumbent.

McConnell vs. Grimes: Let's get ready to rumble

For his part, the senator was up first but hardly acknowledged the presence of his Democratic foe, Alison Lundergan Grimes. Instead, his most stinging remark was directed at her father, a top Democratic figure in Kentucky who has deep ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton.

""I want to say how nice it is to see Jerry Lundergan back in the game,"" McConnell said, before making a dig about Mr. Lundergan's financial contribution to Anthony Weiner's mayoral campaign in New York City.

A veteran of Fancy Farm, McConnell continued on and tried to speak above the raucous crowd, facing shouts of ""Go Grimes Go!""

His key message? This campaign will be between McConnell and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, not Grimes.

""We're not just choosing who's going to represent Kentucky in the Senate; we're going to decide who's going to run the Senate,"" he said.

If Republicans win control of the chamber next year, McConnell would become Senate majority leader.

""It's really quite simple,"" he added. ""Here's the choice: Obama's Nevada 'yes-man,' or a Kentuckian to run the Senate.""

McConnell backers–mostly wearing red shirts and holding signs that read ""Team Mitch""–gave thundering applause to the longtime incumbent. While he hasn't officially announced his re-election bid for 2014, he gave no indication he had any plans to sit this one out.

""We're going to have a great campaign. It's going to be a lot of fun,"" he said, exiting the stage.

McConnell stayed on stage when Grimes, the youngest female secretary of state in the country, took the podium in one of her first public speeches as the main Democratic challenger. The 34-year-old, whose grandmother sat next to her on stage, dove right in, delivering far more hard-hitting lines than McConnell.

""Let's just tell it like it is: If the doctor told Senator McConnell he had a kidney stone, he'd refuse to pass it,"" she said, getting a big response from the crowd.

Web wars start early in crucial 2014 Senate battle

Wearing a sleeveless red dress, Grimes looked confident and her delivery was polished, though clearly rehearsed, with a voice that seemed to carry beyond McConnell's in the boisterous environment.

With McConnell sitting just feet from her, she pulled no punches as she sought to paint the senator as the most despised lawmakers in the country. Her speech offered a preview of what will likely be sure attack lines in the coming months.

""There's a reason McConnell is disliked, not only by Kentucky but by the entire United States, and that's because there is a disease of dysfunction in Washington, D.C. And after 30 years, Senator McConnell is at the center of it,"" she said. ""As long as he remains in Washington, D.C., DC will stand for Dysfunctional Capital.""

McConnell sat still with his arms crossed, occasionally smiling.

Grimes seemed unfazed by the McConnell supporters shouting ""We want Mitch!"" and kept her eyes trained mostly on her supporters' side of the venue. Dropping the words ""gridlock"", ""obstruction"" and ""partisanship"" to describe McConnell and Washington Republicans, Grimes did not hold back in trying to define the minority leader.

The secretary of state, who was elected to office in 2011, also took time to poke fun at herself, making a joke about her lengthy name.

""Because it's such a long name, my grandmother and I decided we would do something about that,"" she said. ""With your help, Kentucky, come January 2015, you can call me senator.""

Matt Bevin, McConnell's GOP primary challenger, was also ready to pounce. But by the time Bevin took the stage, McConnell had already left the scene.

His absence clearly egged Bevin on. The candidate asked his family to come stand behind him at the podium since McConnell had left room on stage. Grimes, meanwhile, remained in place.

""Mitch McConnell has amazingly disappeared...maybe we can call him back,"" he said, as he started a chant: ""Where's Mitch? Where's Mitch?""

Bevin, a businessman with tea party ties, hit McConnell on immigration, jobs, and financial bailouts. On Obamacare, Bevin said McConnell should stop simply talking about the pitfalls of the health care law but stand side-by-side with conservative senators who want to defund it altogether.

Primary challenger to top Senate Republican lands conservative endorsement

""Be a man. Stand up. And put your money where your mouth is,"" Bevin said.

The candidate, who had launched his campaign the week prior, appeared remarkably comfortable at the podium for a first-time candidate.

Conservative challenger takes on top Senate Republican

Bevin supporters rang bells throughout the speech, a coordinated move that went along with his line: ""The bells toll for you, senator.""

""I don't intend to run to the right of Mitch McConnell. I don't intend to run to the left of Mitch McConnell,"" he said. ""I intend to run straight over the top of Mitch McConnell and right into the U.S. Senate."""

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/08/18/The-Clintons-Legacy-of-Lies,2013-08-18 00:00:00,['Joel B. Pollak'],The Clintons' Legacy of Lies,"It is difficult to explain to Americans, particularly young Americans, what was wrong with the Clinton era, and why we ought not want to re-live it. The 1990s are sealed into our national memory as a time of great prosperity and expectation–killed off, in Democrats’ rewriting of history, by the 2000 recount and all that followed.

The truth is that by 2000, Democrats could not run away from Clinton quickly enough. It’s worth revisiting why.

By 2000, President Bill Clinton had survived the scandal that led to his impeachment, but the dot-com bubble had burst and the country had plunged into recession.

(It never really recovered. A college friend and I recently observed that the career trajectories of our friends were deeply affected by whether they graduated in 1998, at the height of the boom, or 1999, just before the crash, and with little time to gain real work experience.)

The political right, frustrated by the perceived failure of the 1994 revolution, decided to adopt its own version of Clinton’s “third way” politics by embracing George W. Bush and his “compassionate conservatism.” But on the left, those who resented Clinton’s market-oriented, free-trade policies finally gained the upper hand, shutting down the Seattle World Trade Organization talks in 1999, inaugurating the anti-globalization movement.

Things were unraveling overseas, as well. The Oslo Peace Process, which Clinton had pushed, and which promised a “new Middle East,” collapsed, and a new wave of terror began.

Just days later, the U.S.S. Cole was attacked by Al Qaeda, the follow-up to the embassy bombings of two years before, and a sign that Clinton’s cruise-missile, light-footprint response to those attacks had encouraged rather than placated the enemy.

The party was over. And Americans were tired of it.

Culturally, for instance, it was a time of stagnation. The Clinton era was a time of classic-rock revival and derivative hip-hop, each mining the past for inspiration as major stars died out. Grunge and alternative rose and fell in an arc of self-loathing. Across the arts, nostalgia for more meaningful times–what Harvard critic Philip Fisher mocked as “nightmare envy”–was a dominant theme.

Beneath the surface of Clinton-era complacency also lay the roots of future crises. The president reauthorized the Community Reinvestment Act in 1999, for example, pushing big banks into subprime lending and setting the stage for the 2007-8 housing crisis.

At the same time, Clinton cronies like Jack Lew and Rahm Emanuel seized the opportunity of deregulation for self-enrichment at the country’s decrepit “too big to fail” banks.

It was Bill Clinton’s lies about his personal life that led to his impeachment; it was his manipulation and broken promises that led to public disenchantment. And that came at the worst possible time.

A newly-globalized world, under attack by the far-left, the Islamists, and thinly-disguised nationalists, needed an effective leader to guide it through turbulent times, to affirm the value of freedom despite the great risks involved.

But Clinton had undermined himself, and his collapse left no political successors. His “New Democrats,” who once sought to move the party beyond old labor alliances and leftist dogmas, withered and faded.

Worse, Clinton abandoned his own achievements. Later, when President Obama gutted welfare reform’s work requirements, Clinton refused to criticize him, collaborating in the death of his own legacy–all for the sake of 2016.

Democrats forget all of that now, and the “Clinton fatigue” of 1999-2000. But what they still remembered about the Clintons in 2008 was their dishonesty.

To moderates, that was a virtue: when Hillary mouthed the new left-wing rhetoric of her party, they knew she was saying what she thought would win primary voters.

But to others, it was a fatal flaw. They preferred Barack Obama’s apparent left-wing authenticity (though Bill Clinton warned it was a “fairy tale”).

Hillary Clinton has all of the fakery, and none of the charm, of her husband. From her comical pandering to the black community, to her cover-ups at the State Department, she has done little of substance to redeem her duplicity.

After Obama’s many failures, Americans may be content to embrace someone they never trusted anyway. But those lies do make a “difference,” and opponents ought to remind Americans of that, constantly."

A New Jersey Native', 'He Graduated Loyola University In Maryland.']",Reid sets stage for showdown over use of filibuster,"WASHINGTON – Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, claiming Republicans have engaged in unprecedented obstruction of presidential nominations, signaled Thursday that he would proceed with long-threatened changes to Senate rules to limit use of the filibuster.

In remarks on the Senate floor, the Nevada Democrat called it a “disturbing trend” that Republicans have blocked or delayed some of President Obama’s appointees even when their qualifications are not in doubt, bogging them down “with unreasonable demands.”

He cited an earlier filibuster of Chuck Hagel to be Defense secretary and continued delays in the confirmation of Obama’s picks to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Labor Department and Environmental Protection Agency, as well as appointments to the National Labor Relations Board. The obstruction, Reid said, “has continued at every level and through creative new methods.”

“They’re blocking qualified nominees because they refuse to accept the law of the land,” he said, adding that the American people “know the Senate hasn’t worked. And we need to do something to change that.”

Reid was convening a meeting of Senate Democrats to outline the strategy for implementing rules changes that would streamline the process for confirming executive appointments, and possibly most judicial nominations, by simple majority votes, limiting the use of the filibuster to legislation. The filibuster is part of the Senate rules and can be changed by a majority vote.

The Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, bitterly protested the threat to employ what he called the “nuclear option,” saying it would be “one of the most consequential changes to the United States Senate in the history of our nation.”

“This is no small matter,” he said. “And I guarantee you it’s a decision that if they actually go through with it they will live to regret.”

The Kentucky Republican said Reid was manufacturing a crisis to appease Democratic allies in labor and the party’s liberal base to replace the Senate mandate of “advise and consent” with “sit down and shut up.”

He noted that every Obama Cabinet choice brought to the Senate floor for a vote this year has been confirmed and maintained that it was Reid’s decision not to schedule votes on other nominations that is holding them up, not Republican obstruction.

Reid countered that he has no such power to unilaterally bring nominations to the floor, and that McConnell also proved his point – that some nominees who were eventually confirmed with overwhelming bipartisan majorities still had to wait more than a month to work through the confirmation process.

He even compared the situation to depriving the manager of Washington’s baseball team, the Nationals, with key players until long after the season had begun.

“We shouldn’t be waiting around here for months and months and months to get a vote,” he said.

Reid’s comments on the Senate floor to start Thursday’s session drew a number of Republicans to the chamber to protest. Some senators suggested that the full Senate convene in private – perhaps in the historic Old Senate Chamber – to have a fuller debate before acting. Reid said he might be open to such a discussion, but in the meantime would schedule votes on some of the controversial nominees.

(CNN) - Newark Mayor Cory Booker will move on to New Jersey's special Senate election as the Democratic nominee after winning his party's primary on Tuesday.

He'll battle the GOP winner, former Bogota mayor Steve Lonegan, for the October 16 contest, though polls show Booker is already considered the favorite to win the seat and become the first African American elected to the Senate since Barack Obama.



(Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina is currently the only African American in the Senate, but he was appointed–not elected–to his seat.)

""Thank you. It is such an honor to be your nominee, to be your Democratic nominee for the United States Senate,"" Booker, who won 59% of the vote, told supporters at his victory party late Tuesday night in Newark.

Speaking with a slightly hoarse voice, Booker pledged to be ""unwavering"" in finding common ground in Washington if he becomes the state's next senator.

""The direction I will be most concerned with will not be right or left, it will be with going forward.""

Heading into the special election, Booker has a massive fundraising advantage over his Republican opponent and a double-digit lead ahead of Lonegan, according to recent polls.

A rising star in his party, Booker handily beat out a crowded field of Democratic candidates for the nomination Tuesday–a group that included Rep. Frank Pallone, Rep. Rush Holt and General Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver.

Cory Booker joins Democratic rivals in Senate primary debate

In the Republican primary, Lonegan toppled physician Alieta Eck. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Monday at a press conference he fully anticipates endorsing the Republican nominee, no matter who wins Tuesday's contest.

While Lonegan now moves on as the GOP's pick for the seat, he trails Booker 29%-54% in a hypothetical matchup among registered voters, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released last week.

Lonegan won 79% of the vote in Tuesday's primary.

With more than 1.4 million followers on Twitter and Oprah Winfrey as one of his biggest supporters, Booker's appeal and frequent television appearances have reached beyond the borders of the Garden State.

In addition to voting, Booker on Tuesday greeted voters and retweeted shout-outs from celebrities on Twitter, including comedian Sarah Silverman, California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons, writer and actress Lena Dunham, and Ivanka Trump, daughter of real estate titan Donald Trump.

Actress Eva Longoria appeared at an event for Booker on the eve of primary day, encouraging voters to turn out for the two-term mayor.

Oprah to host fundraiser for Booker

Elected in 2006, after losing his first mayoral attempt in 2002, the Stanford grad and former football player previously served on Newark city council. Booker's resume also includes a law degree from Yale and a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford.

His critics have accused the mayor of being more interested in his celebrity status than waging a serious campaign. But Booker's high profile has helped in part with his massive fundraising haul. As of July 24, the candidate has raised $8.6 million and has $4 million in the bank, according to Federal Election Commission reports.

Newark mayor says he's not a hero after daring rescue of his neighbor

Rivals also bring up Booker's involvement in his internet start-up, Waywire. As the chairman with the largest share, Booker began promoting the struggling company last year. Critics argue the business was a distraction to his job as mayor, and they faulted him for initially opening up offices in New York City, rather than in his own town of Newark. Those offices closed down this year, according to The New York Times.

He has said publicly that if elected to the Senate, he would step down from the board of Waywire and put his shares in a blind trust. He would prohibit Waywire from lobbying his office and prohibit his staff from doing any work on the company's behalf.

""Everybody knows that Mayor Booker is excited about technology and what it can do to empower real people,"" campaign spokesman Kevin Griffis said in a statement. ""He invested in an idea and helped get a business off the ground, and a lot of people found that idea compelling.""

Watch: Mayor Cory Booker 'fires up' DNC

Christie called the special election after Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg passed away in early June. While a Republican interim senator–appointed by Christie–currently holds the seat, it has been expected a Democrat would win the special election in the largely blue state.

At the top of his victory speech Tuesday night, Booker first acknowledged Lautenberg's legacy. ""He has made us safer and healthier. We are a better state and we are a better America because of Senator Frank Lautenberg.""

Lautenberg's family backs Pallone, says he's not a 'showhorse'

The winner of the October 16 race will finish out Lautenberg's term through 2014, and the winner can run for a full term next year.

The nonpartisan political handicappers Stuart Rothenberg and Charlie Cook both rate next year's Senate race in New Jersey as solid or safe for Democrats.

Christie was criticized earlier this summer when he set the oddly-timed date for the special election. Rather than scheduling the special election to fall in line with the already-set gubernatorial election in November, Christie set the special for October.

Critics pointed to the extra costs to taxpayers for a separate election, but the governor stood by his decision, saying New Jersey voters deserved to have an elected official in the Senate as soon as possible.

“I know from past experience that the gentleman is all hat and no cattle,” O’Malley said of Perry during a pre-dinner reception at a Maryland Democratic Party gala in Greenbelt.

In advance of Perry’s visit, a Texas group has started airing radio and television ads in Maryland knocking O’Malley for raising taxes and inviting Maryland companies to consider coming to a more business-friendly state. Perry narrates the ads.

“We’re going to treat him with great Maryland hospitality, and then we’re going to give his high hat the high hand and send him packing,” O’Malley told the reception crowd.

About three hours later, when O’Malley’s turn came to address the Democratic dinner, Perry was still on his mind.

The Maryland governor rattled off a series of statistical measures on which Maryland fares better than Texas, including median income, poverty rates and upward mobility.

O’Malley also shared with the crowd of more than 600 that he had once debated Perry, a reference to a 2011 forum hosted by Politico. At the time, O’Malley was chairman of the Democratic Governors Association and Perry was leading the Republican Governors Association.

But despite President Obama’s tepid job approval ratings, Democrats have a shot at breaking that rule this November. Some polls show the Democratic nominee, Terry McAuliffe, with a narrow lead over Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, his Republican challenger.

“Why is McAuliffe ahead?” asked Tom Davis, a former Virginia congressman and Republican strategist.

One important reason: The same demographic shifts that made it possible for Mr. Obama to carry Virginia twice after 10 consecutive Democratic losses have raised the water level for the party’s statewide candidates, too.

The swelling number of Virginia’s suburban, college-educated, moderate, minority voters — black, Hispanic and Asian — is hardly the only factor shaping the race. It is certainly not the most conspicuous, as scandal swirls around Gov. Bob McDonnell, the departing Republican, and buffets Mr. Cuccinelli at the same time."

Chuck Hagel for defense secretary over past statements the former Nebraska lawmaker made about Israel and gay rights--hinting Hagel's confirmation would not come without a fight.

On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham called Hagel an ""in your face"" choice by the president.

“Chuck Hagel, if confirmed to be the secretary of defense, would be the most antagonistic secretary of defense toward the state of Israel in our nation’s history,"" Graham said. “Not only has he said you should directly negotiate with Iran, sanctions won’t work, that Israel should directly negotiate with the Hamas organization, a terrorist group that lobs thousands of rockets into Israel. He also was one of 12 senators who refused to sign a letter to the European Union that Hezbollah should be designated as a terrorist organization.

""This is an in-your-face nomination by the president,"" Graham continued. ""And it looks like the second term of Barack Obama is going to be an in-your-face term.""

Hagel's nomination for the post is expected to be announced by the White House on Monday, according to Politico.

On ""Fox News Sunday,"" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said the reported choice of Hagel proves Obama was emboldened by his victory in November. ""This is a president who has drunk the tea,"" Cruz said. ""He's high on reelection right now.""

On ABC's ""This Week,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said he'd ""wait and see how the hearings go,"" and see ""whether Chuck's views square with the job he would be nominated to do.""

""Whoever's nominated for secretary of defense is going to have to have a full understanding of our close relationship with our Israeli allies, the Iranian threat and the importance of having a robust military,"" McConnell said. ""So whoever that is, I think, will be given a thorough vetting. And if Senator Hagel's nominated, he'll be subjected to the same kinds of review of his credentials as anyone else.

Story continues

McConnell added: ""He's certainly been outspoken in foreign policy and defense over the years. The question we will be answering, if he's the nominee, is 'Do his views make sense for that particular job?'""

In 2006, Hagel said that ""the Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people” in Washington, angering both its members and supporters.

In 1998, Hagel called U.S. Ambassador James C. Hormel “aggressively gay” after his appointment by President Bill Clinton. ""[American ambassadors] are representing our lifestyle, our values, our standards,"" Hagel said. ""And I think it is an inhibiting factor to be gay.""

Last month, Hagel apologized. “My comments 14 years ago in 1998 were insensitive,"" he said in a statement. ""They do not reflect my views or the totality of my public record, and I apologize to Ambassador Hormel and any LGBT Americans who may question my commitment to their civil rights.""

Last week on ""Meet The Press,"" President Obama dismissed concerns about Hagel's past.

""I know him. He is a patriot,"" the president said. ""He is somebody who has done extraordinary work both in the United States Senate, somebody who served this country with valor in Vietnam. And is somebody who’s currently serving on my intelligence advisory board and doing an outstanding job.""

""With respect to the [gay] comment,"" Obama added, ""he apologized for it. And I think it’s a testimony to what has been a positive change over the last decade in terms of people’s attitudes about gays and lesbians serving our country.”"
http://news.yahoo.com/virginia-new-jersey-election-republican-lessons-200258255.html,,[],"After Virginia and New Jersey, voters offer GOP advice for 2014","Tuesday told a tale of two campaigns — and perhaps provided two lessons for 2014.

In New Jersey, GOP Gov. Chris Christie sailed to victory by 21 percentage points in the Democrat-dominated state.

In Virginia, meanwhile, Republican Ken Cuccinelli couldn’t eke out a win over Terry McAuliffe, a candidate who occasionally received voter approval ratings south of 30 percent and who was dubbed either “cancer” or “a heart attack” by ""The Daily Show."" How does Cuccinelli lose to a candidate voters dislike so widely?

For sure, he and Christie are different. Cuccinelli’s low approval ratings in Virginia mirrored McAuliffe’s. The New Jerseyan, on the other hand, boasts bipartisan appeal — note his high-profile post-Sandy bromance with President Barack Obama — and is perhaps that rare blue-chip candidate whom Republicans can’t realistically place on every ballot.

Do these two high-profile gubernatorial elections furnish the GOP a strategy going forward? Who better to ask for a plan than the voters? Yahoo News invited Republicans and conservatives in each state to perform a postmortem on Tuesday’s results and also to look forward to future campaigns: What did their party learn that it can apply across the nation in 2014, 2016 and beyond?

Here’s advice voters offered the morning after. Click their names to read their full thoughts.

Abandon social conservatism

Annie Tobey, 53, votes for Republicans in most Virginia elections. But on Tuesday, she backed Libertarian Party candidate Robert Sarvis, who received 6.6 percent of the votes. She writes:

Increasingly, the Republican Party is influenced by the tea party, which is controlled by religious fundamentalists. Cuccinelli is a sterling example of this religious domination, especially controlling a woman's body and depriving gays and lesbians of equal rights.

Increasingly, as in the 2013 governor's race, I find myself called upon to choose between financial slavery and personal slavery: The Democrats want to hijack my purse, while the Republicans want to control my personal life. I'd rather give up my money.

Story continues

Until the Republican Party can promote both social and economic liberty, I will not be able to give them my support, in 2014 or beyond.

Hammer away at Democrats’ support of the Affordable Care Act

Jeff Dunsavage, 51, is a lifelong New Jerseyan and lives in Dunellen. He has voted Republican in nearly every election since he first registered. He writes:

The next Democratic presidential candidate will reap the grief or glory of Obamacare. If President Obama and the Democratic leadership can bring this beast to heel, the party will have something to crow about. If not, the ACA may well be the vehicle that carries a Republican into the White House.

Right now, Christie seems the most likely beneficiary. But a lot can change in a few years.

Robert Peterson is a 36-year-old conservative voter in Sterling, Va. He writes:

McAuliffe's biggest weakness in my opinion was his full-sell mentality regarding the ACA, and it wasn't until late in the election that the Republicans advertisements focused on the effect that ACA would have on the Virginia budget and Virginian businesses that are shouldering new requirements of the health care law. If ACA fails, it should be the Republicans’ prominent lead in 2014 and 2016.

Stop being such a politician

Arrivanna Brooks, 28, lives in Clifton, N.J., and has voted Republican in elections since she was 18. She writes:

Christie's campaign teaches us that politicians need to be, well, non-politicians. In other words: Be more honest, reach across the aisle, commend the other side, don’t always say no just to say no. That resonates. Christie does not mince words, but he stands up for what he believes in. Republicans often say one thing and then distance themselves if they field a lot of blowback. Say what you mean. Stick by it. Voters want that loyalty.

Make campaigns more about issues and less about the party

Ashley Raybourn has been a registered voter and Republican in Virginia for 10 years, but cast a Democratic ballot for the first time. She is 28 and votes in Hampton.

The race for governor in New Jersey turned out quite differently; Christie won by a landslide. As colorful a character as he is, I think the Republican Party could stand to learn a lot from him. He wasn't afraid to point fingers at his own party when federal disaster relief was held up by House Republicans and he worked with a Democratic president in Sandy's aftermath. Some Republicans, such as myself, are fed up with members in our own party and he showed that it's OK to call them out and even reach across the aisle in the best interest of his constituents.

And take heart: It’s not all moonlight and roses for Democrats, either

Lyn Brooks, 45, lives in rural southwest Virginia near Roanoke. She writes:

Results show McAuliffe beat Cuccinelli by fewer than 55,000 votes statewide. That number is hardly a ""clear mandate"" that shows approval of Obama, Obamacare, or even a clear repudiation of the recent government shut down, threat of default, or the tea party.

Would a more socially moderate Republican have defeated McAuliffe? The narrow victory margin certainly suggests this.

The fact that McAuliffe beat Cuccinelli by such a small number should concern Democrats as the 2014 midterm elections draw near. To me, this narrow victory implies that Democrats face strong headwinds, and there is still time for Republicans to repair the fallout from this year's government shut down. If issues continue to plague the roll out of Obamacare, and if millions of Americans continue to receive cancellation notices in the mail from their insurers due to Obamacare, Democrats will pay the price in 2014 for Obama's lie: ""If you like your plan, you can keep it,"" just as President George H.W. Bush paid the price for his infamous falsehood, ""Read my lips: no new taxes."""
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/02/us/politics/ex-governor-of-florida-seeks-old-job-in-new-party.html,2013-11-02 00:00:00,['Lizette Alvarez'],Ex-Governor of Florida Seeks Old Job in New Party,"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — As Charlie Crist, the newly minted Democrat and former Florida governor, sat outside his waterfront condominium here in his hometown recently, the “Go, Charlie” shout-outs never let up.

A Lincoln Town Car pulled up and Mr. Crist leaned in and shook hands, doing what he does best. “Hey bro, what’s happening?” the driver asked. “I’m good, man,” Mr. Crist replied. When a Duke Energy worker recognized Mr. Crist, the former governor gave him an earful about solar energy. “You got my vote, buddy,” the man said. “There’s our next governor right here.”

Whether Mr. Crist, a man who sprinted from Republican to independent to Democrat in three years, can wrest the governorship away from Rick Scott is anybody’s guess. But on Friday he filed his paperwork to run for governor. And on Monday, with the enthusiastic backing of most leading Democrats, Mr. Crist, 57, is expected to formally announce his intention to reclaim the governor’s office in 2014.

Mr. Crist’s announcement is all but certain to kick off one of next year’s most expensive, contentious and rancorous governor’s races, pitting betrayed Republicans out for revenge against hopeful Democrats out for redemption."

http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/facebook-founder-host-fundraiser-chris-christie-162302419--politics.html,,[],Facebook founder to host a fundraiser for Chris Christie,"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie wraps up a three-day fundraising swing through California on Wednesday with a stop at the Palo Alto home of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who is helping the Republican lawmaker raise cash for his bid to win a second term in November.

The Facebook CEO announced last month he would host a finance event for Christie because he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, admired the New Jersey governor’s stance on “education reform and other issues.” The two first met in 2010 when Zuckerberg donated $100 million to improve schools in Newark, N.J.—a troubled state-run school district where Christie has championed reforms.

Zuckerberg’s decision to help the GOP governor has come under fire from Democrats in New Jersey, including groups angry over Christie’s veto of a gay marriage bill last year and what they view as anti-union efforts.

Last month, Garden State Equality, a civil rights organization, ran an ad urging Zuckerberg to “unfriend” Christie and cancel the fundraiser.

The Facebook executive's fundraiser marks his first notable foray into national politics. While Zuckerberg hosted President Barack Obama at a Facebook town hall in 2011 and was later invited to a White House event with other Silicon Valley executives, he hasn’t been a prolific political donor. According to Federal Election Commission records, Zuckerberg has made just two political donations in the past: two $5,000 checks to Facebook’s political action committee.

Christie’s campaign has not said how much the governor expects to raise at the Zuckerberg event, and a Christie adviser didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Over the past two days, Christie has also held fundraisers in Santa Barbara, Beverly Hills and La Jolla—all home to some of the biggest GOP donors in the country—as he seeks to stockpile cash for his re-election bid. But the finance event with Zuckerberg is also likely to fuel more speculation about Christie's potential 2016 presidential run. The fundraiser could help the governor make valuable inroads with political donors in Silicon Valley—who increasingly have been a major source of campaign dollars in recent years.

Asked last month about his upcoming event with the Facebook founder, Christie told reporters, “When Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan offer to host a fundraiser for you, you say, ‘Yes sir, what time?’”"
"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-pn-gop-study-20130318,0,5301566.story",2013-03-18 07:00:00,[],GOP study calls for changes to halt presidential losing streak,"WASHINGTON -- A smug, uncaring, ideologically rigid national Republican Party is turning off the majority of American voters, with stale policies that have changed little in 30 years and an image that alienates minorities and the young, according to an internal GOP study.

That blunt assessment on the state of Republicanism at the national level comes from a major new report, out Monday, that will likely shake up an already battered party. It was commissioned by the head of the Republican National Committee in the wake of Mitt Romney’s defeat last year.

Without offering detailed policy prescriptions, the 98-page report calls on the party to “smartly change course,” modernize itself and develop “a more welcoming brand of conservatism that invites and inspires new people to visit us.”

There are extensive lists of proposals, many of them technological and procedural, designed to help the GOP better engage voters, especially women, minorities and the young, and reverse a losing pattern in five of the last six popular votes for president.

“Unless changes are made, it will be increasingly difficult for Republicans to win another presidential election in the near future,” the report concludes.

RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, in remarks in Washington on the release of the study by the party’s “Growth and Opportunity Project,” is unsparing in his analysis of the 2012 election setback.

“Our message was weak. Our ground game was insufficient. We weren’t inclusive. We were behind in both data and digital. Our primary and debate process needed improvement,” he says, according to an advance text of his remarks.

“We know we have problems. We’ve identified them, and we’re implementing the solutions to fix them,” he says.

Most of the criticisms are familiar to those, both inside and outside the GOP, who have watched the party fail to come to grips with changing demographics and, instead, try to rely on older, white voters who represent a shrinking part of the electorate.

“Young voters are increasingly rolling their eyes at what the party represents, and many minorities wrongly think that Republicans do not like them or want them in the country. When someone rolls their eyes at us, they are not likely to open their ears to us,” the report says. Young voters, it says, see the party as “old and detached from pop culture.”

In calling for the GOP to develop “a more welcoming conservatism,” the report rebukes those who remain in denial about the seriousness of the problem and those who are unwilling to broaden the party’s appeal.

A just-concluded gathering of conservatives in Washington cheered speaker after speaker who urged the GOP to stick to its guns and, instead, largely blamed the 2012 defeat on Romney or the way he ran his campaign.

“The Republican Party needs to stop talking to itself,” the study says. “We have become expert in how to provide ideological reinforcement to like-minded people, but devastatingly we have lost the ability to be persuasive with, or welcoming to, those who do not agree with us on every issue.”

The report calls on Republicans to counter the party’s image as an arm of business. It says Republicans should “blow the whistle at corporate malfeasance and attack corporate welfare. We should speak out when a company liquidates itself and its executives receive bonuses but rank-and-file workers are left unemployed. We should speak out when CEOs receive tens of millions of dollars in retirement packages but middle-class workers have not had a meaningful raise in years.”

Beyond that, however, there are no policy details. Indeed, the authors point out that they are not a policy committee, in a section calling on the GOP to “embrace and champion” comprehensive immigration reform without further specifics.

In addition, an extensive set of “inclusion” proposals for minority groups, including Latinos, Asians and African Americans, appears to mimic similar, failed outreach efforts by various RNC chairs over the last 30 years.

The report notes the party’s problems with women voters, especially unmarried women. But its 10-point plan for appealing to women makes no mention of the GOP stance on any social issues, such as abortion and same-sex marriage, that have turned off many of the voters in question.

In a section on campaign mechanics, Republicans are advised to make “a critical cultural shift” on early, absentee, and online voting, trends that the report notes are “here to stay.” The report fails to note, however, that Republican elected officials fought to block and even reverse that trend at the state level in 2012.

Although the RNC study spares Romney any direct criticism, it includes tacit criticism of GOP polling that seems directed at his campaign. Research conducted for the study report found that 70% of Republican pollsters surveyed said that Democratic polling in 2012 “was better than our own. Fully 22% felt the Democrats did ‘much better’ than the Republicans when it came to accuracy and reliability.”

In a section on party primaries, there are thinly veiled attacks on efforts by outside groups, such as those tied to former George W. Bush strategist Karl Rove and organizations like the Club for Growth, that seek to apply litmus tests or weed out candidates considered unelectable.

“It would be a mistake for any one organization to think it can circumvent GOP voters and hand-pick our nominees,” the report says. “Third-party groups that promote purity are hurting our electoral prospects.”

There are also calls for fewer candidate debates during the presidential primaries, a shorter nomination calendar and an earlier national convention.

The report is the product of a committee headed by Priebus’ allies and supporters, including Henry Barbour of Mississippi, the nephew of former governor and RNC chairman Haley Barbour; former George W. Bush White House spokesman Ari Fleischer; and Sally Bradshaw, a longtime advisor to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.

Raffi Williams, the 24 year-old son of the liberal Fox commentator, will be the RNC’s deputy press secretary and will be tasked with helping the GOP make inroads in these communities.

He told BuzzFeed that even though it is not realistic to expect Republicans to “get a ridiculous amount of African Americans in the next election,” the party can “can start to make inroads, and the more inclusive we are as a party the better optics we get to other demographics as well — not just African Americans — and that helps us in the long run.”

Williams was a Communications Director for the Republican Study Committee and worked for Rep. Dan Benishek’s (R-MI) reelection campaign.

After losing every minority group badly during the last election cycle in a country that is getting more diverse, the RNC conducted an “autopsy” report that identified the problems the GOP has had with minority voters. Williams said RNC Chair Reince Priebus is enthusiastic about his efforts and it seems like he will be given the resources to succeed.

“So it’s about making those new connections and getting the support I need. People are really enthused about it,” Williams said. “And that’s a nice thing for me. I didn’t know what I was walking into exactly but from the Chairman on down everyone is so on board with this.”

Republicans may be able to win over black voters after Obama leaves office because many blacks tend to be conservative on issues like immigration and gay marriage.

For instance, George W. Bush won 16% of the black vote in Ohio in 2004, largely because many culturally conservative black voters went to the polls to vote against gay marriage. In 2008, Obama won 97% of the black vote in Ohio. And in 2012, Obama received 96% of the black vote in Ohio, but blacks made up an astounding 15% of Ohio’s electorate on election day, which made the difference for Obama in the state."

Something on the order of a thousand bills have been put up assaulting women's rights and women's health. Texas is no exception and the only thing between SB5 being rammed through easily before the clock struck twelve was one brave state senator and a few hundred spectators.

Majority Leader Reid take note: this is old school filibustering. According to rules of the Texas Senate, Davis had to stand for the entire time, could not eat anything, not so much as a sip of water. She could not lean or sit or otherwise use any desk or chair for support, she could not even take a quick bathroom break! Despite these restrictions, Davis stood her ground and spoke passionately, nonstop, through the day, into the evening, and on toward midnight. Real and virtual crowds grew, #SB5 exploded to become a top trending tag on Twitter.

Thanks to the Texas Tribune's live feed and many onsite tweets with expert commentary keeping readers informed minute to minute, it soon became clear we were witnessing a rare event, indeed a very special one, the birth of a new progressive champion on the national stage was unfolding before our eyes. In the deep red Lone Star State of all places! But with midnight on the horizon, the filibuster was suddenly shut down in its tracks. Naturally, by Texas Republicans on dicey technicalities. Hopes were briefly dashed.

When I got home after 11 PM, pessimistic, I found it was not covered live on any cable news station I could find. But online was a completely different story, the excitement was palpable, someone had stood up to the powerful good ole boys who have held sway over Texas for far too long.

That's when the people took over. Democrats on the floor quickly called up parliamentary procedures buying critical minutes, news ripped through the crowds and they starting voicing their disgust. With galleries in the rotunda overflowing, the clock ticking down, the eyes of Texas and the nation upon them and the crowd now roaring, republicans were literally in disarray. They grew desperate, eventually trying to hold a quiet, hasty vote just after the midnight curfew, back-date it on the ledge page, and then adjourn, perhaps smug in the belief they had won. Early Wednesday morning the Texas Tribune reported that that blatant violation will not stand:

The nation watched on Tuesday — and into Wednesday — as Democratic Sen. Wendy Davis and hundreds of impassioned reproductive rights advocates stalled proceedings and ultimately defeated controversial abortion legislation in a storm of screams and shouts as the clock struck midnight. ""I am overwhelmed, honestly,” Davis said after standing for nearly 13 hours to filibuster Senate Bill 5, the abortion legislation. The outpouring of support from protesters at the Capitol and across the nation, she said, “shows the determination and spirit of Texas women and people who care about Texas women.""

Wendy Davis and her dedicated professional staff are no strangers to standing up for the people against long odds, even when they know they might lose, or worse. They are certainly familiar with the consequences that can follow in this day and age. The Davis Fort Worth office was fire-bombed last year. Davis is already being demonized for her stand. The GOP will try again, any way they can, to get SB5 passed. Rick Perry has already announced another special session to ram this odious bill through. We will all try again, we will try to shame them and expose them and use every legal and ethical method to kill the bill. Nevertheless, the battle field is tilted against us, we may lose the skirmish.

But one day we will win the battle. Thanks to lots of people, like Wendy Davis and her staff (A staff I'm told is almost legendary in the commitment and resources they devote to constituent services) the tide may be beginning to turn in Texas faster than we could have dared hope! In fact she's reportedly considering a run in the 2014 Texas governor's race. Even in the event of a close defeat, such a run would badly rattle the GOP and boost progressive morale. It would also field test how organized the growing coalitions of disaffected voters in Texas that would engineer that revolution are becoming. If she were to pull off an upset, the implications for future elections far and wide are devastating for the GOP beginning immediately.

That will be a major lift, we'll need all the help we can get, and I'm not talking about money, not today folks. I'm talking about support. If you want to consider getting more involved at some point, high school kids through retirees anxious to throw in with the underdog candidate against the Harkonnens might be needed in droves. I'm talking unpaid door knockers, phone banking and data entry, too. Most of all, before this can even begin to coalesce, the Davis office needs to see the mojo; something that ought to be familiar in concept here! But this isn't asking much, many have done way more for a lot less. History is rife with examples.

In the Battle of Cowpens, General Daniel Morgan only asked his rag-tag irregulars to take two good shots before retreating in the face of the better trained and heavily armed British Army. It was brilliant strategy, Continental Irregulars stood their ground and made those two shots count, the seemingly invincible British lines panicked, some began to fold, the tide soon turned in favor of the underdogs, and no less than George Washington's relative [Correction DS] chased Bernaste Tarlton off the field of battle in final defeat. It was one of the key turning points in the long, bloody Revolutionary War. Many of the fallen on that day were mere teenagers, boys really, who who never got to grow up. But thanks to them and others like them, our revolutions today are no longer fought with guns and steel on blood-stained fields littered with corpses. To our great national pride we now hold bloodless revolutions regularly, at the ballot box, in peace.

I believe we can open up fault lines in the Texas republicans using similar, proven, asymmetric tactics to bring about a modern day electoral revolution in what has been a reliable GOP stronghold critical to republican victories. No one's asking for two shots, all we need to get started is for you take two minutes to drop Davis and her staff a note of encouragement here via Daily Kos and/or here on her site.

Let them know this is not a one day phenomenon, a mere fifteen minutes of fame, and that we will always remember and support those who risk their livelihoods and careers to do what is right for millions of disenfranchised people. Who will remain increasingly isolated and exiled from meaningful political influence without progressive champions like Wendy Davis."

"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-conservatives-denounce-hagel-defense-secretary-20130106,0,3997241.story",2013-01-06 08:00:00,[],Conservatives denounce pick of Hagel for Defense secretary,"WASHINGTON — The rough road to confirmation facing former Sen. Chuck Hagel if he is nominated as expected to be the next secretary of Defense was made clear Sunday as conservatives denounced his anticipated selection and painted the Vietnam veteran as out of step with mainstream foreign policy views.

Speaking on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina predicted that Hagel would be “the most antagonistic secretary of Defense toward the state of Israel in our nation’s history” and called his pick by President Obama an “in-your-face nomination.” Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume, describing the choice as “very peculiar,” said on “Fox News Sunday” that Hagel did not have “a particularly distinguished record.” And Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, while promising that Hagel would get a “fair hearing,” said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that he would get “tough questions” in a confirmation process.

Hagel, although a Republican, is viewed with suspicion by many in his party for past comments he has made calling on Israel to negotiate with Palestinians and for his opposition to some sanctions aimed at Iran. Since his possible nomination was floated late last year, he has come under fierce attack by conservatives.

He also has been criticized on the left for a remark he made in 1998 calling a Clinton administration ambassadorial nominee “openly, aggressively gay.” Hagel recently apologized for the comment, pledging his support for lesbian and gay military families.

The dissent over his pick does not appear to have dissuaded Obama from selecting Hagel to succeed current Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta. While White House officials said Friday afternoon that the president hadn’t yet formally offered the job to Hagel, others familiar with the process said that the announcement could come as soon as Monday.

Hagel is a former two-term senator from Nebraska and an Army veteran who was awarded two Purple Hearts for wounds received in Vietnam. In the Senate, he initially voted to give the George W. Bush administration authority to go to war in Afghanistan and Iraq, but later harshly criticized the conduct of both wars, irritating fellow Republicans and making him popular with Democrats critical of those wars.

Critics have pounced on his calls for direct negotiations with Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that the U.S. and Israel refuse to deal with directly, and his votes against some Iran sanctions.

And Hagel rankled many with comments he made in a 2006 interview with former State Department Mideast peace negotiator Aaron David Miller in which he said that the “Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people” in Congress, in a reference to AIPAC and other pro-Israel groups.

“Quite frankly, Chuck Hagel is out of the mainstream of thinking I believe on most issues regarding foreign policy,” Graham said on CNN, adding that, “this an in-your-face nomination by the president to all of us who are supportive of Israel.”

Miller, who had interviewed Hagel for a book he was writing on the Mideast peace negotiations, wrote recently that attempts to use his comment about the “Jewish lobby” to paint Hagel as anti-Semitic were “shameful and scurrilous.” He noted that in the same interview Hagel also stressed “shared values and the importance of Israeli security.”

Supporters say Hagel showed his support for Israel by voting repeatedly to provide it with military aid and by calling for a comprehensive peace deal with the Palestinians that should not include any compromise regarding Israel’s Jewish identity and that would leave Israel “free to live in peace and security.”

They note that he also supported three major Iran sanctions bills: the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act of 1998, the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 and the Iran Freedom Support Act of 2006.

When Hagel left the Senate four years ago, McConnell praised his “clear voice and stature on national security and foreign policy,” ABC’s George Stephanopoulos reminded the Senate minority leader on “This Week.”

But McConnell declined to reiterate that view Sunday.

“He’s certainly been outspoken in foreign policy and defense over the years,” he said. “The question we will be answering, if he’s the nominee, is do his views make sense for that particular job? I think he ought to be given a fair hearing, like any other nominee, and he will be.”

USA TODAY

Don't touch Dante de Blasio's Afro.

The 16-year-old Brooklyn Tech student is being credited with giving his father, Bill de Blasio, a big boost in New York City mayor's race. The elder de Blasio was the top vote-getter in Tuesday's Democratic primary and is slightly above the 40% support he needs to avoid a runoff with William Thompson. The winner will face Republican Joe Lhota on Nov. 5.

Dante, with his big smile and even bigger hair, starred in a campaign commercial that helped push de Blasio and the candidate's message of ending economic inequality for New Yorkers to the top of the Democratic field.

""Bill de Blasio will be a mayor for every New Yorker and I'd say that even if he weren't my dad,"" Dante proudly says in the TV ad.

Nearly 6 in 10 registered Democrats, or 59%, who saw the ad said they liked Bill de Blasio even more after seeing it, a poll by NBC News 4/Wall Street Journal/Marist Institute for Public Opinion showed.

Dante, his hairdo and his dad's strength at the ballot box have combined into one social media phenomenon: the Twitter hashtag #fromentum.

Chiara de Blasio, the candidate's 18-year-old daughter, joked about her little brother's emerging fame while managing to put him in his place. ""My brother ... may look good on TV, but there's only one de Blasio who got to vote for her dad today,"" she said at the candidate's primary night party.

But it was Papa de Blasio who had the best line, celebrating not only his daughter but his son as well.

""In her enthusiasm Chiara just attempted to touch the hair,"" de Blasio joked. ""Security was ready to intervene.""

A Hillary Rodham Clinton book deal is in place.

Simon & Schuster announced Thursday that it will publish the former secretary of State's memoir next year.

The tentative publication date is June 2014, and will likely inspire a book tour that will be filled with speculation about whether Clinton will seek the presidency in 2016.

Financial terms were not disclosed; Clinton received $8 million for her 2003 memoir Living History, also published by Simon & Schuster.

From Simon & Schuster:

""The yet-to-be titled book will use a number of dramatic moments during Secretary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State to frame her thoughts about the recent history of U.S. foreign policy and the urgent, ongoing need for American leadership in a changing world.

""She will write about her role in, and reflections on, such recent events as the killing of Osama Bin Laden; the overthrow of the Qaddafi regime in Libya; the transitions in Iraq and Afghanistan; the Arab Spring; the pivot to the Asia-Pacific; the rise of new powers like China, Brazil, Turkey, and India; building diplomatic coalitions to deal with Iran and North Korea; and our relations with important allies around the world.

""The book will also address many of the major trends reshaping the global landscape of the 21st century – trends in economics, energy and climate change, democracy and human rights, the critical role of women and girls, technology and innovation, health and human development, and more.""

(CNN) - In their final face-to-face meeting, New Jersey's candidates for governor held nothing back. The nationally known incumbent, Republican Chris Christie, and Democratic state Sen. Barbara Buono, traded personal and political barbs in a heated exchange three weeks before election day.

The 90-minute debate was interrupted twice by audience members and featured dueling narratives. Christie described himself as a bipartisan governor with overwhelming public support who has brought New Jersey out of the depths of the recession. Buono, on the other hand, pitched herself as a fierce underdog who has fought for the working class all her career.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Christie has an overwhelming majority in the polls. The latest numbers from Quinnipiac University put the Republican governor almost 30% ahead of Buono despite the state's history of leaning blue.

""Governor Christie represents the worst combination of bully and boss-ism,"" Buono said, speaking again and again about what she called the ""Boardwalk Empire of New Jersey bosses and backroom politics"" that she charged Christie stood at the center of.

Throughout the night, Christie was quick to fire back.

""You want to start throwing stones tonight, you better get out of your glass house,"" he said.

Buono didn't hit hard all night, however, knowing how popular the governor is on many issues.

""I think the governor did a great job during Sandy and the aftermath,"" she said of his leadership during the hurricane last fall. She was quick to add, ""I just wish that we could see that governor again.""

For his part, Christie, who is widely considered a contender for the 2016 presidential election, tried to combat a perception that he had already checked out of state politics on his national climb. He was asked a handful of times about his political ambition, and his opponent painted some of his policy-making as him appeasing the right wing of the national Republican Party.

Buono accused him of ""wilting"" to the NRA and New Hampshire Republicans when he vetoed a ban on a powerful model of semi-automatic assault rifle. She argued he was aligning himself with Sarah Palin and Tea Party Republicans by opposing same-sex marriage over a majority of New Jersey voters' support for it. And she tied him to the debt fights in Washington through his campaigning and fundraising for GOP leaders like Sen. Marco Rubio and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.

Again and again, Christie defended his record.

""I am who I am,"" he said, and the people of New Jersey ""know that when I tell them something, I'm telling them the truth as I see it and that I'm not going to mince words about it. I think that's the way most people in New Jersey are... and they're not going to see anything different from Chris Christie in a second term if I'm lucky enough to have one.""

And on the issue of presidential politics, he remained mum.

""I have no idea what the next four years are going to bring me. Absolutely no idea,"" he said. ""And I don’t think that the people of New Jersey out there watching right now expect me to be able to predict what will happen over the next four years."""

George H.W. Bush, for example, is someone whose legacy has grown -- in a good way -- because of the work he did after he lost to Bill Clinton in 1992. Clinton, too, has largely aided his political legacy by his active involvement in both Democratic campaigns and humanitarian efforts since leaving office. (The exception to that rule for Clinton was his campaigning on behalf of his wife in 2008, which took some of the shine off his reputation.)"

The president was surrounded by his immediate family and was sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts on a bible belonging to the family of his wife, first lady Michelle Obama.

The first lady stood to the president's left and held the Robinson family bible as daughters Sasha and Malia stood beside her, inside the White House's Blue Room.

The oath took about two minutes and was administered shortly before noon.

Obama hugged his wife and said, ""Thank you Sweetie,"" after the oath was administered.

He then hugged his daughters and told Sasha, ""I did it.""

Earlier in the day, Obama joined Vice President Biden, after he was sworn in, at Arlington National Cemetery for a wreath-laying ceremony on a crisp, sun-splashed January day.

Obama and Biden jointly placed a large wreath, adorned with red, white and blue ribbon, in front of Arlington's Tomb of the Unknowns. Placing their hands over their hearts, the two leaders stood solemnly as a bugle played ""Taps.""

Biden was surrounded by family and friends for his brief swearing-in at the Naval Observatory, his official residence in northwest Washington.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, appointed by Obama as the first Hispanic to serve on the Supreme Court, administered the oath of office to Biden, who placed his hand on a Bible his family has used since 1893.

""I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States,"" Biden said as he recited the oath.

Among the 120 guests on hand to witness the vice president's second swearing-in were Attorney General Eric Holder, departing Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and several Democratic lawmakers.

Sunday's subdued ceremonies are a function of the calendar and the Constitution, which says presidents automatically begin their new terms at noon on Jan. 20. Because that date fell this year on a Sunday -- a day on which inaugural ceremonies historically are not held -- organizers scheduled a second, public swearing-in for Monday.

A crowd of up to 800,000 people is expected to gather on the National Mall to witness that event, which will take place on the Capitol's red, white and blue bunting-draped west front. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who famously flubbed the oath of office that Obama took in 2009, was to swear the president in both days.

Once the celebrations are over, Obama will plunge into a second-term agenda still dominated by the economy, which slowly churned out of recession during his first four years in office. The president will also try to cement his legacy with sweeping domestic changes, pledging to achieve both an immigration overhaul and stricter gun laws despite opposition from a divided Congress.

But for one weekend at least, Washington was putting politics aside. Obama called the nation's inaugural traditions ""a symbol of how our democracy works and how we peacefully transfer power.""

""But it should also be an affirmation that we're all in this together,"" he said Saturday, as he opened a weekend of inaugural activities at a Washington elementary school.

The Blue Room is an oval space with majestic views of the South Lawn and the Washington Monument.

The room, named for the color of the drapes, upholstery and carpet, primarily has been a reception room as well as the site of the only presidential wedding in the White House, when President Grover Cleveland married Frances Folsum in 1886.

Obama and Biden were to address supporters Sunday evening at an inaugural reception.

The president planned to save his most expansive remarks for Monday's inaugural address to the crowd gathered on the Mall and millions more watching across the country and the world. Obama started working on the speech in early December and was still tinkering with it into the weekend, aides said.

The president's address will set the stage for the policy objectives he seeks to achieve in his second term, including speeding up the economic recovery, passing comprehensive immigration and gun control measures and ending the war in Afghanistan. Aides said Obama would save the specifics of those agenda items for his Feb. 12 State of the Union address.

The president launched a weekend of inaugural activities Saturday by heading up a National Day of Service. Along with his family, Obama helped hundreds of volunteers spruce up a Washington area elementary school.

Obama wore rubber gloves, picked up a paint brush and helped volunteers stain a bookshelf.

Obama added the service event to the inaugural schedule in 2009 and is hoping it becomes a tradition followed for future presidents.

Mrs. Obama, speaking to volunteers Sunday, espoused the importance of giving back in the midst of the weekend of pomp, circumstance and celebration.

""The reason why we're here, why we're standing here, why we're able to celebrate this weekend is because a lot of people worked hard and supported us, and we've got a job to do and this is a symbol of the kind of work that we need to be doing the next four years,"" Michelle Obama said at Burrville Elementary.

As the immigration issue moves front and center in Congress, a chorus of GOP voices is warning that if immigrants—and, let’s face it, the debate is focused mostly on those from Mexico, Central America, and South America—are provided a path to citizenship, Republicans will never again win a national election. The same people also argue that Republicans would find it much harder to win statewide races in places such as Texas that now routinely fall into the GOP column. Implicit in both arguments is the notion that Republicans will remain a competitive party nationally and stay dominant in certain states if they can prevent Hispanic immigrants from becoming citizens and gaining voting rights. But that position ignores the fact that the 45.5 million Hispanics already in this country legally are registering to vote and are seeing the Republican Party as distinctly hostile. The more the GOP comes to be seen as fighting immigration reform, the more difficult it will be for Republican candidates to compete for this group of voters. Remember, 50,000 Hispanic citizens reach voting age every month.

Oops. The GOP forgot to do something about the ones already here.

Sometimes it works temporarily, as when Wendy Davis filibustered to kill a bill on a legislative deadline, only to watch the Republicans reset the clock, by booting up another special session, to get what they wanted a few days later.

Scratch this, and you’ll find people arguing both sides. After one or two sessions in the Texas Senate, each officeholder has been either the stomper or the stompee — in the minority on something and the majority on something else. Washington seems to always be in a partisan fight. In Austin, the majority-minority fights shift constantly. Redistricting debates are partisan. Debates over budgets for education break on rural and suburban lines, or on lines between big and little property tax bases. Water wars are all about geography.

So the federal scrap over what got tagged as the “nuclear option” was all about partisans. The state ruckus is more nuanced, and even the strong proponents of change are inclined to move slowly. Drop it to a smaller supermajority like 60 percent instead of killing it, they suggest.

The initial resistance is partisan. After all, Mr. Patrick, a Houston Republican who is running for lieutenant governor, is one of the most conservative senators, and Democrats are immediately suspect of anything he supports. A lower supermajority like 60 percent would put Republicans in control, given the current configuration. It would take 19 people to call up a bill. Today, there are 19 Republicans. With Ms. Davis, a Democrat from Fort Worth, running for governor, Republican chances of taking her district have improved. With the two-thirds rule in place, Republicans would still need a defector on partisan issues, even with one of their own representing the 10th Senate District.

Democratic senators think they would get squashed if the two-thirds rule disappeared. Republicans, during the 1990s, would have had the same reaction. The traditions in the Senate are strong, and that has kept the rule in place for all these years. Earlier this year, in fact, senators voted unanimously to keep the rule.

But others in the race for lieutenant governor have endorsed the lower number. That makes it an item for discussion when the Texas Senate convenes after next year’s elections. Those Republicans want to exercise the full power of the majority without a pesky minority throwing obstacles in their way. Who wouldn’t?

Just ask Mr. Reid and the Democrats in the United States Senate."

In September 2011, when Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey was considering making a last-minute entry into the presidential race, I pointed out an incongruity in Republican attitudes toward him. Many Republican organizations and activists, including some very conservative ones, were enthusiastic about the possibility that Mr. Christie might enter the presidential race. But Mr. Christie’s history of actions and issue statements was fairly moderate.

Roughly 18 months later, the attitude toward Mr. Christie has changed. Mr. Christie has not been invited to the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, which will gather next month. Mr. Christie’s failure to be invited is not a mere oversight; virtually every other prominent Republican who might be a plausible nominee in 2016 has been asked to participate.

Isn’t it premature to conclude very much about 2016 dynamics based on something that is happening in February 2013?

Actually, as I wrote in my piece on Marco Rubio week, the Republican primary is already under way. Candidates like Mr. Rubio, Rand Paul, Jeb Bush, and Bobby Jindal are already positioning themselves with an eye toward 2016.

The broader public certainly won’t be paying much attention to what they do or say for a very long time. But the nomination process is as much an inside game as an exercise in voting. The candidates who perform well in the so-called invisible primary — the phase of the campaign when candidates seek to accumulate scarce resources like money, endorsements, staff talent and favorable relationships with the news media — will be far better positioned to succeed once voters in Iowa and New Hampshire get to have their say.

The veto of Mr. Christie by CPAC, which represents a relatively broad coalition of conservative and Republican interest groups, is an ominous sign for him. Candidates who have won the CPAC straw poll in the recent past include Mitt Romney and Rudolph W. Giuliani, other Republicans with whom some conservatives have had considerable disagreements. So the fact that Mr. Christie has not even been invited to the conference this year says something.

Mr. Christie was in good graces of CPAC as recently as last June, when he was the headliner at a regional conference the group sponsored in Chicago.

So what has changed? Is it Mr. Christie, or is it CPAC?

In fact, I’m not sure that either has. Instead, what seems to have changed is the salience of different issues, as driven by major news events over the past year.

Mr. Christie has long been an advocate of gun-control policies, for example. But that issue has become far more relevant since the shootings in Newtown, Conn.

Mr. Christie has also taken moderate positions on immigration. Immigration was an issue in the 2012 campaign, but it seems to have grown in importance now, after the poor performance of the Republicans with Hispanic voters in November, and the push by President Obama and by some Republicans in Congress for immigration legislation.

Of course, there was Hurricane Sandy, which yielded Mr. Christie’s literal and figurative embrace of Mr. Obama, and his later criticism of Congressional Republicans for failing to pass a disaster-relief bill. This is an important symbolic issue, but would Mr. Christie have behaved differently if the storm had hit in 2010 or 2011?

And on Tuesday, Mr. Christie became the eighth Republican governor to announce that he will accept Medicaid expansion under the president’s health care law, in spite of his party’s general opposition to the law.

Contrast this to the political climate in late 2011, when Mr. Christie was winning praise from conservatives for his statements toward teachers’ unions — an issue that was then in the news because of the protests against efforts by Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin to curtail benefits for public-sector unions in that state. Mr. Christie also takes relatively conservative views on gay marriage and abortion, social issues that had the stage more to themselves in 2011, but which may have to compete more against immigration and gun control in the next political cycle.

So far as I can tell, Mr. Christie hasn’t changed his positions on any of these issues very much. Rather, it’s that Mr. Christie had a number of relatively moderate positions to begin with, along with some conservative ones.

Does that mean there could be a reconciliation between Mr. Christie and conservative groups later on? It’s certainly possible. Surely the news cycle will shift again. And Mr. Christie could shift his stances to the right, especially once he secures re-election in New Jersey next year, as he is heavily favored to do.

But my premise when I wrote about Mr. Christie in 2011 was that conservatives had been underrating how moderate Mr. Christie was — perhaps because they were so desperate at that time to find alternatives to Mr. Romney and their other candidates. Now that he’s been “outed” as a moderate, it may be hard to close the closet door.

Mr. Christie, meanwhile, will need to consider whether to compete for the Republican nomination in 2016. While the mainstream media tends to chronically overrate the likelihood of a viable independent bid for the presidency, Mr. Christie would be better positioned to seek one than most, with very high favorability ratings among independent voters and the access to money and news media attention that comes from being a prominent politician in the Northeast. Or he could shoot for another office. Because of the ethical cloud surrounding Senator Robert Menendez, the Democratic incumbent in New Jersey, the Senate race in New Jersey could be very competitive in 2018.

Mr. Christie’s relationship with conservative Republicans, however, may have been doomed from the start."

Despite objections from popular Republican Sens. Marco Rubio, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, it seem the much-criticized budget deal will get final congressional approval this week, sidestepping the cooked-up dramas that have come to define the 113th Congress.

Bad news for those who thought the Republican establishment and the tea party were going to live happily ever after.

Last week House Speaker John Boehner let some of his frustrations with the far-right cohort spill out on television. He called them “ridiculous.” He said, “They’ve lost all credibility,” and accused them of “pushing our members in places where they don’t want to be.” He even tossed in a bit of theatrics with his “Are you kidding me?” remark, all of which made for great sound bites.

Intentionally or not, the outburst also provided a good distraction from the overhaul the Republican National Committee is planning for the 2016 primary process, which was also was reported last week.

RNC Chairman Reince Priebus had talked about limiting the number of debates soon after President Barack Obama was re-elected. Now it seems the RNC is prepared to punish candidates who participate in unofficial GOP debates and forums severely by stripping them of one third of their delegates. Remember the quotes from Republican candidates all trying to out-ultra-conservative each other in 2012? Don’t expect to hear as many come 2016. This, more than entertaining sound bites from Boehner, is a far more tangible sign that the establishment is serious about reining in the radical right.

And by radical right, I mean the tea party.

So now what?

Well, 60% of Americans want a third party, and it seems Republicans want their party back. Perhaps it’s time that tea party standard bearer Cruz and company file the divorce papers and see if the group has the strength to stand on its own two feet.

It is, after all, unlikely that he or any of the other tea party-leaning politicians are going to forgo the group’s influence and get in line with moderates just because Boehner said some harsh words on TV. And with deep-pocket groups such as Americans for Prosperity behind the tea party, why should they?

Indeed, many tea partiers believe the reason Republicans lost in 2012 – despite an economy that lagged under the first Obama administration – was because Mitt Romney wasn’t conservative enough.

This thinking was echoed in November after tea partiers cited a lack of conservatism as a main reason why the anti-gay, anti-abortion Ken Cuccinelli lost in the governor’s race in Virginia.

Couple that with The New York Times reporting that presumptive front-runner – and establishment darling – New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is as unpopular with ultra-conservatives as he is popular with moderates, and there is no reason to believe the tea party is just going to roll over after Obama signs the budget deal into law.

“(Christie’s) no more conservative than Harry Reid,” said Scott Hofstra, a tea partier from Vine Grove, Kentucky, told the Times. With statements such as that, it’s clear it’s time for the GOP and the tea party to call it quits. The two had a good run retaking the House in 2010, but if a guy such as Cuccinelli doesn’t pass the conservative smell test and Christie’s a RINO, or Republican in Name Only, then it seems this marriage is unsalvageable.

Debates within a party are healthy for Washington. But civil wars are not good for anyone, as evidenced by the country’s downgraded credit rating, Congress’ historically low approval numbers, the unprecedented number of appointment delays for Obama’s nominees and Congress’ dubious distinction of being the least productive in U.S. history.

The tea party supposedly started to express the views of voters frustrated with big government. But it has quickly morphed into a thorn in the side of the Republican establishment – prodding 2012 candidates into making outlandish statements and strong-arming leadership into a series of questionable moves.

It seems it now has a critical decision to make: be reined in or break out. The scenario reminds me of the day Ronald Reagan became a Republican.

It was the summer of 1962. And though he still called himself a Democrat, at this point, Reagan was so in name only. His political leanings had begun shifting in the 1940s, and he had been publicly campaigning for Republicans since the 1950s. One day, while campaigning for Richard Nixon, someone in the crowd interrupted his speech with a question.

Have you registered as a Republican yet?

He replied no.

And then a woman identifying herself as a registrar appeared. She walked down the center aisle, placed a registration card in front of Reagan, and he signed it. He then returned to his speech, later saying, “I didn’t leave the Democratic Party, the party left me.”

Last week Boehner came down the center aisle and placed a registration card in front of the tea party. But given its beliefs, funding and recent events, is there still a good reason why the group and its followers should sign it?

Chris Christie wraps up a three-day fundraising swing through California on Wednesday with a stop at the Palo Alto home of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who is helping the Republican lawmaker raise cash for his bid to win a second term in November.

The Facebook CEO announced last month he would host a finance event for Christie because he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, admired the New Jersey governor’s stance on “education reform and other issues.” The two first met in 2010 when Zuckerberg donated $100 million to improve schools in Newark, N.J.—a troubled state-run school district where Christie has championed reforms.

Zuckerberg’s decision to help the GOP governor has come under fire from Democrats in New Jersey, including groups angry over Christie’s veto of a gay marriage bill last year and what they view as anti-union efforts.

Last month, Garden State Equality, a civil rights organization, ran an ad urging Zuckerberg to “unfriend” Christie and cancel the fundraiser.

The Facebook executive's fundraiser marks his first notable foray into national politics. While Zuckerberg hosted President Barack Obama at a Facebook town hall in 2011 and was later invited to a White House event with other Silicon Valley executives, he hasn’t been a prolific political donor. According to Federal Election Commission records, Zuckerberg has made just two political donations in the past: two $5,000 checks to Facebook’s political action committee.

Christie’s campaign has not said how much the governor expects to raise at the Zuckerberg event, and a Christie adviser didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Over the past two days, Christie has also held fundraisers in Santa Barbara, Beverly Hills and La Jolla—all home to some of the biggest GOP donors in the country—as he seeks to stockpile cash for his re-election bid. But the finance event with Zuckerberg is also likely to fuel more speculation about Christie's potential 2016 presidential run. The fundraiser could help the governor make valuable inroads with political donors in Silicon Valley—who increasingly have been a major source of campaign dollars in recent years.

Asked last month about his upcoming event with the Facebook founder, Christie told reporters, “When Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan offer to host a fundraiser for you, you say, ‘Yes sir, what time?’”"

Joe Biden is going to Iowa.

Let us now explicate.

The vice president (that’s Biden) is scheduled in September to attend Sen. Tom Harkin’s annual steak fry, which is what you do for a presidential race even if you have no taste for steak. Biden knows that merely by attending he is suggesting that he might enter the Iowa Democratic caucuses, which, as usual, will be the lead-off contest for the 2016 presidential election. If he does so, Clinton will be his likely opponent. Will she say she’s been to Togo?

Will she say she’s been to where no secretary of state had ever been before — the Cook Islands, for instance? Will she echo the constant refrain from her State Department tenure — that she traveled more than any secretary of state in history, an astounding 956,733 miles, which is 38.42 times around the world and which, you have to concede, is a lot? Iowans may be impressed, but being First Frequent Flier is not enough to get them out on the forbiddingly cold night when the caucuses will be held. Clinton, as my Post colleague Dan Balz points out, needs a message.

At the moment, her only one is that she is a woman. Becoming the first female president is a worthy goal, but it kind of falls into the category of miles traveled and countries visited. It is an achievement, even a stunning one, but it is not a stirring trumpet call. Even now, her statistics-laden tenure has been somewhat eclipsed by her successor at State. John F. Kerry has already managed to bring Israelis and Palestinians together to resume peace talks. If these talks produce an agreement (not likely, but still . . .), then all this talk about miles traveled is going to sound awfully silly.

Clinton is undoubtedly the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in 2016, but then she is always the front-runner until something trips her up. The last time out — 2008 — it was her own dismal campaign and, of course, the emergence of one Barack Hussein Obama, a junior senator promising “hope.” To counter that, Clinton had no real message of her own. Instead, there was a fustiness about her, a familiarity that was both good and bad. She was — remains — Bill Clinton’s wife, and that, as we all know, is both good and bad.

Now, just as Kerry is strutting his stuff as secretary of state, comes the revolting Anthony Weiner, whose association with Clinton through his wife, Huma Abedin — a Hillary Clinton intimate — has the Clintons running so fast the other way she may well revisit Togo by the time this is over. Once again, the Clinton past proves to be toxic. What she needs is a present — an emphatic now.

There are few people in public life as smart as Hillary Clinton. A conversation with her is always instructive. She’s also a good person and — almost as important — she knows how to laugh. But if she is to run for president at the age of 68, she must rediscover her youth. She has to revert to the brave and inspiring woman who was the first student to deliver the commencement address at Wellesley College (a seven-minute ovation) and made her a national figure overnight. In other words, she has to lead.

If Biden runs — he will be 73 in 2016 — he will do so as a vice president. As did George H.W. Bush, he will seek office as a continuation of the previous presidency. At the moment, Gallup gives Obama a healthy approval rating of 80 percent among Democrats. He does less well among the public at large — 44 percent in the most recent poll — but it is Democrats who vote in the Democratic caucuses and primaries. It can’t hurt to be Obama’s vice president.

The 2016 presidential nomination is Hillary Clinton’s to lose. Already, a group called “Ready for Hillary” has raised money on her behalf. Emily’s List, the formidable organization dedicated to the election of women, has virtually endorsed her — and she has, to mangle a word, the vastest network of friends and supporters of any American politician. She can probably raise $1 billion with the snap of a finger. All she lacks is what she has always lacked — an overriding, stirring message. Lots of people are ready to march, but they need to know in what direction.

Lamar Alexander penned a letter to the state’s largest newspaper defending his pragmatic, “problem solving” approach to governing. The letter in The Tennessean defends his record as a conservative who knows how to “get results.”

“Well, I learned to count in Maryville City Schools,” Alexander writes. “So I know that if you only have 45 votes and you need 60 senators to get something important done like balancing the budget and fixing the debt, then you have to work with other people — that is, IF you really care about solving the problem, IF you really want to get a result, instead of just making a speech.”

It is a superficially compelling argument. It is an argument conservatives have heard for decades. Yes, the perfect can’t be the enemy of the good. Yes, we have to compromise to meet many of our goals. And, yes, a half-loaf is better than nothing.

But it begs the question. Where has Alexander’s “compromise” and “problem-solving” approach taken us? Alexander has often abetted the Democrats in the Senate, supporting their legislative agenda and providing support for Obama nominees. When has he been able to persuade Democrats to support a conservative issue? Alexander’s record suggests compromise is a one-way street, i.e. Republicans support Democrats. When do Democrats in the Senate ever repay the favor Alexander extends them?

The record of the “problem-solving” approach is fairly grim. It has given us $16 trillion in debt, ObamaCare, bailouts of Wall Street and the auto industry, trillion dollar deficits, sweeping new regulations, and government encroachment on ever more aspects of our lives.

Against this, Alexander proudly trumps his successful campaign to preserve the rights of people to fish at dams. That’s all well and good, but it isn’t exactly an even trade.

I have no doubt that Alexander is a fine man and a decent-enough Senator. Unfortunately, both he and the state’s junior Senator, Bob Corker, represent something of a wasted opportunity. Tennessee is a deeply conservative state. It is still one of only a handful of states that doesn’t have an income tax. Alexander and Corker, however, have voting records that better reflect the voters in Maine or Illinois.

There is perhaps a place for Alexander’s approach to governing. Tennessee isn’t that place."

(CNN) – Mark Sanford overcame the latest hurdle in his South Carolina political redemption tour, ending Tuesday night with a concession from his opponent in the GOP primary runoff for a U.S. House seat.

Results showed the former South Carolina governor had 57% of the vote, compared with 43% held by former Charleston City Councilman Curtis Bostic. That was a difference of about 6,000 votes out of about 45,000 cast.

Jake Tapper interviews Mark Sanford Wednesday on ""The Lead"" - 4 p.m. ET, only on CNN.





[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Sanford said he was “humbled” and “thankful” for the win, calling his competitor “a gentleman.”

His fiancee, Maria Belen Chapur, made a rare public appearance, standing at his side Tuesday evening. Revelations about his extramarital affair with her in 2009 led many observers to conclude his political career was over.

“I congratulate the governor on his race,” Bostic told supporters after conceding. “I want to be the first to say, ‘Congratulations, campaign well-run, we wish you the very, very best.’ ”

Sanford now goes on to the May 7 special election against Democratic nominee Elizabeth Colbert Busch.

In a statement Tuesday night, she said she looked forward to a “vigorous campaign” and said the heavily Republican district needs “a voice in Washington who stands up for South Carolina solutions - not either political party.”

National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Greg Walden wrote in a statement that “South Carolina families clearly deserve a continuation of the strong fiscal discipline displayed by now-Senator Tim Scott and will greatly benefit from Sanford’s fiscal hawk approach. Without a doubt, Mark Sanford will campaign tirelessly to grow South Carolina jobs and work to get our nation’s massive spending problem under control.”

Sanford's past infidelity is front and center in battle for the state's 1st Congressional District, which he represented from 1995 to 2001 before being elected the Palmetto State's governor for two terms.

In his victory speech Tuesday night, Sanford thanked voters, saying that while God forgives, “sometimes the voters aren’t so forgiving.”

Bostic claimed in Thursday's debate that Sanford was a ""compromised candidate"" because of his extramarital affair with a woman from Argentina. The affair came to light in 2009, sinking any hopes Sanford had of making a bid for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012.

""Trust is a crucial issue,” he said. “In fact, it has become a crucial issue in this race.""

Sanford and his then-wife, Jenny, were divorced in 2010, and Sanford finished his second term as governor in January 2011. He's now engaged to the woman with whom he had the affair.

Sanford, who's touting his fiscal conservative credentials as he campaigns for Congress, is also asking the public for a second chance, telling CNN that he was seeking ""redemption"" by running for office again. He came in first in a 16-candidate primary two weeks ago but finished with 37% of the vote, far short of the 50% needed to avoid a runoff. But he was far ahead of Bostic, who narrowly edged out state Sen. Larry Grooms to finish second with 13%.

Sanford said his first-place finish was ""incredibly humbling.""

""The events of 2009 absolutely represent a failure on my part, for which there were and probably always will be consequences,"" added Sanford. ""But that does not mean, because you have had failure in your personal life, that you cannot step back into life again.""

But Bostic, who had won the support of some top social conservative leaders, disagreed, arguing that the congressional seat - which has been held by the GOP since 1981 - would become vulnerable if Sanford became the Republican nominee.

""A compromised candidate is not what we need. It's just not what we need. We need to secure this seat. It needs to be red,"" Bostic said, citing surveys that indicated that Colbert Busch was leading Sanford.

But Bostic did not repeat his criticism of Sanford's infidelity at their second debate last weekend.

Colbert Busch is the sister of Stephen Colbert, the satirist and host of ""The Colbert Report"" on Comedy Central. He's campaigned on his sister's behalf, recently telling Jake Tapper, CNN’s chief Washington correspondent and anchor of CNN's The Lead, that ""she's my sister, and I'm willing to, you know, break the jewel of my own creation to try to do something for her.""

Colbert Busch, an official with Clemson University's wind turbine drive testing facility, is expected to have an uphill climb in the general election because the district is heavily Republican.

GOP Rep. Tim Scott won re-election to the seat by 27 percentage points in last November's election. But when Republican U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina stepped down from his seat late last year to take over as the head of the conservative Heritage Foundation, GOP Gov. Nikki Haley named Scott to fill the seat, triggering the special election to fill his seat.

By Richard Valdmanis

BOSTON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Young Americans are unhappy with virtually every major thing President Barack Obama has done since he was re-elected, but they would still vote for him today, according to the results of a Harvard University survey released on Wednesday.

The national poll by Harvard's Institute of Politics of more than 2,000 people aged 18 through 29 is intended to provide insight into the political views of the youngest U.S. voters. This increasingly influential demographic known as the ""millennial generation"" has been a traditional base of Obama's support.

More than 50 percent of respondents in the survey, taken between Oct. 30 and Nov. 11, said they disapproved of how the Democratic president handled key issues in his second term, including Syria, Iran, the economy, healthcare and the federal budget deficit.

Most cited the economy as their top concern.

Still, disapproval ratings were higher for both Republicans and Democrats in Congress. And a plurality of respondents, 46 percent, said they would still vote for Obama for president if they could recast their 2012 ballots, compared with 35 percent who said they would vote for the then-Republican nominee, Mitt Romney.

Some 55 percent of the survey respondents who reported casting ballots in the 2012 presidential election said they had voted for Obama, compared with 33 percent for Romney.

Institute of Politics Director Trey Grayson said the poll revealed cracks forming in Obama's base.

""This isn't a problem for Obama because he's not coming up for election again,"" Grayson said in a conference call with reporters. ""But it is a potential problem for any Democratic candidate seeking to mobilize young Americans.""

The results follow a CNN/ORC poll released on Nov. 25 that showed a growing number of Americans doubted Obama's ability to manage the nation, amid ongoing problems plaguing the president's signature domestic policy achievement, the healthcare reform law known as Obamacare.

Obama's administration has also come under fire. Critics claim it is dealing poorly with the Syrian government over its alleged use of chemical weapons and Iran over its nuclear ambitions, and has failed to rein in U.S. public spending or revive the economy.

Some 57 percent of respondents in the Harvard poll said they disapproved of the Obamacare law, with 40 percent expecting the quality of healthcare to worsen and about half expecting such costs to rise.

""Among the 22 percent in our survey who report that they have no insurance, less than one-third tell us they are likely to enroll,"" according to the report detailing the survey findings. ""A plurality however are 50-50 and are therefore open to enrolling under the right circumstances.""

UNHAPPY WITH EVERYONE

The Harvard survey respondents spread out the blame for Washington's shortcomings beyond Obama and the Democratic Party. In terms of job performance, 54 percent said they disapproved of the president, 59 percent disapproved of Democrats in Congress, and a whopping 75 percent disapproved of Republicans in Congress.

Conservative U.S. Republicans took a hard line in the fight over October's U.S. government shutdown, which was waged over the party's demands to stop the launch of Obamacare. But delays in pay to some public workers, closings of national parks and reductions in public services only deepened Americans' frustration.

""Nobody was happy with anybody after the shutdown,"" Grayson said.

Asked which proposals they would prefer to see enacted to cut the federal deficit, respondents tended to favor increasing taxes for the wealthy and cutting certain types of military spending - including on the nuclear arsenal and the size of the Navy fleet.

More than 70 percent also said they would prefer not to see any cuts to education spending on kindergarten through high school, the poll showed.

In a sign of ambivalence over the role of Edward Snowden, a contractor for the National Security Agency, in unveiling details of the U.S. spying program, 52 percent of survey respondents said they were not sure if he was a traitor or a patriot. Some 22 percent labeled him a traitor and an equal 22 percent labeled him a patriot.

Snowden is living in Russia as a fugitive after President Vladimir Putin granted him asylum against Washington's wishes.

""The Snowden stuff shows that these 18-to-29-year-olds are not that supportive of giving up personal information for the interests of national security,"" Grayson said. (Writing by Richard Valdmanis; Editing by Scott Malone and Lisa Von Ahn)"

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Residents in a small Rhode Island town are voting Saturday on whether four town council members should be recalled for proposing a change in the way the town issues gun permits.

The rare recall election was prompted by gun rights supporters who said the four Exeter council members ignored their objections to a failed proposal to allow the attorney general to oversee the town's concealed weapons permits.

Both sides were concerned about low-turnout with snow in the forecast.

The four council members supported a resolution asking the state's General Assembly to allow the state attorney general to process concealed weapons permits. Under current law, those seeking a permit may apply to either the attorney general or their local police. Since Exeter doesn't have a police department — just a single town sergeant — the job now falls to the town clerk, who the council members said lacks the resources to conduct proper background checks.

Even though the council's request never got a vote in the Assembly, gun rights supporters began petitioning for a recall, saying the town's leaders had ignored the concerns of hundreds of people who turned out for a meeting on the proposal.

Debates about gun policy have sparked similar ouster efforts elsewhere. In September, two Democratic Colorado state senators were recalled over their support for changes to gun laws following the theater massacre outside Denver in 2012.

The recall vote coincidentally comes on the anniversary of the Newtown, Conn., school shooting.

The four officials being targeted by the recall effort are Council President Arlene Hicks and Councilmen Cal Ellis, Robert Johnson and William Monahan. All are Democrats. A fifth member is not up for recall: independent Councilman Raymond Morrissey Jr., who voted against the resolution.

Should one or more of the council members be recalled, their council seats will go to the losing candidates from the last election. Daniel W. Patterson would get the first seat, Edward F. Nataly the second and Lincoln P. Picillo the third.

The fourth seat would be filled by a council appointment.

Polls close at 8 p.m.

http://news.yahoo.com/senate-control-hinges-fate-southern-dems-183626132.html,,[],Senate control hinges on fate of Southern Dems,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans are counting on some Southern comfort to win Senate control next year.

The fate of Democratic incumbents in GOP-trending Arkansas, Louisiana and North Carolina, the ability of the 71-year-old GOP leader to hold his Kentucky seat and the eventual outcome of a Georgia primary will help decide whether Republicans gain the six seats necessary to grab power in the Senate for the final two years of Barack Obama's presidency.

Fifteen months before Election Day, the GOP has a genuine shot at the majority, especially with the midterm elections' traditional low turnout and possible Obama fatigue on the party's side. But both Republicans and Democrats stop short of writing off several Democratic incumbents who would have to lose for the GOP to regain power, and some Republicans worry about holding GOP seats in Kentucky and Georgia.

The transformation of the South from solidly Democratic to nearly all Republican in the half century since the 1964 Civil Rights Act has made the states generally inhospitable to Democratic politicians. And next year's elections will test whether the last remaining Southern Democrats can survive.

Overall numbers and geography favor the GOP — 21 Democratic seats are on state ballots compared with 14 Republican. Seven of the Democratic seats are in states that Obama lost in 2012 to Republican Mitt Romney, some by 15 points or more. Adding to the GOP bullishness: Democratic retirements in three of the seven states — West Virginia, Montana and South Dakota — and a few recruiting disappointments.

""There's a lot of hard work to be done, but we feel very comfortable about the progression of the 2014 map in our favor and the quality of Republican candidates expressing an interest in running in key states,"" said Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

Still, Republicans had a similar edge in 2010 and 2012, and failed to take control because of flawed candidates and ill-conceived remarks. The GOP list of lost opportunities is long — Delaware, Colorado, Nevada in 2010, Missouri, Indiana, North Dakota and Montana in 2012.

Story continues

""All of those prognostications were wrong,"" Guy Cecil, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said. ""One of the things that we demonstrated in the last election is that Senate races are about the two people who are on the ballot.""

Next year's Senate contests stand as perhaps the best chance for the GOP, especially since Republicans will have to defend 24 Senate seats to the Democrats' 10 in the presidential election year of 2016.

Currently, Democrats hold a 54-46 edge. Newark Mayor Cory Booker is expected to win next week's Democratic primary in New Jersey and the Oct. 16 special election, boosting the Democratic margin to 10.

BLUEGRASS BRAWL

The political ads and videos in Kentucky make it seem like five-term Sen. Mitch McConnell has three opponents — primary challenger Matt Bevin, Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes and Obama.

With close to $10 million on hand to make his case, McConnell is casting himself as the bulwark against the president's policies in a state that Obama lost by 23 percentage points last year. ""To Barack Obama and his allies, coal country represents a threat,"" McConnell intones in a video that repeatedly shows the president and never mentions Grimes by name.

McConnell is seeking not just another six-year term but also a shot at the prize of Senate majority leader. And he is taking no chances either politically or legislatively.

He has run four television ads since March, responding quickly to outside groups, promoting his own candidacy and seeking to define his rivals. McConnell has assailed Bevin over payment of taxes in two ads, with one airing even before the businessman announced his GOP primary candidacy.

In the Senate last week, McConnell voted with fellow Kentuckian and tea party favorite Rand Paul to cut U.S. aid to Egypt. The vote put McConnell on the opposite side of the powerful American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a rare place for a senator who has been a strong supporter of Israel.

On Thursday, in an embarrassment for McConnell, audio of a Jan. 9 telephone conversation revealed that his campaign manager said he was ""holding my nose"" while working for the candidate. In a brief telephone interview, Jesse Benton, who has deep tea party ties, didn't dispute the authenticity of the taping, saying he wasn't confirming it but wasn't denying it either. Separately, in a statement emailed to reporters, he said he believes in McConnell and is 100 percent committed to his re-election.

Economic Policy Journal posted the audio online.

If McConnell dispatches Bevin, who is on the air with his own ad hitting the senator for supporting the Wall Street bailout in 2007, Democrat Grimes has served notice that she'll be a tough competitor.

""I don't scare easy,"" she declares in a web video that criticizes McConnell as an obstructionist.

Republicans take heart in the senator's history of nail-biting wins. He prevailed by 5,169 votes in 1984 and survived another challenge in 2008.

LAST DAYS OF SOUTHERN DEMOCRATS?

Republicans are counting on two House members — one in office just seven months — to knock out moderate Sens. Mark Pryor in Arkansas and Mary Landrieu in Louisiana, two politicians with familiar family names.

Pryor stands as the most vulnerable after Arkansas voters soundly rejected a Democratic incumbent in 2010, Sen. Blanche Lincoln, and the GOP got a top recruit, freshman Rep. Tom Cotton, a 36-year-old Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran. Pryor welcomed Cotton to the race with an ad criticizing his House votes against a sweeping farm bill, the Violence Against Women Act and a student loan bill.

""Being able to draw that clear contrast is something that didn't happen in 2010,"" Cecil said. ""Now we have a record.""

Landrieu faces three-term Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy, a physician from Baton Rouge, in a state that has become more Republican and changed demographically since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. But Republicans and Democrats describe Landrieu as tenacious and point to past races that she won comfortably. She has $4.9 million cash on hand.

In swing-voting North Carolina, Republicans probably will have a tough primary race before picking a nominee to run against Sen. Kay Hagan. Thom Tillis, speaker of the North Carolina House, has announced, and state Senate leader Phil Berger may run.

GEORGIA ON MY MIND

Republicans nervously watch the Georgia primary free-for-all, which includes no less than three House members vying for the open Senate seat.

Conservative Rep. Paul Broun has said evolution and the Big Bang theory are ""lies straight from the pit of Hell."" Rep. Phil Gingrey, an OB-GYN since 1975, backtracked earlier this year after saying former Rep. Todd Akin was ""partly right"" when he said during his failed Senate race in Missouri last year that women's bodies can avoid pregnancy in cases of ""legitimate rape."" Rep. Jack Kingston, a conservative, has emerged as the moderate.

Other Republicans are expected to join the field.

Georgia rules set the primary for next June, but if no candidate gets 50 percent, a runoff occurs in early August, a late date that could leave the GOP with a roughed-up nominee.

Democrats recruited Michelle Nunn, daughter of former Sen. Sam Nunn and CEO of Points of Light, the volunteer organization founded by President George H.W. Bush.

Democrats hope the Nunn name still resonates in the state nearly 20 years after the senator retired. The challenge is clear: No non-incumbent Democrat has won a major statewide race in Georgia since Gov. Roy Barnes in 1998.

ON THE HORIZON

Republicans are awaiting word from 75-year-old Thad Cochran on whether the Mississippi senator will seek a seventh term in a state the GOP will have no problem holding.

Alaska, where Democratic Sen. Mark Begich is a top Republican target, could get another GOP candidate to join Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell and Joe Miller, the tea party favorite who won the 2010 GOP primary against Sen. Lisa Murkowski but then lost as she prevailed as a write-in. Alaska Department of Natural Resources Commissioner Dan Sullivan is expected to decide after he returns from a deployment in Afghanistan.

Among other potential GOP Senate challengers is Rep. Dave Camp, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, in Michigan. Republican Ken Buck, who lost to Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet in 2010, filed the necessary paperwork on Thursday for a run against Sen. Mark Udall.

In a letter to both NBC and CNN, RNC Chair Reince Priebus said that the Party will not allow either network to host primary debates if they go ahead with planned projects surrounding Hillary Clinton. In its statement, CNN said they will not cancel the planned documentary and that it would be a “disservice to voters” for the RNC not to partner with them for the debates:

CNN Films, a division of CNN Worldwide, commissioned a documentary about Hillary Clinton earlier this year. It is expected to premiere in 2014 with a theatrical run prior to airing on CNN. This documentary will be a non-fiction look at the life of a former First Lady and Secretary of State. Instead of making premature decisions about a project that is in the very early stages of development and months from completion, we would encourage the members of the Republican National Committee to reserve judgment until they know more. Should they decide not to participate in debates on CNN, we would find it curious, as limiting their debate participation seems to be the ultimate disservice to voters.

As far as CNN’s claim about a “disservice to voters,” one wonders which voters CNN is talking about. Certainly not Republican voters. For years now, and for very good reason, Republican voters have seen CNN as just another branch of the Democrat Party.

During the 2012 election, many Republicans were infuriated and questioned the judgment of an RNC that willingly allowed our candidates to have their futures put in the hands of a network that was and is so obviously enamored with Obama and the left. It was a suicide run, when these debates should be used by the RNC to help our candidates shine.

CNN was even worse during the actual presidential debates when CNN’s Candy Crowley violated the debate rules, tried to save Barack Obama from a Mitt Romney attack, and got her facts horribly wrong. This is one of the biggest gaffes in all of presidential debate history, but this one was committed by the moderator.

Earlier today, NBC News responded with the claim it had nothing to do with the network’s planned miniseries about Clinton, that will star Academy Award-nominee Diane Lane.

It is unlikely that Priebus and the RNC expected either network to back down. So the news here is all good.

Jim DeMint (R-S.C.).

The endorsement of Kentucky businessman Matt Bevin escalates the effort by outside conservative groups to back primary challenges next year against those congressional lawmakers who finally voted for the bipartisan budget deal. On Thursday, the Senate Conservatives Fund, the Club for Growth and the Madison Project all endorsed Mississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel, a primary challenger to Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.). The Madison Project had already endorsed Bevin.

McConnell himself helped craft the budget deal that left Obamacare virtually unscathed. The Senate Conservatives Fund also hammered him over a provision in the legislation boosting funding for the Olmsted Locks and Dam in Kentucky from $775 million to $2.9 billion.

""Matt Bevin is a true conservative who will fight to stop the massive spending, bailouts, and debt that are destroying our country,"" said Senate Conservatives Fund Director Matt Hoskins in a statement. ""He is not afraid to stand up to the establishment and he will do what it takes to stop Obamacare. We know that winning this primary won't be easy. Mitch McConnell has the support of the entire Washington establishment and he will do anything to hold on to power. But if people in Kentucky and all across the country rise up and demand something better, we're confident Matt Bevin can win this race.""

The Senate Conservatives Fund had previously targeted open seats that had been held by Democrats. But since DeMint left the Senate to run the Heritage Foundation at the beginning of 2013, the fund also has set its sights on incumbent Republican senators.

McConnell's campaign dismissed the endorsement.

""Matt Bevin now has the dubious honor of standing with a self-serving D.C. fundraising group that made its name by recruiting and promoting unelectable candidates that ensured Barack Obama a majority in the Senate,"" said McConnell spokeswoman Allison Moore. ""They clearly care less about Kentuckians than they do about their reputation for supporting laughably bad candidates.""

This story has been updated with comment from McConnell's campaign."

That's not snark, people. That's legit. We're looking for quality in this one, not quantity, and one could make a pretty compelling argument that Alaska has the most important race on Election Night.

Part of this, admittedly, is a function of geography. Alaska, as the westernmost state in the Union, has the latest poll closing time of all 50 states (midnight ET/9 PM PT, and because some precincts are even further to the west, results typically don't come in for an hour after that).

Which means, even if Democrats don't want to stomach the thought, control of the United States Senate may not be decided until very early in the morning on Wednesday, Nov. 5, 2014. In a red state, the final Senate race of the night will feature a Democratic incumbent, Mark Begich, who knocked off incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Stevens by the narrowest of margins in 2008.

This time around, he gets a respectable, if somewhat generic, GOP challenger in state Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell. But, in a state where both John McCain and Mitt Romney won handily, ""generic Republican"" might be enough.

State #4: Pennsylvania

One of the more artistic Republican gerrymanders in the nation has robbed us of the usual 3-6 competitive House races in the Keystone State. However, that does not mean that all is well for the GOP next year in Pennsylvania.

For one thing, Pennsylvania may well be home to the least popular Republican governor in the nation. Gov. Tom Corbett, at best, is in a tossup to earn a second term as the state's governor. More likely, he is a narrow underdog, who has to hope for a complete and total circular firing squad in the Democratic primary in order to gain a damaged opponent.

For another, Pennsylvania's GOP is in control of the state legislature (hence, the butt-ugly gerrymander). But that control is tenuous, and this seems to be a real target at the downballot level.

The state isn't completely devoid of interesting U.S. House races, either. While the seat will stay blue, the Democratic primary in PA-13 (where veteran Rep. Allyson Schwartz is among a host of Democrats challenging Corbett) will be highly entertaining. And, in PA-08, Democrat and former CIA analyst Kevin Strouse is showing some early strength, though Mike Fitzpatrick fairly easily dispatched a well-financed Democrat in 2012.

State #3: Colorado

If this were the states to watch in 2013, Colorado may well be #1. Yep, even ahead of New Jersey and Virginia. Those two state Senate recall elections looming this coming week are simply huge, and could have immense ramifications for state legislatures around the nation.

More practically, however, it could have huge implications in Colorado, which is somewhat of a mirror image of Pennsylvania in one key sense. Here, it is the Democrats that control the legislature, and that control is reasonably tenuous. If the Democrats can beat back the recalls of Democrat senators Morse and Giron, they will have a little extra cushion when 2014 rolls around.

That's not all that is on deck in the Rockies. Voters could be getting a serious case of deja vu, as both 2010 GOP contenders (gubernatorial candidate Tom Tancredo and Senate candidate Ken Buck) are back for another round. Lest anyone take either of them lightly because of ... well ... their batshit craziness, bear two stats in mind: Tancredo has been polling even with Hickenlooper (whose approval ratings have been bruised badly this year), and Buck nearly knocked off Michael Bennet in 2010.

Democrats have a real opportunity in 2014 here, as well. Indeed, one of their biggest targets in the U.S. House is suburban Republican Rep. Mike Coffman, who has drawn one of the highest profile Democratic challengers in the country in well-respected former state legislator Andrew Romanoff, the one-time speaker of the House.

State #2: Florida

Florida is still a little bit undefined, but its status as a key 2014 battleground is pretty much beyond doubt. Start at the top: Republican Gov. Rick Scott has long been one of the less-loved incumbents in the nation. Even a generic Democrat would appear to be a real contender, and one of the newest Democrats in the state (former Gov. Charlie Crist) could turn this race into a clash of the Sunshine State titans should he elect to seek a return to elective politics.

Meanwhile, downballot, there are a lot of variables, but come next Fall there could be as many as six races worth watching in Florida. One race has already pretty well defined itself, as it is already certain that sophomore GOP Rep. Steve Southerland will have a top-flight Democrat challenging him in 2014. Democrats are very high on Leon County Schools official Gwen Graham, the daughter of former Florida pol (and institution) Bob Graham. Al Lawson, who took 47 percent off of Southerland last year, may still throw his hat in the ring for round 2. Meanwhile, Bill Young is facing a rematch in the Tampa metro area, after being held to 58 percent last year. He'll be 84 on Election Day 2014, and his retirement has only been rumored for a decade or two.

Democrats, alas, will have a couple of incumbents to defend, as well. While the challengers are still undefined, you can pretty much count on freshmen Patrick Murphy (FL-18) and Joe Garcia (FL-26) to have tight races next year.

State #1: Michigan

Things could change, of course. But right now, it is hard to conceive of another state that will draw more eyeballs on Election Night 2014 than Michigan. Two hugely critical (and high-profile) statewide races, coupled with what may well be several interesting House races, plus what promises to be a huge skirmish over control of the state legislature, highlight what ought to be a fascinating Election Night in the upper Midwest.

Start with the gubernatorial race. Put first-term GOP Gov. Rick Snyder in the same mix as the aforementioned Msrs. Scott and Corbett. Rookie Republican governor, governing like he is the governor of Wyoming, instead of a state carried twice by President Obama. He has already drawn a first-tier challenger in former Democratic U.S. Rep. Mark Schauer. Polls have been a little inconsistent here, but even the best polls for Snyder spot him a very modest lead, and well under 50 percent of the vote, to boot.

Meanwhile, there is also an open seat U.S. Senate race that will command a lot of attention. This one is already somewhat defined, as well, though it is certainly off to a funky start. Democrats have coalesced around third-term Rep. Gary Peters. Republicans also got a commitment from a respectable statewide candidate in former Sec. of State Terri Lynn Land. The funky part is that the Republican party seems to be less than enthused about Land, and seem open (if not eager) to see someone else get into the race.

Downballot, a couple of House Republicans deserve some focus. In the northern tier of the state, sophomore Republican Rep. Dan Benishek has already drawn a formidable Democratic challenger in former Kalkaska County Sheriff Jerry Cannon. Benishek won in 2012 by less than one percent. Meanwhile, downstate in MI-11, two questions need to be answered between now and next November: (1) Will freshman Republican Kerry Bentivolio be the Republican nominee (he is being challenged by attorney Dave Trott)?; (2) Will the Democrats have a top-flight candidate in place on the off chance that the ... ahem ... very interesting Bentivolio survives his primary? Finally, the Democrats landed a legit opponent in MI-07 for Rep. Tim Walberg, who usually underperforms in this purply-red district. Democrat Pam Byrnes is looking for a political second act, after a six year stint in the state legislature that ran from 2004-2010.

Last, but certainly not least: Watch the state legislative battles here. Democrats halved the GOP majority in the 2012 elections, and they'll be eager to finish the job in 2014. Plus, they get their first crack at the GOP majority in the state Senate, though at a 26-12 GOP majority, a switch in that chamber would require a pretty herculean effort by the Democrats.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

There were some other states that were in the mix. One could make a decent case for Maine (who doesn't want to see GOP Gov. Paul LePage become unemployed?), or North Carolina (has the GOP lege been so extreme that they can neutralize their own gerrymander?). Others, too. If you feel strongly about a state that didn't crack the top five this time around, by all means: Make your case in the comments."

• IA-Sen: Man. This is some seriously bottom-of-the-barrel business. I hadn't even heard of West Des Moines Mayor Steve Gaer, who is just the latest Republican to decline a Senate bid, but I'm more amused at the roster of other potential candidates found at the link. Apparently, some mystery list of 13 GOP names ""surfaced"" recently, and Gaer's was on it, but so is that of one Kevin O'Brien, who is described as an ""owner and operator of nine McDonald's stores, including one in Iowa City."" And the rest of the bunch aren't really much more notable than that.

• MA-Sen: Rep. Ed Markey has released his first negative ad of the campaign, a spot that lacerates Republican Gabriel Gomez on guns. In particular, it features footage of Gomez saying he opposes both an assault weapons ban and a ban on high-capacity magazines, which the narrator compares to ""the ones used in the Newtown school shooting."" Gomez doesn't come off looking good in those clips, particularly since both bans register over 60 percent support nationally (and likely higher in Massachusetts). That probably explains his histrionic response, in which he outlandishly claims Markey ""blames me for the horrific Newtown shooting."" When you're attacking your opponent for politicizing something, it usually means you're on the losing end of the issue.

There's no word on the size of Markey's buy, but we do have a new FEC report showing sizable spending on his behalf by the SEIU. The union is shelling out $340,000 on canvassing efforts, the first independent expenditure by any group since the April 30 primary. Gomez has pointedly refused to sign the so-called people's pledge to bar outside advertising, so conceivably we could start to see third-party ads here. But Markey seems to prefer beating Gomez up for not taking the pledge, and by focusing their money on canvassing (which would be permitted even with the pledge), SEIU allows Markey to maintain the high ground while still helping him.

• NC-Sen: Jim Cain, an ambassador to Denmark under George W. Bush, says he's considering a run against Dem Sen. Kay Hagan next year. Also of note in Kyle Trygstad's piece is that Rep. Virginia Foxx is supposedly taking a look at the race, according to unnamed ""sources."" I have to think her particular brand of crazy would contrast nicely in a general election.

• SD-Sen: Proving that you can never be conservative enough for the nutters, the Club for Growth's communications director took to Twitter on Friday to slam GOP Rep. Kristi Noem, who has often been held out as a purer alternative to ex-Gov. Mike Rounds in South Dakota's open seat Senate race. But nope, Noem isn't good enough. The Club says she's ""no fiscal conservative or darling of Tea Party"" and adds that she sports ""a very bad 62 percent on CFG Scorecard."" This is actually somewhat discouraging for Democrats who still held out hope that a nasty Republican primary would give us a better shot at holding this seat next year. If the Club doesn't want to help Noem, that makes it all the less likely that she'd want to get in the race.

Gubernatorial:

• CO-Gov: In a pretty stark about-face, Republican Secretary of State Scott Gessler now says he's considering a bid against Gov. John Hickenlooper, even though he declared months ago that he'd seek re-election instead. It's not at all clear what's changed in Gessler's thinking, and as Kurtis Lee at the Denver Post notes, his conservative activism as secretary of state could prove to be a real turnoff in a higher-scrutiny race. However, if he does run, it would open up his current job, giving Dems a good chance at winning back the SoS post.

• RI-Gov: He gets credit for sticking to his timetable: In late December, Republican Brendan Doherty said he was considering a bid for governor and would decide in four or five months. Five months later, he has indeed decided, and not too surprisingly, it's a no. Doherty, a former state police chief, ran for Congress last year against in RI-01; though the seat is ocean blue, Rep. David Cicilline's personal troubles made it look like Doherty was poised for an upset, but he wound up falling far short.

A January PPP poll did show Doherty with narrow leads in some three-way matchups, assuming independent Gov. Lincoln Chafee were to run again, but there's no guarantee he will. Republicans very likely need him to in order to have a chance, though, because in direct pairings with Democrats, they fared much worse, Doherty included. But it would still be a bank shot even if the unpopular Chafee does try to seek another term, just given Rhode Island's strong Democratic lean, so it makes sense that Doherty would rather not try.

House:

• MA-07: Local analyst David Bernstein, ensconced in his new gig at Boston Magazine, takes a look at possible Democratic candidates who could seek to replace Rep. Mike Capuano, assuming Capuano runs for governor (which Bernstein thinks he will). Bernstein names Boston City Councillors Ayanna Pressley and Felix Arroyo, as well as Somerville Mayor Joseph Curtatone, but says that the rumor mill ""has been pretty quiet"" so far.

• NJ-05: I think we're going to have to call it the ""Rick Nolan phenomenon"": former Dem congressman, now in his 70s or thereabouts, hasn't served since the 1980s, but decides to stage a comeback in the 20-teens. Nolan, of course, pulled this off in Minnesota's 8th District last year, and then, back in January, there was a bit of chatter that ex-Rep. Andrew Maguire might be interested in running in New Jersey's 5th. Maguire's 74 and left office in 1981, after losing to Republican Marge Roukema in an old district then numbered the 7th.

It seemed like an incredible longshot that he might actually get back in the game, but lo and behold, he's filed a statement of candidacy with the FEC. Maguire isn't commenting and he may not ultimately go through with it, but he'd certainly be an interesting opponent for GOP Rep. Scott Garrett.

• OH-06: State Sen. Lou Gentile, who came up in politics as a driver for then-Rep. (and later Gov.) Ted Strickland, says he's considering a run against Republican Rep. Bill Johnson in Ohio's 6th Congressional District, but doesn't have a timetable for making a decision. This district is definitely a tough nut to crack, though: It went 55-43 for Romney last year, and at the same time Johnson fended off a stiff challenge from ex-Rep. Charlie Wilson, the man he'd unseated two years earlier. However, David Skolnick points out that Gentile was the GOP's top target in 2012, weathering a seven-figure assault to win by 5 points, so he certainly knows how to fight.

Other Races:

• Portland, OR: Have you ever seen a Commie drink a glass of water? You might soon get your chance, since SurveyUSA's new poll confirms their last one, which I first became aware of during the physical act of love. Our comrades in Portland now look set to defeat a measure to add fluoride to ice cream, Mandrake, children's ice cream the city water supply by a 53-40 margin, up from 48-39 a week earlier. Peace on Earth/Purity of Essence.

Grab Bag:

• Demographics: Pew Research has some fascinating new data on the changing map of where legal immigrants to the U.S. are coming from. Over the last 20 years, as you'd probably expect, the share of Europeans among all immigrants has fallen considerably—but so too has the share of Latin Americans. Instead, there are percentage gains among Asians and Middle Easterners, but the most significant gains come among the oft-overlooked group of sub-Saharan Africans (9 percent of immigrants in 2012, up from 2 percent in 1992). (David Jarman)

• House: If you liked Stephen Wolf's series of diaries on what the House would look like under a nationwide regime of nonpartisan redistricting, then you'll want to also check out the new effort from Real Clear Politics' Sean Trende, which also tries to imagine that scenario. However, he comes to a different set of conclusions, that it wouldn't change the House's composition too much, largely because of Democrats' increasingly inefficient concentration in the nation's urban areas.

Perhaps that points to the very Rorschach-test-like nature of redistricting where one sees what one wants to see in the blots, though Trende also uses a slightly different set of assumptions on how a nonpartisan commission would do its work (and he also doesn't force the issue of additional VRA seats where possible, like Louisiana and South Carolina). Also, we don't get to actually see the maps he actually drew in DRA, just a chart of median Obama vote share for each state, so we can't do the kind of fun seat-by-seat analysis as seen in Stephen's work—though, of course, predicting real-world outcomes in fantasy districts is where the real Rorschach-test stuff happens. (David Jarman)

• Red vs. Blue: No doubt you've noticed that the nation is gradually sorting itself out better at the downballot level as the parties lose their regional quirks and take on more national identities, especially at the congressional level but also at the level of state legislatures and statewide offices. But Governing magazine's Louis Jacobson actually sets out to quantify just how much things have consolidated in the red and blue states. In state Senates, for instance, Republicans now have 4 percent fewer seats in blue states than they did in 2004, while Democrats have 12 percent fewer seats than they did in red states back then.

Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. A golf game with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky. A chance to mingle over breakfast with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Those are just a few of the offerings available to the powerful who donated to 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney at a three-day gathering that the former Massachusetts governor is hosting next week in Park City, Utah.

Donors and former aides say Romney is not looking to take sides, or play kingmaker, for the potential Republican presidential candidates, but rather to connect all of the contenders with the expansive network of donors that propelled him to the Republican nomination, while letting his donors evaluate who – if anyone – they will back in the next round.

(For good measure, they can also get their fill of Democrats, among them a potential Democratic contender in 2016, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, outgoing Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and President Obama’s longtime strategist, David Axelrod.)

Next week’s gathering in Park City, a favorite spot of the family after Romney oversaw the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, comes as the Romneys are once again reentering the public eye. Romney told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published Thursday that he wanted to bring together the members of his 2012 finance team for the “Experts & Enthusiasts” gathering to “update our thinking about where the world is headed and what the national agenda ought to be.”

The conference is being sponsored by Solamere Capital, the investment firm co-founded by his Romney’s son Tagg and his campaign finance chairman, Spencer Zwick.

Romney, who has rejoined Boston-based Solamere as the chairman of its executive committee, has emphasized that he does not intend to run for office again or try to be the standard bearer for the Republican Party — quipping to Fox News during his first post-campaign interview that “as the guy who lost the election, I’m not in a position to tell everybody else how to win.”

At the same time, he has not shied away from expressing disappointment in the current administration. During that March interview with Chris Wallace, Romney referred to President Obama as “Nero""—the Roman emperor who, as the expression goes, “fiddled” while Rome burned.

Advertisement

In his new interview with the Wall Street Journal’s Neil King Jr., Romney said he was disappointed by “the lack of any clear White House agenda” during the first 100 days of Obama’s second term.

His wife, Ann Romney, who was sometimes more blunt than her husband during the 2012 campaign, told CBS News in her first solo interview this week that the recent scandals in Washington had breached the trust between Americans and their government.

Advertisement

“We have to believe they are doing right for us,” she said on “CBS This Morning.” “Where do we turn to know what’s really true?”

Though some of Romney’s aides say he is unlikely to take sides in the 2016 Republican primary, the Romneys clearly feel a strong connection with Ryan, who got to know many of the Romney financiers as he helped raise money for the campaign last fall as the vice presidential nominee. Some of Romney’s supporters also remain convinced that Christie’s decision to appear with Obama and praise his performance after Superstorm Sandy hurt Romney at the polls in November.

Advertisement

Ann Romney told CBS that there were no hard feelings toward Christie -- “It’s all good” -- and called him a “great guy,” but she also indicated warm feelings toward the Wisconsin congressman.

“Mitt and I are partial to Paul Ryan, but we don’t even know if he’s going to run,” she said.

Some Romney donors will get a chance to take Ryan’s measure in this new phase — and assess his shooting skills — next week, so long as they’re not busy with Paul, Christie or Hickenlooper at the other “enthusiast” events.

The six-member commission is evenly divided between the two parties, but the Republican vice chairman, Donald McGahn, has spent his tenure as a partisan obstructionist, adroitly engineering 3-to-3 standoff votes to block penalties and other recommendations by staff investigators who uncover abuses by big-money campaigners.

Now Mr. McGahn aims to take advantage of a temporary Democratic vacancy and 3-to-2 Republican edge to push through rules that would make total lackeys of commission staff members by blocking them from the usual sharing of information with the Justice Department and other agencies. In his partisan cunning, Mr. McGahn would even bar them from looking into possible violations publicly reported in news media and on the Internet.

It is critically important when the commission meets next week that this attempt to gut investigative procedures be kept off the agenda until a full, six-member panel is in place. Two nominees — to fill the vacancy and to replace Mr. McGahn, whose term is up — await approval in the Senate. Washington’s major watchdog groups have said that the McGahn proposal would gravely undermine campaign law and that the issue is of such importance that it should be taken up only by a full panel.

Predictably, Mr. McGahn is muddying things by suggesting darkly that F.E.C. staff members may have conspired with the Internal Revenue Service in its investigation into right-wing political groups seeking tax exemption. There is no evidence that they did, but that has not deterred Darrell Issa, the chairman of the House oversight committee, from lending loud support to Mr. McGahn’s crusade."

Inauguration morning may have looked good on TV. The pomp, the crowds, the soaring rhetoric, the patriotic songs.

In real life, it involved rising before dawn to navigate barricaded streets with confused crowds given faulty directions by clueless volunteers and out-of-town police. I wound up so far back in the National Mall crowd I could barely hear or see.

I had barely defrosted from the Inaugural Parade — a two-hour wait for a 10-second glimpse of the commander-in-chief — when it was time to set out for the Inaugural Ball.

That too was not what you might think.

Barricades and checkpoints made it a three-mile walk from my hotel — in heels, at 26 degrees — to the Convention Center. There was no orchestra, no gourmet food, no carpet or chandeliers. Just a concrete cavern where 30,000 people in fancy clothes munched on pretzels and corn nuts, and waited in long lines for tickets to buy $10 mixed drinks.

If you timed it right and were situated to see over the crowd and sea of cellphone cameras, you might have been able to catch the First Couple’s dance on the fuzzy ballroom Jumbotron.

But at least I knew enough to prepare better this time around.

Four years ago, I braved the cold in a strapless dress, open-toed shoes and a shawl that covered my shoulders. I nearly froze waiting in line with the mink-coated ladies for cabs that ran out before my turn came.

This time, I wore a big coat, suede boots and a knit cap so warm that I didn’t mind that it made a mess of my hair.

I guess I shouldn’t have been surprised by this year’s proletariat style. There was a fairy-tale dimension to the celebration last time. But nothing is as magical the second time around.

Four years ago, there were almost 2 million people celebrating Barack Obama’s inauguration on the National Mall.

This time, the crowd was less than half that size. Beyoncé seemed to get the biggest applause. The president hadn’t even finished his speech before folks began streaming out.

Last time, there were dozens of “official” balls, with lavish buffets and photo stands where guests could pose for keepsakes in front of the presidential seal. The crowd was heavy with big names, big donors and politicos. It had the feel of a grown-up senior prom.

By comparison, Monday night’s bash made a mockery of the whole ball concept. Call it a reception, maybe. Or an open house. It had the vibe — with a DJ blaring Michael Jackson songs — of a high-spirited stadium concert.

But the crowd didn’t seem to mind.

I met an old black woman in a wheelchair, who shared her memories of the March on Washington from 50 years ago. And a multi-generational family from Ecuador, mom trying to keep tabs on her restless son while translating our chat for grandma.

When the music was good, I made my way through throngs of gay revelers celebrating on the dance floor. A lesbian couple drew me into their group, and a giddy young woman in froufrou pink planted a kiss on my cheek.

I could analyze the inaugural events for signs of how time has passed and how things have changed.

But the moment that struck and stays with me is simple and devoid of political import:

I’m shivering with the crowd on the National Mall, peering at the jumbo screen. We’ve dutifully applauded the procession of politicians and dignitaries.

Then Malia and Sasha appear, click-clacking down the Capitol stairs, eyes on their feet so they don’t trip. Cheers rise and I hear scattered calls:

“The girls!” from the elderly women next to me. “The girls!” from the flag-waving troupe of pre-teens aiming cellphones at the jumbo screen.

The girls. It’s what I’ve always called my daughters — and still do, though the youngest of the three is now 22. It’s a phrase that freezes them in place, binds sisters into a unit.

The Obama daughters are clearly outgrowing the shorthand.

Sasha is no longer the little kid who clings to Daddy when she’s tired; she’s a wisecracking 11-year-old with a budding sense of style. And Malia has finessed the awkward passage into adolescence, fashion-model pretty at 14, with her mother’s presence and her father’s smile.

We’re watching them grow up in the White House; and for all the trappings of privilege, they seem so ordinary, so natural, so unimpressed with it all.

Advertisement

The girls found the week’s festivities, at times, as boring as I did. They diddled with their cellphones, made faces into their cameras. Malia texted. Sasha yawned.

They could have been my daughters, or yours. We’ve embraced them as ours. They connect us to this president in a way that can’t be measured by politics or experienced at a ball.

Advertisement

The learning curve of a president is not much different, in some ways, from the learning curve of a father. Teenagers can be as intractable as John Boehner or Mitch McConnell.

Obama lamented to reporters this month that his daughters aren’t so keen anymore about having him around. I felt a twinge of sympathy; there are limits to his power.

USA TODAY

Most contributions to candidates for Virginia governor come from out-of-state sources

Outside groups are testing tactics in the state%2C which will be a key battleground in 2016 races

Groups backing McAuliffe%27s candidacy are among the biggest outside spenders in the race

A group backed by the Koch brothers has organized hundreds of activists to knock on doors to turn out conservative-leaning voters. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is running ads about the toll of gun violence. And a California billionaire worried about climate change has even hired an impersonator to taunt the Republican nominee.

Welcome to the Virginia governor's race, where outside groups are flooding the airwaves and bombarding voters' homes with mailers and phone calls both to shape the outcome of next week's contest between Republican Ken Cuccinelli and Democrat Terry McAuliffe and to test their campaign tactics ahead of 2016 in a presidential battleground state.

""Virginia in 2013 is a good incubator,"" said Dave Schwartz, Virginia state director of Americans for Prosperity, a non-profit group supported by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch. Its affiliated foundation has undertaken a massive voter-canvassing operation ahead of the election, tapping about 1,600 activists to make phone calls and go door-to-door in the last month alone to encourage Virginians who typically vote in presidential contests to show up next Tuesday.

The group plans to reach 125,000 voters by Election Day. ""We want to test our capabilities,"" said Schwartz, whose organization is pushing a small-government agenda at the federal and state level. ""We want to see what works and what doesn't.""

Abortion-rights groups, environmentalists, gun-control advocates and the National Rifle Association all have jumped into the battle, one of two governorships to be decided next week. Virginia also is one of a handful of states where individuals, unions and corporations can donate unlimited amounts directly to candidates. McAuliffe has pulled in more than $34 million, while Cuccinelli has raised nearly $20 million.

The stakes are high in the Old Dominion, a swing state won by President Obama in both his campaigns. In 2008, he was the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry the state in more than four decades. In every race since 1977, however, the president's party has lost the state's governorship.

McAuliffe, a former Democratic National Committee chairman, hopes to end that streak, and recent polls give him the advantage over Cuccinelli, the state's attorney general, who has drawn support from religious conservatives and Tea Party activists for his staunchly conservative views. He was the first state attorney general to file suit against Obama's 2010 health care law, and he has expressed skepticism about climate change.

With New Jersey's Republican Gov. Chris Christie expected to cruise to re-election in the other gubernatorial race next week, ""the only game in town is Virginia,"" Robert Roberts, a political scientist at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Va. ""Clearly, both parties want to win this race terribly badly.""

Obama will appear with McAuliffe at a get-out-the-vote rally Sunday in Northern Virginia. The husband-and-wife team of former president Bill Clinton and former secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, a potential 2016 presidential contender herself, also has stumped for the Democrat. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican, and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., hit the trail for Cuccinelli this week.

Major out-of-state donors

Out-of-state money dominates the race.

Seventy-two percent of McAuliffe's campaign funds through Sept. 30 came from outside Virginia, according to an analysis by the Virginia Public Access Project, a non-partisan group that tracks political money. Cuccinelli relied on out-of-state donors for 64% of his haul during the same period.

Groups backing McAuliffe's candidacy are among the biggest outside spenders in the race. They include NextGen Climate Action, a political action committee founded by California billionaire Tom Steyer, that has spent more than $2.4 million to run independent commercials slamming Cuccinelli in the state's largest television markets.

Steyer, a prominent Democratic fundraiser and environmental activist, also has employed guerrilla tactics in the race, underwriting billboards questioning an energy company's donation to the Republican's campaign and hiring a Cuccinelli impersonator. He also has worked behind the scenes, helping support a group of landowners from southwestern Virginia who have battled two energy companies over royalties from natural gas removed from coal seams beneath their land.

The landowners have urged Cuccinelli to return campaign contributions he received from the parent company of one of the firms.

""Our efforts have sent the message that if you are anti-climate science — or choose to side with an out-of-state fossil fuel company against your state's own people — you will be held accountable,"" Steyer said in a statement about the race.

Other groups spending heavily include the Independence USA PAC, funded by New York City's billionaire Mayor Michael Bloomberg to promote his gun-control message. The PAC, which began advertising last week, already has spent more than six times the amount of the NRA, according to the Virginia Political Access Project's tally of spending in the state's four largest television markets.

Each candidate said the other would be beholden to out-of-state interests.

""Liberals like Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer ... are counting on (McAuliffe) to impose a big-government, radical agenda on Virginia,"" Cuccinelli spokeswoman Anna Nix said.

McAuliffe spokesman Josh Schwerin said McAuliffe is backed by a ""bipartisan coalition"" that knows ""he will focus on mainstream issues, which is a big difference from the divisive ideological crusades that have defined Cuccinelli's time"" in office.

Democratic groups weighing in

Groups affiliated with the Democratic candidates and causes are spending more heavily to influence the governor's race because they ""have a lot to fear from a unified Republican government,"" said Daniel Palazzolo, a political scientist at the University of Richmond. Republicans currently have a large, veto-proof majority in the state's House of Delegates, and no one expects control of the chamber to flip to Democrats.

""The gun folks don't have to worry about Terry McAuliffe coming in and passing any gun-control legislation,"" Palazzolo said. ""It won't get through the House of Delegates.""

A third candidate in the race, Libertarian Robert Sarvis, has raised less than $200,000, but he's also getting some last-minute outside help for his candidacy.

The Purple PAC, which describes itself as backing candidates who are ""red"" on fiscal policy and ""blue"" on social issues, plans to spend between $300,000 and $500,000 on a commercial that paints Sarvis as a better alternative to either McAuliffe or Cuccinelli."

In A Three-Decade Career At The Washington Post', 'Robinson Has Been City Hall Reporter', 'City Editor', 'Foreign Correspondent In Buenos Aires', 'London']",Eugene Robinson: The GOP is too juvenile to govern,"With budgetary tantrums in the Senate and investigative play-acting in the House, the Republican Party is proving once again that it simply cannot be taken seriously.

This is a shame. I don’t share the GOP’s philosophy, but I do believe that competition makes both of our major parties smarter. I also believe that a big, complicated country facing economic and geopolitical challenges needs a government able to govern.

What we don’t need is the steady diet of obstruction, diversion and gamesmanship that Republicans are trying to ram down the nation’s throat. It’s not as if President Obama and the Democrats are doing everything right. It’s just that the GOP shrinks from doing anything meaningful at all.

The most glaring example, at the moment, is in the Senate. For four years, Republican senators lambasted their Democratic colleagues — with justification — for not approving a budget, one of the basic tasks of governance. Sen. John Cornyn(R-Tex.), and others regularly took to the Senate floor to announce the number of days since the body last produced a spending plan and to blast Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) for this shocking failure.

Two months ago, Reid and the Democrats finally passed a budget. Since the House has already passed its version — the controversial plan authored by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) — the next step should be for both chambers to appoint members of a conference committee that would iron out the differences. But Republicans won’t let this happen.

Specifically, far-right conservatives including Ted Cruz of Texas, Marco Rubio of Florida, Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky are refusing to allow the Senate to appoint its representatives to the conference. Yes, having demanded this budget for four years, Republicans are now refusing to let it go forward.

Some Republicans, that is. Establishment types such as John McCain of Arizona are apoplectic at the antics of their tea party-inspired colleagues, which McCain called “absolutely out of line and unprecedented.”

Cruz and the others are worried that a conference committee might not only work out a budget but also make it possible to raise the federal debt ceiling without the now-customary showdown threatening default and catastrophe. They believe that brinkmanship is the only way to stop runaway government spending, which produces massive trillion-dollar deficits, which add to the ballooning national debt, which . . .

Hold on, senator. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the deficit is shrinking rapidly and will fall to $642 billion this fiscal year. That’s still substantial, but it’s less than half the deficit our government ran in 2011. More important, if annual deficits continue to decline as the CBO predicts, the long-term debt problem begins to look more manageable. That’s good news, right?

What Republicans ought to do is declare a victory for fiscal conservatism and move on to the battle to have their priorities reflected in the budget — a promising fight, since the conferees appointed by the GOP-controlled House are hardly going to be flaming liberals. Instead, the party seeks not consensus but crisis.

This is no way for a 2-year-old to act, much less the self-proclaimed “world’s greatest deliberative body.”

And speaking of juvenile behavior, I would be remiss not to mention how Rep. Darrell Issa of California and his GOP colleagues in the House are embarrassing themselves by straining to turn Obama administration missteps into Watergate-style scandals.

The deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, resulted from a security lapse of the kind that every recent administration, unfortunately, has suffered. Since future administrations will have lapses as well, congressional oversight could be useful in at least making sure the specific mistakes of Benghazi are not repeated. But instead, House Republicans summon the television cameras and ask round after round of tendentious questions — without paying the slightest attention to the answers.

Similarly, on the question of how and why the IRS gave added scrutiny to conservative “social welfare” groups seeking nonprofit status, House inquisitors seem barely interested in what actually happened. “What did the president know and when did he know it?” was an appropriate question. But the follow-up — “Harrumph, well then, why didn’t he know sooner?” — isn’t much in the way of scandal material.

And concerning the Justice Department’s overzealous crusade to thwart classified leaks — and investigative reporting — it is amusing to watch House Republicans twist themselves into champions of the hated Lamestream Media. Who knew?

None of this is boosting the GOP’s poll numbers. I’ve got an idea: Why don’t they try doing the people’s business for a change?

With some policy differences at the margins, the four top candidates have all promised to improve neighborhood services, hire more police officers and streamline city government to help private industry create jobs.

Many of the several dozen candidate forums ahead of Tuesday’s vote have focused on improving the city’s infrastructure, hardly a rallying cry to inflame voters.

“So much of what’s being discussed gets perceived as ‘same old stuff,’” said Mark Larson, talk show host on KCBQ-AM (1170). “People are talking more about Obamacare than the mayor’s race.”

The name of Filner, if uttered at all, is said with a sneer.

“Bob Filner was a dead-end for this city,” said Councilman Kevin Faulconer, the only Republican among the four top candidates.

Councilman David Alvarez, one of three major Democratic candidates in the race, prefers not to use Filner’s name at all, instead referring to unfinished business at City Hall left by “the last mayor.”

If Filner, who resigned Aug. 30 and now awaits a Dec. 9 sentencing on sex harassment charges, hopes to repair history’s judgment on his brief, chaotic tenure as mayor, the time has not yet arrived.

“The final legacy of the Filner fiasco is that his personal peccadilloes cost the city millions in unnecessary electoral and litigation expenses and, worse, months of leadership and forward movement on a host of pressing issues,” said Carl Luna, political science professor at San Diego Mesa College.

Another aspect of the Filner legacy may be one he never intended: that his resignation gives the Republican Party a chance to reclaim the mayor’s job despite the fact that registration is trending toward Democrats and independents.

At last count, 40.2% of voters are Democrats, 27.7% independents and 27% Republicans.

When Filner was elected a year ago as the city’s first Democratic mayor in two decades, turnout was nearly 80%. But for this week’s election, the county registrar is predicting a 50% turnout.

Filner’s resignation may prove to be “a speed bump on the road to a more purple — and eventually blue — San Diego,” Luna said.

Based on requests for absentee ballots, the Democratic turnout, particularly in blue-collar neighborhoods south of Interstate 8, is lagging, according to a local think tank, the National University System Institute for Policy Research.

“Unlike November 2012, voter turnout has been low and concentrated in only a handful of neighborhoods,” said Vince Vasquez, senior policy analyst at the institute and author of the report.

The strategy of GOP and business community heavyweights to rally around one candidate — and discourage former Councilman Carl DeMaio from entering the race — appears to be working. At an invitation-only gathering in La Jolla after Filner’s resignation, the group decided on Faulconer.

Advertisement

Polls now suggest that Faulconer is the only candidate with even an outside chance of winning enough votes to avoid a runoff.

In the drive toward election day, former Assemblyman Nathan Fletcher had tried to gain advantage by portraying Faulconer as the candidate of an entrenched power structure.

“I didn’t need a group of insiders and status-quo folks to anoint me and tell me I could run,” Fletcher said to Faulconer during a roundtable discussion among major candidates on KUSI-TV.

Alvarez and Fletcher are jousting for the second spot and a runoff with Faulconer early next year. Each has the endorsement of a collection of party notables and labor unions.

Advertisement

Fletcher finished third in last year’s mayoral primary behind Filner and DeMaio. At the time, he was an independent, having dumped the Republican Party. Now he’s a Democrat.

“As we go through life, we change positions,” Fletcher said during the roundtable, attempting to explain his party shifting.

Faulconer, 46, in his second term representing a beach district, was a close ally of former Mayor Jerry Sanders. Support from Sanders and the editorial page of the U-T San Diego newspaper is key to his campaign.

Fletcher, 36, who served in Iraq as an enlisted Marine, is now an executive at Qualcomm, whose co-founder, Irwin Jacobs, is a major supporter. Alvarez, 33, in his first term representing a district south of Interstate 8, is backed by labor unions and the Sierra Club.

Advertisement

Former City Atty. Michael Aguirre, 64, the third Democrat among the major candidates, is endorsed by the newspaper La Prensa. He refers to his opponents as “fine young men” but decries a political system that requires them to seek endorsements and contributions from groups such as labor unions with issues pending at City Hall.

Aguirre has attempted to shift the discussion to the city’s pension payments, which he warns will leave little money to improve neighborhood services.

The other candidates have shown little interest in dwelling on the pension issue that dominated city politics for nearly a decade and sparked media-fanned public anger aimed at city employees and their labor unions. The issue now seems to have lost its resonance with voters.

“I think, after Filner, people are looking for a little less drama,” political consultant John Kern said.

He attended a pre-inaugural party with Democrats from Iowa, the first caucus state, and invited the governor of New Hampshire, the first primary state, to his private swearing-in ceremony. In two other likely early primary states, he will address the Democratic State Convention in South Carolina next month and appear at a testimonial for the retiring Senator Carl Levin in Michigan. He is enlisting candidates and collecting money for midterm elections.

“He is already generating lots of good will among House Democrats and Democratic candidates across the country,” said Representative Steve Israel of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “He is diving into races. He is making recruiting calls. He is fund-raising. He is firing up our core supporters across the country.”

Aides said Mr. Biden would do those things regardless of his own ambitions. And the preliminary moves do not address the more fundamental challenge: How would he run against Mrs. Clinton, who seemed to be Mr. Obama’s anointed heir in a joint interview they gave to the CBS program “60 Minutes” earlier this year? Mr. Biden would not have exclusive claim to the Obama legacy and, like any vice president, he would need to distinguish himself from the departing president. He could run to the left of her, emphasizing a more populist approach. Or he could run as the insurance policy in case she does not run or if she falters.

It is not clear that a presidential campaign makes sense for Mr. Biden, who would turn 74 shortly after the 2016 general election and 82 before the end of a second term.

But it is in his interest to keep the option open as long as possible to maintain his influence and to see what Mrs. Clinton decides to do. The moment Mr. Biden declares he will not run, he becomes a lame-duck No. 2 in a lame-duck administration."

The more the public gets to know Hagel, the less they like him. Over the course of a month, as public awareness increased, Hagel’s favorables increased a mere four points, from 18 to 22, while his unfavorables jumped from 17 to 28 points.

The pressure isn’t letting up, either. Today, Senator Lindsey Grahem sent a letter to Hagel asking for clarification on another round of controversial comments supposedly attached to the nominee:

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) sent a letter to Chuck Hagel today, asking whether he had made the reported comments (or anything like them) that “Israel has violated every UN resolution since 1967, that Israel has violated its agreements with the quartet, that it was risking becoming an apartheid state if it didn’t allow the Palestinians to form a state, … that the settlements were getting close to the point where a contiguous Palestinian state would be impossible … that Netanyahu was a radical … [and] that Hamas has to be brought in to any peace negotiation.” Moreover, Graham by no means has given up on seeking the financial information Hagel so far has refused to provide.

There’s another development today in the great state of Nebraska. The University of Nebraska-Omaha is refusing to release Senator Hagel’s archives to the media. According to the Weekly Standard, Hagel stands by the university’s decision to keep sealed thousands of his papers, audio, video and transcripts of speeches:

Chuck Hagel’s record in the Senate is well documented in the public domain,” says Hagel spokesman Marie Harf in an emailed statement.

“Given his extraordinary disclosures to date, which surpass the threshold applied to nominees, there is no need to make this archived material public.”

The archives are not open to the public, university officials say, because not everything there has been processed.

However, the university has also said that with Hagel’s permission, they would grant the Weekly Standard’s Daniel Halper access to the archive.

Thus far, Hagel is refusing that permission.

Democrats try to lump GOP candidates under Tea Party banner

The movement began by focusing on economic and tax issues%2C not social issues

Republicans say they should focus on their common ground%2C not labels

The failure of Tea Party-backed candidates in Tuesday's election shows that Democrats have been successful in making the Tea Party label a negative for Republicans, even if it isn't always clear what being a Tea Party candidate means.

Exit polls in Virginia, where Republican Ken Cucinelli lost to Democrat Terry McAuliffe, show 42% of voters had a negative opinion of the Tea Party movement. Those voters went overwhelmingly for McAuliffe. A Tea Party-affiliated Republican in Alabama, Dean Young, lost a congressional primary against Bradley Byrne, who was backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business interests. In New Jersey, voters re-elected Republican Gov. Chris Christie by a landslide while expressing dislike of both the Republican Party (57%) and the Tea Party movement (45%), exit polls show.

Democrats touted those results in a conference call Wednesday. ""The Republican brand and the Tea Party brand are one and the same and people do not like either,'' said Mo Elleithee, Democratic National Committee spokesman.""There is no distinction in the mind of voters.''

By emphasizing the Tea Party ties of social conservatives such as Cuccinelli, Young, and former Missouri congressman Todd Akin, Democrats are able to blur the distinction between the limited government/less spending origins of the Tea Party and the staunch opposition to gay marriage and abortion of Republican conservatives.

Democrats conflate the Tea Party and the GOP ""because they see that it hurts us,'' says Keli Carender, national grass-roots director of the Tea Party Patriots. ""Social issues are so hot button that it's easy for Democrats to make them the main point when they're talking about somebody.''

October's government shutdown was pushed by Tea Party leaders Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, but supported by a majority of congressional Republicans — further eroding the distinction between the Tea Party and the GOP.

Tea Party principles had been ""perverted'' by Republicans in Washington who ""use that theory just to try to enhance themselves politically,'' Christie, a critic of the shutdown, said this week on CNN. Republicans should have been emphasizing instead their success in cutting government spending through the sequester, which imposed automatic spending cuts, he said.

""The core of the Tea Party movement, as I understand it, I think is very consistent with good conservative Republicanism,'' Christie said in the CNN interview. ""But some of the stuff that's happened of late down in Washington I think is not even consistent with what a lot of the real folks who started the Tea Party movement would agree with.''

The Tea Party is blurry by definition because it's a movement, not a party, says Adam Brandon of the Tea Party group Freedom Works. ""The Tea Party is an easy punching bag ... from the left and it's a punching bag from the right. There's no one out there really defending it,'' he says. ""It's too easy to fall into a situation where if you're a challenger you're automatically a Tea Party candidate, (or) if you're not handpicked by the establishment you're a Tea Party candidate.''

What works instead, Brandon says, is for Republicans to avoid labels and talk about cutting spending and taxes, the Tea Party's core issues. ""Even if people have a negative view of the Tea Party, they have a positive view of all these issues we're talking about.''

Rob Collins, chief strategist for the Senate GOP's 2014 campaign operation, said Democrats' focus on GOP divisions is overstated. ""It's not so much an ideological rift, it's more of a tactical rift. Strategically, we all want the same thing,"" he told reporters this week.

But Collins acknowledged that the GOP is facing pressure not only from grass-roots activists and outside groups that are attempting to harness them, but also increasingly from its mainstream constituencies such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the business lobby .

""There's a whole lot of folks out there that are Tea Party and then there's — call them what you want — the elites, the D.C.-based leaders of folks … and those are different creatures,"" Collins said. ""In order for us to win in the fall and also elect the right candidate, we need the Tea Party, we need the business crowd, we need everybody pulling on the same oar.""

That may not happen, Carender says. If voters now see little distinction between Republicans and Tea Partiers, they should wait until 2014 when the conflict between establishment GOP and grass-roots-backed candidates will make the distinctions clear, she says. ""There's going to be some serious primary battles going on.''

A late night meeting attended by nearly every senator failed to produce an agreement to resolve the dispute.

After the hours-long session, Democratic Senate leaders reaffirmed that a key vote on the issue was scheduled for Tuesday morning.

Earlier Monday, Reid issued his ultimatum during a speech to the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress.

At issue is the Senate's own rulebook, which to lawmakers is a very serious topic. Reid is threatening to flout the normal process in order to change the rules so that key presidential nominees can be confirmed with just 51 votes -- as opposed to 60.In short, the move would curb the minority party's ability to filibuster nominees.

Despite virulent protests by Republicans, Reid called the move ""a minor change, no big deal.""

Republicans don't see it that way, and reminded Reid that he and other Democrats warned about doing such a thing when they were in the minority.

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said Reid's threatened action would ""change the core of the Senate."" He said it would fundamentally deny senators their right to question potential officials.

Republicans have delayed or blocked presidential nominees by using their filibuster powers, which allow 41 senators to block actions in the 100-member chamber.

Reid has teed up a test vote on several nominees for Tuesday, and now says that Republicans must confirm all seven to avoid a confrontation over what is dubbed the ""nuclear option.""

Among them are nominees to the National Labor Relations Board. Obama originally appointed them when he said the Senate was in recess -- but an appeals court ruled that Obama exceeded his authority, and Republicans likewise describe the appointments as illegitimate.

The roster also includes EPA Administrator nominee Gina McCarthy and Richard Cordray, nominee to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created as part of Wall Street overhaul legislation that was opposed by the GOP. Many Republican senators say they will not confirm anyone to the consumer post unless the bureau's leadership structure is changed.

A GOP agreement to confirm the seven nominees would defuse the tension and allow the Senate to return to normal business, Reid said.

Senate Republicans and at least one Democrat, Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, strongly oppose his proposed rules change.

All 100 senators were invited to the Monday night meeting in the Old Senate Chamber. Senators drifting in and out told reporters it was a ""very good discussion"" and the ""most bipartisan discussion in a long time.""

White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough met with Reid's chief of staff ahead of the meeting.

Some senators, including Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., are floating possible compromises but there is no indication yet that Reid is ready to accept. It's also not clear whether Reid would have the votes to pursue the rule change.

""The power of an extreme minority"" threatens the Senate's integrity, and forces him to act, Reid said Monday. He acknowledged that future Republican presidents were likely to benefit from the proposed rule change.

The proposed change would not end filibusters for legislation or judicial nominees. But some senators say a limited rule change now could open the gate for much deeper changes in the years ahead.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday that Obama ""supports Harry Reid and is appreciative of the support Harry Reid has given to his nominees.""

Carney, asked if Obama worried that the Senate could become even more dysfunctional if rules are changed, said: ""Well, it boggles the mind how they would achieve that.""

While it may be tempting to interpret these numbers as proof that a notable swath of Democratic voters are so passionate about Bill Thompson that they want him to be the nominee no matter what, that theory seems debunked by the fact that he has not been a frontrunner in polls that have included all of the primary candidates. Instead he miraculously vaults to the front of the pack when voters are forced to contemplate a Weiner or Quinn mayoralty.

Among likely Democratic voters, de Blasio took 30 percent of the vote, followed by City Council Speaker Christine Quinn at 24 percent, former comptroller Bill Thompson at 22 percent, former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) at 10 percent, comptroller John Liu at 6 percent and former council member Sal Albanese at 1 percent. Another 7 percent was undecided.

De Blasio also held the lead in three potential runoff scenarios, beating Quinn by 54 percent to 38 percent, Thompson by 50 percent to 40 percent, and Weiner by a whopping 72 percent to 22 percent.

But voters' choices are hardly set in stone: 34 percent, including 37 percent who backed de Blasio, said there was a good chance they'd change their minds.

While there was little evidence of a gender gap among voters, there was a ""measurable racial divide,"" according to the poll. Thompson led among black voters, with 39 percent, followed by de Blasio and Quinn. Among white voters, de Blasio led with 39 percent, followed by Quinn and then Thompson.

De Blasio's 30 percent is the greatest share of the vote any candidate has attracted so far in polling on the race. In the weeks since Weiner's numbers dropped after new revelations of his inappropriate behavior, most surveys have shown Quinn leading the field, although generally with support in the mid-20s, far below the 40 percent threshold needed to avoid a runoff.

But as shown by HuffPost Pollster's chart, which includes all publicly available polling, de Blasio and Thompson's numbers have also risen.

De Blasio's campaign, until recently mired in the middle of the pack, has been buoyed by improving numbers and a front-page New York Times story.

""I always had faith…when people start to focus, a real progressive impulse was going to come out in the New York City electorate,” de Blasio told Politicker in July, after an earlier poll found him gaining.

De Blasio attracted 40 percent of the city's ""very liberal"" voters in Tuesday's poll. He has sought to present himself as the campaign's most progressive candidate, as HuffPost's Michael McLaughlin reported Sunday:

For months, de Blasio stumped with bread-and-butter proposals to aid the poor and working class. He appealed to the middle class with a liberal agenda promoting green technology, equality for women in the workplace, and job growth in the tech and entertainment industries. Now, it seemed, his message was breaking through....His campaign rests on the idea that New York is ""a tale of two cities,"" divided between the haves and have-nots. Almost half of the city's population lived in or near poverty in 2011 -- a statistic that de Blasio frequently mentions. The villain in his story is none other than billionaire New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The pre-K tax is perhaps the centerpiece of his platform to alleviate economic and racial disparities. But de Blasio, the city's public advocate since 2009, also wants to build affordable housing, rescue hospitals on the verge of closing and reform the police department's controversial stop-and-frisk program.

A judge ruled Monday that the NYPD's use of the stop-and-frisk tactic violated the rights of thousands of New Yorkers.

Sixty percent of likely Democratic voters view the stop-and-frisk program as excessive, while 31 percent find it acceptable, according to Tuesday's poll.

The Quinnipiac poll surveyed 579 likely primary voters by phone between Aug. 7 and 12.

http://news.yahoo.com/high-powered-traveling-companions-air-force-one-213718204--politics.html,,[],High-powered traveling companions on Air Force One,"ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) — As Air Force One made its way from Washington to Johannesburg Monday, a president, a former president and a possible future president were all traveling aboard.

The high-powered traveling partners came together for a transcontinental trip to South Africa for a memorial service honoring Nelson Mandela, the former South African leader who died last week at the age of 95. The unusual manifest required some creative seating arrangements on the presidential plane.

Obama and Michelle Obama occupied the president's stateroom at the front of the plane. Former President George W. Bush and wife Laura were settled nearby in the plane's medical suite, which can function as an operating room. And former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton — a potential candidate for president in 2016 — was given a spot in a cabin normally occupied by senior staff.

The plane's spacious conference room served as a gathering spot for the former president and three first ladies, with the current commander-in-chief popping in between in-flight meetings and calls. And there was no shortage of time for catching up. The flight from Washington to Johannesburg was scheduled to span about 16 hours, including a one-hour refueling stop in Dakar, Senegal.

""It's a very, I think, enjoyable experience certainly for the president and first lady,"" said White House spokesman Jay Carney. ""And they're both grateful to be able to have former president and first lady, former secretary of state on board.""

For Bush, the flight marked the first time he had stepped foot on Air Force One since leaving the presidency nearly five years ago. He and the former first lady were already on board the plane in Washington when Obama arrived, skipping an on-camera greeting with the current president and first lady.

Bush has purposely tried to stay out of the public eye since leaving office. But he wandered back to the plane's press cabin for two lengthy off-the-record conversations with reporters, returning the second time with Laura Bush in tow.

Story continues

Clinton is no stranger to the presidential plane, having traveled aboard Air Force One frequently as both first lady and secretary of state. And many Democrats have visions of her making many more trips aboard the plane, though they hope she'll be the one occupying the front cabin.

The White House invited all of the living American presidents to travel to South Africa on Air Force One. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter were instead traveling on their own, while 89-year-old George H.W. Bush was unable to attend the memorial because he can no longer travel far distances.

Pew/Stateline Staff Writer

Perception of loss of local democratic rights creates tension

Only 25%25 of Detroit%27s registered voters turned out for last municipal election

Role of newly elected Mayor Mike Duggan remains murky

DETROIT — On Jan. 1, Detroit will swear in its first white mayor in 40 years. Usually that would be a significant turn in a city where eight of 10 residents are black. But the milestone will be diminished by the reality that this city is the largest in America where elected officials do not run their own government.

A Washington, D.C., lawyer, Kevyn Orr, is managing the day-to-day operations of the Detroit government for now and into the new year instead of Mayor-elect Mike Duggan and the Detroit City Council. Orr answers to Republican Gov. Rick Snyder, who in March appointed him as an ""emergency manager"" to steer the city through an unprecedented bankruptcy.

Michigan's election-year intervention in Detroit points up a collateral effect of a state takeover: the loss of control by a government's leaders whom residents elected to deliver their services. Nineteen states have enacted laws allowing the state government to step in and help a financially distressed city, but only a handful are as aggressive as Michigan, which has taken over seven cities and three school districts since 2007.

The perceived trampling of democratic rights often creates tension between the state and city, which disillusions many residents in places such as Detroit. The current mayor, Dave Bing, and five of nine city council members did not seek re-election Nov. 5, when 25% of registered voters came out for the municipal election.

""I feel like we have lost our democracy,"" said Gail Craig, 57, of Detroit, a General Motors consultant. ""I know a lot of people who said they weren't voting in the election because they said it wouldn't matter anyway.""

Darlene Jackson, 58, a Detroit native laid off from a city job, said, ""Now that we've elected a mayor, there's no need for an emergency manager.""

Snyder has said the emergency manager will probably be in charge at least until next fall as the city works its way through the bankruptcy, which was filed in July but is awaiting a ruling from a federal judge on whether it can proceed. The city, whose annual general fund budget is about $1.1 billion, has $18 billion in public pension and bond debt.

Mayor's role

What role Duggan will play in the coming year will be watched closely in Michigan, where Detroit's future is tied to the state's own efforts to re-invent itself after years of decline.

Under Michigan law, the emergency manager has broad powers to act in place of the mayor and council, but the manager can assign tasks to elected officials if he chooses. Some managers have done that in other Michigan cities, but the law was primarily designed to hold the manager accountable for repairing a city's finances.

Duggan, a former county prosecutor and medical center executive, captured 55 percent of the vote in the nonpartisan election. Coming off that momentum, Duggan has talked to Orr, Snyder and state lawmakers to persuade them to give him a role in city operations. Orr, a bankruptcy lawyer, is a former classmate of Duggan's at the University of Michigan law school.

A Democrat who opposed appointing the emergency manager, Duggan is asking Snyder, a Republican up for re-election next year, to honor the mandate voters gave him to help fix their city. The governor's sometimes frosty relations with Bing and the current council have not improved since the election; city officials said Nov. 13 they were insulted at the state's offer of only $5 million in aid to restructure the government.

Yet Snyder is eager to show progress in resolving the city's crisis before next year's election. ""What I'd like to do is have a strong good working relationship with the mayor-elect and see how we can work together,"" Snyder said. ""I'm very open to having a process where hopefully he can participate in the operations of the city. That's for the emergency manager and him to work out, hopefully.""

Terry Stanton, a spokesman for the state department of treasury, said Snyder is committed to working with Duggan to complete Detroit's comeback. ""It would not, however, be prudent to speculate on the specifics of that collaboration at this time,"" he said.

Historic perspective

Detroit is not the first city in Michigan or elsewhere in which elected officials have clashed with their state overseers. Pontiac's leaders also resisted a state takeover in 2009, and Flint re-elected its mayor in 2011 only to see him replaced with a state-appointed emergency manager. Allen Park unsuccessfully tried to avoid Snyder's emergency manager in 2012, saying it would harm the city's future.

Washington, D.C.'s mayor called Congress' 1995 decision to impose a financial control board on the nation's ailing capital ""the rape of democracy."" More recently, a lawyer for the city council of bankrupt Central Falls, R.I., compared the 2011 state takeover to the German occupation of Paris during World War II.

It is not just the loss of local decision-making that local officials resent. The state overseers—a manager, receiver or control board—usually cut budgets, eliminate jobs, reduce or restructure services, trim retirement benefits and raise taxes, none of which is popular.

Yet in city after city, residents opposed to the state takeover often admit it was necessary because their elected leaders would not take the politically difficult actions needed to balance spending and revenues.

""I didn't like the idea of an emergency manager, but it's obvious things wouldn't correct themselves on their own,"" said Jenise Verde, 48, a Blue Cross analyst in downtown Detroit. ""For a long time the people running the city haven't looked at what's going on in the full light of day. At some point, that blows up.""

Officials who have led relatively successful state takeovers stress the need to engage the community, including elected officials, city workers, labor unions and civic, business and religious leaders.

Michigan governors have twice named Joyce Parker an emergency manager in Ecorse (2009) and Allen Park (2012). She said in an interview that she eased the strain from budget and pay cuts in those communities in part through a series of meetings in which she explained the financial challenges the cities faced and the role of the emergency manager in resolving them. Small groups met over coffee; large groups gathered at town meetings.

""The key is educating the public, being transparent and keeping an open-door policy,"" she said. Did state officials tell her to adopt that tack? ""No. I was a city manager over 25 years,"" Parker said. ""It's common to do it that way to build consensus.""

The same transparency contributed to the quick resolution of the Central Falls bankruptcy, which lasted only 13 months, although the effects of budget and pension cuts and tax increases will linger for several years.

""For a bankruptcy to work there's really got to be negotiations,"" Theodore Orson, the attorney for Central Falls' receiver, said at a recent Bloomberg conference here on municipal finance. Officials leveraged the negotiations, he said, by stating clear goals: the state would not leave Central Falls until there was a plan to balance the budget for five years, and until the public pension and retiree health care systems were sustainable.

Unionized employees and retirees eventually accepted the benefit cuts once they realized the solvency of the pension system was at stake. Orson said, ""We had retirees who had been devastated by the cuts come up to us at the end and say, 'Thank you. This is the first time anyone's been honest with us about our pensions. Even though they will be slimmer, at least we know it's going to be there.'""

But just in case you do have some faint, slight, extremely modest interest in parlaying your landslide re-election into a presidential bid, here are four 2016 “don’ts” to keep in mind:

Don’t be Jon Huntsman. This sounds easy enough, but obvious pitfalls are still worth pointing out. For the next two years, you’re going to be hailed up and down the Acela Corridor as the Great Moderate Hope, the anti-Tea Party candidate, the Man Who Is Not Ted Cruz. But you can’t actively embrace that part, or give off the impression — as Huntsman did, obviously and fatally — that you agree with the media that your party’s full of rubes and cranks.

As a would-be nominee, you have to woo base voters, not run against them, and make them feel respected even when they disagree with you. This doesn’t mean muzzling yourself, or pandering to every right-wing interest group. But it means persuading conservatives that you like them, that you understand them and that as president you’re going to be (mostly) on their side.

Don’t be Rudy Giuliani. You probably think you wouldn’t have Rudy’s problems in a Republican primary. Yes, you’re both combative Northeasterners from the party’s moderate flank, but unlike the former mayor you aren’t a social liberal with a public history of adultery (and a few drag performances thrown in)."

The trio discussed their experiences as debate moderators during the last presidential campaign to panel moderator Marvin Kalb.

When asked by Kalb if she felt rattled by Twitter criticism of her performance, she said:

Twitter, as much as you might want to fight it, Marvin, it’s out there. There are voices out there that have influence. There are. I think for we as journalists, it’s a great journalistic tool. It is. You can find all sorts of stories. I had some strange press the day before that for about fifteen minutes rattled me. It did not affect me as a moderator. It affected me as a mom. My son’s on Twitter all the time. It’s the only way we can communicate. If he’s in the bedroom, it’s like, ‘Are you coming to dinner?’ And I tweet it. But I was worried, because there was such nasty stuff. And then my son was like, ‘Mom, do people..?’ I said, ‘You know there are some crazy people who write really mean things and don’t worry about them.’ She added that she she told him, ‘These people have three followers. Quit answering them. They all live in basements with 75 cats.’

Raddatz was asked later by Breitbart News during the Q & A, “You seemed to have gotten a lot of criticism during the vice presidential debate, allowing Joe Biden to just run all over you–the constant laughing, the interrupting of Paul Ryan, particularly when he was talking about an armed Iran or green energy. How can you say you had any control over that debate whatsoever?”

She responded:

Listen, I want to answer you fairly. I really do. You’re up there and you’re as fair as you can possibly be. I think that when we came out of that debate, Joe Biden had 45 seconds more than Congressman Ryan. I think Congressman Ryan felt it was fair. And that’s what I can say. I think Congressman Ryan afterwards could not have been nicer. Both of them were. And both of them thought it was fair.

However, Michael Steel, Paul Ryan’s Vice Presidential spokesman, told the Daily Caller after the debate that Raddatz did not moderate debate fairly at all. :

“I thought she obviously asserted herself more than [Jim] Lehrer did,” Steel said, referencing the moderator of the first presidential debate last week, according to Politico. “[B]ut there was still a great deal of crosstalk, there was still a great deal of difficulty making points in a reasonable and progressive fashion.”

Marvin Kalb began making a tweeting sound after Breitbart News asked her the question, referencing Raddatz’s previous remarks about criticisms she received on Twitter. However, Raddatz, did not just receive criticism for her debate moderator performance from people with 75 cats who live in basements and have three Twitter followers.

A number of right-of-center journalists were critical of her as well. The Washington Examiner‘s David Freddoso wrote, “Ryan is outnumbered here. It’s two against one.” National Review’s Katrina Trinko remarked, “Raddatz is totally being walked all over by Biden. She’s letting him get by with murder in time of talking.” Phil Klein, who works for the Washington Examiner, said, “Every time Biden starts interrupting Ryan, Martha Raddatz cuts Ryan off.” Fox News Contributor and Radio’s Laura Ingraham asked, “Why does Raddatz want to ‘move on’ when Ryan is getting traction?”

Finally, Fox News contributor Charles Krauthammer said of Raddatz, “I pay good money to see a fight, not the referee.”"

Rep.-elect Mark Sanford will be in court Thursday%2C accused of trespassing by his ex-wife

Sanford had prickly relations with GOP leadership when was previously in Congress

Democrats promise to make his ethical baggage a continued issue for the GOP

Republican Mark Sanford won South Carolina's congressional special election Tuesday, but the results may not conclude the drama of a disgraced former governor on the outs with his own party.

Sanford's quest for public and political redemption after an extramarital affair succeeded with voters Tuesday, who returned him to a congressional seat he left in 2001. Sanford will fill the seat vacated when Rep. Tim Scott was appointed to the U.S. Senate in January.

On Thursday, however, Sanford will appear in a televised court hearing to answer a charge of trespassing from his former wife. Then he'll head to Washington, where he made few friends during his previous three terms in office bucking the Republican leadership.

Sanford defeated Elizabeth Colbert Busch, despite her backing by national Democratic organizations and fundraising help from her brother, comedian Stephen Colbert.

The victory in what had been seen as a tight race means the district, centered on Charleston, ""is a safe Republican district … and Democrats have not a lot of hope going forward,"" says political scientist Danielle Vinson of Furman University in Greenville, S.C.

""I don't see him having a lot of trouble if he can just shut his mouth about his private life and stop making an enemy of his ex-wife."" If he can't, Vinson says, ""the frustration with being a national punch line is pretty high in that district.""

Sanford won nomination for the special election over a field of 16 Republicans, so there is no lack of potential primary challengers in 2014 should he continue to make embarrassing headlines.

During his previous terms in Congress, Sanford stuck to his fiscal hawk positions even when he clashed with Republican leaders.

""I don't suspect he'll be any better a colleague than he was 15 years ago,"" said Mark Tompkins, a political scientist at the University of South Carolina. ""He doesn't change those spots, but on the other hand, he'll vote for Republican leadership. The election … really does get him on the path to overcoming his current liabilities. And that's a big deal.""

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, congratulated Sanford on Twitter on Tuesday night on his victory, and Republicans said it proved the unpopularity of national Democrats.

Sanford was late-night-comic fodder in 2009 when he told staff he was hiking the Appalachian Trail and instead headed to Argentina to visit his mistress.

He paid a $70,000 ethics fine for spending public money on personal travel. He is now divorced and engaged to his Argentine girlfriend.

""The House Republican caucus has added yet another ethically challenged embarrassment who will be an albatross around the neck of every Republican forced to answer for Mark Sanford's embarrassing and reckless behavior,"" said House Majority PAC Executive Director Alixandria Lapp.

The PAC backed Colbert Busch with $450,000 in ad spending.

Rep. Steve Israel of New York, who runs the House Democratic campaign effort, said ""House Republicans' outreach to women voters now has Mark Sanford as the face.""

Democrats ""laid siege"" to the district because Charleston County, one of five in the district, voted for Obama, says county GOP Chair Joe Bustos. Sanford's win, ""is not a green light that future elections can be taken for granted at all.""

Sanford was initially favored to win the special election when he prevailed in the primary, but revelations that his ex-wife had filed a complaint alleging he trespassed at her home brought him a wave of bad publicity. The national Republican House campaign operation pulled its support, and polls suddenly showed Colbert Busch ahead by 9 percentage points before Sanford closed the gap.

Sanford campaigned with a cardboard cutout of House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and tried to tie Colbert Busch tightly to national Democrats. In the final week of the campaign, South Carolina's two senators endorsed him and Gov. Nikki Haley appeared at a fundraiser on his behalf. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a Tea Party favorite, also endorsed Sanford."

(Photo by Rob Kim/FilmMagic)

Bill de Blasio, the soon-to-be mayor of New York, surged to prominence over the summer while promising to reform the city’s police department.

He said he would scale back the rampant use of stop and frisk, the controversial practice of stopping suspects and frisking them for guns and drugs, which led to hundreds of thousands of arrests of mostly black and Latino New Yorkers on minor marijuana charges. And he vowed to dismiss the current police commissioner, Raymond Kelly, who made stop and frisk a keystone of his tenure and vigorously defended it in the press and in court to those who say that the way he has used it infringes on the rights of minorities.

But now de Blasio is considering a replacement for Kelly who has arguably done more than anyone else in the United States -- including Kelly himself -- to popularize the use of stop and frisk and other aggressive tactics associated with racial profiling.

William Bratton, who led the Boston Police Department in 1993 and oversaw dramatic crime reductions while leading the New York City Police Department from 1994 to 1996 and the Los Angeles Police Department from 2002 to 2009, is a superstar cop and a hero to many. But some critics of the aggressive policing methods championed by Kelly say he’s a poor choice to lead the department in a new direction.

“He would be terrible,” said Harry Levine, a sociology professor at Queens College and the CUNY Graduate Center, who studies marijuana arrests. “Bratton is Kelly policing with charm, charisma, savoir-faire, and unbelievably brilliant PR skills.”

Others are less critical. Adhyl Polanco, an NYPD officer who has testified against Kelly’s policies in hearings and trials, said he would welcome Bratton back to the force. Stop and frisk isn’t the problem with the NYPD today, Polanco said. “It’s the abuse that’s the problem.”

Whether a potential Bratton appointment is a good or bad thing largely depends on the lens through which you view New York City. Is New York’s transformation into one of the safest cities in the U.S. over the last 20 years an unalloyed success story? Or is it a “tale of two cities” in which the haves keep improving their lot, while the have-nots get stopped and frisked and often thrown in jail by those who see them as criminals in the making?



Bratton with former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.

De Blasio ran a very successful campaign arguing the latter, making it all the more surprising he could choose a police commissioner championed by people who see New York through the first lens.

As the head of the NYPD, Bratton was perhaps the first police commissioner in the country to embrace the “broken windows” theory of policing -- the idea that the police can discourage criminals from acting with impunity by using the full force of the law to crack down on vandalism and other petty displays of contempt for the authorities.

Bratton unleashed patrol officers to stop people for all sorts of minor and suspected violations, and to frisk them for drugs and guns. During his 27 months as New York’s top cop, the city’s arrest rate soared and reports of serious crimes decreased by 33 percent, an extraordinary decline. Supporters praised Bratton both for his hard-nosed style and his introduction of CompStat, a police-intelligence computer system that allows commanders to track crime and arrest data in real time and essentially encourages officers to make more arrests.

But as the arrest rate climbed, so did charges of police misconduct, especially in precincts heavily populated by blacks and Latinos.

Kelly, who took over from Bratton’s successor, Bernard Kerik, in 2002, embraced and expanded on Bratton’s tactics in a way that many consider excessive and discriminatory against minorities. An analysis of the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk practice by the New York Civil Liberties Union found that innocent black and Latino New Yorkers were stopped 400,000 times in 2012, far more often than whites. The report also found that police made more arrests for marijuana possession last year than for any other crime, despite support from both Kelly and Mayor Michael Bloomberg for a proposal to decriminalize open possession of small amounts of the drug.

In recent years, Bratton has at times seemed eager to distance himself from Kelly’s approach to policing. At a 2012 business group meeting in New York, he compared stop and frisk to chemotherapy, calling it an “intrusive power,” before adding, “applied in the right way, it can have the effect of reducing crime.”

Some black and Latino leaders support Bratton's ""right way” of using stop and frisk, largely because of his accomplishments as the police chief in Los Angeles between 2002 and 2009.

John Mack, a black civil rights veteran and the former director of the Los Angeles Urban League, offered a full-throated endorsement of Bratton. “He’s sensitive to the importance of a police department not operating like an occupation force in communities of color,” he said. “The broken windows theory, that’s part of his philosophy, but that was not an issue here in Los Angeles.”

Mack worked closely with Bratton in LA and says he has personally recommended him to de Blasio. Under Bratton’s leadership, he said, “the police were not just going after every young black African American on the streets of South Los Angeles.”



Bratton greets immigrant reform supporters as they march on Hollywood Boulevard on June 24, 2007 in Los Angeles, California.

When Bratton arrived in LA, violent crimes were on the rise. The city’s police department faced corruption allegations and operated under federal oversight, and the historically strained relationship between the city’s cops and black residents was as fraught as ever.

Soon after taking over the department, Bratton sat down with some of the LAPD’s fiercest critics, including Mack and civil rights attorney Connie Rice, who had filed a number of lawsuits against the department, and asked for their support. He later tapped Rice to investigate allegations that gang officers from a troubled division had stolen drugs and framed suspects. Meanwhile, the officers who served under him were encouraged to build relationships with black and Latino community leaders, including former gang members, in a cooperative effort to reduce gang violence in the city.

By the end of his tenure, crime was down 54 percent from 2001, and race relations seemed to be improving. That year, 51 percent of residents said that the police in their communities treated members of all racial and ethnic groups fairly “almost all the time” or “most of the time,” up from 44 percent in 2005, according to a Harvard University study.

In November, de Blasio met with Bratton and two other candidates for New York’s top cop job: Philip Banks III and Rafael Pineiro, both of whom currently serve in high-ranking jobs under Kelly. Banks is black, and Pineiro is Latino, but as veterans of Kelly’s department, neither candidate fully represents a break from the NYPD’s recent past.

As the city’s public advocate, de Blasio released a report showing that stopping whites was actually more likely to lead to the recovery of guns and drugs than stops of blacks and Latinos, despite the much higher frequency of the latter. He recommended appointing an inspector general to oversee the department’s use of the strategy and passing a bill to protect against racial profiling.

Yet de Blasio has stopped short of calling for an end to stop and frisk altogether. His campaign website criticized the “overuse and abuse” of the tactic under Kelly, not the tactic itself.

Donna Lieberman, director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said she’s heard good things about Bratton from her ACLU colleagues in Southern California. “We have learned from them that his tenure in LA was characterized by a very different relationship with advocates like the Civil Liberties Union than what we have seen with Commissioner Kelly in New York,” she said. “There were lines of communication which don’t exist for us in New York now.”

Still, she tempered her praise with words of caution. If Bratton is named commissioner, “we would be very eager to hear about the plans to rein in the excesses with regard to stop and frisk, ‘broken windows,’ and CompStat,” she said. “It starts from the top.”"

In an interview with The New York Times published Saturday, Obama was asked whether he was worried about being cast as a ""standing pat"" president, thanks to Congressional gridlock that has affected his agenda.

""But do you worry, Mr. President, that that description of that sort of standing pat, what happens if you stand pat and the sort of slower than expected -- do you worry that that could end up being your legacy simply because of the obstruction that -- and the gridlock that doesn’t seem to end?,"" the newspaper asked.

Obama appeared to argue that if the results were spurred by Congressional inaction, that would not stand as a lasting impression on the presidency.

""Well, let’s separate it from me for a second, because I think if I’m arguing for entirely different policies and Congress ends up pursuing policies that I think don’t make sense and we get a bad result, it’s hard to argue that’d be my legacy,"" Obama replied. ""And so I’ll worry about my legacy later or I’ll let historians worry about my legacy.""

According to HuffPost Pollster's compilation of data, Obama's second-term numbers have dipped in terms approval rating. Right after securing reelection in November 2012, Obama job approval stood at 50.2 percent. As of July 25, 2013, that number had dipped to 44.8 percent.

According to the Louisiana Secretary of State's website, McAllister led establishment candidate Neil Riser 59.7 percent to 40.3 percent -- a difference of over 17,500 votes -- with 976 of a possible 981 precincts reporting.

McAllister advanced to this weekend’s election to face off against Riser after an October contest with more than a dozen other candidates from both political parties -- in what is known as a “jungle primary.”

The seat in Louisiana's 5th Congressional District was left open when GOP Rep. Rodney Alexander resigned this summer to take a Cabinet post in GOP Gov. Bobby Jindal's administration.

The largely rural district along the Mississippi River delta is dotted with farmland and plagued by poverty. The 5th District covers all or part of 24 parishes, from northeast and central Louisiana into southeastern parishes bordering Mississippi.

In last month's election, Riser finished ahead of McAllister, taking 33 percent of the vote compared to 18 percent. But neither got the 50 percent needed to be declared the outright winner.

Many GOP races since 2010 have in some form been a Tea Party-vs.-establishment candidate showdown.

However, Riser doubled as both the establishment candidate and Tea Party favorite, promoting his experience but promising strident opposition to President Obama.

McAllister, meanwhile, embraced his outsider status, complete with an endorsement from his close friend Phil Robertson, the patriarch of television's hit series ""Duck Dynasty."" McAllister ran as the more measured pragmatist, criticizing Washington gridlock and hyper-partisanship, particularly on Obama's health care law.

""Plain and simple, this was Riser's election to lose. Riser was the favorite going into the evening. He had the dollars. He had the endorsement of the Republican establishment. He had a strong showing in the primary. Yet, he lost it,"" Joshua Stockley, a political science professor at the University of Louisiana at Monroe, told the Associated Press.

An ally of Jindal, Riser had his campaign up and running almost immediately after Alexander announced his resignation in September. The timing prompted cries of favoritism, though Jindal, Alexander and Riser deny any collusion.

Riser touted his decades-long experience as a businessman in the funeral industry while arguing his insider experience has led to significant legislative accomplishments such as helping get a state constitutional amendment passed that strengthened gun rights.

""I see a very clear distinction in the fact that I've made the votes,"" Riser said. ""These aren't just talking points for me.""

He was endorsed by the Tea Party of Louisiana and FreedomWorks, a Tea Party-aligned national political action group.

Conservative activists said it's McAllister, who's never held public office and noted during the campaign that he'd never even visited Washington, that they worry would be the go-along-to-get-along congressman who isn't conservative enough.

McAllister, who spent at least $800,000 of his own money on his campaign, according to the Federal Election Comission, countered eagerly with his newcomer status.

""I am not part of the establishment; I'm just part of the district,"" he said.

When Robertson endorsed his friend, he explained that McAllister has ""the least political experience.""

Despite that profile, McAllister didn't push the ""blow the whole place up"" mantra that some GOP primary candidates have offered in similar conservative enclaves around the country.

While he is critical of the atmosphere in Washington, he doesn't blame it exclusively on Obama. He also points a finger at House Republicans' 40-plus votes to repeal Obama's health insurance overhaul.

""I will vote to repeal it if there's a vote right now today,"" he said in a recent debate.

""But the truth of the matter is you stand on a platform and pander for votes on something that can't be repealed,"" he told Riser.

McAllister says Republicans should show the president respect and that the best course on health care is to work on improving Obama's signature law since he was re-elected and Democrats still control the Senate.

Both candidates described themselves as conservatives – opposing abortion, favoring strong gun rights and criticizing Obama's policies generally. Both criticize the levels of federal spending and debt.

""I don't think there's a lot of difference in the policy, per se, because we're both true conservatives both fiscally and socially,"" McAllister said.

McAllister will take office in time to vote on the next round of budget resolutions in January and, almost certainly, a vote soon after on whether to raise the nation's borrowing limit. Those votes were set up by an October deal to end a partial government shutdown driven by GOP opposition to the health care law.

Riser said he opposes efforts to raise the debt ceiling, saying spending should be cut instead. McAllister wasn't so absolute. He conceded he'd be willing to raise the debt ceiling if the increase was coupled with federal spending cuts and a long-term deficit reduction plan.

Des Moines, Iowa (CNN) - Vice President Joe Biden, widely assumed to be plotting a third presidential bid in 2016, shouldn’t bother booking any flights to Des Moines, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said.

“Biden is dead meat out here,” Branstad asserted Wednesday in an interview with CNN inside his office at the gilded state capitol building. “He is not going anywhere.”

Branstad, a 67-year old Republican, admitted his lack of familiarity with the passions of Iowa’s liberal Democratic caucus-goers, but he was unusually blunt when discussing Biden’s latest flirtation with the White House.

“Washington, D.C. is extremely unpopular,” he said. “Biden is so associated with this administration and all of its failures. He was unpopular before and he is even less popular now.”

Just 38% of Iowans approve of the job President Obama is doing, a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday found, a number Branstad cited repeatedly. It’s the President's worst performance ever in Quinnipiac surveys of Iowa, the state that launched his historic presidential campaign in 2008.

The poll did not measure Biden’s standing.

Branstad was more charitable when chatting about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, but he predicted that she, too, will be dragged down by her ties to Washington and the flagging popularity of the president if she decides to run.

“I am probably not the one to ask about a Democratic caucus because I have never been to one,” he said. “But in terms of the electorate here, I think that Washington D.C. is extremely unpopular, and she is associated with Washington D.C. and served in [Obama’s] administration.”

Unprompted, Branstad cited another Quinnipiac poll released this week that showed Clinton losing Iowa in a hypothetical 2016 general election match-up against New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Asked if Iowa Democrats might be open to someone other than Clinton, Branstad said there is “potential and possibility.”

“I saw some senator from Massachusetts that liberals are intrigued by,” he said, gesturing to his press aide for a clue.

“Elizabeth Warren,” the aide offered, naming the senator who ruled out a 2016 bid earlier this month, pledging to serve the remainder of a term that runs through 2018."

Republican rhetoric focuses on business creators without connecting to the average American.

Republican policies must address common interests %u2013 and not just economic interests.

We need to look to leaders in our party to emerge and solidify around this message.

Republicans feel better about their party thanks to the rash of Obama administration scandals: Benghazi stonewalling, targeting of the IRS, DOJ monitoring of media and NSA leaks. Each disgrace is bad enough, but collectively they display the president's failure to be a different kind of leader. But Republicans cannot just rely on the letdown of the Obama administration.

2012 exit polling tells us that 21% of voters thought that the most important Presidential quality was that the candidate ""cares about people like me"" – and President Obama won these voters 81 to 18. This fact rekindled the discussion over the increasing ""empathy gap.""

The ""gap"" should come as no surprise. Republican rhetoric focuses on business creators without making the connection to the average American. Furthermore, the establishment Republicans policies have cooperated with Democrats to use the government to reward big businesses and big banks at the expense of these job creators. But Republicans often don't even talk about those who work in those businesses: the cooks, technicians, welders, truck drivers, administrative assistants, middle managers, laborers, and all the other good and honorable jobs that are the foundations of these companies. These employees also make the American economy run, and there are a lot more of them than employers.

We need to talk with them – and to them. Plus our policies must address their interests – and I don't mean just economic interests. True empathy is conveyed by message, messenger, and action.

The Republican establishment dismisses such ""populism"" just like they dismissed our 2012 presidential campaign. Contrary to the popular wisdom, we did not base our campaign on contraception and abortion.

In spite of being badly outspent, we won 11 states. (Incidentally, the same number as Ronald Reagan won against Gerald Ford in 1976.) How? Much like President Reagan, we resonated with Middle America. Our campaign focused on American first principles, the family as a key economic unit and economic opportunity for those struggling during this difficult time. We talked about manufacturing, technical training, tax breaks for working families and a patient centered health care system.

In the days after the election, the Romney campaign shared some of the polling they had done during the primary, since we hadn't done any polling of our own. The most fascinating information was a trend they saw when it basically became a two-man race: Every election day exit poll released before the polls closed had Romney doing better than the final results, so they began asking what time of day voters were planning on voting. The last poll they took from Pennsylvania was telling. We were tied with voters who were planning to vote before 5:00 PM, but I lead Romney by 21 points with the folks voting on their way home from work.

Those are the voters up for grabs in America today, irrespective of their ethnicity, gender, or any other ""demographic indicators."" They know that the president's promises of government taking care of their every need is a farce, but they don't see anyone else talking about or to them. Nor do they see policies that move the needle in their lives.

When President Obama said to American business owners during the campaign last summer ""you didn't build that,"" many Americans cringed – and many were rightly offended. He was wrong, of course, but the Republican response was also wrong. Many American companies were built by great entrepreneurs, but they would be the first to tell you that, while they risked the most time and money, they weren't alone. Republicans should have told the story of entrepreneurs and their employees – how conservative principles have a positive impact on everyone's lives.

As we now know, Obama's gaffe didn't hurt him too much. Mitt Romney's ""47%"" comment was far more damaging. Why? Obama showed he didn't care or connect with, say, 13% of the population that were entrepreneurs in 2012, while Romney turned off Middle America.

In the future, Republicans must have the message and the policies that truly level the playing field, get government out of picking winners and losers, and lift up both owners and workers. We need to look to leaders in our party to emerge and solidify around this message.

Republican President Theodore Roosevelt has had a rebirth of appreciation in some conservative circles for a phrase he coined at the turn of the last century: ""Nobody cares how much you know, until they know how much you care.""

Republicans, take heed.

A Virginia Republican delegate, Scott Lingamfelter, said that he received a robocall on Sunday night claiming that Cuccinelli supports ObamaCare and taxpayer funding of abortions. According to the Washington Free Beacon, the calls are believed to be an attempt to depress conservative voter turnout and to use pressure to boost voter turnout among Democrats in the final days of the race.

Rather than a supporter of those positions, Cuccinelli was the first attorney general in the United States to challenge ObamaCare in federal court and is adamantly pro-life.

A description of the robocall from Lingamfelter’s Facebook page claimed:

About 25 minutes ago (7:24 PM 3 November) the Democratic Party of Virginia dropped a robo-call (that they said they paid for in the recording) at MY house to try to tell ME that Ken Cuccinelli supports Obamacare and public financing of abortion!!! Virginia, pa-leeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeezzz understand that the party that wants Terry McAuliffe to be your governor will flat lie about anything! If you want proof that they will say ANYTHING to gain power over you and your life, you need go no further than the “robo-lies” they are sending around Virginia this Sunday evening. They are shameless in their tactics. (I guess they are trying to suppress GOP voters.)

The Beacon states that neither Lingamfelter nor the Democratic Party of Virginia responded to questions about the robocall campaign.

In an update on its report of the story, LifeNews indicated that Cuccinelli himself has commented on the robocalls via an email sent out to his supporters:"
