By Scott Malone

BOSTON, April 8 (Reuters) - The top White House adviser on health care said on Monday she did not anticipate how lengthy and persistent the political opposition would be to healthcare reform - U.S. President Barack Obama's signature domestic legislative achievement.

The administration had not anticipated opposition to the Affordable Care Act of 2010, nicknamed ""Obamacare,"" would drag on years after the law's passage, said Kathleen Sebelius, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services.

Despite its goal to provide health coverage to more than 30 million uninsured Americans and improve the quality of medical care delivered across the country, many voters have balked over concerns the law will raise healthcare costs and increase government involvement in their personal decisions.

""The politics has been relentless and that continues,"" Sebelius said. ""There was some hope that once the Supreme Court ruled in July and then once an election occurred there would be a sense that, 'This is the law of the land, let's get on board, let's make this work.' And yet we will find ourselves having state by state political battles.""

One factor that contributed to the law's unpopularity for a large segment of the American public is the fact that its benefits have taken several years to impact people directly. Only in 2014 will many of its broadest benefits take effect, extending health coverage to millions more people.

At the same time, Republican governors and legislatures in states including Texas, Louisiana and South Carolina have refused to set up state-run exchanges where individuals would be able to buy insurance and have rejected the law's provision to allow more low-income people to enroll in Medicaid insurance.

""It is very difficult when people live in a state where there is a daily declaration, 'We will not participate in the law,' for them to figure out whether they are going to benefit,"" Sebelius said at an event at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, presented in collaboration with Reuters.

Opponents of Medicaid expansion have argued that states could find themselves saddled with untenable financial burdens if the federal government later cut back its funding to the program.

Loudest among them has been the voice of Texas' Republican Governor Rick Perry, who has described the Medicaid program as ""a broken system.""

Other prominent Republicans have sought to compromise - in Florida, Governor Rick Scott has sought, so far unsuccessfully to persuade his legislative colleagues to accept the Medicaid expansion.

The law also faces continued opposition from corners of the $2.8 trillion U.S. healthcare industry.

Sebelius, addressing the issue of feared increases in health insurance premiums because of the law, said competition to provide a set of mandated basic benefits would help.

""For the first time ever in the history of the United States, they'll have to compete for service and customers, not by cherry-picking the market (and) trying to figure out who can only insure people who promise never to get sick,"" she said.

Sebelius is one of a handful of members of Obama's cabinet to stay on for the president's second term in office. (Reporting by Scott Malone; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)"
http://news.yahoo.com/house-votes-delay-parts-health-care-law-230218513.html,,[],House votes to delay parts of health care law,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Republican-led House voted on Wednesday to delay core provisions of President Barack Obama's health care law, emboldened by the administration's concession that requiring companies to provide coverage for their workers next year may be too complicated.

After a day of heated rhetoric, the House voted largely along party lines, 264-161, to delay by one year the so-called employer mandate of the Affordable Care Act. It voted 251-174 to extend a similar grace period to virtually all Americans who will be required to obtain coverage beginning Jan. 1, the linchpin of the law.

The dual political-show votes marked the 38th time the GOP majority has tried to eliminate, defund or scale back the unpopular law since Republicans took control of the House in January 2011. The House legislation stands no chance in the Democratic-run Senate.

The goal of the health care law is to provide coverage to nearly 50 million Americans without health insurance and lower skyrocketing costs. But in the three years since Obama signed his signature law, the public remains highly skeptical and the administration's abrupt decision earlier this month to delay the employer provision only fueled more doubts.

Republican foes welcomed the deferment as a political gift, not only to assail Obama but to arrange votes that put House Democrats on record ahead of next year's congressional elections. In fact, on the employer mandate, 35 Democrats broke with party leaders and joined Republicans in backing the delay. Twenty-two Democrats supported a postponement of the health care requirement for individuals.

""This administration cannot make its own law work,"" said Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, during House debate.

Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., said the decision was ""a clear signal that even the administration doesn't believe the country is ready to sustain the painful economic impact this law will have.""

Story continues

Eager to counter the Republican criticism, Obama plans to deliver remarks Thursday focusing on rebates that consumers are already receiving from insurance companies under the health care law.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama will draw attention to the 8.5 million consumers who have received an average consumer rebate of about $100. Carney also highlighted reports that some states are already anticipating lower premiums under the Affordable Care Act.

""Competition and transparency in the marketplaces, plus the hard effort by those committed to making the law work, are leading to affordable, new and better choices for families,"" Carney said.

The House vote delaying the employer requirement codified the administration's decision, but the White House insisted it was unnecessary and issued a tough veto threat. Democrats dismissed the entire GOP effort as just another fruitless attack on a law that has been upheld by the Supreme Court.

""Well, here we go again. Another repeal vote, another political side show,"" said Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich.

Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said it was ""nothing more than a waste of time"" as the health care issue has been settled in Congress, the courts and in last year's presidential election when Obama won a second term.

In a series of unconventional political arguments, Republicans faulted Obama, who taught courses in constitutional law, of selectively enforcing the law. They accused a Democratic president of siding with business while ignoring the needs of average Americans.

""Let's provide the same relief to American families that Obama's promised to big business,"" said Rep. Todd Young, R-Ind.

Republicans also read aloud the complaints of union leaders about the unintended consequences of the law on workers' hours, with companies scaling back work time to avoid providing health coverage. They gleefully cited labor's statement that it voted for Democrats and expected them to address the problem.

The unions — International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union and UNITE-HERE — wrote to Democratic leaders last week that the law's requirements have created an incentive for employers to limit workers' hours.

The law created a new definition of full-time workers, those putting in 30 hours or more.

""Time is running out: Congress wrote this law; we voted for you. We have a problem; you need to fix it. The unintended consequences of the ACA (Affordable Care Act) are severe. Perverse incentives are already creating nightmare scenarios,"" the union leaders wrote.

House Democrats argued that the criticisms ignore the immediate advantages of the law, millions of young people who are able to remain on their parents' health care until age 26, preventives services and the millions of Americans who will have access to affordable care.

After each Republican spoke during House debate, Democrats described the specific benefits of the law in the GOP lawmaker's district.

Under the health law, companies with 50 or more workers must provide affordable coverage to their full-time employees or risk a series of escalating tax penalties if just one worker ends up getting government-subsidized insurance. Originally, that requirement was supposed to take effect Jan. 1. It will now be delayed to 2015.

The administration said businesses had raised concerns about the complexity of the requirements and pressed for more time for implementation. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 95 percent of employers with 50 or more workers already offer health benefits.

Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, senior administration officials defended the law and the delay.

Treasury Department health policy adviser Mark Iwry told the Ways and Means Committee that the administration's one-year delay of the requirement for larger employers to offer coverage was in keeping with the agency's longstanding legal authority to smooth the implementation of complicated new tax laws.

""On a number of prior occasions across administrations, this authority has been used to postpone the application of new legislation when immediate application would have subjected taxpayers to unreasonable administrative burdens or costs,"" Iwry said.

He cited a number of previous examples, from small business legislation to a tax on aviation fuel.

The inspector general's office that monitors the Internal Revenue Service warned of possible problems for consumers submitting applications for health insurance in October.

Testifying before the House Oversight committee, Alan Duncan of the Treasury's Inspector General office said the rush to be ready for open enrollment Oct. 1 may leave some technology not fully tested.

""The lack of adequate testing could result in significant delays and errors in accepting and processing ... applications for health insurance coverage,"" Duncan testified.

Administration officials said they are highly confident of a successful launch.

A successful society works to help make sure that the people are well cared for, avoid illness, and have access to good medicine and good advice. But that's not always the case, at least not to Republicans.

States like Nebraska, Kansas, Indiana have all made moves to cut prenatal care, and at the same time, they move to cut funding to planned parenthood, of course. In their mind, it means fewer abortions. In reality, it means far more unwanted pregnancies, and a raise in rates of infant mortality.

http://www.guttmacher.org/...

One in 10 women said that they had switched to a less expensive provider of contraceptive services. This increased demand for lower-cost services was mirrored in the survey responses from family planning providers. Two-thirds of the family planning centers surveyed noted an increase in the number of clients seeking services between the first quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 (see chart, page 10). Importantly, the vast majority of providers surveyed said they had seen an increase in the number of clients who are poor or low income and, therefore, eligible for free or reduced-fee care from providers receiving any subsidy from the federal Title X program. More than half the providers reported significant service delivery challenges in meeting clients' needs. Most often, they reported staff layoffs or a hiring freeze during 2009. Many also said that they had been forced to reduce the number of contraceptive methods they are able to offer; more expensive methods such as the IUD, the implant, the patch and some brand-name oral contraceptives were the most likely to be cut. One in four providers said that waiting times had increased, typically doubling from less than a week to about two weeks.

As women have less and less access to effective birthcontrol, the rate of potential unwanted pregnancy goes up.

The republicans counter this claim with: ""Then don't have sex"". My response: OK, let us see how long you men who pass these laws can go without sex. We'll have a Jerry Seinfield like competition and check it out.

The sad fact is, this move to cut access to early care and family planning doesn't cut abortion as much as it increases infant mortality - and which is more negative to you?



In general, Owens said, many pregnant women don't realize the importance of getting their own medical problems treated. ""We know that the way we get the best pregnancy is to have a healthy mom before mom and baby are together,"" she said.



Birth defects are the leading cause of infant death in the United States. Not all are preventable, but a mother can reduce risk by keeping her own health under control by eliminating smoking, drinking and illegal drugs. The same is true for premature births, another leading cause of infant deaths in the United States. The March of Dimes recently released its Premature Birth Report Card and gave failing grades to Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana. Mississippi has the largest premature birth rate based on the 2011 national statistics used in the report.

With conservative states leading the way in rates of birth defects and premature births. Not all birth defects can be prevented, but many, say the March of Dimes as well as the CDC, can be prevented through good prenatal care, proper nutrition, access to routine checkups.. which includes health of the mother, blood pressure control, etc. These are common things for those with insurance and care, but not for the poor.

So, let's be blunt.. the decrease in prenatal care means a rise in infant mortality and an increase in children born with preventable birth defects because of lack of care.

The March of Dimes speaks to exactly how effective good pre-natal care is.

http://www.pcrm.org/...

The medical costs of care for children with disabilities resulting from birth defects have been estimated to exceed $1.4 billion annually. While some types of birth defects have decreased, mainly through preventive methods, many have increased. According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study of 38 types of birth defects occurring over the period 1979-89, 27 had increased, including several cardiac defects, chromosomal defects such as trisomy 18, and fetal alcohol syndrome; nine had remained the same; and only two had decreased.

That's OK, though, because Republicans will want to fund support for all the children of disabilities born because of bad prenatal care, and they will provide support for women who lose their child in the first year, right?

Don't worry, Republican governors have got that.



2. A program to help adults with disabilities live independently faces an enrollment freeze in the new budget, which will leave nearly 17,000 men and women throughout the state without vital resources over the next two years. Family Care helps provide a wide range of services such as in-home care, supported living communities, meal delivery, and job training to help keep more than 31,000 people integrated with their communities; waiting lists for private resources like housing can be well over a decade. Cutting off enrollment in Family Care is a message from Scott Walker to men and women already disproportionately affected by poverty and discrimination that in his eyes they’re less than human.

So, with more unwanted pregnancies, a higher infant mortality, and an increase in preventable birth defects, I want to know: when did Republicans become the party that likes any of these things? Because rooting for increases in infant mortality and birth defects is so abhorrent to me, I cannot fathom the logic.

Sorry Republicans. I prefer babies who breath and live healthy, long lives. That's why I favor prenatal care support. Please, advocate for me that you want more children to die after birth, as long as they aren't aborted. Because it would be an honest assessment of how this will turn out.

New York%2C Philadelphia%2C a few other localities and California ban it in restaurants

McDonald%27s%2C Taco Bell and KFC dropped it from fries%2C nachos and chicken years ago

Products at grocery stores have nearly 75%25 less in them since 2005

WASHINGTON (AP) — They are among our most personal daily decisions: what to eat or drink. Maybe what to inhale.

Now that the government's banning trans fat, does that mean it's revving up to take away our choice to consume all sorts of other unhealthy stuff?

What about salt? Soda? Cigarettes?

Nah.

In the tug-of-war between public health and personal freedom, the Food and Drug Administration's decision to ban trans fats barely rates a ripple.

Hardly anyone defends the icky-sounding artificial ingredient anymore, two decades after health activists began warning Americans that it was clogging their arteries and causing heart attacks.

New York, Philadelphia, a few other localities and the state of California already have banned trans fat from restaurant food.

McDonald's, Taco Bell and KFC dropped it from their french fries, nachos and chicken years ago.

The companies that fill grocery shelves say they already have reduced their use of trans fat by nearly three-fourths since 2005.

Growers are promoting new soybean oils that they say will eliminate, within a few years, the need for partial hydrogenation, the process that creates trans fats still used to enhance the texture of some pie crusts, cookies and margarine.

Mostly, Americans' palates have moved on, and so have their arguments over what's sensible health policy and what amounts to a ""nanny state"" run amok.

When they aren't feuding over President Barack Obama's health care law, state politicians are busy weighing the wisdom of legalizing marijuana. Already 20 states and the District of Columbia have authorized it for medicinal use. Voters in Colorado and Washington state approved smoking pot just for fun.

The FDA is taking heat for delays in coming out with new rules on regular-old tobacco cigarettes under a law passed in 2009. There are the new e-cigarettes to worry about, too. More than 20 states have banned stores from selling electronic cigarettes to minors, but the federal government has yet to take them on.

New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's attempt to stop restaurants from selling sodas larger than 16 ounces, and the federal government's efforts to impose healthier lunches on school kids are causing more of an uproar than the trans fat ban.

Still, Jeffrey Levi, executive director of the nonprofit Trust for America's Health, says a national trans fat ban is ""a big deal."" After all, the FDA estimates it will prevent 20,000 heart attacks and 7,000 deaths a year.

Levi doesn't see it as evidence that federal regulators are suddenly on a roll, however.

""There are other areas where regulation is sort of stuck — everything from nutrition labeling to food safety to the tobacco regulations that have not seen the light of day,"" Levi said.

Talk of new government regulation typically stirs up libertarians and conservatives. Yet the trans fat ban hasn't provoked much beefing.

Radio host Rush Limbaugh groused that bureaucrats shouldn't regulate what people eat because it's ""none of their business"" and research on nutrition keeps changing. After all, sticks of margarine made with trans fats used to be recommended as a healthier alternative to butter.

Heritage Foundation research fellow Daren Bakst, who specializes in agriculture issues, blogged that the FDA is ""ignoring the most important issue: the freedom of Americans.""

A few fans of ready-to-spread cake frostings and microwave popcorn that still contain trans fat griped via Twitter.

They don't have to worry immediately.

The FDA must consider comments from the food industry and the public before it comes up with a timeline for phasing out trans fats, also known as partially hydrogenated oils. It could take years to get them off the market.

Michael Jacobson, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest, has been warning about the dangers since the early 1990s. Advocacy by the center helped persuade the government to add trans fat to nutrition labels beginning in 2006.

That created consumer pressure on food companies to find tasty ways to replace partially hydrogenated oil with less harmful fats. The companies' success helped clear the way for the government to consider a trans fat ban, he said.

""It's a little bit of an exception, in that it's so harmful and it was so widely used,"" Jacobson said, ""and there are substitutes so that people can't tell the difference when it's removed.""

Next on Jacobson's wish list is something that would be much harder for industry and the FDA to accomplish: reducing the salt in processed foods.

""There are estimates that it's causing around 100,000 deaths prematurely every year in this country,"" he said. ""That is just huge.""

Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) said Tuesday, in another sign of a growing split in the Republican Party.

""I want to defund this bill, but I also want a way to do it that kills it,"" Coburn, who was one of the health care law's most vocal opponents when it passed, said in a Senate floor speech.

He argued that the plan by Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and several other tea party-backed senators to try and strip funds for the law from a September government funding bill simply won't work.

The reason, Coburn argued, is that most of the spending in Obamacare is mandatory, and the spending cannot be touched, even if the GOP were to shut down the rest of the government. He cited a new Congressional Research Service report that found as much.

""There's not a legislative method that we have that is capable of defunding it short of 67 votes in the U.S. Senate, short of two-thirds [of the] votes in the U.S. House,"" Coburn said, referring to the number of votes needed to override the presidential veto that would be sure to block any attempt to defund the law.

Nevertheless, Lee said that the GOP has an obligation to try.

He and Cruz argued that if the House passed a bill to fund all of the government except for Obamacare and the president blocked it, it would be the White House shutting down the government, not the GOP.

They also contended that this year was Republicans' last real chance to stop the health care law before it is fully implemented, and said any members of the GOP who don't stand against it now are essentially guaranteeing the law will continue to exist.

""Defund it, or own it,"" Lee said to his colleagues. ""If you fund it, you're for it.""

Cruz told reporters shortly before taking to the floor that Americans would essentially be hooked on the law if it's not blocked by the start of next year.

""Jan. 1 is when the exchanges start and subsidies start. And the administration's plan is to get as many people as possible addicted to the sugar, addicted to the subsidies,"" Cruz said, arguing that entitlements never get repealed.

""It is an iron rule of politics that those who receive subsidies, inevitably, after they start receiving those subsidies, fight to retain those subsidies,"" Cruz said. ""They want as many people as possible receiving those subsidies in order to ensure that they remain a permanent aspect of the economy.""

But other Republicans, like Coburn, think a shutdown showdown is doomed to not only fail, but to make Americans angry at the GOP, potentially harming chances to win fights in other areas, from tax reform and the debt ceiling later this year to next year's elections.

Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) has called the defunding gambit the ""dumbest idea"" he's ever heard. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) warned against it, while Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Americans were tired of GOP-led debt ceiling and government shutdown ""shenanigans."" Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said shutting down the government was ""foolish.""

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) added her criticism to the chorus Tuesday, saying the plan was simply not realistic, and that it was both bad policy and bad politics.

""The American people want commonsense solutions,"" Collins told reporters on Capitol Hill. ""They don't want us to pursue policies that are pointless, that are going to end in governments shutting down, more partisanship, more gridlock. They want us to actually get things done.""

Even conservative Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.) was not willing to join Lee, Cruz and company, although he opposes Obamacare.

""We all agree and have voted to repeal and replace Obamacare. Our conference is united on that,"" he told HuffPost. ""Now we're just working through what's the best tactic or strategy to do it. So we're working through that, and obviously there are different opinions. Nobody wants the government to shut down. Nobody wants that to happen.""

Nevertheless, Cruz said he saw a path, saying that ""August is a critical period"" to convince the public to put pressure on lawmakers while they are on their month-long recess.

""If we see a grassroots tsunami, if we see millions of Americans stand up and say, 'Stop giving speeches about Obamacare, stop casting symbolic votes that don't do anything, and actually stand and fight,' if senators, if members of the House actually listen to their constituents, I believe we will return and come September... I believe we will succeed in getting either 41 senators in the Senate to stand together, or 218 members in the House to stand together. That's the path to winning this fight,"" Cruz said. The 41 senators he referred to are the number needed to filibuster a bill in the Senate.

Cruz -- who argued on the Senate floor that no ""parade of horribles"" materialized when the GOP shut down government for several weeks in the Clinton era -- told reporters that Republicans need to stop being afraid of being blamed.

""Republicans actually will have to stand up and fight and win the argument, and say, 'No, we have voted to fund the federal government. We want to keep the federal government funded, and why is President Obama threatening to shut down the federal government in order to force Obamacare down the American people's throats?'""

During the shutdowns in 1995, the GOP took adamant positions on the budget while Clinton signaled willingness to negotiate. The showdowns are widely credited with aiding Democrats in the 1996 elections."

The White House says Obamacare will be working by Sunday. Here’s what that means.

Much of the Beltway establishment scoffed at the promise of cost savings. The prevalent attitude in Washington is that reform isn’t real unless the little people suffer; serious savings are supposed to come from things like raising the Medicare age (which the Congressional Budget Office recently concluded would, in fact, hardly save any money) and throwing millions of Americans off Medicaid. True, a 2011 letter signed by hundreds of health and labor economists pointed out that “the Affordable Care Act contains essentially every cost-containment provision policy analysts have considered effective in reducing the rate of medical spending.” But such expert views were largely ignored. So, how’s it going? The health exchanges are off to a famously rocky start, but many, though by no means all, of the cost-control measures have already kicked in. Has the curve been bent? The answer, amazingly, is yes. In fact, the slowdown in health costs has been dramatic.

When the first attempt by the United States to launch a satellite into orbit, in 1957, ended in disaster, did Democrats start to cheer, and unify to stop a space program in its infancy? Or, when Medicare got off to a confusing start, did Republicans of the mid-1960s wrap their entire political future around a campaign to deny government-run health care to the elderly? Of course not. But for the entirety of the Obama era, Republicans have consistently been cheerleaders for failure. They rooted for the economic recovery to sputter, for gas prices to spike, the job market to crater, the rescue of the American automobile industry to fall apart. I get it. This organized schadenfreude goes back to the dawn of Obama’s presidency, when Rush Limbaugh, later joined by Senator Mitch McConnell, said their No. 1 goal was for the president to fail. A CNN poll in 2010 found 61 percent of Republicans hoping Obama would fail (versus only 27 percent among all Americans). Wish granted, mission accomplished. Obama has failed -- that is, if you judge by his tanking poll numbers. But does this collapse in approval have to mean that the last best chance for expanding health care for millions of Americans must fail as well?

The ""President as failure"" is a rhetorical device here, but it's all too assumed by journalists, and pushed by GOP flacks.

More politics and policy below the fold."

Yet such is the trifecta with the Republican campaign to call attention to Obamacare’s young “victims.”

Republicans are obsessed with the supposed injustice being done to some healthy young people who will effectively subsidize their sicker elders when Obamacare’s individual mandate takes effect.

The crusaders are nothing if not convinced of the righteousness of their cause. “The whole scheme is enlisting young adults to overpay, so other people can have subsidies,” Dean Clancy, a vice president at FreedomWorks, told my Post colleague Sarah Kliff. “That unfairness reminded us of the military draft.”

Conservatives are therefore urging young Americans to resist. “I’m burning my Obamacare draft card,” runs one theatrical riff from a group called Young Americans for Liberty, “because I’m too busy paying student loans to pay for somebody else’s health insurance.” Republican policy advisors have urged the party to make such child abuse a big part of their anti-Obamacare message.

Sounds like a sexy argument, except for one thing. Republicans seem to have forgotten where most people aged 19 to 34 get health coverage: from their employer. And at virtually every company, young people pay the same premiums as employees who are much older than they are and who get more expensively sick than they do. In other words, the evil cross-subsidy Obamacare’s foes are storming the barricades to roll back already exists, at vastly larger scale, in corporate America.

These youngsters are already in chains! They’ve been put there by the private sector! And, inexplicably, young employees have entered this servitude of their own volition. (To extend the GOP’s draft analogy, it turns out there’s a voluntary army of health care masochists from sea to shining sea.)

How could injustice on this scale escape the GOP’s searing moral scrutiny?

After all, the president is only hoping thatabout 2.7 million young people will purchase coverage in the new exchanges. But 20 million Americans between the ages of 19 and 34 get coverage from their employer right now, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

If you’re keeping score, that makes employer-based health care’s cross-subsidy about eight times more evil than Obamacare’s.

How does it work? Compare a typical, strapping young employee of 28 to her broken- down 58-year-old colleague. These two employees have very different annual health expenses. Yet under the nefarious plot known as “group health insurance,” they basically pay the same premiums. It turns out every big company in America is essentially a socialized health care republic, in which the young subsidize the old, and the healthy subsidize the sick — all of whom pay the same premiums for the same plans.

Similar dynamics explain why, in the federal health-care plan, spry 42-year-olds like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz subsidize 79-year-old geezers like Chuck Grassley and Orrin Hatch.

Maybe that’s why Cruz always seems so angry.

The U.S. spends more than other countries on health care. (Ann Telnaes/The Washington Post)

Of course, most people in civilized nations know and accept that this is how insurance works. But Republicans nowadays aren’t like most people in civilized nations. They think Obamacare is a form of injustice akin to slavery. Which makes employer-provided health care slavery on steroids. Where’s the outrage? If conservatives were consistent and principled, they would devote far more time and effort to liberating 20 million young Americans from the socialism baked into employer-based insurance and look past the Obamacare exchanges as a puny sideshow.

But, alas, conservatives are not consistent and principled, save for their consistent determination to hurt the president politically.

It would be better if all those smart GOP thinkers devoted their talent and energy to the question of how they would expand coverage to the 50 million uninsured — but to raise that question is to enter the policy cul de sac in all its delicious irony.

Because the answer to that question is RomneyObamacare, the only sound way (as Republicans rightly taught us) that a country can move toward universal coverage using private health plans. The GOP could offer a tweaked version with slightly fewer regulations. Or structure it to offer universal catastrophic coverage to save money. But if Republicans were serious, they’d offer the same basic reform architecture.

So Republicans choose not to be serious. And it shows.

In the end, the GOP’s Obamacare youth hoax shows how silly a party can look when a political focus on one corner of a policy leads it to latch on to “insights” that utterly miss the big picture. It’s a reminder, if we needed another, of how close the connection can be between ideology and idiocy.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/29/ted-cruz-house-republicans_n_4014071.html,2013-09-29 00:00:00,"['Politics Reporter', 'The Huffington Post']",House Republicans Credit Ted Cruz As Government Shutdown Looms,"WASHINGTON -- House Republicans give one person the most credit for bringing Congress to its current standoff over funding for the federal government: Ted Cruz.

With the clock ticking toward the first government shutdown in 17 years, many lawmakers said they never would have been here had it not been for the junior senator from Texas.

""I think he's played a lot of role in where we are right now,"" Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said as he left a closed-door meeting of the House Republican conference on Saturday afternoon.

During the meeting, GOP leaders announced plans to advance a bill that would keep the government funded beyond Sept. 30 in exchange for a one-year delay of Obamacare and repeal of its medical device tax. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) declared the proposal dead on arrival a couple hours later.

But conservatives were jubilant as they left the meeting, and they identified Cruz as the force that pushed a reluctant GOP leadership to the brink.

""I think Ted Cruz did a huge service to the nation and to the cause of Republicanism,"" Rep. John Culberson (R-Texas) told The Huffington Post.

""[He played] an excellent role,"" said Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.). ""I think what he's done is strengthened our hand. He's made the case that we need to act and act decisively, and so I think we have a lot to credit him for.""

Rep. John Fleming (R-La.) called Cruz's role ""huge.""

""He's been the rallying flag that has pulled Republicans around conservatives,"" Fleming said. ""Just the mere fact that he's out there talking, that he's had petitions going, that he did a 21-hour [speech] that was highlighted in the media … all of these things are building energy among Republicans and conservatives who are unified in the fact that we oppose Obamacare.""

Cruz, along with his main ally Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), spent much of the summer mounting a full-fledged campaign to include a provision defunding Obamacare in a bill to fund the government. He starred in robocalls and television and radio ads, and raised millions for a possible White House bid in 2016, all while ramping up pressure on the House to yield to his demands.

At first, House Republicans seemed content to pass a continuing resolution that defunded Obamacare and leave it to Cruz to filibuster any attempts by Reid to amend it. The Texas senator failed to gather enough support from his colleagues to mount a filibuster and embarked on a 21-hour floor speech anyway.

As the Cruz show ran its course, House GOP leaders looked unlikely to tamper with Obamacare once again in their next government funding offer. They instead shifted focus to the pending debt ceiling fight, unveiling plans to seek a one-year delay in the implementation of Obamacare in exchange for raising the nation's borrowing limit.

But once again, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) found himself up against Cruz.

National Review reported that Cruz told House conservatives in a Thursday conference call to oppose leadership's fiscal strategy. Two days after the call, GOP leaders once again hinged funding for the government on Obamacare and dramatically raised the odds of a shutdown.

Some Republicans denied that Cruz was responsible.

""That's a different body over there,"" said Rep. Lynn Westmoreland (R-Ga.). ""I think our leadership has been onto this the whole time. I think they listened to the American people. That's what we're supposed to do.""

""I think we motivated him. We stood firm first and he did what he did,"" said Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.).

Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) said it was a team effort, but conceded the senator from Texas had been at the forefront of it all.

""I think we're motivated by the dangers of Obamacare, not by Ted Cruz,"" he said. ""Although it is good to see Ted Cruz take a leadership role.""

Democrats have pounced on Cruz's influence among the House GOP's right flank and played up the idea of the Texas Republican becoming the next speaker of the House.

But Cole, the House GOP's deputy whip, laughed at the suggestion that Cruz had dictated the House's strategy over funding the government and said the conference was in ""total support"" of Boehner.

""It's not as if any of us have ever been for Obamacare, so we've had multiple proposals to change, delay, what have you,"" he said, before taking a jab at Cruz's lengthy talkathon last week.

""He's dragged the clock out a little bit, so it's made it a little tougher, but we'll see what he does once we move [our bill] back over there,"" Cole said.

Mr. Obama’s openness to Medicare changes seemed to be news to many Republicans, even though he first proposed detailed ideas in 2011. Republicans often accuse the president of opposing changes in entitlement spending while focusing on raising taxes, an attack that ignores his proposals but also reflects how little Mr. Obama has talked about them.

Still, the same hurdle to compromise stands: The president and his party will not support even his Medicare proposals unless Republicans agree to raise taxes on the wealthy and some corporations. Without that trade-off, common ground on Medicare will remain unplowed.

“The president has said this to the Republicans: ‘You want to do entitlement reform? I do, too. I can produce entitlement reform and bring Democrats to the table, because I am a Democratic president. And so I’m ready to sit down with you and work out an approach,’ ” Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, a Democratic leader, said at a recent forum hosted by The Wall Street Journal.

Many Republicans remain distrustful of Mr. Obama. Yet when they speak of altering Medicare, not replacing it, it is clear that they share some concerns about the existing program.

Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of a health subcommittee, said the structure of the traditional fee-for-service Medicare is “outdated and confusing.”

“Can you imagine a world in which someone has to buy hospital and nursing home coverage from one insurance company, physician office coverage from another insurance company, prescription drug coverage from yet another company, and likely supplemental coverage from a fourth insurance company?” Mr. Brady asked. “This is exactly how the current Medicare benefit is designed.”"

Administration officials approached the contractors last week to see if they could perform the necessary repairs and reboot the system by Nov. 1. However, that goal struck many contractors as unrealistic, at least for major components of the system. Some specialists working on the project said the online system required such extensive repairs that it might not operate smoothly until after the Dec. 15 deadline for people to sign up for coverage starting in January, although that view is not universally shared.

In interviews, experts said the technological problems of the site went far beyond the roadblocks to creating accounts that continue to prevent legions of users from even registering. Indeed, several said, the login problems, though vexing to consumers, may be the easiest to solve. One specialist said that as many as five million lines of software code may need to be rewritten before the Web site runs properly.

“The account creation and registration problems are masking the problems that will happen later,” said one person involved in the repair effort."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

I suggested yesterday that we’re probably heading for a turning point in the health reform discussion. Conservatives are operating on the assumption that it’s an irredeemable disaster that they can ride all the way to 2016; but the facts on the ground are getting better by the day, and Obamacare will turn into a Benghazi-type affair where Republicans are screaming about a scandal nobody else cares about.

And it’s already starting to happen.

White House officials are sounding increasingly upbeat. They could be deluded or spinning; but after what happened two months ago one suspects that the last thing they want is to inflate expectations unduly.

Meanwhile, media coverage is shifting fast. It’s still mostly trying for equivalence — each positive story of people being helped matched by a negative story of people hurt. But the stories don’t actually match up at all.

Small example: earlier today I found myself trapped in a place with CNN on in the background, showing a fair-and-balanced account of losers and winners. First, the loser: a guy who admits that Obamacare has gotten him a plan cheaper than the insurance he had, but who has found that his current allergist is off-network. Annoying, no doubt; but there are other allergists, and this particular one probably didn’t help the case by saying that he’s thinking of refusing to take Medicare patients, too.

And in any case, insurance with restricted networks is hardly something new to Obamacare.

Then, the winners: a couple with no insurance at all, because her premium would have been prohibitive and he has a preexisting condition that won’t let him buy any kind of insurance at all — but now both covered, at a very affordable price, by Covered California.

I don’t know about you, but these don’t sound to me like equivalent stories.

At this rate, the whole horrors-of-Obamacare meme will be gone in weeks, not months. But the GOP echo chamber won’t be able to let it go."

Phil Gingrey to Sebelius: Prove You Met with President About Obamacare,"In a move sure to spark consternation inside the White House, Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-GA) sent a letter Tuesday to embattled Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius requesting she produce a list of the one-on-one meetings she and President Barack Obama allege to have held in the over three-and-a-half years leading up to Obamacare’s calamitous rollout–meetings that do not appear on the White House’s own official calendar.

“I have been greatly concerned over the lack of transparency and disregard for straight answers,” says Gingrey in his letter to Sebelius. “The Government Accountability Institute reported this month that according to the White House calendar, you have only met with the President once at the White House since becoming Secretary. Yet the White House has disputed the account and claims that you have been briefing the President regularly.”

Last week during a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing, Gingrey, a medical doctor, asked a flustered Sebelius how many one-on-one meetings she had with Obama. “A lot,” replied Sebelius. Gingrey then asked whether she could verify her statement. “I, I…,” Sebelius uttered while flailing her hands. The committee chair then announced that Gingrey’s time for questioning had expired.

Gingrey says in his letter that the American people deserve to know “how the rollout of the healthcare law has been botched so badly, who in the administration knew what, and when officials received warnings of problems.”

Gingrey’s request to Sebelius comes on the heels of an explosive report and Politico Magazine article by the Government Accountability Institute (GAI) that found the official White House calendar and the Politico presidential calendar do not record a single one-on-one meeting between the HHS chief and Obama since Obamacare was signed into law on March 23, 2010. Only once does Sebelius’s name appear–in a meeting that also included then-Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner. Curiously, those same calendars record 277 private meetings between Obama and other Cabinet secretaries.

Specifically, Gingrey says he wants Sebelius to answer the following questions:

How many times have you met in-person with the president since the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)?

How many meetings did you have with White House staffers to discuss ACA?

Were issues regarding implementation deadlines discussed? If so, what directions were given?

How many meetings did you have with White House, CMS, and other agency personnel to discuss ACA implementation?

When it became clear that the ACA would not be ready by October 1, who in the White House was briefed? When was he or she briefed? What were they told?

Specifically, did you meet with the president after you received the McKinsey briefing? If yes, did you inform him of the grave warnings outlined? If no, why not?

Gingrey’s last question refers to a critical April 4, 2013 meeting wherein McKinsey & Co. consultants presented a 15-slide presentation to Sebelius and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Marilyn Tavenner. The presentation cautioned that the ideal situation for the Obamacare website would include “end-to-end integrated operations and IT testing” and warned that there was “insufficient time and scope of end-to-end testing.”

The Georgia congressman’s letter to Sebelius places the already beleaguered Obama Administration in a difficult and dangerous political quandary that could further erode the president’s already sinking trustworthiness and approval ratings.

During his roundly-criticized November 14 press conference, Obama promised the American people that he was unaware of the HealthCare.gov problems until after the website was launched on October 1. But as GAI President Peter Schweizer pointed out in a Politico Magazine article, “If Obama and Sebelius worked together closely and regularly, why did the president publicly state he did not know about the problems with HealthCare.gov?”

That unanswered question threatens to further unravel Obama’s tenuous standing with Independent voters who tend to base political preferences more on executive performance and leadership traits and less on ideological positions.

Former counselor to four presidents from both parties David Gergen said on CNN that the GAI report and the White House’s refusal to turn over the dates of the alleged one-on-one meetings between Sebelius and Obama suggests that “there was no one in charge in the administration.”

prev Image 2 of 2

Millions of health insurance plans have been cancelled after ObamaCare went into effect, and President Obama backed away Monday from his previous oft-repeated statement that “if you like your plan, you can keep your plan.”

But he may want to glance at his own website, WhiteHouse.gov, which still states: ""For Americans with insurance coverage who like what they have, they can keep it. Nothing in this act or anywhere in the bill forces anyone to change the insurance they have, period.""



That appears in a section of the WhiteHouse.gov website labeled ""health reform details."" The exact same language also appears in the Department of Health and Human Services' online description of the law.

But that web description is very different from what Obama said Monday to top backers of Organizing for Action, his permanent campaign arm.

“What we said was, ‘You could keep it [your plan] if it hasn’t changed since the law was passed,’” Obama said.

Critics say the conflicting language is dishonest.

More On This...

“Even though millions of Americans are getting cancellation notices in the mail because of the President’s health care law, the White House website still promises that Americans can keep the care they like,"" Senator John Barrasso, R-Wyo., who is also an orthopedic surgeon, said in a statement to FoxNews.com.

""If the President was being honest, he would finally tell the American people that his law won’t allow them to keep their coverage, premiums won’t be cheaper than a cell phone bill, and the website won’t be as easy to use as Amazon. It’s time for the White House to tell the truth – instead of doubling down on dishonesty,” Barrasso added.

A Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman said on Monday that she would check on the issue, but did not comment as of Tuesday.

White House spokesman Eric Schultz, reached by FoxNews.com, did not say whether the administration stood by the website's wording, but he instead referred to statements by spokesman Jay Carney from Tuesday.

Carney, in his remarks Tuesday, defended all the President’s statements.

""Look, the [grandfathering] provision within the Affordable Care Act was the manifestation of the President’s promise that if you had a plan that you liked, you could keep it,” Carney said, before putting the blame on insurers.

""If you had a plan and your insurance company didn’t cancel it, you could keep it,"" Carney said.

However, the insurance company cancellations were largely due to a rule issued by the Department of Health and Human services which disqualified plans that have changed at all since the law passed from being “grandfathered” in and exempted from the regulations.

“When the rule was issued, Secretary Sebelius and others spoke to the press about it, specifically about the fact that… if insurance companies changed their plans or canceled their plans, they would give up the opportunity to grandfather those plans in,” Carney said.

Yet critics point out that the website reads: “Nothing in this act or anywhere in the bill forces anyone to change the insurance they have, period.”

A Republican Senate health policy staffer told FoxNews.com he thought the wording on the website was inaccurate and surprising.

""It does surprise me, because the Obama team owes their success in no small part to social media and web savvy. And they know that any narrative is subject to a quick check via Google.""

The staffer added, ""the President's defenders will say he was just trying to simplify a complicated public policy into terms that people can understand... But I think there's a difference between trying to simplify things and fundamentally changing the meaning.""

Most Americans are happy with their existing plans, he noted.

""Polls have repeatedly shown that 85% of Americans who have coverage are satisfied with it,"" he said. Two Quinnipiac polls from 2009, before ObamaCare passed, put the number at between 85 and 88%.

Some in Congress say they're trying to do something to help people keep their plans.

""Millions of Americans are slated to lose the individual health insurance they already like and own,"" Re. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., told FoxNews.com.

""I recently joined Congressman Ron DeSantis to introduce the 'If You Like Your Health Care Plan You Can Keep It Act of 2013' to make good on the President’s promise,"" he added.

Asked on Tuesday whether such a plan would be considered by the President, Jay Carney did not answer directly.

Asked whether the President would take back his ""if you like your health plan, you can keep it"" comments from the past if he could, Carney replied:

""Well, the President, as awesomely powerful as the office is, can't go back in time. And what the President is focused on is what we're all focused on, which is getting this right for the American people and getting it right for everyone.""

Oct 7 (Reuters) - The Obama administration said on Monday it was fixing software and capacity problems at the main website designed to enroll millions of Americans into new health plans.

The HealthCare.gov website has been beset by glitches since Oct. 1, the first day people were allowed to enroll in the new coverage provided by the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.

The website, which serves insurance exchanges in 36 states, received 8.6 million unique visitors last week, according to the federal government.

""Our top issue when it comes to the glitches has been the extraordinary number of people coming to check out plans and find out more about Obamacare. The number has obviously exceeded expectations,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said at a news briefing.

""To make further improvements, we are doing several things at once, including adding server capacity and making software changes to make the system more efficient to handle higher volume.""

IT experts told Reuters last week they believed flaws in the system's architecture, not traffic alone, contributed to the problems of the first week.

One expert told Reuters the site's design triggered too many requests to the server simultaneously, which created a situation similar to when hackers attack a site, known as a distributed denial of service attack.

Carney said a particular component of the system within the account registration function was not able to handle the high volume, causing problems for consumers at the registration process.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, ""has put up a gate at the front end of the system that places visitors into a waiting room and lets them in at a particular pace, so that the surge in volume does not cause the problems that it caused in the past,"" Carney said.

""Thus far, we've reduced waiting room times by a third and are increasingly moving more users through the system, but we're not satisfied with the performance.""

In response to the early glitches, supporters of the law have pointed to the fact that enrollment in the online healthcare exchanges is set to run through the end of March, allowing for several months to work out the kinks.

Including separate websites run by individual states alone, the exchanges are expected to enroll 7 million Americans next year, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates. (Additional reporting by Roberta Rampton in Washington. Editing by Andre Grenon)"

(CNN) —

It was the government’s fault, contractors on the problem-plagued website for President Barack Obama’s signature health care reforms told a congressional hearing on Thursday.

In more than four hours of testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, officials of companies hired to create the HealthCare.gov website cited a lack of testing on the full system and last-minute changes by the federal agency overseeing the online enrollment system.

Angry exchanges between Republicans who oppose Obamacare and Democrats defending it erupted repeatedly, while the contractors insisted their work went fine even though the software buckled when the system went online on October 1.

Complaints about logging in, lengthy delays, incorrect information relayed to insurance companies and other problems have fueled continued GOP attacks on the 2010 Affordable Care Act that was upheld by the Supreme Court last year.

The White House and administration officials say the enrollment problems are being fixed. On Thursday, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) that oversees the new programs under the health care reforms said almost 700,000 applications have been submitted online on either the federal or state websites.

While the applications don’t mean that many people have fully enrolled for health insurance under the new system, the figure represents a significant increase in those who have been able to start the process in recent days.

However, Julie Bataille, the CMS director of communications, was unable to say how many of the 700,000 applications were submitted on the federal website.

Bataille seemed to agree with some of the criticism by contractors at the hearing, saying that “due to a compressed time frame, the system just wasn’t tested enough, especially for high volume.”

House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa on Thursday raised the threat of a possible subpoena if Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius doesn’t respond to his panel’s questions and requests for documents about problems with the Obamacare website. Committee aides say Sebelius has failed to respond to a previous request and Issa is now giving her until Monday to comply or possibly face “compulsory” action.

At Thursday’s hearing, committee Chairman Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan called the launch of the website “nothing short of a disaster,” noting that contractors at the hearing previously “looked us in the eye and assured us repeatedly that everything was on track, except that it wasn’t.”

Upton and other Republicans said it heralded problems with the rest of the Obamacare reforms.

“I am more nervous today than I was when I got here,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers of Michigan said of security concerns raised by Thursday’s testimony, such as code changes being made to fix the problems without undergoing normal testing.

Democrats, however, accused Republicans of continuing a campaign to sabotage the health care reforms instead of working to fix problems in the system intended to help millions of uninsured Americans obtain affordable health coverage.

They noted that media headlines in 2006 blared similar descriptions of rollout problems with the Medicare Part D prescription drug reforms of the Bush administration, but that Democrats then worked with Republicans to resolve the issues instead of trying to scrap the legislation.

“The Republicans don’t have clean hands coming here. Their effort is not to make things better,” said Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey. “Let the goal here be to fix it, not nix it.”

In the first detailed account of what happened, officials of four contractors involved in the website creation described a convoluted system of multiple companies operating separately under the oversight of CMS, a part of the Department of Health and Human Services.

Each said their individual components generally performed as planned after internal testing, but all conceded that CMS failed to conduct sufficient “end-to-end” testing of the entire system before the launch.

“The system didn’t receive adequate end-to-end testing,” declared Andrew Slavitt of Optum, while Cheryl Campbell of CGI Federal added “no one ever gets enough time for testing.”

Campbell, whose company has a contract worth a possible total of more than $200 million for its work on the system, noted than an end-to-end test conducted within two weeks of the launch caused the system to crash. She said it was up to CMS to decide on proceeding with the rollout.

Slavitt, whose company stands to make up to $85 million for its work, acknowledged that unexpected volume at the start overwhelmed the “enterprise identity management” or EIDM entry portal blamed for the initial blockages.

He and Campbell blamed a decision by CMS within two weeks of the launch to require users to fully register in order to browse for health insurance products, instead of being able to get information anonymously, as originally planned.

While the technical change to require registration was easy, the result was a much greater burden on the system that it failed to handle, Slavitt and Campbell said.

Insurers pledge to help solve website problems

Bataille of CMS called the change a business decision to ensure that users could fully enroll from the start. She blamed the initial problems of the website on “pent up consumer demand.”

However, Slavitt of Optum said CMS was warned about the system’s problems ahead of the launch.

That was enough for GOP Rep. Renee Ellmers of North Carolina to say: “The bottom line here is that CMS is responsible for this failure.”

At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney told reporters on Thursday that administration officials “did not anticipate, we did not know of the kind of problems that would take place beginning on October 1 until October 1 came and we saw these challenges.”

He repeated the President’s insistence that the problems were being fixed, an assurance also provided by Bataille.

“We increased our bandwidth by adding servers and improving site architecture. We’re continuing this work,” she said. “Problems wtih our database and system synchronization also made it hard for visitors to initially create accounts. So we improved site architecture, substituted in hardware and optimized database inquiries.”

White House video makes HealthCare.gov issues seem simple

Sebelius offered a similar view while addressing reporters in Arizona, acknowledging continued issues while insisting “fixes” are being instituted regularly to make things better.

“It’s better today than it was on October 1, but it’s a long way from perfect,” Sebelius said after visiting one of 17 call centers where some 10,000 representatives talk by phone or online with those asking about health plans. “And we are determined to make it perfect.”

Campbell blames initial problems on the “enterprise identity management” function known as EIDM that serves as the entry portal to the website.

Her company expects the online system to be able to enroll Americans seeking health insurance by January 1, she added, rejecting media reports that software needs to be scrapped or that five million lines of code must be rewritten.

Campbell called the software program unprecedented, noting that “for the first time in history” it combines the process of enrolling and selecting health insurance with determining eligibility for government subsidies “all in one place.”

Sebelius on the spot in Obamacare website fiasco

The EIDM tool designed by another contractor, which Campbell’s advance testimony doesn’t name, “created a bottleneck that prevented the vast majority of users from accessing” Healthcare.gov when it opened, according to Campbell.

However, Republicans said they had failed to gain full access to the website despite repeated attempts and complained they hear similar stories from their constituents across the country.

Gupta: 5 surprises from Sebelius interview

Sebelius: Website problems blindsided President

The latter sent an eight-page letter Wednesday to 11 contracting firms involved in putting together HealthCare.gov giving them two days to provide documents, meeting lists and all communications with the Obama administration on the project, committee spokeswoman Caitlin Carroll said.

Meanwhile, Republican Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah and Chuck Grassley of Iowa sent a letter to 47 contractors on Thursday also seeking extensive details of their work on the Obamacare website including all contracts and other information.

Congressional Republicans have sought to undermine the health care reforms, trying unsuccessfully to make defunding or delaying them a requirement for legislation to fund the government.

Sebelius: Website problems blindsided President

The White House has been pushing back against not just Republicans, but some Democrats who have urged an extension of the open enrollment period beyond March 31 and/or a delay in penalties for those who don’t sign up for insurance on time because of the website issues.

The Obama administration is moving to clarify confusion on when people need to sign up for health care, and it has plans to issue new guidelines to this point soon.

Still, Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters insisted “the individual mandate timing” – i.e. the requirement for a person to have insurance by March – “has not changed. … It was true this morning. It is true tonight.”

After wading through some gratuitous attacks on Hasselbeck for her conservative views, Tricia Romano then focuses squarely on McCarthy and her activism with regard to the scientifically dubious connections between autism and diet and vaccinations.

Since 2007, McCarthy has been a vocal opponent of the chemicals in vaccinations, credulously citing research (she’s neither a doctor nor a medical professional) and experiences with her autistic son as evidence. (It has also been reported that he may not even have autism, but Landau-Kleffner syndrome.) She has promoted the idea that people are getting an outrageous number of vaccinations today compared with the 1970s or ’80s. According to the book, Autism’s False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure, the amount has only doubled, from seven to 14, to include vaccinations for the flu, hepatitis, and chickenpox among others, in addition to the measles, mumps, polio, tetanus, and others that are standard. McCarthy doesn’t let science and facts get in her way. She has written three books about the subject–Louder Than Words: A Mother’s Journey in Healing Autism, Mother Warriors: A Nation of Parents Healing Autism Against All Odds, and Healing and Preventing Autism, which have all been New York Times bestsellers. She is the president of an autism organization, which is also averse to vaccination, called Generation Rescue. When promoting one of her books, she told Oprah how she learned about autism: “The University of Google is where I got my degree from.”

McCarthy’s opinions on autism and suspected “causes” and “cures” have raised eyebrows in the past, including a legendary appearance on The Larry King Show in 2008. “Give my son the measles! I’ll take that over autism any day,” she yelled at a pediatrician after calling America’s vaccination program “bulls**t.”

Many believe her stances on autism lead parents to have false hope for a “cure” rather than focusing parents on the path of accepting their child’s autism as a part of their unique personality, worthy of respect. They also say McCarthy’s pseudo-science distracts parents from seeking actual help in how to better communicate and interact with their autistic children. As Big Hollywood’s Dana Commandatore points out:

Once again, we’ve learned that celebrities do not have the answers. Sure, they look good on camera and can deliver a line better than average folks, but they are missing out on something important in the case of autism. Parents don’t need pseudo science and anecdotes. They need real life experiences and tried and tested information.

Others criticize the anti-vaccine rhetoric as being responsible for thousands of preventable illnesses and deaths. But, as the Daily Beast points out, McCarthy seems unfazed by the increase in diseases as a result of her efforts:"

Many have been accusing President Obama of breaking his promise: ""If you like it you can keep it."" The president ill-advisedly decided to ""apologize"" in an interview with MSNBC’s Chuck Todd.

On Thursday the president gave an extensive news conference. Republicans may have been caught flat-footed judging from the less-than-inflammatory rhetoric that followed. Maybe they thought the president would have to resort to legislation that they would be able to politicize and block.

The fix the president has instituted is rather ingenious. More importantly it immediately ensured that Congress, the insurance companies, and the American citizens absorb responsibility for the solution.

The president said, ""Insurers can extend current plans that otherwise would be canceled into 2014 and Americans whose plans have been canceled can choose to re-enroll in the same kind of plan."" He then said, ""This fix won't solve every problem for every person, but it's going to help a lot of people. Doing more would require work with Congress.""

The president’s fix allows insurance companies to extend the cancelled policies even if they do not conform to the Affordable Care Act for one year. The insurance companies cannot enroll new customers into the substandard policies. The insurance companies are also required to inform the purchasers of these substandard policies that they may qualify for federal subsidies only through the exchanges. They must disclose that these policies do not have the consumer protections that all new insurance policies must have. They must also inform them that they may qualify for Medicaid,

President Clinton was the master of triangulation. Unfortunately while he seemed to win at triangulation, the poor and the middle class usually became its victim (e.g., Glass-Steagall, welfare reform, supply side economics). This move by President Obama if allowed to go through is how a masterful triangulation should be effected.

More on the president and the insurance companies below the fold."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

The loony legions that drive Republican primary elections now are driving the United States toward calamity.

Weirdly, the continuing funding resolution that the Republicans have refused to pass is a seriously conservative budget plan far closer to what House Budget Committee Chairman Paul D. Ryan asked for than what President Obama would have liked. But, instead of claiming a victory for fiscal conservatism, the Republicans’ right-wing absolutists have refused to pass the continuing resolution unless it includes provisions to cripple or kill the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare.

On the very day that Obamacare’s new insurance market is opening to make healthcare affordable to millions of Americans who have gone without it, the GOP radicals still think they can bring the system down. In this, they are clearly deluded, given that the Senate and the White House are under the control of the people who created healthcare reform, but, then, their whole crusade is built on fantastical thinking.

From the very start of the healthcare debate that began after Obama’s inauguration in 2009, the tea party Republicans have believed some preposterous things. Most famous of all was the big brouhaha about “death panels,” those fictitious boards of bureaucrats who tea party types claimed would be empowered by Obamacare to kill off grandpas and grannies. But there were many other untruths and, from a long list assembled by Politifact, here are just a few:

Advertisement

• The Affordable Health Care Act is a scheme to ration care, just like the systems in Canada and the United Kingdom. The truth, of course, is that Obamacare leaves American healthcare in the hands of the insurance industry. That is why many people on the left do not like it. They would much prefer a single-payer plan like Canadians have.

• Muslims are exempt from the healthcare law. This whopper made the rounds in right-wing blogs and talk shows. Of course, it’s utterly absurd.

• All non-U.S. citizens, including illegals, will get free healthcare. Another bit of pure mendacity from the tea party blogosphere.

• Under Obamacare, “75% of small businesses now say they are going to be forced to either fire workers or cut their hours.” Florida’s GOP Sen. Marco Rubio said that and many have repeated it, but it ain’t so. A U.S. Chamber of Commerce survey indicates less than 10% of small businesses will cut hours or get rid of workers because of Obamacare.

• Obamacare will place a sales tax on real estate transactions, send out government agents for forced home inspections and produce the largest tax increase in the history of the world. These claims from right-wing emails and talk radio fantasists are completely false.

Does it matter that almost all the right-wing opposition to Obamacare is based on lies and exaggerations? Politically, it doesn’t matter at all. If the base of the Republican Party gets behind a string of crazy ideas, do not count on the politicians who seek their votes to correct them. On the contrary, they will make those delusions their own and fight for them, no matter the cost to the country.

Better to shut down a government, after all, than to risk the wrath of the tea party in the next election."

—

—

The president is lying though omission there. The argument that health care costs aren’t as high as the worst nightmare scenarios predicted does not mean costs are going down, even though that is what Obama is trying to hustle people into believing. The fact is, is that while pushing his health care plan, Obama promised premiums would go down for a family of four by at least $2400 per year. The reality, however, is that costs will increase by almost two times that amount.

For example, while Obama pointed to a reduction in premiums in New York state, state officials in Ohio say the average premium proposal for individual coverage next year is up 88 percent from this year’s average price as reported by the Society of Actuaries. In Maryland, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield proposed a 25 percent increase in premiums next year, after first seeking a 50 percent increase. Final rates haven’t been determined in either state.

The higher rates, supporters say, buy a health insurance system that guarantees access to coverage for everyone and improves benefits, such as requiring insurers to cover older children and outlawing lifetime spending limits on claims.

Obama did a good job injecting a little energy into the 100th time he’s given a speech that has already failed 99 times. But attacking Fox News by name is just another example of the smallness of a man who seems to delight in making his office smaller in the eyes of the country and his country smaller in the eyes of the world.

Three years after President Obama’s landmark law was passed, the state unveiled the first details Thursday on what many Californians can expect to pay for coverage from 13 health plans offering policies in the state’s exchange, in which as many as 5 million people will shop for coverage next year.

Developments in California are being watched carefully around the country as an important indicator of whether the healthcare law can deliver on its promise to expand health coverage at an affordable price. Many Republicans, insurance executives and other critics of the law have been warning that consumers are in for a shock next year when insurance companies raise rates to comply with the law’s many new requirements.

Supporters were upbeat after an initial look at the proposed premiums, while critics remain unimpressed.

“These rates are way below the worst-case gloom-and-doom scenarios we have heard,” said Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California, the state agency implementing the healthcare law. “But let’s be clear, some consumers will have prices that go up. There may be some sticker shock.”

The new government-run market is aimed at many of the state’s uninsured and at Californians who already purchase their own health insurance. The majority of Californians receive health coverage from their employers and are not among those targeted for enrollment.

The health plans selected by the state will sell uniform benefits, each offering four broad categories of coverage called Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze.

Platinum policies will offer the most comprehensive benefits and carry the highest prices, followed by Gold, Silver and Bronze. The Bronze package will have the lowest premiums, but people would be on the hook for a greater share of their medical bills. The rates revealed Thursday still must be reviewed by state regulators.

Within each of those four benefit categories, plans will have the same co-pays, deductibles and limits on out-of-pocket medical expenses.

As a result, consumers will be able to compare insurance prices in their regions more easily, once these rates are finalized by July.

Consumers shopping in the exchange will have three to six health insurance plans to choose from in each of the state’s 19 regions.

In the south Los Angeles County region, for instance, rates for a 40-year-old purchasing a Silver plan ranged from $242 a month through Health Net Inc. to $325 a month through Kaiser Permanente. Overall, Los Angeles County had the lowest premiums statewide for the Silver plans.

The average premium for individual plans sold through EHealthInsurance in California last year was $177 a month. Covered California said the average premium for the three lowest Silver plans statewide was $321 a month, albeit for more comprehensive benefits.

Overall, state officials said they can’t estimate yet how much rates will rise on average. Blue Shield of California, one of the winning bidders in the exchange, said its existing individual policyholders would pay about 13% more, on average, for coverage in the state marketplace.

These rates “came in below what people legitimately expected them to be,” said Paul Markovich, Blue Shield’s chief executive.

Comparing the proposed rates for next year with current premiums is difficult, officials and experts agree, because the healthcare law mandates next year’s plans to offer richer benefits and to limit consumers’ out-of-pocket expenses.

Democrats in Washington were quick to hold up California’s announcement as a sign that the federal healthcare law is working and bringing a healthy dose of competition to a dysfunctional insurance market in which millions of people have been denied coverage because of their medical history or subjected to punishing rate hikes year after year.

Most Republican-led states have resisted the healthcare law and declined to set up their own state exchanges. Instead, they have opted for the federal government to step in.

Starting in January, most Americans must have health insurance or pay a penalty under the federal law.

Some industry experts said California’s outlook on rates remains far too optimistic in light of the hefty increases some consumers will see.

“California has no right to declare victory on rates,” said Robert Laszewski, a healthcare consultant in Virginia. He said the sample premiums released by Covered California were about 50% higher than rates for the most commonly sold health plans in the individual market primarily because of increased benefit requirements. “If rates come in higher, it speaks to the sustainability of the Affordable Care Act.”

Federal premium subsidies will ease the bite on many people’s wallets. In California, individuals earning less than about $16,000 a year will qualify for an expansion of Medi-Cal, the state’s Medicaid program for the poor. Above that threshold, individuals making less than $46,000 a year and families earning below $94,000 annually will qualify for federal subsidies.

One of the bigger risks is that high premiums turn off healthier, middle-income households that aren’t eligible for that federal assistance and have to pay the full premium. Rates could skyrocket if the exchange fails to enroll enough of those people to offset the higher costs of sicker, poorer policyholders.

Katharine King, 59 and a self-employed concert and event producer in Santa Monica, already pays $497 a month for her individual health insurance from Anthem Blue Cross. She wouldn’t qualify for federal premium help based on her income. Using the state’s online calculator, which doesn’t yet reflect the final rates, her premiums could shoot up to nearly $600 a month next year.

“The Affordable Care Act is still not all that affordable unless you qualify for a federal subsidy, which I will not,” King said. “It will likely be another case of the middle class kind of getting screwed.”

Alfredo Ceron, 44, an uninsured painter in Los Angeles, has less to worry about with these rates. He said he earns about $100 a day when he has work, which means the federal government would pick up most of the tab for him and his two adult children who still live at home.

“I’d like to get my family covered,” he said while waiting in line at a recent downtown festival to get more information about the new insurance options.

The 13 health plans selected by the state include all four of California’s largest insurance companies. They are Kaiser Permanente, Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Shield and Health Net.

The other nine health plans selected were smaller regional players and insurers that have traditionally served lower-income and Medi-Cal patients. They are Alameda Alliance for Health, Chinese Community Health Plan, Contra Costa Health Services, L.A. Care Health Plan, Molina Healthcare, Sharp Health Plan, Valley Health Plan, Ventura County Health Care Plan and Western Health Advantage.

In Los Angeles County, which was divided into two regions, six companies will compete for policyholders. They are Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Shield, Health Net, Kaiser Permanente, L.A. Care and Molina.

California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said he was troubled by the lack of choice in some markets. “There are only three statewide health insurers selling in Covered California,” Jones said, “which means less statewide competition than we’d hoped to see in the new marketplace.”

Brown to Sign Bill Legalizing Non-Physician Abortions in CA,"A bill that would allow non-physicians to perform abortions in the first trimester of pregnancy is awaiting signature by Gov. Jerry Brown of California by Sep. 30. The bill, AB 154, passed both houses of the state legislature with strong support from Planned Parenthood and pro-choice groups. Planned Parenthood stands to benefit most directly from the bill, as non-physician staff at its clinics would be able to obtain abortion licenses.

One doctor–who identified himself as pro-choice–told Breitbart News that “the bill is a disaster since it sends us back 100 years to the problems of the complications from back-steet abortions.” The bill’s critics warn that the training provided to non-physician staff is weak, that supervision by physicians in clinics will be minimal, and that there is real risk of injury or death to women who will be treated in such conditions.

The California Medical Association has endorsed AB 154 because of “provisions for training in the bill and the amendments that clarify physician supervision.” Yet the training is to be provided by the Board of Registered Nursing, not by physicians, and the protocols for defining “supervision” have not been specified. There is nothing in the legislation requiring a physician to be present or on-site during an abortion.

The bill permits licensed non-physicians to perform two kinds of abortion in the first trimester–by medication, and by aspiration, which requires the insertion of medical instruments into the uterus. Though many doctors agree that non-physicians could provide medications with few risks, the idea that a non-physician would perform an invasive procedure such as aspiration strikes many as rife with risks.

Debate about AB 154, which was introduced by California State Assembly Majority Leader Toni Atkins (D-San Diego), has been muted in a state that pro-choice advocates see as sympathetic to their cause. The Los Angeles Times came out strongly in favor of the measure in an editorial on September 3, arguing that it does not pose safety risks and that it could increase access to abortion services for women early in pregnancy:

In underserved urban areas, women face delays in getting medical appointments at clinics. When a woman can’t get an abortion in the first trimester, she may end up getting one in the later stages of pregnancy, which can mean a more complicated and more expensive abortion.

Advocates of AB 154 also argue that other states have allowed non-physicians to perform abortions safely, including in Planned Parenthood clinics.

Opponents describe AB 154 as an effort by Planned Parenthood and other groups to profit from Obamacare, since the legislation will expand the number of patients eligible for the state Medi-Cal program, and Medi-Cal pays for abortion. They also dispute assurances about the bill’s safety for women, arguing that there has been inadequate monitoring of California abortion clinics even prior to the passage of the new legislation."

CGI official%27s testimony says high demand caused problems

House Republicans have cited problems with site as signs of law%27s flaws

White House held meeting Wednesday with top insurance company executives

WASHINGTON — High demand for health insurance coupled with confusion between contractors led to many of the problems that have plagued the HealthCare.gov website meant to allow uninsured Americans to buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act, an official with the top contractor will say in prepared testimony to a House panel Thursday.

Cheryl Campbell, senior vice president of CGI Federal, said in advance testimony for her scheduled Thursday appearance before the House Energy and Commerce Committee that another contractor was responsible for the technology that allowed users to create new accounts and which caused the initial bottleneck issues on the site.

Still, Campbell said, CGI is responsible for some of the problems, too.

""Now, as more and more users have been able to proceed to the (exchange) over the past several days, more individuals have enrolled in qualified insurance plans,"" Campbell's prepared testimony says. ""However, the increased number of transactions in the (exchange) have caused system performance issues (such as slow response times or data assurance issues) that now need to be addressed through tuning, optimization, and application improvements.""

Members of the Republican-led House and committee said they want to know why, after the Government Accountability Office issued a report saying the exchange was behind schedule, federal officials launched it anyway.

""Despite such issues, HHS officials repeatedly assured the public that implementation was progressing on time and as intended,"" according to a committee memo about the hearing.

Along with Campbell, other witnesses include officials from contractors associated with the launch, including Optum/QSSI, Equifax Workforce Solutions and Serco.

John Lau, contract representative for Serco, plans to testify that his company has processed about 8,000 paper applications since Oct. 2.

Andrew Slavitt of Optum will testify that while the Data Services Hub that they built is working properly, and that it has handled hundreds of thousands of operations a day, the tool that allows people to register is made up of several pieces from many different contractors.

""Many of the critical components developed by these multiple vendors were overwhelmed — the virtual data center environment, the software, the database system, and the hardware, as well as our (registration) tool,"" Slavitt's advance testimony says. ""It appears that one of the reasons for the high concurrent volume at the registration system was a late decision requiring consumers to register for an account before they could browse for insurance products.""

The Obama administration Wednesday created a series of ""alpha teams"" with insurance companies after a meeting between Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, industry executives and White House officials.

The teams, Sebelius said in a statement after the meeting, consist of ""insurers' technology experts and CMS technology experts, to iron out kinks in the both the (enrollment) forms and in direct enrollment."" They are part of ""the 'tech surge' that is incrementally improving performance at HealthCare.Gov.""

CGI's contract

CGI has caught the brunt of the blame, as analysts have begun to question how their initial $93.7 million contract was awarded, as well as the flood of new money they received in April.

The company's contract to create HealthCare.gov spun from an existing 2007 contract, federal contract records show.

Scott Amey, general counsel for the Project on Government Oversight, said it was a multiple-vendor contract, or delivery order. Usually, the government issues a call for proposals publicly and allows any company to bid. But in cases where they use the same goods over and over again — such as office equipment or paint — they have several vendors who are preapproved to supply what the government needs, such as information technology.

It's something the government has done for many years, Amey said.

The government often benefits from the arrangement because contractors make lower bids because they know they will receive more work in the future, Amey said.

CGI has received more than $2.5 billion in federal contracts, he said.

""Time was of the essence to get this thing up and running,"" Amey said. ""This is the exact reason you would use this kind of contracting vehicle.""

Republican committee members said they plan to ask if the problems are long-term, how many people have been able to sign up for the new health exchange, why the exchange was allowed to roll out if the administration knew there were problems and what, exactly, are the problems with the website.

Along with the preparation for the hearing, there was some movement in Congress to extend the March 31 deadline by which uninsured Americans have to buy insurance through the exchanges.

Legislators seek extension

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., sent a letter Tuesday asking that the deadline to enroll be extended past March 31. Those who do not enroll by that day may be required to pay a fine through their 2014 taxes. Republican Marco Rubio of Florida has also asked that the requirement to buy insurance be delayed, and Sen Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said Wednesday he was researching a similar proposal.

Despite the website's problems in its first three weeks of operation, many potential insurance customers often wait until closer to the deadline, said Jonathan Gruber, an economist at MIT who worked with both former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney's and President Obama's health care laws.

Massachusetts launched its health insurance program ""at the beginning of 2007,"" Gruber said, ""but enrollment didn't fully flesh out for a year."" In fact, it was less than 6% of the year's total by the end of the second month. ""But the mandate didn't come into place until the end of the year, and you could sign up any time.""

That differs from the federal and state exchanges; people must sign up by Dec. 15 to receive insurance by Jan. 1, and by March 31 to avoid a fine for violating the individual mandate portion of the law. The March 31 date is a concession to insurers, who feared that allowing open enrollment would mean people would sign up for insurance as they were diagnosed with an illness.

But Gruber, a proponent of the individual mandate, doesn't see any reason to panic about the federal exchange problems — yet. Now, he described the situation as ""DEFCON 1,"" a political problem, but probably not a problem yet for the marketplace.

""If it's not running by Thanksgiving, that's DEFCON 2,"" he said. ""It's a real problem because people want to get insurance by January, but it's not a crisis.

""The real crisis comes if people can't get insurance until March,"" he said, adding that people can enroll over the phone or by paper now.

In Massachusetts, Gruber said officials weren't focused on how well enrollment went on a day-to-day basis. They looked at the long-term potential, and expected that people would sign up in time to avoid the penalty.

""I'm pretty confident they'll have it up and going by Thanksgiving,"" he said."

Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania listens to discussions about state and federal tax reform, during the committees meeting at the NGA 2013 Winter Meeting in Washington on Saturday, Feb. 23, 2013. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)

Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett (R) announced last month that he would reject Medicaid expansion -- a key provision of President Barack Obama's health care reform law that would have made health care available to many more of the state's poorest residents.

A new study has found that Corbett's decision might end up costing the state hundreds of millions of dollars.

Expanding Medicaid in Pennsylvania would have increased the annual amount of money the state receives from the federal government by around $2 billion, adding about $200 million in state revenue every year, according to a new study by the RAND Corporation, the nation's largest independent health policy research program.

The study's findings contradict remarks made by the governor during his budget address last month when he said that “without serious reforms, [Medicaid expansion] would be financially unsustainable for the taxpayers.""

Had Pennsylvania opted into Medicaid expansion, the state would have received around $6 billion in federal funding for health care programs in 2014, according to the study. That's $2 billion more than it will receive without expanding Medicaid. The increase in funding would have added 35,000 jobs and provided a $3 billion boost in economic activity, according to the study.

“This is money that is coming into the state that wouldn’t otherwise,” RAND mathematician and lead study author Carter Price told The Huffington Post. “There are certainly substantive benefits, in that you have more people covered, more revenue coming in the state and more jobs.”

But Price cautions that the economic benefits of Medicaid expansion under Obamacare will eventually come with a cost. Starting in 2017, the federal government will begin to pay less of the state costs of the expansion, causing Pennsylvania's revenue increases to decline over time."

Frank'],What Sweden Can Tell Us About Obamacare,"LAST month, for the 37th time, the House of Representatives voted to repeal Obamacare, with many Republicans saying that its call for greater government involvement in the health care system spells doom. Yet most other industrial countries have health care systems with far more government involvement than we are ever likely to see under Obamacare. What does their experience tell us about Republican fears?

While in Sweden this month as a visiting scholar, I’ve asked several Swedish health economists to share their thoughts about that question. They have spent their lives under a system in which most health care providers work directly for the government. Like economists in most other countries, they tend to be skeptical of large bureaucracies. So if extensive government involvement in health care is indeed a recipe for doom, they should have clear evidence of that by now.

Yet none of them voiced the kinds of complaints about recalcitrant bureaucrats and runaway health costs that invariably surface in similar conversations with American colleagues. Little wonder. The Swedish system performs superbly, and my Swedish colleagues cited evidence of that fact with obvious pride.

The United States spends more than $8,000 a person per year on health care, well more than twice what Sweden spends. Yet health outcomes are far better in Sweden along virtually every dimension. Its infant mortality rate, for example, was recently less than half that of the United States. And males aged 15 to 60 are almost twice as likely to die in any given year in the United States than in Sweden."

The Obama administration confirmed Monday that Michelle Snyder, the No. 2 official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, is leaving her post. The departure was announced by CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner.

Though Republicans, and some Democrats, have been calling for heads to roll over the botched launch of the program, and particularly HealthCare.gov, it's unclear whether Snyder's resignation at this point was already planned.

Tavenner claimed that Snyder originally was preparing to leave a year ago but ""characteristically chose to postpone her retirement from federal service at my request to help me with the challenges facing CMS in 2013.""

The statement from Tavenner included no criticism of Snyder's performance over the past year. She praised her ""41 years of outstanding public service.""

Tavenner added: ""While the agency is losing a key member of its leadership team, we should celebrate Michelle's dedication to a mission that provides vital health care services to tens of millions of our fellow Americans through the Medicare and Medicaid programs.""

While Snyder is not a well-known official, her name surfaced in connection with the botched rollout during an Oct. 30 hearing. At the time, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius revealed that Snyder -- as chief operating officer -- was in charge of the launch. But then, under questioning from Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., Sebelius tried to shoulder the blame.

""Michelle Snyder is the one responsible for this debacle?"" Blackburn asked.

""Well, excuse me, Congresswoman,"" Sebelius answered. ""Michelle Snyder is not responsible for the debacle. Hold me accountable for the debacle. I'm responsible.""

Despite widespread technical problems and meager enrollment at the outset, the administration announced that the number of enrollees through the health care site has surpassed 1 million.

Jerry Brown’s claim that California has improved its mental healthcare for inmates enough to end 17 years of court oversight, a victory for prisoners’ lawyers who say they will use it to seek further sanctions against the state.

U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton’s 68-page decision is a blow to Brown’s larger ambition to halt court control of California’s entire prison medical program and to remove court limits on the prison population. Courts have cited overcrowding as the main reason the state has failed to provide basic medical and mental healthcare.

Brown has vowed to take his case for restoring state control to the same U.S. Supreme Court that less than two years ago said California prison conditions amounted to cruel and unusual punishment.

A spokeswoman for Brown’s corrections department called Friday’s ruling “unfortunate,” saying it failed to give appropriate weight to the state’s paid experts, who said adequate improvements had been made in housing and treating mentally ill prisoners.

Karlton tossed out that core evidence, saying it was based on “tainted” reports crafted in secret. He accused California’s lawyers of unprofessional conduct by allowing the state’s paid experts to question inmates about the care they were receiving without telling their lawyers. The questions were intended to bolster the state’s legal case, Karlton wrote.

“There was nothing unethical” about the state’s assessment, corrections spokeswoman Deborah Hoffman said in a prepared statement. “We will appeal this decision and are confident that we will prevail.”

Karlton found that “ongoing constitutional violations remain,” including failure to act on suicide-prevention methods recommended by the court’s special master and one of the state’s own experts. What gains California has made in reducing waiting lists for seriously ill inmates to receive psychiatric care “are new, and work remains,” he said.

The judge found climbing suicide rates, shortages of mental health crisis beds and mental health workers, in addition to inadequate treatment space, despite years of planning, amounting to what he termed “deliberate indifference.”

Court records show that Brown’s surprise Jan. 7 motion to end federal oversight had been in the works since at least late 2011. The motion triggered a 90-day deadline for a ruling, leaving inmate lawyers roughly 10 weeks to hire experts, tour prisons and build their opposing case and giving Karlton a matter of days to weigh thousands of pages of contradictory depositions.

Lawyers representing more than 32,000 mentally ill inmates said the governor’s failed effort may backfire on him. They said it reopened access to prisons and shed light on new problems.

Those include a mental ward where most of the psychiatrists have quit, the use of cages to hold inmates for therapy sessions and the isolation of mentally ill inmates in punitive segregation cells.

“We will be moving for additional relief to fix problems we weren’t focused on,” said Michael Bien, lead lawyer for inmates in the 23-year-old class-action lawsuit that triggered federal oversight.

Advertisement

The state’s experts contended that, after touring 13 of California’s 33 prisons, they found that conditions, while imperfect, met the minimum adequate care required under the U.S. Constitution and were continuing to improve.

Documents filed in the case provided a glimpse of the Brown administration’s thinking — that it was saddled with a judge who “hated” the state and with battles it couldn’t win against a court-appointed special master over 120 detailed aspects of care. In addition, Sacramento was paying $7 million a year to fund that scrutiny.

The court papers include a five-page December 2011 strategy memo written by Jeffrey Beard, the retired chief of Pennsylvania prisons hired as a consultant to the Brown administration. In the memo, Beard told state lawyers he believed California was close to making the case that the state met the standard for six basic areas of care.

A year later, Brown named Beard as his new corrections chief.

Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., asked again whether she had any idea what the numbers are.

More On This...

Her answer was the same.

""I'll take that as you don't want to answer the question,"" Nunes said.

Earlier in the hearing, Tavenner tried to downplay expectations. Facing ongoing problems with the enrollment website, Tavenner told Congress that ""we expect the initial numbers to be small.""

An internal memo obtained by The Associated Press shows that the administration expected nearly 500,000 people to gain coverage just in October, the program's first month. If the administration is short of that target, it is unclear by how much.

Tavenner, though, vowed to fix the troubled exchange website by the end of November.

""To the millions who have attempted to use HealthCare.gov to shop and enroll in health care coverage, I want to apologize to you that the website has not worked as well as it should,"" she said. ""We know how desperately you need affordable coverage. I want to assure you that HealthCare.gov can and will be fixed.""

The apology would appear to be the first by an administration official.

Tavenner's testimony precedes that of Sebelius, who is expected to appear before a separate House committee on Wednesday. As Tavenner testified, calls were mounting from Republicans for Sebelius to resign.

Significantly, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., speaking on the Senate floor, called Tuesday for Sebelius' resignation. Alexander is the top Republican on the Senate health panel.

""Mr. President, at some point there has to be accountability. Expecting this secretary to be able to fix what she hasn't been able to fix during the last three-and-a-half years is unrealistic,"" he said. ""It's throwing good money after bad. It's time for her to resign -- someone else to take charge.""

In written testimony released ahead of Wednesday's hearing, Sebelius vowed to improve the website and said the consumer experience to date is ""not acceptable."" But she defended the law itself and said extensive work and testing is being done.

""We are working to ensure consumers' interaction with HealthCare.gov is a positive one, and that the Affordable Care Act fully delivers on its promise,"" she said in the prepared remarks.

Republicans were also voicing concern Tuesday about Americans being kicked off their current health plans, and newly uncovered documents that show the administration anticipated millions might lose their current coverage and be sent into different plans -- despite pledges to the contrary from the White House.

U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill ruled late Wednesday in favor of Jennie Linn McCormack, who was 33 at the time she decided to challenge the state's so-called fetal pain law and other abortion laws.

Idaho was one of seven states to adopt fetal pain laws in 2011, following in the footsteps of Nebraska's approval of the law in 2010. But those laws are no longer the most restrictive. This week, lawmakers in Arkansas overrode a veto of a near-ban on the abortion procedure starting from the 12th week of pregnancy.

In his 42-page decision, Winmill sided with McCormack and her attorney, Richard Hearn, declaring Idaho's fetal pain law places an undue burden on a woman's right to have an abortion. The judge also took the Legislature -- dominated by Republicans in both chambers -- to task for the motives driving adoption of the law, finding that efforts to protect a fetus don't outweigh a women's right to choose.

The judge found ""compelling evidence of the legislature's `improper purpose' in enacting it,"" Winmill wrote. ""The state may not rely on its interest in the potential life of the fetus to place a substantial obstacle to abortion before viability in women's paths,"" he said.

The ruling also finds unconstitutional at least two other Idaho laws dealing with abortion that Hearn and McCormack also challenged.

One is Idaho's requirement that first-trimester abortions be performed by a physician in a staffed office or clinic, a law that makes most drug-induced abortions, such as RU-486, illegal. The ruling also targets a law requiring that second-trimester abortions be performed in a hospital and a statute that criminalizes the woman in some cases for undergoing the procedure.

""Historically, abortion statutes sought to protect pregnant females from third parties providing dangerous abortions,"" Winmill wrote. ""As a result, most states' abortion laws traditionally criminalized the behavior of third parties to protect the health of pregnant women -- they did not punish women for obtaining an abortion. By punishing women, Idaho's abortion statute is therefore unusual.""

McCormack originally filed her lawsuit in federal court against Bannock County's prosecuting attorney on grounds the new fetal pain law was unconstitutional. She initially sought class-action status against prosecutor Mark Hiedeman, who filed criminal charges against her alleging she had an illegal abortion.

McCormack was charged after police began investigating after finding a fetus in a box in January 2011. An autopsy determined it was between five and six months gestation. Police said McCormack told them she didn't have enough money to go to a licensed medical professional, so her sister helped her access abortion-inducing drugs online.

A judge later dismissed the criminal case without prejudice for lack of evidence, but left open the possibility for prosecutors to refile.

In her lawsuit, McCormack challenged the lack of access to abortions for women in her region, as well as the ban on abortions after 20 weeks.

She noted there are no elective-abortion providers in southeastern Idaho, forcing women seeking the procedure to travel elsewhere.

McCormack was unmarried and unemployed at the time of her pregnancy -- with an income of $200 to $250 a month -- and already had three children. She couldn't afford the time or money it would take to travel to Salt Lake City to get an abortion, the lawsuit says."

By Caroline Humer

NEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Americans hitting roadblocks on the new U.S. government-run healthcare website have been contacting insurers directly and enrolling in plans away from the federal marketplace, representing a lost opportunity for President Barack Obama's landmark reform.

Since its launch on Oct. 1, technical problems have stalled Healthcare.gov, the website meant to help millions of uninsured Americans sign up for coverage as part of the biggest U.S. social program since Medicare plans for the elderly launched in the 1960s.

Nearly a dozen insurance companies offering plans on the exchange who were interviewed by Reuters say they have received at most a trickle of enrollments through the federal marketplace serving 36 states, some of them with errors that require the insurers to separately verify information about applicants.

At the same time, consumer inquiries at insurance company call centers and websites are up, in some case even double the amount of normal traffic. When they hear from potential customers who appear to qualify for government subsidized plans, they take phone numbers, create shopping baskets for the plans they like and send them to Healthcare.gov to verify eligibility.

But if the shoppers do not qualify for a subsidy, insurers say they sell them a plan directly. More often than not, those plans are individual policies that are not available on the government-run exchange.

PHONES RINGING 'OFF THE HOOK'

Health First Health Plans in Florida, one of nine insurers selling individual plans in the state through Healthcare.gov, has sold only a handful of exchange-based plans through the government marketplace.

But its phones have been ringing ""off the hook"" since Oct. 1, said Jason Alford, director of individual and marketplace sales. Many of the sales are for plans that extend coverage from 2013 into 2014 and that do not include many of the government program's most significant benefit requirements.

""We have begun taking a number of off-exchange applications,"" Alford said.

A chain of five Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance plans, including BCBS of Texas and BCBS of Oklahoma, said it is also sending buyers who qualify for subsidies to the exchange, while those who do not qualify for subsidies have been buying off exchange plans more often.

""I'm very hopeful that individuals will come back and purchase the product,"" said Kurt Kossen, vice president of retail at parent company Health Care Service Corp, referring to customers who get information about a plan but do not buy it on the spot.

The move off exchanges is another way in which the Healthcare.gov problems may jeopardize the administration's efforts to sign up as many as 7 million Americans for coverage on the exchanges in their first year, including an estimated 2.7 million young and healthy members needed to make the system work financially.

The administration and the contractors it has hired say they are working around the clock to fix the problems. The government said on Thursday that about 700,000 applications have been submitted so far for coverage through Healthcare.gov and 14 insurance exchanges run by states.

The loss of potential customers could become more critical if the federal exchange is not fixed in time for an expected influx of enrollments by Dec. 15, the last day to sign up and have benefits available on Jan. 1.

Dan Mendelson, Chief Executive Officer at Avalere Health, which has been tracking the exchanges closely, said although he expects the Healthcare.gov problems to be solved, ""There is a void right now and the void is being filled in many cases by insurers engaging directly with patients.""

He said that ""ultimately there will be a modest uptick in the off-exchange products as a result of this.""

WHITE HOUSE PROMISES FIX

White House officials on Wednesday met with chief executives of 12 leading insurance companies, including Aetna Inc, Humana Inc and WellPoint Inc. The administration promised to fix problems with enrollment data sent to the health plans and address issues that have prevented insurers from directly enrolling consumers who are eligible for subsidies.

For some small insurers selling only on the exchange, the technology issues have affected all of their business. Community First Health Plans in San Antonio, Texas said that it was still experiencing technical problems and that the volume of sales was small. Community Health Choice in Houston, Texas said sales from the federal exchange had been slow.

""I see that every day the system is getting a little bit easier,"" said Daisy Morales, vice president of marketing and outreach.

Some insurers are selling 2013 plans that extend into 2014 and do not have all the benefits required by the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly called ""Obamacare,"" making them less costly.

As a result, a shift to off-exchange products could signal that more healthy consumers will not be part of the Obamacare exchanges.

In the first year of the exchanges, insurers are reimbursed by the Obamacare risk adjustment program if they enroll very sick people. The more people in the pool, the lower the risk, and in the health insurance market, lower risk has meant more competition and lower premium prices.

""I can't give you a magic number, but insurers need a big enough pool of risk,"" said Jay Angoff, a former official at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services who now works as a lawyer at Mehri & Skalet in Washington DC.

Jefferies & Co analyst David Windley said that a weaker enrollment in Obamacare exchanges, with a final tally of a few million consumers, could mean the risk pool has a higher concentration of sick consumers.

It would mean ""that the healthy ones tried and gave up (on enrollment) and the sick ones were the persistent ones that actually got through the process,"" Windley said.

In 2014, risk adjustment payments would help cover any hit that insurers take because of the sicker population. After that, it could mean higher premiums and therefore more government spending per person on subsidies.

WellPoint Chief Financial Officer Wayne DeVeydt said in an interview that the company, which has the largest presence on exchanges among health insurers, is selling both exchange-based products and off-exchange products from its websites. It sends people eligible for subsidies to Healthcare.gov.

""It messes the timing up a little, just because those off exchange can get in a little bit sooner,"" DeVeydt said. ""It doesn't change the outlook. None of these policies start until Jan. 1 anyway.""

At the same time, WellPoint on Wednesday told investors it would not yet give a forecast for 2014 financial results due to uncertainty over how the Obamacare exchanges will work next year."

On Thursday, the contrite president announced that Americans whose healthcare insurance policies have been canceled due to requirements of the Affordable Care Act would have another year to keep those policies. This new guarantee is meant to make up for his ill-considered promise that no one would lose their old policies if they wanted to keep what they had.

The problem with Obama’s new promise, though, is that he cannot force insurers to restore policies they have already terminated. And rather than doing the president any favors, those insurers are attacking him for trying to change the rules in the middle of the game.

Obama has a mess on his hands and -- judging by his almost daily apologies for the screwed-up launch of the national healthcare exchange website, as well as for his misstatements about the effect of the plan on several million people who buy their own policies -- it is pretty clear he knows how deep the mess has become.

Instead of anyone offering to help him out, though, everyone is piling on.

His fellow Democrats in the House and Senate are panicked, fearing the bad feelings about Obamacare will imperil their chances for reelection. Some are rushing to concoct a bill -- any bill! -- to do something -- anything! -- about healthcare. Their object is not to provide a fix, but to provide political cover. In the words of NBC’s chief White House correspondent, Chuck Todd, Democratic senators and congressmen want to be able to demonstrate to their constituents that they “stood up to the president.”

It may seem strange that Democrats would prefer to run against Obama rather than put in extra effort to make the president’s healthcare plan work, but fear of losing a political career makes politicians do weird things.

Electoral considerations are also what drive the Republican response to Obama’s predicament. Any bad news for the president is good news for them. The last thing they would think of doing is anything constructive to improve America’s healthcare system if doing so would help the president they despise.

The media are running with the story, of course -- not just the permanent opposition at Fox News, but most of the so-called mainstream media. Obamacare’s shaky start is the hot political crisis of the moment and can hardly be ignored. Still, as Rachel Maddow observed on MSNBC Thursday night, Romneycare -- the Massachusetts healthcare scheme that provided the template for Obamacare -- took a year to catch on and no one at the time thought of the early missteps as a huge scandal or proof that the plan would never get off the ground. Politicians in both parties worked to pull it together, and now 97% of the citizens of Massachusetts have healthcare coverage.

Don’t expect anything like that sensible approach with Obamacare. Healthcare is a political football, above all else, at the national level. Obama has blown several big plays and lost a lot of yardage. His own team is not providing much coverage and the other side is lined up, revved up and ready to sack him, steal the ball and put him out of the game."

USATODAY

As of Saturday%2C officials said 50%2C000 people could visit the page at a time

States seeing success are bragging about their accomplishments

Insurers say there are still some concerns

All the glitches won't be gone, but the troubled federal health care website is expected to be working more smoothly on Sunday, the deadline that the administration set for improvements and fixes.

But beyond the HealthCare.gov update, experts say the best predictor for the federal exchange could be state health exchanges, where the technology already operates smoothly.

And though November enrollment numbers for HealthCare.gov are not expected to be released until later this month, a look at state enrollment numbers could hint at their direction, health experts say.

""I think we're already seeing this dichotomy unfold,"" said Stan Dorn, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. ""In California, they're ahead of their own targets.""

Now that officials say the federal website is functioning properly for most Americans, health care proponents — and politicians, including the president, who have staked their careers on the merits of the Affordable Care Act — are hoping for a similar boon for HealthCare.gov's enrollment numbers. As of Saturday, officials said 50,000 people could visit the page at a time, with a potential for 800,000 visitors a day.

After a glitch-filled rollout kept Americans from even attempting to access the federal health insurance plans, federal officials reported that only about 23,000 people signed up for private insurance through HealthCare.gov. And only about 100,000 signed up for private plans through both the federal and state-based exchanges.

But the state numbers quickly began to go up as the states addressed their own website glitches, while at the same time boosting marketing efforts. Early successes included Kentucky, a Republican stronghold that decided to expand Medicaid and build a state-based exchange.

""There is great variation by state,"" Dorn said. ""In states that are enthusiastically implementing the law and trying to implement the state exchanges and trying to increase enrollment, there's going to be greater numbers.""

In other states, such as Oklahoma where there's no mention of the Affordable Care Act on the state website beyond to bash the law, it's going to be a tougher ride, he said.

""There are a lot more resources available in the states that are doing their own exchange,"" Dorn said. Those states received federal funds to market their exchanges.

And, he said, it's easier for one state to handle marketing, technology and enrollment for just one exchange than it is for the federal government to manage all of those issues for the 35 states that chose not to create state-based exchanges.

The states seeing success are bragging about their accomplishments, while at the same time carefully edging around commenting about the problems at the federal site. But they've also been pretty vocal about the problems the state websites faced, too.

""We opened on Oct. 1, and we had an overwhelming volume,"" said Donna Frescatore, executive director of the New York state health exchange. ""In the next three to four days, we quadrupled the capacity of the system, but that was something we planned for.""

As of Tuesday, New York's enrollment numbers showed 76,177 had enrolled in a health plan, up from 48,162 on Nov. 12. And 257,414 people had completed their exchange applications, up from 197,011.

""I think that from the very beginning, we had a very engaged community in New York state,"" Frescatore said. ""We have lots of helpers on the ground.""

Before the launch, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said the states and federal government would share with each other what was working best to get people enrolled.

""We've had ongoing discussions throughout the entire process,"" Frescatore said. ""We think that there are opportunities here for all states and the federal marketplace to gain coverage, so we're certainly supportive.""

New York officials expected 1.1 million to sign up by the end of three years.

""We are at or slightly above target, so we are very pleased,"" Frescatore said.

Tuesday, California said enrollment applications grew from 334,027 as of Nov. 16 to 385,556 as of Nov. 23. Kentucky announced it would add an 80% increase in capacity by Dec. 2, and that more than 60,000 people had enrolled in coverage by Nov. 26. In Washington, more than 150,000 have started applications.





But Oregon still hasn't gotten its website off the ground, so people are manually entering paper applications, and Colorado's exchange is falling behind projections.



Doug Piper, vice president of product strategy at Vision Solutions, a technology protection and disaster recovery provider, said the next step for the federal exchange, even if there's a sudden jump in enrollment, needs to be an aggressive, clear marketing campaign.

""To drive this thing home, you need a Gen. Patton or someone who's going to take no prisoners and drive this project home,"" he said. ""I think confidence needs to be restored, and that comes from articulating a clear, demonstrated plan, and that you can then show your track record. You have to distill that down to some meaningful set of milestones to restore confidence.""

Insurers say there are still some concerns. Karen Ignagni, president of America's Health Insurance Plans, said that while the site continues to improve, she's worried that ""back-end"" issues — or the non-consumer portion of the site that ensures insurers receive subsidy payments — will not be ready by Jan. 1. There have also been problems with ""834"" forms, or the process by which the government gives insurers data about whom they're insuring.

""HealthCare.gov and the overall enrollment process continue to improve, but there are significant issues that still need to be addressed,"" Ignagni said. ""Health plans will continue to support federal and state officials' efforts to fix the ongoing technical problems and improve the direct enrollment process so that consumers can get the coverage they need.""

Julie Bataille, director of the office of communications for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said those back-end processes will be completed by the middle of January, and that officials made an ""intentional decision"" to focus on the consumer end of the website.

Last week, Bataille announced a pilot program where people may enroll directly in the federal program through one of 16 insurers, rather than through the federal website.

""We continue to work with issuers to understand their issues, both as the fixes we put in place improve their processes for things like direct enrollment, and we'll also work with them as we continue to build the system for some of those financial management functions,"" Bataille said."

And what thwarts those plans? It's the far left. It's President Obama and his supporters who will not allow the Republicans to usher in free market, patient-centered, doctor-patient relationship links to reform health care.""

Without even thinking, Palin sprung into action:Got that?

Matt Lauer, clearly not interested in deciphering any of that and not wanting to make her feel bad, simply said ""L-L-Let's move on. Let's talk about Chris Christie? Boy, he had a massive win!""

Really, it was a softball interview and Matt Lauer was an embarrassment. You can't appreciate how bad he was until you listen to him immediately after she said that ball of stupid. She has had months to think of a coherent response to what an alternative would be (and its not like she has had any real work to do). A REAL journalist would have called her out on what she said: ""What plans are you talking about that have been proposed over and over? How is the ACA not free market?""

Or just ""I'm sorry, I didn't understand any of that. What?""

But asking for clarification wouldn't be fair to her fans. After all, this isn't a real news program, its a talk show interview. So let's move on to an easy question. And don't you have a book to plug?

In fact, don't waste your time on the whole interview. The today show is a joke. Just enjoy 1:37-2:31. You will pine for the intellect of Quayle and Bush.

Because as bad as our leaders can be, I am proud to say that at the very least they can put a coherent sentence together."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/opinion/edsall-the-obamacare-crisis.html,2013-11-20 00:00:00,['Thomas B. Edsall'],The Obamacare Crisis - The New York Times,"Responding to an email, Drew Altman, the president and C.E.O. of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, wrote of the A.C.A.:

“I think the bottom line here is that the ‘winners’ greatly outnumber the ‘losers’ in general and in the individual market in Obamacare, but the media and political math is different from the actual math. A significant minority of ‘losers’ or self-perceived losers and a few high profile bad outcomes (possibly NH) are more than enough to cause real political problems.”

According to Robert J. Blendon, a professor at Harvard’s School of Public Health, the New Hampshire type of problem is more endemic:

“This is the next big political story. The president promised people they could keep their doctor and implicitly their hospital. A number of state exchanges are like New Hampshire in that they are offering what are called narrow network plans. Some of these plans exclude coverage at children’s hospitals as well, which means some parents with sick children will have to change their source of care. This too is not what was promised.”

In the state of Washington, the Seattle Children’s Hospital was initially left off the list of approved care providers by five of the seven insurers operating in Kings County through the state exchange, Healthplanfinder. The hospital was forced to sue state officials in order to gain eligibility.

Obama and his party's elected officials not only have the elections of 2014 and 2016 to worry about, but also the future prospects of the liberal agenda writ large, which had appeared to be slowly gaining momentum before the Obamacare portal snafu.

The degree of political damage inflicted so far is reflected in this RealClearPolitics graph (Figure 1) of voter responses to the question: “If the election for the U.S. House of Representatives were being held today, would you vote for the Republican candidate or for the Democratic candidate in your district?”

The graph shows a collapse in Democratic voting intention. In effect, all the gains Democrats made during the period Republicans shut down the government and demanded an end to Obamacare have been lost since Obamacare was actually launched.

More granular analysis of Democratic losses in recent weeks can be found by comparing two Quinnipiac polls, the first released on Oct. 1, 2013 when Democrats had a nine point, 43-34, advantage on the generic voting question; and the second released on Nov. 13, when the Democratic lead was erased and the parties were tied at 39-39.

The biggest drops were among self-identified independents, who went from slightly favoring Democrats, 32-30, to decisively Republican, 37-26; men, an 11-point shift; voters making less than $50,000, 11 points; and young voters 18-29 who showed the largest shift of all, 24 points. The dropoff among lower income and young voters strikes at the heart of the Obama coalition. Voters 65 and over, who had backed Republicans by large margins in 2010, but who favored Democrats 43-37 in the October poll, were back in the Republican fold, 41-38, by November.

“The redistributive arithmetic of Obamacare’s architecture could never add up,” Steven Hayward, a visiting scholar in conservative thought and policy at the University of Colorado, wrote in Forbes magazine: “The wonder is that Obama’s political team didn’t see this coming and prepare a pre-emptive strategy for dealing with the inevitable exposure of the duplicity at the heart of Obamacare’s logic.”"

Will the implementation of some of the most important provisions of ObamaCare this fall and next year result in the ""train wreck"" Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) predicted a few days ago?

No. But you can be certain that there will be no shortage of political candidates and high-powered political spin doctors who will be working relentlessly between now and the 2014 midterms to convince us that it will be.

ObamaCare -- even though it already has reduced the number of uninsured Americans by several million and has limited price gouging by insurance companies -- represents the best hope that many Republicans will have of maintaining or boosting their majority in the House and possibly retaking the Senate.

Think about it. The economy seems to be on the right track. Just last week the stock market reached record highs and the jobless rate fell to its lowest point in four years. The war in Iraq is over and most American troops are scheduled to be out of Afghanistan by the end of next year. The GOP appears to have lost the advantage to Democrats on gun control and immigration, and abortion and gay rights are no longer the reliable campaign wedge issues they once were.

That leaves ObamaCare and ""big government spending"" as just about the only issues that remain for right-leaning candidates, barring any unforeseen domestic or global calamity. But if their campaigns against ObamaCare next year are as successful as their campaigns against it were in the 2010 midterms -- and the White House and supporters of the law are once again asleep at the switch -- GOP candidates might not need anything else to talk about to take both houses of Congress.

When Barack Obama was inaugurated in January 2009, there was wide support for health care reform, and Republican strategists knew it. They realized they might be able to turn reform into a winning issue for their candidates by mounting a campaign to make people afraid of what the Democrats might try to do. So just as Congress was beginning preliminary work on what eventually became the Affordable Care Act, GOP message guru Frank Luntz persuaded his clients to condemn whatever the Democrats proposed as a ""government takeover of health care.""

Even though the bill that ultimately became law was anything but a government takeover, GOP lawmakers and candidates never missed an opportunity to insist that it was. Luntz' sound bite was repeated hundreds of times in floor speeches by Republican members of Congress in the hours before the House voted on its version of the bill on November 7, 2009.

Their fear-based campaign worked so well to influence public opinion that GOP candidates have never stopped using the ""government takeover"" meme, which is why the perception of ObamaCare as being exactly that has become a reality for millions of Americans.

When you consider the inadequate job that the White House and the president's supporters have done in explaining how the law benefits just about every one of us -- and never letting us forget why reform was necessary in the first place -- it's little wonder Republicans see opportunity once again.

There no doubt will be glitches when the online health insurance exchanges go live on October 1 for the relatively small percentage of Americans who will use them to shop for coverage because their employers don't offer health insurance as an employee benefit. The exchanges will work just fine for the vast majority of people, but there will be some who will have complaints. You can expect the law's critics to give every one of them a voice in their effort to create the impression that the exchanges are a disaster and that the government can't do anything right.

Similarly, some people who have been paying relatively low premiums for what they don't realize is junk insurance will be upset when junk insurance is outlawed next year. Because real insurance costs more than junk, some invariably will complain about having to pay higher premiums for coverage that will actually be there if and when they need it.

You can also expect that a fair number of folks will squawk when the requirement to have health insurance kicks in on January 1. And you can bet that the opponents of the law will be aided, unwittingly in most but certainly not all cases, by the media. Just as local TV reporters tell us about the drivers who crash into each other instead of the rest of us who get to our destinations unharmed, the media will focus on the glitches. And they'll interview far more complainers than happy campers.

I'm betting that Frank Luntz and other Republican strategists have already been hired to craft the sound bites to use against Democrats next year. If the Democrats and consumer advocates who support ObamaCare are not at work developing their own strategies to counter the coming barrage of misleading spin, the GOP will have an excellent chance of controlling Capitol Hill after the next elections."

At Josh Marshall's online news operation, he has been soliciting people for PPACA (Obamacare) stories, and someone just sent in something that implies that the way that this is set up is nothing short of genius, both in terms of policy, and politics.

Basically it goes as follows:



Because of state regulatory issues, insurance companies have an incentive to overprice their policies, because they are serving a new (broader) market, and because the state rate setting bureaucracy is slow and cumbersome.

If this is true, then the 80% medical loss ratio requirements will mean that they have to issue refunds to people at the end of the year.

So, this means that it is pretty likely that a lot of people will be getting refunds in early 2015.

Looking at this through my political lens, it looks pretty good.

News about lots of people being eligible for refunds should start percolating up sometime toward the end of the 3rd quarter of 2014.

That is September and October of 2014.

Just before congressional elections."

The massive Care Harbor event returns to town this week, amid the rollout of new and shifting insurance options for millions of Californians under the Obama administration’s overhaul of the healthcare system. Once again, thousands showed up Monday at the Sports Arena to secure appointments for everything from mammograms to teeth cleaning — but with new expectations for the future.

“For many of these folks, we hope it’s the last time they’re in this line,” said Howard A. Kahn, chief executive of the public health plan L.A. Care, which co-sponsors the event.

As they have for several years, dozens of doctors and dentists will be on hand Thursday through Sunday to serve thousands of patients.

Among many of the would-be patients, future insurance coverage was a secondary concern to blurry vision and painful gums.

Los Angeles resident Stanley Lewis, 52, hoped to get a crown; Boyle Heights resident Judy Ramos, 55, wanted to get her teeth fixed and a new pair of glasses. Richard Marcella, a 68-year-old from Lake Los Angeles, was concerned about his hearing and a painful mass that he worried might be cancer.

“You can’t tell someone with a decaying tooth that there’s anything more important in the moment,” L.A. Care’s Kahn said.

Many hoping to see a dentist said they had medical coverage through private or public plans, but no dental insurance.

Some without insurance said they tried to go on the state’s new insurance website to sign up, but couldn’t complete applications because the system wasn’t working.

Others said they didn’t want to attempt to use the system until any glitches are worked out. A few expressed anger at being compelled to enroll in health insurance under the federal Affordable Care Act.

“It’s unfair, really,” said Josh Berg, a 21-year-old actor who was signing up for medical and vision appointments. An Orange County native who said his life in Los Angeles was “just getting going,” Berg said he was upset that he would face a fine if he doesn’t buy insurance.

Information on insurance options was available for clinic-goers like Berg. Just beyond tables where patients received wristbands that would get them into the clinic, volunteers distributed information about Medi-Cal, Medicare and Covered California, the state’s healthcare exchange.

Care Harbor’s founder, Don Manelli, said the organization hadn’t set any goals for Obamacare signups, but that he believed “a healthy percentage” of attendees would inquire about coverage. In about two weeks, he added, his team would be able to analyze computer records and determine how many people applied for insurance.

Manelli said sign-ups for clinic appointments were “going beautifully.” He noted that by Sunday evening, hundreds had lined up to get wristbands. People continued arriving throughout the night, eventually forming a line that stretched around two sides of the arena and doubled back on itself.

At 8 a.m. on the dot Monday, the line — estimated at more than 2,000 men, women and children — jolted into motion. People jumped up from folding chairs and milk crates and quietly began to shuffle toward the appointment area.

By 10:40, the line was all but gone. A few minutes later, patients who had hoped to get dental appointments started being turned away.

“We wanted to come early, but I had work,” said Natasha Oiye, 30, of North Hills. “This is so disappointing.”

The need for less-expensive cleanings and fillings won’t disappear with healthcare reform, organizers said. And despite the high hopes many hold for healthcare reform, they added, many people will still need Care Harbor’s medical services.

UC Berkeley researchers have estimated that by 2019, when the Affordable Care Act is fully implemented, there will be more than 1 million uninsured people in L.A. County.

Updated 4:19 p.m. ET, 11/6/2013

(CNN) - A stack of daily updates written by Obamacare contractors shows the October rollout hit more walls than previously known: In the first days, half of the calls to the phone center had problems, paper applications could not be processed and up to 40,000 people at a time were sitting in the waiting room of http://www.HealthCare.gov.

The 175 pages of internal updates during the sign-up chronicle the growing ailments and efforts to heal the system during October. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, led by Republican Darrell Issa, obtained the documents from contractors involved and released them Wednesday.

""50% of the call center calls have issues,"" reads an entry on day three of the sign-up. ""Anecdotal evidence supports a widerspread problem (with the call centers),"" the October 3 document says.

Phone trouble continued into the next week. ""Our call center reps can't see their screens,"" wrote an unnamed consultant on October 7. ""So we need to train them ... with this issue."" The following day, another note: ""Call Center – Working with them to help them triage their issues.""

At the same time, the paper applications starting to arrive were in limbo. ""Serco still cannot process online the 500+ applications they have,"" reads one line from October 8 war room notes. Serco is the company paid to handle all the paperwork involved with the Affordable Care Acts sign-ups. Website problems meant that Serco, like individual consumers themselves, could not file applications online.

The Department of Health and Human Services points out the problems were at their worst at the beginning and either were fixed or are being fixed. “These are just notes by a contractor,” HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters wrote to CNN in a statement, stressing that these documents present just one piece of the HealthCare.gov effort. “Many of (the documents) are more than a month old and they reflect static points in time in a fast moving process. We have made significant progress, as we have worked to identify issues, diagnose them and fix them.”

The updates indicate that contractors waited for HHS before directing people to the paper applications. An October 3 entry reads that navigators needed ""approval from leadership"" before directing people to the paper option That approval seemed to come by October 21, when another entry indicates navigators should use the paper forms.

The contractor documents are an up-close look at the asteroid field of issues with the Obamacare launch.

According to the war room notes: On day one, October 1, the system mistakenly rejected 90% of Medicaid applicants. The next day, estimates counted 40,000 people in the HealthCare.gov waiting room, while just 100 people had enrolled. By day three, it was clear that insurers were not getting the data for people who had signed up for their plans.

Systemwide issues were compounded by more isolated problems. On day six, Utah asked to shut down its exchange because the main insurance provider in the state had not been able to set up its template in the system. A few days later, on October 9, contractor notes say that the entire system has skipped some questions or information for 30% of all applicants.

A few days later, and another specific problem: insurers in Oklahoma were confused over whether they had to provide coverage for bariatric weight loss surgery (they didn't, sparking the need for changes to some plans).

Issues continued, but after the first week, the trend turned more positive.

On October 9, the war room update for the morning says, ""About 60% of applicants are getting into HealthCare.gov without sitting in the waiting room."" That left 40% who still had to wait. But the number was a vast improvement from the 90% to 95% percent the week before."

Fox News' Ed Henry told Megyn Kelly on “The Kelly File” Thursday that the documents, released by committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, are not official enrollment numbers, but say that as of the morning of Oct. 2, “six enrollments have occurred so far with five different issuers.”

The notes were taken at a “war room” meeting of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which has been tasked with implementing ObamaCare.

They say that at the next meeting, which took place on the afternoon of Oct. 2, “approximately 100” people had signed up and 248 enrollments had occurred by the morning of Oct. 3.

The Obama administration has thus far not released any official numbers on ObamaCare enrollment, saying the first numbers would be released in mid-November after the HHS collects data from a variety of different sources.

A HHS spokesman told Fox News the documents “appear to be notes,” and do not include official enrollment statistics.

“As the Secretary said before Congress, we are focused on providing reliable and accurate information and we do not have that at this time due to the issues with 834 forms,” Joanne Peters said. “We have always anticipated that the pace of enrollment will increase throughout the enrollment period.”

Health care industry consultant Robert Laszewski told Kelly the numbers are not surprising, saying ""clearly the White House does not want insurance companies talking about what's going here.""

""And given what was released tonight, the news that so very few people are signing up, you can see why,"" he continued. ""If four weeks ago the enrollment numbers were public it would look very bad. I can tell you based upon the information that I continue to get this trickle of enrollment that you're reporting on for the first three days has really continued for the first month.""

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee received the documents in response to its request to 11 of the contractors involved in the ObamaCare website rollout.

John Cornyn -- citing Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius' recent admission that felons potentially could become ObamaCare navigators as well as new undercover video showing questionable behavior by these officials -- called Monday for the program to be halted.

Cornyn ripped the program after conservative activist James O'Keefe released a new video that appears to depict ObamaCare navigators, in Cornyn's home state of Texas, encouraging applicants to fib on their applications.

""This behavior is unacceptable, and is yet another broken piece of a deeply flawed system. The Obama administration should stop this program immediately,"" Cornyn said in a statement. ""Texans should not be purposefully misled and more importantly, their privacy should not be put at risk.""

The ""navigators"" are workers who are supposed to help people sign up for health care coverage under the new health law.

Reports continue to roll in about problems with the program, after a group formed from the ruins of ACORN announced earlier this year it was getting in on the sign-up effort.

The United Labor Unions Council Local 100, a New Orleans-based nonprofit, said in September it would take part in a multi-state ""navigator"" drive to help people enroll in President Obama's health care plan. The labor council was established by ACORN founder Wade Rathke after his larger group was broken up amid scandal in 2009.

The video from O'Keefe, who played a big role in dismantling ACORN, adds to the concern.

The newly released video from O'Keefe's Project Veritas are similar to past sting operations his group has conducted, including against ACORN. Using hidden-camera footage, the latest shows actors posing as ObamaCare applicants -- and unsuspecting navigators giving questionable advice.

In one, workers with a community center in Irving, Texas, are shown telling one actor that he shouldn't reveal anything about smoking, because it could jack up his premiums.

""You lie, because your premiums will be higher,"" one says.

Another chimes in, ""Don't tell them that.""

In another video, from a National Urban League office in Dallas, an actor is told not to declare income he has earned on the side because it could cause problems with the government.

""Don't get yourself in trouble by declaring it now,"" one worker says.

""Yeah, it didn't happen,"" another says.

""Our organization has taken immediate steps to address the actions of the identified employees and investigate the full context of what occurred in our Dallas and Irving offices,"" a statement released by The Urban League of Greater Dallas said.

""In addition, we support actions by the Department of Health & Human Services to decertify the three Navigators-in-training featured in the video, and The Urban League of Greater Dallas has suspended these employees until further notice,"" the statement said.

O'Keefe's group says it will release more videos of its ""ObamaCare investigations"" in the coming weeks that will show fraud and abuse in the system.

""This investigation shows just how vulnerable Obamacare is to fraud,"" O'Keefe said in a statement."

(CNN) —

A moment of truth approaches for President Barack Obama’s signature health care reforms with Saturday’s self-imposed deadline to get the website to work properly for most users.

Obama and officials in charge of HealthCare.gov say the “vast majority” of people who go to the website to sign up at the end of the month will have a much improved experience than the crashes, error messages and delays users faced when it launched October 1.

However, problems continue to plague the system, and technology experts question if the fixes being deployed by a team of government workers, outside contractors and specialists can get it functioning smoothly as soon as Saturday.

Luke Chung, president of Virginia-based software developer FMS Inc., called the administration’s prediction that HealthCare.gov would work at 80% capacity on or around November 30 an impractical threshold in the software world.

“I don’t know how to build something that’s only 80% complete,” Chung told CNN. “I don’t even understand how that works.”

The website woes raised questions about the viability and security of the system, and opened the reforms known as Obamacare to fresh attacks by conservative Republicans who seek to dismantle or eliminate them.

More bad news emerged Wednesday when the administration announced the website will be unable to enroll small businesses online for another year.

White House: Enroll in Obamacare, but not too fast

Small businesses can enroll in other ways in the special small business system known as SHOP, but problems with HealthCare.gov have prevented their online enrollment so far. It was the third delay of the SHOP Marketplace component of the website, this time until November 2014.

For now, “small businesses will be able to enroll directly in a SHOP plan through an insurer, agent or broker and can get certified for a tax credit after they enroll,” said Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that oversees the rollout of the reforms.

The Affordable Care Act doesn’t require companies with fewer than 50 employees to buy insurance for workers, though workers are required to have coverage. Employers who choose to provide coverage for their workers may qualify for subsidies to reduce their costs.

“We expect that making direct enrollment, tax credit applications and comparison shopping easier will help to ensure that small businesses can take full advantage of the marketplace and tax credits worth up to 50% of employee premiums in 2014,” Bataille said.

However, the head of the International Franchise Association complained the delay in online enrollment made it harder for small business owners to get all the information they need to enroll.

“With this delay, it will also call into question how the small business tax credit is applied,” said Steve Caldeira, the group’s president and CEO. “Not having the ability to apply electronically will now make this process more confusing, cumbersome and time-consuming for employers.”

Republicans pounced on the news, with House Speaker John Boehner urging Obama to delay implementation of the entire Affordable Care Act.

“This law has been an absolute disaster, leaving us to ask, ‘What’s next?’ ” the Ohio Republican said in a statement. “If the President won’t repeal it, he should at least delay the entire law before it wreaks any more havoc on American families and small businesses as well as our economy.”

Boehner signs up for Obamacare

Meanwhile, insurance industry insiders told CNN on condition of not being identified that problems continue with the transmission of data submitted by people signing up for coverage through HealthCare.gov.

“There’s no part of us that thinks all of this will be fixed in three days from now,” an industry official said, referring to the November 30 date for the site to run smoothly for most users.

Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for the insurance trade group America’s Health Insurance Plans, said that “there is still a lot of work to be done to make sure that enrollments can be done and processed accurately.”

Insurers: Despite deadline, Obamacare glitches persist

Wednesday’s developments came as the Obama administration prepared for a potential surge in online enrollment over the weekend.

According to a White House official, the administration suggested this week that allied organizations hold off on launching campaigns to drive traffic to the website in the first week of December.

Officials fear another huge surge in volume that the site can’t handle, which is what occurred around its launch in October.

HealthCare.gov was originally planned to handle 50,000 concurrent users, and will reach that capacity by Saturday, the White House official said.

However, big spikes in traffic – such as the 200,000 who tried to get on at the same time on October 1 – would cause users to go into a queue to receive e-mails advising them when to return, the official noted.

Publicly, Obama and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius have been urging Americans to give HealthCare.gov another try, though they make clear it remains a work in progress.

The November 30 target for website improvements “does not represent a relaunch of HealthCare.gov; it is not a magical date,” Bataille told reporters. “There will be times after November 30 when HealthCare.gov does not function properly.”

Website woes aside, a new CNN/ORC International poll released Wednesday showed a majority of Americans believe the current Obamacare problems can be solved, and the figures for overall support and opposition remain little changed from a month ago.

In a conference call Tuesday with state and local officials, Sebelius listed steps taken so far to improve the website’s performance.

“We’ve added hardware, we’ve added software; we’re continuing to work on the parts of the website that were too confusing to people,” she said, urging the officials “to not hesitate to recommend that people go to HealthCare.gov and get signed up because that experience is currently working much better and it will continue to work much better.”

Sebelius: Obamacare website improvements ‘on track’

A properly functioning website is crucial to implementing the most vital provisions of the Affordable Care Act that require people to have health coverage.

The failure of HealthCare.gov to enable people to enroll when the sign-up period began last month undermined the launch of new health insurance exchanges intended to provide affordable coverage for millions who previously were uninsured or under-insured.

In theory, the exchanges create large pools of customers that include generally healthier and less-costly younger people as well as older folks who tend to require more expensive health care.

Such large markets would hold down prices by allowing insurance companies to offset the higher costs of aging consumers with the money from lower-cost policy holders, the thinking goes.

For the program to work, it needs to sign up younger people less inclined to pay for health coverage they don’t believe they need.

The GOP opposition targets the entire health care law, not just the website woes, as the ultimate example of big government run amok.

Enrollment figures for the first month after the opening of the new insurance exchanges were much lower than initially expected. Now some states have reported stronger numbers.

According to a CNN count based on available figures, a little more than 200,000 people have signed up for new private health insurance under Obamacare – either through the national system or networks set up in 14 states and the District of Columbia.

In addition, more than 370,000 have signed up for Medicaid under state programs expanded through the health care reforms, the CNN count shows.

The enrollment period runs until March 31, and officials have said the target for the first year was 7 million people. To ensure they have coverage starting on January 1, consumers must sign up by December 23, the administration recently announced.

Chung, the software expert, cited December 23 as the most significant deadline, noting that demand would be huge because people by nature wait until the last minute.

Success for the website would be determined by both the number of users as well as how long they are in the system, Chung said, comparing it to a highway on which 50,000 people traveling 60 mph is smooth traffic while the same number going 10 mph is a jam.

Also Wednesday, seven Democratic senators, including some up for re-election next year, asked Obama to appoint a special health care overseer to ensure continuity in efforts to fix the problems.

Sebelius is technically the top administration official in the implementation of Obamacare, but former White House aide Jeff Zients was brought in last month to oversee efforts to fix the site. Zients will become a top economic adviser to Obama in January.

In a letter, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Mark Warner of Virginia, Christopher Coons of Delaware, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Mark Udall of Colorado and Tim Kaine of Virginia called for Obama to name a successor to Zients.

Separately, an HHS official confirmed the government will go with a new Web-hosting contractor, Hewlett-Packard, for HealthCare.gov early next year. The current contract with Terremark ends in March.

The official said the decision to go with a different vendor was made months before any problems with HealthCare.gov were identified and was unrelated to an outage that struck the site in late October, which the administration blamed on the Verizon subsidiary. The HP contract was signed in July.

The analysis by McKinsey & Co. foreshadowed many of the problems that have dogged HealthCare.gov since its rollout, including the facts that the call-in centers would not work properly if the online system was malfunctioning and that insufficient testing would make it difficult to fix problems after the launch.

The report was provided to The Washington Post by the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

This risk assessment, which was encapsulated in a 14-slide presentation, was delivered to senior White House and Department of Health and Human Services officials in four briefings between March 28 and April 8, the committee said.

HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius; Marilyn Tavenner, then acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS); and White House Chief Technology Officer Todd Park attended a session about the report on April 4 at HHS headquarters. Obama health policy adviser Jeanne Lambrew and then-White House Deputy Chief of Staff Mark Childress received a briefing April 8 at the White House.

Rep. Tim Murphy (R-Pa.), who chairs the panel’s subcommittee on oversight and investigations, said the presentation suggests that, in the run-up to its fall debut, the enrollment system was more troubled than administration officials have let on.

“Despite assurances from Secretary Sebelius, Marilyn Tavenner and [CMS official] Gary Cohen that all was well and on track with the launch of the Affordable Care Act, we now have documents dating back to April that call into question the assertions made to this committee,” Murphy said.

The CMS said in a statement that the McKinsey assessment was “part of a standard process to identify potential risks and develop mitigating strategies.” It added that “the review was completed six months before the beginning of open enrollment, was in line with industry best practices and was followed by concrete action to address potential risks — as was intended.”

White House spokesman Eric Schultz said “flags were definitely raised throughout the development of the Web site, as would be the case for any IT project this complex. . . . But nobody anticipated the size and scope of the problems we experienced once the site launched.”

Administration officials noted that the assessment was not a technical review of the Web site’s functionality. They said a number of the recommendations were acted upon, including stepping up communication with states and funneling more resources to in-person helpers and the call center.

The document did not predict whether the project’s problematic design stage would hamper its rollout but instead made it clear that programs of this scale are ideally pursued in a more orderly process, with “significant testing and revision” before they launch.

Some of the concerns raised did not come to pass. For example, the report cited the “data hub” — the massive network that connects federal, state and insurer databases — as a vulnerability. Officials say the data hub has been working well since the launch.

In addition, the report warned of long call-center wait times. Wait times were down to two minutes a few days after the launch, and they are now just seconds.

But with many of the project’s shortcomings now glaringly obvious, the report appears prescient in other respects.

One slide notes that the policy and requirements of a program are best defined at the outset, leaving sufficient time for testing and revision. By contrast, McKinsey noted, the federal marketplace’s design was marked by “evolving requirements” that shifted throughout the design phase, leaving scant time to test the system before its launch.

It also warned that the federal government largely depended on contractors to construct the marketplace, and that it lacked an overall “end-to-end operational view” of the system to ensure that its different parts worked well together.

Federal officials asked McKinsey to lay out how the consumer experience was likely to unfold over the first year based on the existing trajectory of the project and to identify things that might go wrong. The firm reviewed more than 200 documents and sources, and interviewed about 40 people across a variety of federal agencies, but did not talk to insurers or study computer code.

McKinsey — which declined to comment Monday, citing client confidentiality — did not assess whether the administration should have delayed the Oct. 1 launch.

Its presentation noted that federal officials were trying to fix the problems stemming from the botched design process. “CMS has been working to mitigate challenges resulting from program characteristics,” it says in bold.

The consulting firm suggested that some of the project’s troubles occurred because there was “no single empowered decision-making authority,” or person in charge, who could make changes or define what constituted success.

One industry source close to the project, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter frankly, said this lack of an overarching project leader complicated the system’s development because contractors received “absolutely conflicting direction between the various entities within CMS.”

McKinsey suggested some ways to mitigate the risk, including creating a “version 1.0” that was fully tested before the project was finished and assigning a single leader to oversee its implementation. It urged federal officials to set “shared metrics for success” on April 12, more than five months before the rollout.

The administration did not develop metrics to evaluate the site’s performance until late October, The Post reported Sunday."

Those who were receiving medical care before being forced to sign up to a new plan on HealthCare.gov will, in many cases, be locked out of hospitals and prevented from seeing doctors who they had typically used. The WSJ contends that about 70% of new plans are more restrictive in the range of doctors and hospitals available to patients than their predecessors.

Fearing that the will be unable to use the doctors and hospitals they want with their new plans, doctors are reporting a massive uptick in the number of patients calling for preventative procedures or moving up their planned surgeries to prevent a disaster once Obamacare measures strike.

The paper explains that while supporters of the Affordable Care Act may argue that procedures will continue to be available, the plans severely curb access to certain doctors and hospitals, preventing patients from getting the level of care they are used to at their usual price. In particular, insurers now using the Obamacare system have begun to exclude major academic institutions from their coverage, as these compete with cheaper community hospitals ostensibly providing the same service.

To prevent patients from spending more of their money on better care, the insurance plans simply eliminate the competition from coverage plans to the benefit of community hospitals. Many plans also require referrals to visit specialists, which would require someone already familiar with a long-time specialist to find a general practitioner to direct them to the doctor they wanted to see in the first place.

These changes will affect the roughly 2 million people that used HealthCare.gov or their state affiliates to buy new insurance. This number is about one million short of the goal the White House set for itself, the result of HealthCare.gov failing to work properly for months and many plans being simply unaffordable to most Americans once they managed to get on the website at all. The White House made an exception to the December deadline to sign up for insurance for those currently insured who have to go through the system, a “hardship” exception in which Obamacare itself is the hardship.

According to a recent report by the New York Times, the hardest hit Americans are squarely in the middle class.

One professional interviewed by the Journal warned ominously not of the Americans rushing to have procedures done, but those that have no reason to need preventative care and will need it as they grow older. Those without this ability to rush due to their current good health will have a “rude awakening,” said James Conroy, chief health care officer of the Association of American Medical Colleges. He warned that these people will likely be surprised at their limited new insurance when they finally need to rely on Obamacare for medical help."

Ted Cruz (R-TX) (L) and Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) wait to speak at the 'Exempt America from Obamacare' rally, on Capitol Hill, September 10, 2013 in Washington, DC.

WASHINGTON -- While Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was bemoaning the ""defeatist attitude"" of his fellow Republican senators, his close ally Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) acknowledged Obamacare won't be defunded in a bill to keep the federal government open.

The Kentucky Republican stood with Cruz in his all-night speech against Obamacare, but later on Wednesday Paul added his name to those who say the writing is on the wall.

""I'm not saying we would get everything we want. We don't want to fund [Obamacare] at all, but I'm ready to admit we may not get that,"" Paul told reporters shortly after he voted to begin debate on the government funding bill passed by House Republicans last week.

That bill would keep the federal government open beyond Sept. 30, but permanently strips the Affordable Care Act of its funding, as Cruz and his allies have demanded. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) is expected to amend the measure to restore funding for the Affordable Care Act in the course of a subsequent procedural vote that requires a simple majority.

Republicans, with 46 votes, could stop the bill during the procedural motion; but many of them oppose shutting down the federal government, especially since it wouldn't lead to the end of Obamacare, and the GOP is likely to bear the brunt of the blame.

To Cruz, who spoke Wednesday on Rush Limbaugh's radio show, that stance shows that Republicans are ""beaten down.""

""The single biggest surprise about arriving to the Senate is the defeatist attitude here,"" Cruz said.

While Paul joined Cruz in his 21-hour talkathon -- which outlasted Paul's 13-hour talking filibuster earlier this year -- the senator from the Bluegrass State conceded Wednesday afternoon that the Senate should no longer delay sending a revised continuing resolution to the House GOP leaders, who will only have one day to pass the measure in order to avert a government shutdown.

""We've spent a lot of time on this, and it's time to vote,"" Paul said. ""I think the sooner we're done with this, the better chance we have of not having the government shut down.""

""I think it's presumptuous of me to tell the House what to do, but I think the goal of everybody should be to try to do something right and at the same time not shut down the government,"" Paul added.

The Kentucky senator argued that Reid and President Barack Obama are pushing the country to the brink of a shutdown by refusing to compromise on the health care law, and called for a ""a discussion over how we could make the bill less bad.""

""I think if you analyze this situation, this is us saying the bill has many problems. Even one of the authors of the bill says there's problems with the bill,"" Paul said. ""But if they're unwilling to revisit the bill and compromise on anything ... maybe some of you in the media ought to ask ... why are they shutting down the government in order to get everything they want?""

Paul was among nearly a dozen Republican signatories on a letter distributed by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) in July that called on the conference to oppose any continuing resolution that included funding for Obamacare. In recent weeks, Cruz and Lee have insisted that any vote to advance the House-passed bill is a vote for Obamacare, because it would enable Reid to keep the health care law funded.

Paul was hesitant to share that opinion.

""I don't really want to characterize what I think the vote means,"" he said. ""I think that the Republican caucus has been united in its opposition to Obamacare.""

""All I know is at this time, my conclusion is -- and apparently a lot of people's conclusion is -- we ought to get to the votes,"" Paul added later, as reporters continued to press him on Cruz's strategy. ""If we're going to send something to the House, I think get something over there sooner rather than later. That's always been my opinion.""

He commended Cruz's speech, noting opposition to Obamacare has been a motivating issue for tea party and grassroots activists in the Republican Party.

""I don't think you're finding many people out in the countryside or across the country saying, 'Oh, it's a bad idea to stand up to Obamacare,'"" Paul said. ""What makes it difficult is people really probably don't want to shut down the government, and I don't either ... so it is a difficult situation."""
http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/11/29/obama-people-do-think-im-trustworthy/,2013-11-29 00:00:00,"['Tampa Tim', 'Rudy Nyc', 'The', 'Compassionate', 'Gop Solution', 'Posted By']",Obama: People do think I'm trustworthy,"7 years ago

(CNN) - The hits to President Obama's popularity, prompted by the botched HealthCare.gov rollout, are simply a natural fluctuation every commander-in-chief faces, Obama told interviewer Barbara Walters in an interview aired Friday.

""If you remember, I've gone up and down pretty consistently throughout,"" Obama said in the ABC interview on Friday. ""But the good thing about when you're down is that usually you've got nowhere to go but up.""



""I got re-elected in part because people did think I was trustworthy and they knew I was working on their behalf,"" Obama said in the network's exclusive.

A CNN Poll of Polls complied Thursday showed the president's approval rating at 41%, near a low of his five years in office. The numbers have dipped as Obama's signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act, faces problems with its website and the number of Americans whose health plans are being canceled.

Obama has taken responsibility for the website's flaws, saying he should have been told earlier about the serious issues with HealthCare.gov's digital infrastructure. He's also apologized for his vow that people who liked their plans could keep them.

In Friday's interview, Obama said he was looking for answers soon on why the rollout failed so spectacularly.

""Obviously my most recent concern has been that my website's not working,"" Obama said. ""We're evaluating why it is exactly that I didn't know soon enough that it wasn't going to work the way it needed to. But my priority now has been to just make sure that it works.""

The glitches aside, Obama remained confident the Affordable Care Act, passed along party lines in 2010, would form a large part of his presidential legacy.

""I continue to believe and I'm absolutely convinced that, at the end of the day, people are going to look back at the work we've done to make sure that in this country, you don't go bankrupt when you get sick, that families have that security,"" Obama told Walters. ""That is going be a legacy I am extraordinarily proud of.""

That legacy - and what can be done while he's still in office to bolster it - does weigh on the president's mind, he admitted.

""Every president in their second term is mindful that you've only got a limited amount of time left,"" Obama said. ""You want to make sure that you are squeezing every last ounce of energy that you have to try to deliver on the commitments you made to the American people."""

USATODAY

Even supporters worry that the administration isn%27t nearly ready to meet the deadline for exchanges on Oct. 1.

Fervent Republican attempts to make the law fail are compounding the administration%27s shortcomings.

Most small businesses have fewer than 50 employees and won%27t be required to provide coverage.

President Obama signed his ambitious health reform plan into law more than three years ago. Let's say that again: more than three years ago.

When Obama signed the law on March 23, 2010, everyone knew that all but the smallest businesses would be required to offer their employees health insurance by Jan. 1, 2014. But now, not unlike a college student who hasn't used his time wisely, the White House says it needs an extension.

On Tuesday, the administration put off for a year the provision that requires any business with at least 50 full-time employees to provide health insurance for workers or pay a penalty of $2,000 per employee. That wasn't the first delay: Earlier this year, the White House put off another provision that would have affected the way employees could buy insurance on health exchanges.

This might just be what the White House says it is – a smart and needed pause to allow officials and businesses to refine complicated rules that govern how the mandate will work. And in at least one way it might be smart politics for Democrats. It buys temporary peace with businesses that deeply dislike the mandate and have threatened to slash workers or reduce them to part-time status to avoid the insurance requirement. The disruptive change will now kick in after next year's congressional elections.

In another way, though, the delay is an indicator of deeper troubles that lie just ahead. ""This is a clear acknowledgment that the law is unworkable,"" declared House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. No it's not – but indications have been mounting for months that implementation, beginning just three months from now -- is going to be rocky and potentially unpopular.

Even ObamaCare supporters worry that the administration isn't nearly ready to meet the deadline for getting health exchanges, where people will choose their insurance, up and running by Oct. 1 and the rest of the law in place on Jan. 1. And whenever the exchanges are ready, some people are likely to see huge rate increases, particularly if young people opt to pay a $95 penalty rather than participate. Insurers have been predicting that outcome for months.

Meanwhile, fervent Republican attempts to make the law fail are compounding the administration's shortcomings. The Republicans have refused to set up exchanges in some states, blocked funding for implementation and tried to inhibit administration attempts to help people understand what's coming.

Introducing a program this big was always going to be bumpy. Even the much-simpler introduction of Medicare drug coverage during he Bush administration got off to a very rough and unpopular start. But in the end, it proved both popular and necessary.

ObamaCare has the same characteristics. Perfecting it will take years, but it's far better than the alternative, which is to see more and more people lose their insurance as costs rise to unaffordability.

The business mandate in particular makes perfect sense because the goal from the start was to preserve the American model – long supported by both parties -- in which most people get their coverage from their employers. Adding a mandate that employers provide coverage disrupts a race to the bottom -- in which businesses feel compelled to reduce or eliminate coverage as a cost-cutting measure to remain competitive.

In practical terms, though, this is not the most important part of the new law. Most small businesses have fewer than 50 employees and won't be required to provide coverage. Studies show most companies larger than that already provide coverage: 98% of companies with more than 200 workers, and 94% of companies with 50 to 199 workers (though smaller companies don't always offer coverage to every employee).

That said, in a nation where 50 million people are without insurance, businesses – including the restaurants and retailers who have led the resistance to the employer mandate -- will play an important role in the push for full coverage. It was galling to hear their leaders cheer the delay, and it's unclear whether they'll change their tune even after their complaints about the process are resolved.

With no agreement on a funding bill in sight, Republicans and Democrats continue to spar on Capitol Hill, while federal workers sit at home and the American public watches as an even more critical deadline on raising the federal debt limit nears.

The Senate rejected House amendments to a short-term spending bill Monday, pushing the government toward its first shutdown in nearly two decades.

by Lori Montgomery and Paul Kane

The U.S. government began to shut down for the first time in 17 years early Tuesday, after a Congress bitterly divided over President Obama’s signature health-care initiative failed to reach agreement to fund federal agencies.

Hours before a midnight deadline, the Republican House passed its third proposal in two weeks to fund the government for a matter of weeks. Like the previous plans, the new one sought to undermine the Affordable Care Act, this time by delaying enforcement of the “individual mandate,” a cornerstone of the law that requires all Americans to obtain health insurance.

The new measure also sought to strip lawmakers and their aides of long-standing government health benefits.

The Democratic-led Senate quickly rejected that plan on a party-line vote. Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) urged House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) to abandon the assault on the health-care law and pass a simple bill to keep the government open. Otherwise, Reid warned, “the responsibility for this Republican government shutdown will rest squarely on his shoulders.”

Boehner refused to yield. He instead won approval, in a 1 a.m. largely party-line roll call, requesting a special House-Senate committee to meet in the coming days to resolve differences between the two parties, leaving in limbo the fate of millions of federal workers and the services they provide.

Shortly before midnight, the White House budget office issued a memo instructing agencies to “execute plans for an orderly shutdown due to the absence of appropriations.”

The impasse means 800,000 federal workers will be furloughed Tuesday. National parks, monuments and museums, as well as most federal offices, will close. Tens of thousands of air-traffic controllers, prison guards and Border Patrol agents will be required to serve, but their pay may be delayed. And many congressional hearings — including one scheduled for Tuesday on last month’s Washington Navy Yard shootings — will be postponed.

In a last-minute ray of hope for active-duty troops, Congress on Monday approved and sent to the White House an agreement to keep issuing military paychecks. But Obama warned that the broader economy, which is finally starting to recover from the shocks of the past six years, would take a substantial hit if congressional gridlock shutters “America’s largest employer.”

“Keeping the people’s government open is not a concession to me. Keeping vital services running and hundreds of thousands of Americans on the job is not something you ‘give’ to the other side. It’s our basic responsibility,” Obama said in a statement Monday evening at the White House.

Privately, senior Republicans predicted that the closure would last at least a week. A fraction of today’s House Republicans were on Capitol Hill in 1995 and 1996 when a Republican-led Congress last shut down the government in a dispute over the budget with a Democratic president. Younger lawmakers don’t remember the pain the shutdown caused constituents, senior Republicans said. And many of them now question the conventional wisdom that the closures weakened the GOP presidential candidate in 1996 and nearly cost the party control of the House.

Democrats predicted that if the shutdown stretches into the weekend, the government-funding dispute could be rolled into an even more serious battle over the $16.7 trillion federal debt limit. The Treasury Department will begin running short of cash to pay the nation’s bills as soon as Oct. 17 unless Congress approves additional borrowing authority. With so little time remaining to avoid what would be the nation’s first default, Democratic aides predicted that negotiations to reopen the government may be merged into the debt-limit talks.

On Monday evening, Obama telephoned Boehner to urge him to reconsider his stance on the health-care law. In a call that lasted nearly 10 minutes, according to Boehner’s office, the president reiterated his insistence that there would be no negotiations over the debt limit, and that Congress must pay the bills it has incurred.

Boehner responded by mocking Obama in a speech on the House floor.

“ ‘I’m not going to negotiate,’ ” he said, quoting Obama. “I would say to the president: This is not about me. It’s not about Republicans here in Congress. It’s about fairness.”

The speech drew applause for the embattled speaker, who argued passionately that Republicans were merely seeking “fairness” for working people. Obama has delayed a mandate for employers to insure workers and delayed other requirements for big unions, Boehner said. “Yet they stick our constituents with a bill they don’t like and a bill they can’t afford,” he said.

Despite the show of unity, Republicans on both sides of the Capitol remain deeply divided about the attack on the health-care law. In the House, a group of more moderate Republicans was seething about the decision to bow to the forces that oppose the Affordable Care Act, led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and his allies on the right, including such outside groups as Heritage Action for America.

On Monday, some publicly urged Boehner to drop the issue and seek the help of House Democrats to pass the simple government-funding bill that the Senate approved last week.

“I don’t want to shut down the government,” said Rep. Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), who is trying to become her state’s first GOP senator since the 1950s, adding that she was inclined to support a “clean” funding bill.

Frustrations also were simmering among Senate Republicans, who complained that House leaders were pressing the attack in direct opposition to public opinion. Polls show that voters overwhelmingly disapprove of using the threat of a shutdown to defund the health-care law and that blame for a shutdown will fall squarely on Republicans.

“By wanting to repeal Obamacare using this method, it defies what the popular will is,” said Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, who campaigned last year on behalf of his party’s national ticket.

“I campaigned in 2012 all over this country for months: ‘Repeal and replace Obamacare.’ That was not the mandate of the voters,” McCain said. “If they wanted to repeal Obamacare, the 2012 election would have been probably significantly different.”

Adding to the tension Monday was Boehner’s decision to add the provision that would strip lawmakers, congressional staff members and White House aides of the employer subsidies for health insurance they have received for many years.

Now that lawmakers and their aides must join the new health-insurance exchanges, some conservative groups have criticized the subsidies, worth about $5,000 a year for individual coverage and $10,000 for families, as a “special exemption” from the new law. By including the provision, House leaders hoped to attract conservative support and put pressure on Senate Democrats, who faced the choice of shutting down the government to protect their own perks.

“On what flooding peninsula can you stand when it’s a question of delaying the individual mandate, ending member subsidies and funding the government?” said Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.). If Reid kills it, “the senators he’s going to protect become the subject of incredible scrutiny.”

Even some Republicans were uneasy about the prospect of dealing their aides — and some of their colleagues — the equivalent of a big pay cut. Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) called it an “outrage,” adding that Boehner had worked directly with Reid and the Obama administration to make sure the subsidies would stay in place when congressional employees join the exchanges next year.

Boehner and his team presented the proposal to rank-and-file Republicans in a closed-door meeting Monday. For more than an hour and a half, lawmakers argued about the plan. They emerged with an unusual number of public dissenters, including Rep. Peter T. King (N.Y.), one of a dozen Republicans who ultimately voted against the proposal.

“I don’t want to be the facilitator of a disastrous process and plan,” he said.

Still, most Republicans endorsed the deal, even if somewhat reluctantly. “I think this is a principled call by leadership and it has the support of the con­ference,” said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), one of Boehner’s closest friends.

Democrats, meanwhile, were united against any attempt by Republicans to extract concessions now, especially with the larger fight over the debt limit swiftly approaching.

“The bottom line is very simple,” said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). “You negotiate on this, they will up the ante for the debt limit.”

Obama%2C top Dems said those who liked their plans could keep them under new law

Most people are covered through their jobs%2C and the law doesn%27t stop employers from dropping or changing plans

The law sets minimum standards%2C and the upgrades mean some inexpensive plans will no longer exist

The Line: If you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.

The Party: Democratic

For years, President Obama promised millions of Americans with health insurance that ""if you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan"" under his health care overhaul. He wasn't the only one, either.

Back in 2009, several top congressional Democrats echoed the president's assurances that those who were happy with their plans would be able to keep them.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the health care overhaul efforts ""means making sure you can keep your family's doctor or keep your health care plan if you like it.""

Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin told the happily insured ""we are going to put in any legislation considered by the House and Senate the protection that you, as an individual, keep the health insurance you have, if that is what you want.""

And current Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray also said: ""If you like what you have today, that will be what you have when this legislation is passed.""

But longtime readers of FactCheck.org know we've been writing since August 2009 that that promise simply couldn't be made to everyone who already had health insurance.

That's because most Americans are covered by plans through their jobs, and nothing in the health care law prohibited employers from dropping coverage or changing health plans as they have been able to previously. Before the health care bill even became law, the Congressional Budget Office projected that up to 10 million people who otherwise would have been covered by employer-provided plans would not be offered coverage under one Democratic proposal.

The health care law also sets minimum standards for insurance coverage, requiring that all health plans cover mental health benefits, prescription drug coverage, vaccinations, dental and vision care for children, maternity care for women, and more. The upgrades mean that some plans that were inexpensive for purchasers — but didn't cover the required benefits — would eventually cease to exist.

Americans who purchase such plans on the individual insurance market have been receiving notices that their current plans will no longer be offered after this year, as severalnewsorganizations reported in October. Those notices make it clear that Obama was over-simplifying and over-promising when he kept saying, ""if you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan.""

Obama, in a Nov. 4, 2013, speech, tried to explain his past promises by saying ""what we said was you can keep it if it hasn't changed since the law passed."" Asked when the president had previously included that detail, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney, in a Nov. 5 press briefing, said Obama was referring to the law's clause allowing insurers and employers to ""grandfather"" plans offered before the bill became law.

""The president was referring to the law and to the fact that the law was written in a way — and everybody who closely covered the drafting of that legislation knew it was written about — that the grandfathering clause was in the law, and he was referring to the implementation of that law through the rule process,"" Carney said.

Grandfathered health plans do not have to meet all of the law's new coverage requirements. But in order to be grandfathered, health plans must have existed on March 23, 2010. Those with individual grandfathered plans had to have them before the law took effect. And to maintain their grandfathered status, the plans must not be changed to cut benefits or significantly raise prices for consumers through deductibles or co-pays.

It's true that Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius explained the grandfather clause in a June 14, 2010, blog post announcing new health care regulations.

""Under the rule issued today, employers or issuers offering such coverage will have the flexibility of making reasonable changes without losing their 'grandfathered' status,"" Sebelius wrote. ""However, if health plans significantly raise co-payments or deductibles, or if they significantly reduce benefits – for example, if they stop covering treatment for a disease like HIV/AIDS or cystic fibrosis – they'll lose their grandfathered status and their customers will get the same full set of consumer protections as new plans.""

Sebelius went on to say that the ""bottom line is that under the Affordable Care Act, if you like your doctor and plan, you can keep them."" But that still wouldn't be true for many, and Obama glossed over those details in his speeches. The president made the sweeping promise, in one variation or another, while the Affordable Care Act was being debated in Congress in 2009. He said it again after he signed the bill into law in 2010. And he continued to say it after the Supreme Court ruled the law was constitutional in 2012.

Even the president now acknowledges that his promise went too far.

In an interview with Chuck Todd of NBC News on Nov. 7, Obama offered an apology to the many Americans who have been notified that they are, in fact, losing the health plans they previously had and wanted to keep.

""I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me,"" Obama said. ""We've got to work hard to make sure that they know we hear them and that we're going to do everything we can to deal with folks who find themselves in a tough position as a consequence of this.""

Strangely, the White House linked to the apology on a health care Web page that carried the same promise he now says went too far.

White House website, Nov. 11: If you like your plan you can keep it and you don't have to change a thing due to the health care law.

Here is a list of some who have promised individuals could keep their health plans:

Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, June 10, 2009: We here in the Senate are working on legislation that will protect people's choice of doctors, will protect their choice of hospitals, will protect their choice of insurance plan. If you like what you have today, that will be what you have when this legislation is passed. (Source: Remarks on the Senate floor.)

Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, July 28, 2009: The reform we are pursuing … not only means making sure you can keep your family's doctor or keep your health care plan if you like it but also that you can afford to do so. (Source: Remarks on the Senate floor.)

Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, July 30, 2009: Many people say: I like my health insurance right now. I don't want to change. I don't want to go into Medicare or Medicaid. I like what I have. Would you please leave people alone. The answer is yes. In fact, we guarantee it. We are going to put in any legislation considered by the House and Senate the protection of you, as an individual, to keep the health insurance you have, if that is what you want. What we are trying to create are voluntary choices and opportunities. (Source: Remarks on the Senate floor.)

President Obama, Aug. 15, 2009: At the same time — I just want to be completely clear about this; I keep on saying this but somehow folks aren't listening — if you like your health care plan, you keep your health care plan. Nobody is going to force you to leave your health care plan. (Source: Remarks from town hall on health care.)

Sen. Mark Begich of Alaska, Dec. 24, 2009: Alaskans who have health insurance now, and are happy with it, can keep it. (Source: Press release.)

President Obama, March 25, 2010: From this day forward, all of the cynics, all the naysayers — they're going to have to confront the reality of what this reform is and what it isn't. They'll have to finally acknowledge this isn't a government takeover of our health care system. They'll see that if Americans like their doctor, they'll be keeping their doctor. You like your plan? You'll be keeping your plan. No one is taking that away from you. (Source: Remarks in Iowa City, Iowa.)

Sen. Max Baucus of Montana, Sept. 29, 2010: From the beginning, the law has been about preserving what is good about American health care. That is why one of the central promises of health care reform has been and is: If you like what you have, you can keep it. That is critically important. If a person has a plan,and he or she likes it, he or she can keep it. (Source: Remarks on the Senate floor.)

Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, April 6, 2012: This bill will help make health insurance more secure for those who already have it and make coverage available for millions of uninsured Americans. And it is important to remember that for those who already have health insurance, the law allows you to keep your existing plan. (Source: Press release.)

President Obama, June 28, 2012: First, if you're one of the more than 250 million Americans who already have health insurance, you will keep your health insurance — this law will only make it more secure and more affordable. (Source: Remarks on Supreme Court ruling on the Affordable Care Act.)

Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, web page accessed Nov. 11, 2013: If you like your current health insurance, you will be able to keep it. And you will be able to continue seeing your current doctor. Health care reform would simply give you the choice to change insurance providers if you so choose. (Source: Q & A webpage.)

Sen. Kay Hagan of North Carolina, fact sheet accessed Nov. 11, 2013: For middle class families, health care reform … Ensures you can keep the coverage you have and guarantees coverage if you change or lose your job. (Source: Fact sheet.)

White House web page, accessed Nov. 11, 2013: If you like your plan you can keep it and you don't have to change a thing due to the health care law. The President addressed concerns from Americans who have received letters of policy cancellations or changes from their insurance companies in an interview with NBC News, watch the video or read a transcript.

After the full implementation of Obamacare in 2014, many will remain uninsured because Texas Gov. Rick Perry is not accepting the Medicaid expansion to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). Perry runs around Texas telling his constituents that it would bankrupt the state . He says this even though 100 percent of the cost of the expansion is paid for by the federal government for the first 3 years. Thereafter the states are responsible for only 10 percent.

Most of the states with the highest uninsured rates are the ones neither setting up exchanges nor accepting the Medicaid expansion to Obamacare. These states have chosen the status quo. Millions of American citizens that could qualify for healthcare insurance through the Medicaid expansion will be left in the cold.

Make no mistake, the governors of these states have choices. They could take the 3 year Medicaid expansion at 100 percent and then opt out in year 4 if they really thought their state would get bankrupted. Their citizens could have at least 3 years’ worth of preventative care, coverage for their children, and much more. They could make the poor and the working poor in their states healthier.

Opposition to Obamacare has characteristics of an addiction. One knows intrinsically when one is doing wrong or doing something detrimental. However, the cravings make one disregard reality and acquiesce to the drug. What is the drug? The drug is hate for all things Obama.

Politics is a blood sport. Politicians and parties attempt to get an advantage at every turn. That is okay as long as it does not materially or deliberately affect the overall well-being of the constituent.

There are many stories detailing the plight of the poor whose only recourse is the emergency room. They get to the emergency rooms only to be stabilized and not really diagnosed in detail. Generally, not until it is too late do they get care at a point when it is most expensive and deadly. One of the most gut-wrenching stories was detailed by a Galveston, Texas, medical student where she literally watched a patient die over a few months. The patient died not because they could not help his cancer, but because he was uninsured.

There are so many real stories out there that every politician opposing Obamacare has access to. They instead promote stories that are generally debunked soon after they are released to the public. They choose to continue promoting stories they know are debunked.

More on these Obamacare lies below the fold."

Senate set to vote on spending bill Wednesday

Sens. Cruz and Lee want to use blocking tactics to stop vote

Key Senate Republicans say they oppose delaying vote on the spending bill

WASHINGTON — Sen. Ted Cruz's marathon talking protest of President Obama's health care law continued Wednesday morning, as the Senate headed toward a procedural vote on a bill that would continue its funding.

Cruz began his talkathon Tuesday afternoon, vowing to speak on the Senate floor ""until I am no longer able to stand."" Technically under Senate rules, Cruz's tactic is not a filibuster because the Texas Republican cannot prevent the Senate from having a scheduled procedural vote later Wednesday.

Shortly before 7 a.m. ET, Cruz passed Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., who spoke on the Senate floor for 16 hours, 12 minutes in 1981 to protest raising the nation's debt limit. In terms of time spent controlling the floor, Cruz has passed such legendary Senate talkers as Robert Byrd, Alfonse D'Amato and Huey Long as he brought attention to Obama's signature domestic achievement.

GOP Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Marco Rubio of Florida both arrived in the Senate chamber before dawn Wednesday to ask questions of Cruz, so he didn't have to speak the whole time.

Overnight, Cruz filled time by talking about the Revolutionary War, the battle against the Nazis, reading tweets from supporters and even reciting Dr. Seuss' Green Eggs and Ham.

Cruz also shared ""words of wisdom"" from the reality TV show Duck Dynasty and quoted much of country music singer Toby Keith's song Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue.

Cruz took a moment to embrace the ""wacko bird"" label Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., used to refer to him and other conservative Republicans back in March.

""If it reflects a fidelity to the Constitution, a fidelity to liberty, a willingness to fight, to defend the principles this country was founded on,"" then Cruz said he and his colleagues were ""very proud wacko birds.""

The conservative-driven effort to defund Obamacare on a stopgap spending bill now under debate in Congress has raised the threat of a government shutdown Oct. 1.

Cruz and Lee have led the defund effort despite criticism from Senate Republicans who view their tactics as short-sighted because there is no chance of passage up against a Democratic-led Senate and Obama's veto pen.

Lee took the floor to denounce the Affordable Care Act as a first step toward a government-run health care system, ""funded, operated and administered entirely from Washington, D.C.""

Lee referred to the Supreme Court ruling that declared Obamacare to be constitutional as a ""lawless act"" and ""something that we should be ashamed of as Americans.""

In one exchange, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., pointed to Obama's re-election as the electorate's word on the health care law. Cruz said Obama was a ""far more talented candidate"" than Mitt Romney and didn't see the 2012 election as a referendum on the health care law.

Despite the Republican senators' efforts, the chamber is on track to clear a key procedural hurdle Wednesday to ultimately advance a stopgap spending bill that leaves intact Obama's health care law.

""Filibusters stop people from voting, and we are going to vote tomorrow,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., on Tuesday. Cruz took to the Senate floor at 2:41 p.m., but under Senate rules Reid will be able to hold a procedural vote to take up the stopgap spending bill around noon Wednesday no matter how long Cruz intends to speak.

Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Reid, posted on Twitter that Cruz and Reid had pre-negotiated the terms of Cruz's floor time.

The House-passed spending bill under debate in the Senate maintains the current annual $986 billion funding levels across the federal government through Dec. 15 but includes a provision to defund the Affordable Care Act. The Senate's vote on Wednesday would essentially clear the way for a final up-or-down vote by the weekend, but Reid is going to strip out the language eliminating spending for the health care law, which is why Cruz and his allies are using blocking tactics.

Senate Democrats also intend to change the time period of the stopgap spending bill to Nov. 15, in order to nudge lawmakers closer toward passing the annual spending bills instead of relying on stopgap measures. ""The best way to stop lurching on this crisis to the next crisis is to get back into funding our government the way the Founding Fathers set it out, through the appropriations process,"" Reid said.

Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., said she will be seeking a longer-term resolution to the dozen fiscal year spending bills that remain unfinished. Democrats are also seeking ways to use the annual spending bills to turn off unpopular, across-the-board spending cuts known as the sequester for up to two years.

The majority of Senate Republicans have said they oppose Cruz's tactics on the stopgap spending bill, in part because of fears of political repercussions for being blamed for a government shutdown, which will occur Oct. 1 if Congress doesn't pass it.

The chamber's top two Republicans, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Monday that they will not vote with Cruz on Wednesday, a clear signal that there are the 60 votes necessary to move forward with the debate on the spending bill.

""We'd all be hard-pressed to explain why we were opposed to a bill we were in favor of,"" McConnell said Tuesday, noting that the vote Wednesday will allow debate on a bill that includes the defund language since Reid has not had the opportunity to strip it out yet.

However, Republicans continue to unanimously oppose Obamacare as a matter of policy, which begins open enrollment on Oct. 1, and are seeking other avenues to dismantle the law.

For example, House Republicans are working to approve a legislative package tied to a debt-ceiling vote increase expected next month that would delay implementation for one year in exchange for suspending the nation's borrowing limit through next year.

Obama has maintained that he will not negotiate on the debt ceiling because of the potentially sweeping economic repercussions that could arise from the United States defaulting on its debt payments.

New poll shows confusion and misinformation still exists about the law

Among young people%2C just 56%25 realize there%27s a mandate to be insured

Knowledge about the law is higher in states that are setting up their own exchanges

This story was originally published Sept. 16, 2013.

WASHINGTON -- Republican lawmakers have failed in dozens of attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but a new USA TODAY/Pew Research Center Poll shows just how difficult they have made it for President Obama's signature legislative achievement to succeed.

As the health care exchanges at the heart of the law open for enrollment in two weeks, the public's views of it are as negative as they have ever been, and disapproval of the president's handling of health care has hit a new high. Confusion and misinformation about the law haven't significantly abated, especially among the law's main targets.

Among the 19% polled who are uninsured, nearly four in 10 don't realize the law requires them to get health insurance next year. Among young people, whose participation is seen as crucial for the exchanges to work, just 56% realize there's a mandate to be insured or face a fine.

And in the states that have refused to participate in the insurance marketplaces — defaulting instead to the federal exchange — knowledge about the Affordable Care Act and support for it are notably lower than in states that are setting up their own exchanges.

""There has been a full-court press from Day One from the opposition to characterize and demonize the plan,"" says Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution, who wrote about the GOP efforts in a 2012 book about Washington he co-authored, It's Even Worse Than It Looks. ""The campaign against the law after it was enacted, the range of steps taken, the effort to delegitimize it — it is unprecedented. We'd probably have to go back to the nullification efforts of the Southern states in the pre-Civil War period to find anything of this intensity.""

Opponents say the law's own shortcomings are responsible for its travails. ""This program is not ready for prime time,"" says Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., chief sponsor of a bill passed by the U.S. House last week to delay the exchanges until additional anti-fraud measures are put in place. (Like dozens of previous House-passed measures on Obamacare, it isn't expected to pass the Senate.)

When Obama signed the law more than three years ago, supporters predicted Americans would embrace it as some of the most popular provisions went into effect, including measures that have helped seniors pay prescription costs, protected children who have serious medical conditions and enabled young adults to stay on their parents' insurance plans until age 26.

But that turnaround in public opinion hasn't happened, at least not yet. Now the biggest test for the Affordable Care Act looms in two weeks, when the marketplaces for the uninsured are scheduled to open for enrollment on Oct. 1.

In the USA TODAY/Pew poll:

Opposition hits new highs: 53% disapprove of the health care law, the highest level since it was signed; 42% approve. By an even wider margin, intensity favors the opposition; 41% of those surveyed strongly disapprove while just 26% strongly approve. Fifty-three percent disapprove of Obama's handling of health care policy, an historic high. And Democrats have lost their traditional advantage on the issue. For the first time in polling that stretches back more than two decades, Americans narrowly prefer Republicans in dealing with health care policy, 40%-39%.

A boost in approval for the law that followed the Supreme Court decision in July 2012 upholding most of its provisions, to 47% approve-43% disapprove, has disappeared.

Confusion continues: Only one in four say they understand the law's impact on them and their families well while one-third say they have little or no understanding about how the law will work. Despite increasing education efforts by the administration, advocacy groups and some states, the percentage of Americans who don't understand the law has declined only modestly, to 34% from 44%, since it was passed.

Expectations are downbeat: Most haven't seen much impact from the law, but they are inclined to expect bad news down the road. Forty-one percent predict in coming years the effect on themselves and their families will be negative; just 25% think it will be positive. Even more, 47%, say the law will have a negative impact on the country as a whole; 35% expect a positive impact.

The poll of 1,506 adults was taken Sept. 4-8. The margin of error is +/–3 percentage points.

A GOP DIVIDE ON WHAT NEXT

Republicans were united in opposing the law when it was proposed, and they haven't budged since. Just 12% of Republicans surveyed favored the health care proposals being considered by Congress in the summer of 2009, when opponents flooded congressional town halls. Now an almost identical 11% of Republicans approve of the law.

Still, significant differences have developed within the GOP over what to do now that the Affordable Care Act is law, a division that could complicate the hard line party leaders are taking. The most fervent opposition, the poll finds, is driven by Tea Party Republicans; two-thirds of those who oppose the law want elected officials to do what they can to make sure it fails.

However, non-Tea Party Republicans who oppose the law are inclined to think officials should do what they can to make the law work as well as possible. Among all opponents of the law, a narrow majority, 51%-42%, want officials to help the law succeed.

Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, says voters eventually will appreciate officials who are now ""scrambling"" to implement the law and create state exchanges that work. ""It's been politically popular to be against the Affordable Care Act,"" he says. ""My prediction is it's going to be much less popular when constituents understand that your political posturing is costing them affordable health care.""

In the Green Mountain State, officials and advocates of the state exchange called Vermont Health Connect have held more than 200 events at community forums and local festivals. They have aired TV, radio, print and on-line ads and posted informational videos on YouTube.com. (""For Vermonters, By Vermonters,"" the videos declare.) Organizers expect about a quarter-million people to have signed up for private insurance or Medicaid through the exchange by next March, when open enrollment is scheduled to close.

But in Tennessee, Rep. Black says she doesn't feel comfortable giving information to constituents who call her congressional office with questions about how the program will work. Since the Volunteer State isn't setting up a state exchange, residents will use the federal exchange.

""At this point, we don't really have a good idea, because the president and the administration doesn't have a good idea,"" she says. And she's reluctant to refer them to so-called ""navigators"" who have been hired to provide guidance because of what she sees as a lack of safeguards protecting applicants' Social Security numbers and other personal information.

The decision by 27 states (all but three of them with GOP governors) against participating in a state exchange may be contributing to the law's considerable challenges.

In the 23 states and the District of Columbia that will have state exchanges, residents split about evenly on approval and disapproval of the law. In the states that are defaulting to a federal exchange, however, residents oppose the law by an overwhelming 20 percentage points.

In states with their own exchanges, 59% of those surveyed understand that an exchange will be available to people in their state. In states using the federal exchange, just 44% realize that.

WHAT'S IN THE LAW?

Most Americans know the act, also known as Obamacare, means uninsured people have to get health insurance. About seven of 10 correctly say that's the case; just 12% say it's not.

On other specific provisions of the law, however, only half of those surveyed know there will be a health care exchange available in their state. Only half are aware that there will be federal subsidies for lower-income citizens to buy insurance.

Even so, for a starting point, consider this: Nearly two-thirds of the uninsured say they plan to get health insurance over the next six months, and not quite half of them say they're going to do so because of the law. That means 12% of those who don't have insurance now plan to get it soon. That translates to millions of Americans, more than double the administration's estimate that 7 million will enroll through the exchanges next year.

Shumlin cautions there are sure to be problems ahead.

""This is not going to be a hiccup-free ride,"" he says. ""Just from the technology perspective, there are going to be bumps in the road."" But time is on the side of supporters of the Affordable Care Act, he says, once the exchanges are implemented and Americans understand how they actually work. ""When constituents in states governed by Republican governors who are trying to make a political point with Obamacare figure out that their son, their daughter, is not getting health care because of their political posturing, well, I wouldn't want to be on the receiving end of that.""

Black expresses equal confidence that time is on the side of opponents of the Affordable Care Act, when the exchanges open for business and Americans understand how they actually work. ""Once this actually starts impacting people in their real lives, in their everyday life — 'My rates are going up; my full-time job is becoming a part-time job because of Obamacare' — once all of that starts happening, that's a negative,"" she says."

But as Congress fast-approached a midnight deadline, the two sides appeared no closer to an agreement.

“Republicans are still playing games,” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid declared on the Senate floor.

The Senate earlier in the night rejected the latest Republican counteroffer that would rein in ObamaCare while still funding the government past midnight.

House Republicans have started floating the possibility of taking their disagreement to what’s known as a conference committee – a bicameral committee where lawmakers from both chambers would meet to resolve the differences between the warring pieces of legislation.

More On This...

“It means we're the reasonable, responsible actors trying to keep the process alive as the clock ticks past midnight, despite Washington Democrats refusal - thus far - to negotiate,” a GOP leadership aide said.

Reid, though, said the Senate would not agree to the approach unless and until the House approves a “clean” budget bill.

Lawmakers are facing a midnight deadline to reach an agreement on a government spending bill, or the government begins to shut down. The rhetoric was getting more heated as the deadline neared.

“They’ve lost their minds,” Reid said of Republicans, in rejecting the latest proposal.

“Senate Democrats have made it perfectly clear that they’d rather shut down the federal government than accept even the most reasonable changes to ObamaCare,” Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell countered.

The latest House bill, which the chamber backed on a 228-201 vote, would have delayed the law's individual mandate while prohibiting lawmakers, their staff and top administration officials from getting government subsidies for their health care.

The Senate voted 54-46 along party lines to reject it.

Amid the drama, President Obama said he's holding out hope that Congress will come together ""in the 11th hour.""

A shutdown ""does not have to happen,"" Obama said, during remarks at the White House.The president has called the top four congressional leaders, including House Speaker John Boehner, though no breakthrough was reported.

At this point, it’s unclear what common ground the two sides can find. The latest GOP proposal stirred dissension in the ranks, with some lawmakers reluctant tohurt their own staff by taking away additional subsidies for their health care costs. According to the site Legistorm, the average House staffer salary is under $60,000.Twelve House Republicans peeled off in the latest vote to oppose the bill.

Congress has until midnight to craft a spending bill, or else the government will begin to wind down. Both sides, though, are digging in deep.

The Senate earlier Monday rejected a GOP proposal that would delay the health care law by one year and repeal an unpopular medical device tax. Reid warned Republicans not to fiddle with the spending bill any more.

Ahead of the House vote, Obama said Congress can avert a shutdown by passing a straight budget bill without ""extraneous and controversial demands.""

Obama warned that a shutdown would hurt all Americans, noting that the federal government is the country's largest employer.""A shutdown will have a very real economic impact on real people, right away,"" Obama said.

A prior Republican effort to include a provision defunding ObamaCare in the budget bill failed. House Republicans then voted, early Sunday, to add amendments delaying the health care law by one year and repealing an unpopular medical device tax.

The Senate, in a 54-46 vote, rejected those proposals on Monday afternoon.

In a rare note of optimism, Obama said earlier Monday that he's ""not at all resigned"" to a shutdown.

But the path forward is not clear. With nothing less than the operation of government on the line, the battle in Congress over ObamaCare was shaping into a test of wills.

Reid has outright stated he will not accept any measures that undermine the health care law as part of the budget bill. With the bill back on the House side, Boehner and Reid now face off with their final set of chess moves in a very narrow time frame. Lawmakers have until midnight to strike a deal.

Reid wants Boehner to simply call up the ""clean"" budget bill, without any ObamaCare provisions, and presumably let it pass with majority Democratic support.

""I have a very simple message to John Boehner: let the House vote,"" Reid said Monday.

But at this stage, a shutdown is highly possible, and congressional leaders are hard at work trying to assign blame. Democrats have already labeled this a ""Republican government shutdown."" But Republicans on Sunday hammered Reid and his colleagues for not coming back to work immediately after the House passed a bill Sunday morning."

Depending on the recommendations of a government task force he would create under a deputy mayor of health care innovation, he said, city coverage might still be placed in the hands of a different insurance company under a more competitive scheme, or the city might outsource just the administration to an insurer, as Medicare does while keeping overhead as low as 1.3 percent. A third option he listed would be for the city “to take the whole thing in-house.”

He said he would reorganize government agencies to seize opportunities presented by the Affordable Care Act, and have his health care innovation task force consider insurance terms that “keep more of the money in the city,” like allowing prescriptions to be filled at local pharmacies rather than only by mail order, or using the city’s development and investment capability to increase primary care at a hospital facing closure.

“This is not just a conversation you can have around cost,” he said, citing the nation’s experience in the 1990s with an H.M.O. model that no one liked, and calling the quality of health care in New York “a crown jewel.”

The coverage devised by the task force, which he called Thrive (standing for Taskforce for Healthcare Reform, Innovation and Vitality for Everyone), could eventually be offered to all New Yorkers by being listed on the state insurance exchange required by the Affordable Care Act. Such an experiment could not be tried in places like Cincinnati or St. Paul, he went on, but “New York is the health care capital of the world,” with more than 560,000 health care workers, including tens of thousands of doctors and nurses in the city’s own employ."

My parents are too young for Medicare, too rich for Medicaid, and right at the age when one develops conditions that must be ""managed"" and not just cured with a week's worth of antibiotics. When my mother was in the ICU, they gave her steroids to save her life, leaving her with steroids-induced diabetes. My dad, a mechanic who's worked 12+ hours a day since he was a teenager, has high blood pressure. Their conditions are the usual suspects for the 60s set.

My parents were never politically active before. As immigrants, they voted but didn't really follow the ins and out of the process. That changed as I became more politically involved. When my mother voted for Barack Obama (this was before she got sick), she said she was voting for him mainly because of his health insurance ideas. ""He better keep his promise. If he doesn't,"" she told me, ""I want you to write him a letter.""

I've typed up many a complaint letter for my mom. Trust me, you don't want to be on the receiving end of one of her letters.

Health care reform was the issue for my parents in the voting booth. They were, after all, spending most of their income on health insurance and health care costs.

To say my parents' health insurance before Obamacare was a ripoff would be like saying that the universe is kind of large and filled with some stars.

Their premium is $710 a month. Their deductible is $10,000 a year. Their medications are expensive. As a result, they've forgone a lot of preventative care and generally avoid doctor's visits. Here's the breakdown:

$8,520 - premiums

$10,000 - deductible

____

$18,520 out of pocket, not including coinsurance.

$18,520.

That's an obscenity that has no place in a modern, civilized society.

As their premiums have increased year after year, they've tried to shop around for better rates. Almost no one else would take them. If a company was open to taking on a couple with so many pre-existing conditions, it took advantage of the situation and quoted them prices that would have required them both to work two jobs. Ridiculous, to say the least.

Of course, I've tried to defray their costs over the years, as have my sisters. But my parents are very, very proud and refused to accept help, choosing instead to do what millions around the country have been forced to do: build a family budget around the costs of health insurance and hope that they don't get sick(er).





TRYING TO GET ENROLLED UNDER THE ACA: THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE VERY, VERY UGLY

As a digital strategist, I've produced more than enough websites to know how the launch process works. It's complicated, glitchy and no matter how well you test beforehand, something always goes wrong.

I was on healthcare.gov right when it officially launched around midnight, even tweeting out a picture of the site when it quietly went live.

I tried creating an account and hit the security question wall and couldn't get past it. I knew that glitches are part and parcel of any site launch. Time to wait it out.

Hours of glitches turned into days of defects, which turned into weeks of malfunction. I must have tried logging in/working the application dozens of times (no exaggeration). I'm no tech dummie, so I kept trying across browsers, clearing my cache/cookies, etc.

I finally managed to get my mother into the application phase, but her identity could not be proofed. I uploaded her ID and waited. After a week or so, I called the Marketplace again.

I will say this for the call desk workers at the Marketplace: generally, they could not have been more polite. Every person I spoke too was remarkably friendly, apologetic and understanding.

For all the hype in the press, it’s indisputable that the site has been getting better by the day. Every day, I was able to go a little further in the process.

On my mom's birthday, I asked her half-jokingly if she wanted to try logging in once more to get herself the Best Birthday Present Ever.

I sat down with her and we tried again. And finally, it worked.





THE REAL RATE SHOCK: BETTER HEALTH CARE FOR $53 A MONTH



Let there be no mistake, health insurance in this country is still outrageously expensive. At first launch, the marketplace isn't going to dramatically decrease the actual premiums set by the insurance companies. You'll still see those wince-inducing numbers on the screen as you research your choices.

The difference is that now, you may also see your taxes at work. If you're like my parents, you'll see a premium subsidy that takes the bite out of the insurance company price-gouging.

For my parents, their subsidy is a hefty one. They choose a silver plan where the premium will now be $53 a month.

Their new plan covers my mom's pulmonary specialist, all of her screenings (x-rays, CTs, etc), requires only a $1,500 deductible and $4,500 max out of pocket cost and the insurance company kicks in 100 percent after the deductible is met.

Granted, there are still glitches. Although she wanted to make a payment right away, she couldn't and the Marketplace reps say it will take some time for the information to transfer over to the insurance company.

Still, affordable, better coverage is the best birthday present she could ask for.

My parents' story isn't unique. Across the country, those who need help the most paying for their health insurance and health care costs are breathing a sigh of relief. Like the Sherburne family in Utah:



It took half-a-dozen tries over several days. But Phil Sherburne struck gold on Saturday — silver actually — with family health coverage purchased on the Affordable Care Act’s online exchange. After plugging in particulars about his family of five, the Salt Lake City business owner was able to compare 38 plans and apply for tax credits to put toward his monthly premiums. He settled on a silver-level plan from Altius that retails for about $850 a month. After tax credits, the Sherburnes will pay just $123 a month.

[S]he’s grateful for the Affordable Care Act, and she doesn’t have much patience with its many critics. “I think those people have never experienced what I’ve experienced,’’ she says. “They are shutting the door on the cancer survivors and the self-employed.”

I am a retired engineer on Medicare, and my wife had long been insured by Cigna, under a group plan from my engineers' society. Because of minor pre-existing conditions, she could not leave that plan, because no other plan would insure her. The Cigna premiums increased to $5,000 per quarter, or $20,000 per year, just for my wife. This year, Cigna canceled the entire plan, leaving her with no insurance. So, we turned to Obamacare. She found it simple and easy to sign up through an agent in a 10-minute phone call. She obtained their best plan, providing much much better coverage than in the past, at a cost of $3,000 per quarter. My wife would not have insurance coverage at all as of Jan. 1, if not for Obamacare. And, here's the kicker - we now are saving $8,000 per year, for a very much better plan.

FREEDOM TO SHOP AROUND

About a month or so ago, I received a notice that my health insurance company was raising my rates. The 12 percent increase was expected. After all, health premiums have been skyrocketing for years. That alarming rate was why President Obama and the Democrats pushed for health insurance reform in the first place.

Much has been made of the president's promise that ""if you like your health insurance, you can keep it."" Less has been made of a much more important fact: If you hate your health insurance, you can leave it.

Now, if an insurance company jacks up your rate, you have the freedom to shop around. I plan to and I'm sure I'll be able to find a plan with better value now that the exchange has been launched.

As for my parents? Well, in writing this, I asked my mother if she wanted to append a letter to President Obama.

""Just tell him thanks,"" she said. Then she smiled.

""It was a good birthday."""
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/05/03/obama-comfortable-with-decision-on-morning-after-pill-for-15-year-olds/,2013-05-03 00:00:00,[],Obama comfortable with decision on morning-after pill for 15 year olds,"President Obama said Thursday he was comfortable with his administration's decision to allow over-the-counter purchases of a morning-after pill for anyone 15 and older.

The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday had lowered the age at which people can buy the Plan B One-Step morning-after pill without a prescription to 15 - younger than the current limit of 17. The FDA decided that the pill could be sold on drugstore shelves near condoms, instead of locked behind pharmacy counters.

Obama, speaking at a news conference while in Mexico, said the FDA's decision was based on ""solid scientific evidence.""

What's still unclear is whether the administration will prevail on its appeal of a court order that would lift all age limits on purchasers of the pill.

That decision to appeal set off a storm of criticism from reproductive rights groups, who denounced it as politically motivated and a step backward for women's health.

""We are profoundly disappointed. This appeal takes away the promise of all women having timely access to emergency contraception,"" Susannah Baruch, Interim President & CEO of the Reproductive Health Technologies Project, said in a statement late Wednesday.

""It is especially troubling in light of the Food and Drug Administration's move yesterday to continue age restrictions and ID requirements, despite a court order to make emergency contraception accessible for women of all ages. Both announcements, particularly in tandem, highlight the administration's corner-cutting on women's health,"" Baruch said. ""It's a sad day for women's health when politics prevails.""

After the appeal was announced late Wednesday, Terry O'Neill, president of the National Organization for Women, said, ""The prevention of unwanted pregnancy, particularly in adolescents, should not be obstructed by politicians."" She called it a ""step backwards for women's health.""

Last week, O'Neill noted, Obama was applauded when he addressed members of Planned Parenthood and spoke of the organization's ""core principle"" that women should be allowed to make their own decisions about their health.

""President Obama should practice what he preaches,"" O'Neill said.

In appealing the ruling Wednesday, the administration recommitted itself to a position Obama took during his re-election campaign that younger teens shouldn't have unabated access to emergency contraceptives, despite the insistence by physicians groups and much of his Democratic base that the pill should be readily available.

The Justice Department's appeal responded to an order by U.S. District Judge Edward Korman in New York that would allow girls and women of any age to buy not only Plan B but its cheaper generic competition as easily as they can buy aspirin. Korman gave the FDA 30 days to comply, and the Monday deadline was approaching.

In its filing, the Justice Department said Korman exceeded his authority and that his decision should be suspended while that appeal is under way, meaning only Plan B One-Step would appear on drugstore shelves until the case is finally settled. If Korman's order isn't suspended during the appeals process, the result would be ""substantial market confusion, harming FDA's and the public's interest"" as drugstores receive conflicting orders about who's allowed to buy what, the Justice Department concluded.

Reluctant to get drawn into a messy second-term spat over social issues, White House officials insisted Wednesday that both the FDA and the Justice Department were acting independently of the White House in deciding how to proceed. But the decision to appeal was certain to irk abortion-rights advocates who say they can't understand why a Democratic president is siding with social conservatives in favor of limiting women's reproductive choices.

Current and former White House aides said Obama's approach to the issue has been heavily influenced by his experience as the father of two school-age daughters. Obama and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius have also questioned whether there's enough data available to show the morning-after pill is safe and appropriate for younger girls, even though physicians groups insist that it is.

Rather than take matters into his own hands, the Justice Department argued to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that Korman should have ordered the FDA to reconsider its options for regulating emergency contraception. The court cannot overturn the rules and processes that federal agencies must follow ""by instead mandating a particular substantive outcome,"" the appeal stated.

Social conservatives were outraged by the FDA's move to lower the age limits for Plan B - as well as the possibility that Korman's ruling might take effect and lift age restrictions altogether.

""This decision undermines the right of parents to make important health decisions for their young daughters,"" said Anna Higgins of the Family Research Council.

If a woman already is pregnant, the morning-after pill has no effect. It prevents ovulation or fertilization of an egg. According to the medical definition, pregnancy doesn't begin until a fertilized egg implants itself into the wall of the uterus. Still, some critics say Plan B is the equivalent of an abortion pill because it may also be able to prevent a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus, a contention that many scientists - and Korman, in his ruling - said has been discredited."

Obamacare) may well promise uninsured Americans a lot more than cheap, reliable medical care. It can also open the door to the democratic empowerment of millions of poor people, who are often alienated from much of the nation’s civic life, by strengthening the organizations that give them a voice.

This year more than 30 million uninsured Americans are to begin signing up for Obamacare, but the vast majority of those eligible for either the expanded Medicaid program, or for subsidized private health insurance through state health exchanges, have no idea how to enroll. Surveys and focus groups have found that up to three-quarters of Americans who might directly benefit from the program are skeptical that the law can provide high-quality insurance coverage at a price they can afford.

This is dangerous, not only for their health but for the viability of the law. Many people think that with the Supreme Court ruling upholding the law and President Obama’s reelection, the Affordable Care Act finally made it out of the political and judicial woods. After all, the last few weeks have seen half a dozen Republican governors sign up their states for its expanded Medicaid coverage.

But confusion, fear and ignorance among millions of potential beneficiaries can still doom the reform. In California, nearly 7.2 million people — more than 20% of the population — lack access to health insurance. Most of these people are poor, and for many, English is their second language.

Obamacare’s success depends on maximum possible participation. If too few healthy people purchase insurance through the state exchanges, not only will the flow of premiums and subsidies to hospitals, doctors and clinics prove inadequate, but insurance companies, which will be prohibited from turning anyone away, will be providing coverage for too many of the old, the ill and the desperate. Insurance rates will skyrocket. Then the young and relatively healthy may drop out of the system, only to face a penalty — $695 a year for an individual by 2016 — a politically toxic burden.

The Affordable Care Act would implode.

The law’s stakeholders are well aware of this danger. Enroll America — a Washington nonprofit funded by hospitals, insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry — will launch a media blitz this summer designed to explain how the new law works and what subsidies are available for working families.

In California, Covered California, the state health exchange, has geared up its outreach and publicity campaign, including an initial $43 million in grants to health clinics, community groups, trade unions and other nonprofits that have “trusted relationships with the uninsured markets that represent the cultural and linguistic diversity of the state.”

Advertisement

Covered California expects that by Oct. 1, when enrollment in health exchanges begins, they will have trained as many as 21,000 “assisters,” volunteers and employees of such groups. These people will knock on doors and sit around kitchen tables to guide the uninsured through the process.

Such hand-holding is essential because signing up for Obamacare will be complicated. Covered California and the other states’ health exchanges are creating streamlined Web portals, but the process of completing the template will be like filling out a tax return. And just as H&R; Block has hundreds of offices and thousands of employees who guide clients through the tax preparation process, so too will the state exchanges need organizations and knowledgeable and trusted people who can make the process understandable and reassuring.

Advertisement

And here is where Obamacare’s peril turns into a promise of enormous social and political benefit. As the poor, alienated and fearful realize that tangible benefits can be won through their neighborhood clinic, civic group or local trade union, and are drawn into civic life and grass-roots action, these organizations that are essential to the health reform’s implementation will be strengthened as agents of civic engagement and citizen mobilization.

This is not a case of creating more voters who will support Obama because of Obamacare. This is a 21st century example of Alexis de Tocqueville’s 19th century observation that the health of American democracy depends on the vibrancy of numerous voluntary organizations.

Advertisement

In recent history, we’ve seen the way such groups feed activism and are fed by it.

This was the case during the Depression when national labor organizations and their local chapters pushed for new labor laws and then gave them a tangible reality as the locals burgeoned in workplaces across America, and in the years after passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, when African American churches, the NAACP and other civil rights organizations reached out to millions and brought them to the registrar’s office and the polls.

Advertisement

Likewise, activists from the women’s movement and the environmental community were indispensable when the laws they had helped push through Congress were put to the test in thousands of communities.

In California, Obamacare civic activism has the political and administrative wind at its back. But in Texas, Louisiana, Georgia and other Southern states, where the political establishment still stands in opposition to the healthcare reform law, the enrollment of the uninsured in federally run health exchanges will require some of the courage and dedication last seen in those precincts when civil rights workers sought to end segregation half a century ago.

The task will be difficult, but the payoff will transform far more than the American health insurance system.

UnitedHealth, the nation’s largest private insurer, Aetna Inc. and Cigna Corp. are sitting out the first year of Covered California, the state’s insurance exchange and a key testing ground nationally for a massive coverage expansion under the federal healthcare law.

Meanwhile, the biggest insurers in the state — Kaiser Permanente, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of California — are all expected to participate in the state-run market for individual health coverage.

Quiz: Test your healthcare knowledge

Covered California, the state agency implementing the federal Affordable Care Act, is announcing the winning bidders and proposed rates Thursday for its insurance exchange, where as many as 5 million residents are expected to shop for coverage next year.

The state has picked a group of health plans for each of 19 regions across California. The insurers will be selling policies with uniform benefits packaged in four broad categories of coverage. For the first time in the individual market, consumers will be able to make easier price comparisons among companies.

But the threat of higher premiums in next year’s revamped market has been a major concern for policymakers who can’t risk alienating too many middle-income, healthier customers who are needed to offset the increased costs of covering sicker, poorer people who have been shut out of the healthcare system for years.

UnitedHealth, Aetna and Cigna are small players now in California’s individual health insurance market. More of their business is focused on large employers, where most Californians receive their health coverage. But the companies signaled a wait-and-see approach on these new government-run marketplaces.

Advertisement

Together, in 2011, those three big insurers had 7% of California’s individual health insurance market, according to Citigroup research. In contrast, Kaiser, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield had nearly 87%, collectively. Anthem Blue Cross is a unit of WellPoint Inc., the nation’s second-largest health insurer.

Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California, declined to comment on specific companies ahead of Thursday’s announcement. But he rejected any criticism that diminished competition could lead to higher premiums and fewer choices.

“There will be plenty of price competition for California consumers,” Lee said in an interview Wednesday. “They will be benefiting from robust competition.”

A spokesman for Minnetonka, Minn.-based UnitedHealth said, “We are simply taking the time to carefully evaluate and better understand how the exchanges will work to ensure we are best prepared to participate meaningfully in their development.”

Advertisement

Joseph Mondy, a spokesman for Bloomfield, Conn.-based Cigna, said the company chose to participate in exchanges in only half of the 10 states where it sells individual health policies. Those states include Arizona, Colorado and Florida. “We will continue to offer individual plans going forward, but we’ve decided not to participate in Covered California in 2014,” Mondy said.

Aetna, the nation’s third-largest health insurer, based in Hartford, Conn., referred questions to Covered California.

Advertisement

Glenn Melnick, a health policy professor at USC, said there could be advantages and disadvantages if the state’s three largest insurers — Kaiser, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield — grab even more business through the exchange. Their increased market power could give them even better bargaining leverage with hospitals and doctors, helping them to drive down healthcare costs.

But Melnick said it remained to be seen whether “the market is competitive enough that those companies will pass along those savings.”

Advertisement

Melnick said UnitedHealth, Aetna and Cigna may be making a mistake by sitting on the sidelines given California’s size and importance in the healthcare overhaul nationwide. “California is going to be a trendsetter,” he said.

Other health policy experts said the lack of these national health plans in the California exchange isn’t a major problem because the exchange probably will announce some new regional competitors.

Advertisement

“We will see a lot of interesting competition by region,” said Micah Weinberg, a senior policy advisor at the Bay Area Council, an employer-backed nonprofit group in San Francisco.

In March, state officials issued a report estimating that, compared with what individual policies cost now, premiums may rise an average of 30% for many middle-income residents who don’t get their insurance through their employers.

At the same time, lower-income consumers will reap the biggest savings and are projected to save as much as 84% off their coverage thanks to federal subsidies.

Advertisement

In California, individuals earning less than about $16,000 will qualify for an expansion of Medi-Cal, the state’s Medicaid program for the poor. Above that threshold, individuals making less than $46,000 and families earning below $94,000 annually will qualify for federal subsidies.

Starting in January, most Americans will be required to have health insurance or face a penalty.

HHS spokesman Jason Young confirms that Sebelius in recent weeks has asked various charitable foundations, businesses executives, churches and doctors to make financial contributions to nonprofit organizations, such as Enroll America, that are helping to implement President Obama's health care overhaul.

Young said there is a special section within the Public Health Services Act that allows the HHS secretary to solicit financial support for nonprofit organizations conducting public health work. He said most of the solicitations have occurred through telephone calls, but in some speeches as well.

""For the last several months, the secretary has been working with a full range of stakeholders who share in the mission of getting Americans the help they need and deserve,"" Young said. ""We have always worked with outside groups and the efforts now ramping up are just one more part of that work.""

The fundraising pitches were first reported by the Washington Post. Young said Sebelius made no fundraising request of entities regulated by HSS, such as drug companies, hospitals or insurers.

Some lawmakers and advocacy groups have voiced concerns in recent weeks that many consumers will have a hard time navigating the health coverage options available to them next year as a mix of government programs and tax credits for private insurance kicks in.

The administration has recently announced it would be directing $200 million to states, private groups and local health centers so that they can hire workers who can help consumers pick the insurance plan best for them. The fundraising pitches appear to be another step along those lines. Beginning Oct. 1, people can start signing up for coverage through new state and federal health exchanges.

But Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said that soliciting money from health care executives is absurd.

""Moving forward, I will be seeking more information from the administration about these actions to help better understand whether there are conflicts of interest and if it violated federal law,"" Hatch said.

Hatch's criticism comes as House Republicans plan yet another vote to try to repeal ObamaCare.

In his remarks at a Mother's Day-themed event at the White House on Friday, Obama said his signature health care law ""is here to stay.""

""There's a lot that this law is already doing for Americans with insurance,"" the president said. ""There's a lot more that's going to happen for folks who don't have insurance.""

Ted Cruz (R-TX) are threatening to shut down the government if Obamacare isn't defunded.



DR. SANJAY GUPTA (9/22/2013): Some Republicans in Congress are threatening to shut down the government unless the president agrees to strip out funding for Obamacare.

Yeah, that's right! I remember that night. How....? (audience laughter) Filthy. How do you....? I'll let you read it at your own pace. (audience laughter) As it rolls around the room, some people are just getting to that.

How do you justify a government shutdown?



SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/23/2013): I believe nothing is hurting the American people more, nothing is hurting the economy more, nothing is damaging jobs more, than Obamacare.

Still, if Ted Cruz's problem with Obamacare is that it's hurting jobs, I'm curious, what would a government shutdown do?



CHRISTINE ROMANS (9/23/2013): Based on the last shutdown in 1995 ... Hundreds of thousands of federal workers sent home without pay. Many, if not most, federal offices and programs would be closed, shut down. During the last shutdown, 200,000 passport applications went unprocessed. Some services to veterans were suspended.

The Washington Monument's fluffer will be furloughed.

(audience laughter)

Why is that... we couldn't have pointed that in the other direction? (more audience laughter) For God's sakes. All right, move on, move on. But I guess....

There's a joke associated with that, but I didn't get to it because I moved on. (Jon facepalms to audience cheering and applause) All right, forget it. Let's go.

But I guess if you really sincerely believe this is a terrible program that Americans will hate, I have to respect your principled stand, Ted Cruz.



SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (8/1/2013): The Obama administration's plan is very simple. It is to get as many Americans as possible addicted to the subsidies, addicted to the sugar, because they know the simple fact that in modern times, no major entitlement has ever gone into effect and then been undone.

You know how America is with entitlements, it's like crack to us. You give us one small taste of Social Security, and suddenly we're all sucking the glass tit of not having our old people freeze to death and live off cat food. (wild audience cheering and applause)

So that's it. I don't understand any of this. You're protecting America from this terrible Obamacare plan that once we get a taste of, we'll never want to be without. You only win if the program fails. Obamacare is your Springtime for Hitler. It turns out the Republicans aren't afraid we're all going to get finger-banged by a puppet Uncle Sam. They're afraid we gonna like it! (audience laughter and applause) We'll be right back."

Shear', 'Pam Belluck']",Obama to End Effort to Restrict Morning-After Pill,"Mr. Obama had expressed personal concern about making the drug more broadly available last year and offered support to Kathleen Sebelius, his secretary of health and human services, when she blocked a decision by the F.D.A. that would have cleared the way for nonprescription distribution to all girls and women regardless of age. He said that as the father of two young girls, the idea of making the drug available to them without a prescription made him uncomfortable.

But a federal judge angrily accused the administration of blocking the drug because of politics, not science, and ordered Ms. Sebelius to reverse her decision. Last week the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York City partially refused the Justice Department’s request for a delay in the judge’s order while the government appealed.

In its letter to the court, the Justice Department outlined the procedural steps that the F.D.A. plans to take. It said the maker of Plan B One-Step, Teva Pharmaceuticals, has been asked to “promptly” file an application asking for no age or sales restrictions, and that the “F.D.A. will approve it without delay.”

Once that is done, the F.D.A. expects makers of generic versions of Plan B One-Step — the most popular of those is Next Choice One Dose — to ask for a similar arrangement. The F.D.A. will evaluate those requests, based on whether it decides to give Plan B One-Step any type of market exclusivity, but most likely generic pills will also eventually be available without restrictions.

The Justice Department said it would not remove restrictions from two-pill emergency contraceptives because it is concerned that young girls might not be able to adequately understand how to take two separate doses. But two-pill versions are a diminishing fraction of the market.

The fight to make emergency contraceptives universally available without a prescription is more than a decade old. Plan B, the trade name for the morning-after pill, was approved in 1999 as a prescription-only product. In 2001 the Center for Reproductive Rights filed a citizens petition for it to be made available over the counter or without a prescription.

By December 2011, after years of pressure from women’s reproductive rights groups and the companies selling the drug, the F.D.A. was poised to lift all age restrictions. By then the F.D.A. also said it had determined that the drug was safe. But in an unprecedented move Ms. Sebelius overruled the agency. She said at the time that she had based her decision on science because she said the manufacturer had failed to study whether the drug was safe for girls as young as 11, about 10 percent of whom are physically able to bear children."
http://news.yahoo.com/voices-opposing-immigration-law-muted-august-070346071.html,,[],Voices opposing immigration law muted this August,"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — It was the kickoff of a ""Stop Amnesty Tour"" organized by the Tea Party Patriots and other groups. But the crowd was so sparse that immigrant advocates were soon gleefully circulating photos of the featured speaker, Republican Rep. Steve King of Iowa, standing alone on an empty stage.

The rally at a public park in Richmond, Va., earlier this month, along with the subsequent cancellation or postponement of several similar events, points to an emerging reality during Congress' five-week summer recess: Opposition to overhauling immigration laws appears notably muted, almost tame. Meanwhile, advocates who support comprehensive overhaul legislation are claiming they've changed at least a handful of minds among House Republicans.

During Congress' last attempt to remake the immigration system, in 2007, public backlash helped kill the bill as angry calls overwhelmed the Senate switchboard. This summer, other issues, notably President Barack Obama's health care law, seem to be topping the list of voters' concerns.

Constituents opposed to citizenship for immigrants in this country illegally are loudly voicing their views at Republican House members' town hall meetings this month. But advocates of immigration legislation that offers a path to citizenship are having some success getting their supporters to show up, too, even in heavily Republican districts.

""In a sort of immediate sense, Obamacare is what the party has decided they want to make a big deal of in these town halls, so that's frankly siphoning off a lot of outrage because the people ticked off about Obamacare are the same people ticked off about amnesty,"" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which opposes higher immigration levels.

Plus, the pro-immigration reform side is better organized and funded this time around and many establishment Republicans are on board. ""All of that put together means you're not going to see the same level of frantic activity,"" Krikorian said.

Story continues

What's less clear is how much it will matter once lawmakers return to Washington in September.

Immigration overhaul legislation, a top second-term priority for Obama, is in limbo after the Democratic-led Senate in June passed a far-reaching bill that includes tens of billions of dollars for border security, new visa programs to bring more high- and low-skilled workers to the country, requirements for employers to check all workers' legal status, and a 13-year path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants already in the country illegally.

GOP House leaders have rejected that approach, vowing instead to proceed with bills addressing individual immigration issues, beginning with border security. And although by advocates' count more than 20 House Republicans have now declared their support for some kind of citizenship path, the majority of House Republicans remain opposed, creating a potentially unbridgeable divide between the House and the Senate. Congress also faces looming deadlines on the debt ceiling and spending bills to keep the government running. It all adds up to a tough environment for getting an immigration bill to Obama's desk.

Nonetheless, pro-immigrant advocates are claiming success in their August recess efforts to pressure House Republicans to act on immigration in the fall. An unusual and deep-pocketed alliance of Catholics and evangelicals, labor unions, business groups and others have been targeting dozens of GOP members viewed as open to hearing them out, and say they'll have momentum on their side when Congress reconvenes.

""The big story I think of the August recess is that we haven't seen what some had predicted, this major anti-immigrant movement where members of Congress would be heckled into inaction,"" Galen Carey, vice president of government relations at the National Association of Evangelicals, said on a media call this week to announce a $400,000, 14-state radio ad campaign in support of immigration reform. ""We've seen very much that that has been a muted voice, but actually the pro-immigrant voice has been rather prominent at many of the town halls that we have observed.""

Although there have been no giant public rallies to draw national attention, pro-immigrant advocates have kept up a drumbeat of activity nationwide. They sent some 1,500 supporters into House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy's Bakersfield, Calif., district last week; delivered a 10,000-signature petition to Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas; and launched a statewide tour through Wisconsin, among other activities.

They're pointing to comments in the past few weeks from a handful of House Republicans, including Reps. Daniel Webster of Florida, Aaron Schock of Illinois and Dave Reichert of Washington, indicating qualified support for eventual citizenship for immigrants here illegally. So far, though, such comments have not become too widespread, and it's uncertain they'll add up to a real impetus for action in the fall.

But immigrant activists who'd been concerned that this summer could be a repeat of the last immigration fight — or of 2009, when irate voters trashed Obama's health care bill at unruly town hall meetings across the country — are starting to breathe easy.

The Stop Amnesty Tour event Aug. 12 in Richmond was to have been followed by events in other states, several of which subsequently disappeared from the Tea Party Patriots' website, according to an archived version circulated by the pro-immigrant group America's Voice. Organizers said most were going forward or rescheduled and disputed the claim by America's Voice that events were being canceled due to lack of interest.

""I think that when I heard about what happened at the Richmond event, we just look at what can we do to improve going forward, and one thing would be to give people more than 72 hours' notice,"" said Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of Tea Party Patriots. The group is working on the events with others, including NumbersUSA, which advocates lower immigration levels.

The Black American Leadership Alliance, which opposes allowing more immigrants into the country to compete for jobs, canceled a series of rallies, according to cached copies of Facebook postings collected by America's Voice. But Leah Durant, the group's founder, said those events were being held by local groups and the Black American Leadership Alliance was just trying to help support them.

""When I look at the focus of what's going on, I wouldn't say that there's no enthusiasm,"" Durant said. ""I hear from people every day who say they are very concerned about this."""

(CNN) —

Americans frustrated by attempts to purchase health insurance on www.HealthCare.gov will soon be able to determine their eligibility for tax subsidies and purchase insurance directly from insurance companies and private exchanges, a government spokeswoman announced Tuesday.

Julie Bataille of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency that oversees the government’s online insurance exchange, told reporters on a conference call that as of Tuesday morning, the process called “direct enrollment” should be functioning.

“With the fixes that we’ve put in place as of this morning, we do believe that the majority of those high-priority fixes for direct enrollment to work have been addressed,” Bataille said. “We continue to work with issuers and work through some additional issues.”

Customers not eligible for tax subsidies have been able to use direct enrollment since October 1, but the fixes put in place Tuesday expand the process to all customers seeking insurance on the individual market.

Battaille added that she expects insurance companies and other issuers will need to test the government’s technical fixes within their own systems and then begin using the direct-enrollment process “in the coming days.”

Bad news for woman cited as Obamacare success story

If it’s functioning properly, customers should be able to go directly to an insurance company’s website to learn about plan offerings. They would then be referred to Healthcare.gov to determine their eligibility for a federal tax credit and then directed back to the company site to purchase a plan.

Direct enrollment can also be used by private insurance exchanges such as eHealth.com and GetInsured.com. A spokeswoman for GetInsured.com confirmed that the government had alerted her company about the new fixes.

“We’ve entered into agreements with more than 30 of those kinds of entities,” Bataille said, adding that CMS has issued guidance over the past several months to these partners regarding how they can interact with the federal marketplace and the fixes put in place Tuesday should address their problems.

“We believe that they are on track to begin their transactions as soon as possible,” she said. “This is something that obviously they will make a determination about individually as they see how their system is interacting with ours.”

Obamacare enrollments pick up steam but don’t include many young people

Earlier on Tuesday, CMS Deputy Chief Information Officer Henry Chao told members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee that the federal marketplace was just 70% completed, meaning 30% of the marketplace still needed to be developed.

“That 30% represents the payment aspects and the accounting aspects of making payments in the marketplaces, for all marketplaces, not just federally facilitated marketplaces,” Chao said. “And that functionality has to be in place for the January 1 effective date enrollments.”

Bataille confirmed that the unfinished part of the marketplace included the portion responsible for paying out consumers’ tax subsidies directly to insurance companies, but she said that the development of those portions is on track.

“We are on track for this functionality to be available in the time frame that it would be necessary to process those transactions so that people would be able to have their coverage in January,” Bataille said.

Arizona companies have been hired to fill in, but many patients are struggling without regular treatment. The state behavioral health system is in turmoil, with the administration of Gov. Susana Martinez under sharp attack.

Laura Bruening’s 12-year-old son, Michael, who is autistic, has been without his therapist for two months, since funding was frozen at the Albuquerque provider where he worked. “I’m really concerned that we don’t have anybody to intervene if something happens with him at school,” she said, adding that her son had become noticeably more agitated.

State officials, under pressure from families like the Bruenings, said they had little choice but to take drastic action when the extent of the abuse accusations became evident.

“When we saw the totality of it all, it was extremely sobering,” said Diana McWilliams, chief executive of the state’s behavioral health system. “We have had to look at our entire system, and that’s what we’re doing. It’s scary, but it’s necessary.”"
http://money.cnn.com/2013/04/11/news/economy/disability-payments/index.html,2013-04-11 00:00:00,['Steve Hargreaves'],Disability claims skyrocket: Here's why,"The number of Americans getting some type of disability check from the federal government is soaring.

Since 2003, there's been a 29% jump in Americans with little or no work experience getting disability payments, according to the Social Security Administration. Over the same time, there's been a 44% increase in disability claims by people formerly in the workplace.

Disability claims among veterans are up 28% since 2008, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

All told, the federal government spent nearly $250 billion in 2011 paying more than 23 million Americans some type of disability claim. That's about 7% of the overall population, and 16% of the workforce.

Those numbers don't even include people out on worker compensation claims -- which are mostly paid for by private companies. Five states also offer short term disability, and there are nearly 1 million workers receiving private disability insurance.

But the Social Security-administered program that pays disability claims will likely run out of money by 2016, forcing politicians to either cut Social Security benefits, raise taxes or, most likely, dip into general Social Security funds for the money.

There are many reasons for the increase in disability claims, most notably the recession, an aging population, advances in medical technology and a decade of war.

The recession: The economic downturn in 2008 and early 2009 is thought to be the major reason for the jump in disability payments to people who were formerly working.

""With every recession, we see a rise in the number of applicants,"" said Andrew Houtenville, an economics professor at the University of New Hampshire's Institute on Disability. ""People are looking for options in terms of income support.""

During the 2001 recession, disability claims from those who used to have a steady job shot up 13%, said Barry Lundquist, president of the Council for Disability Awareness, an insurance-industry funded organization. The growth in claims slowed during the subsequent boom years, but then skyrocketed during the most recent recession. In 2009, claims jumped 21%.

Lundquist said it is simplistic to characterize the jump in claims as people simply looking to substitute disability payments for unemployment.

""Most people really do want to work,"" said Lundquist.

But for some, it's really just not an option.

Aging population: The U.S. population has risen about 8% since 2003. In addition to more people, the population is also getting older as the baby boomers retire.

Older people tend to have more disability issues. And if someone in their late 50s or early 60s gets laid off and also has some sort of injury, they know it's going to be hard for them to find another job.

Still, Houtenville noted that disability claims are up among all age groups.

Welfare reform: Efforts in the 1990s to reform the nation's welfare laws had the perverse effect of pushing more people onto the Social Security program for people with little work history. That has continued.

States and municipalities actually set up screening centers to test welfare recipients for disabilities, said John O'Neill, director of employment and disability research at the Kessler Foundation, a non-profit focused on disability issues. If any were found, state workers helped the people apply for federal disability benefits.

""They shifted their costs onto the federal government,"" said O'Neill.

Medical advances: This is particularly relevant for military veterans. Thanks to better surgical techniques -- and body armor -- soldiers are ten times as likely to survive today's wars, according to the Veterans Administration. But soldiers often come home with severe injuries.

The recent decision to recognize post traumatic stress disorder as a disability has also lifted the number of benefits claims. The Veterans Administration noted that illnesses tied to the cancer-causing chemical defoliant Agent Orange used in Vietnam are also now viewed as a disability.

But medical advances aren't just helping soldiers. Premature babies have a better chance of living now, as are people who have a heart attack or stroke. However, surviving doesn't mean that people are entirely symptom-free.

""We're not just living longer, but we're living disabled longer as well,"" said Daniel Steenerson, president of Disability Insurance Services, a company what works with both insurance firms and disabled people.

Need for reform: Some of the increases in disability payments are arguably a good thing - like more veterans being covered.

But Houtenville said the Social Security disability program for former workers could be improved if there also was a short term disability program that encouraged people to return to work.

An increase in job training and education programs for the disabled would also help."
http://money.cnn.com/2013/06/13/news/economy/obamacare-affordable/index.html,2013-06-13 00:00:00,['Tami Luhby'],"Obamacare: Is a $2,000 deductible 'affordable?'","Until now, much of the debate swirling around Obamacare has focused on the cost of premiums in the state-based health insurance exchanges.

But what will enrollees actually get for that monthly charge?

States are starting to roll out details about the exchanges, providing a look at just how affordable coverage under the Affordable Care Act will be. Some potential participants may be surprised at the figures: $2,000 deductibles, $45 primary care visit co-pays, and $250 emergency room tabs.

Those are just some of the charges enrollees will incur in a silver-level plan in California, which recently unveiled an overview of the benefits and charges associated with its exchange. That's on top of the $321 average monthly premium.

For some, this will be great news since it will allow them to see the doctor without breaking the bank. But others may not want to shell out a few thousand bucks in addition to a monthly premium.

""The hardest question is will it be a good deal and will consumers be able to afford it,"" said Marian Mulkey, director of the health reform initiative at the California Healthcare Foundation. ""The jury is still out. It depends on their circumstances.""

A quick refresher on Obamacare: People who don't have affordable health insurance through their employers will be able to sign up for coverage through state-based exchanges. Enrollment is set to begin in October, with coverage taking effect in January. You must have some form of coverage next year, or you will face annual penalties of $95 or 1% of family income (whichever is greater) initially and more in subsequent years.

Each state will offer four levels of coverage: platinum, gold, silver and bronze. Platinum plans come with the highest premiums, but lowest out-of-pocket expenses, while bronze plans carry lower monthly charges but require more cost-sharing. Gold and silver fall in the middle.

The federal government will offer premium subsidies to those with incomes of up to four times the federal poverty level. This year, that's $45,960 for an individual or $94,200 for a family of four. There will be additional help to cover out-of-pocket expenses for those earning less than 250% of the poverty line: $28,725 for a single person and $58,875 for a family of four. The subsidies are tied to the cost of the state's silver level plans.

Related: I'm signing up for Obamacare

California offers insight into how much participants will actually have to pay under Obamacare. The state, unlike most others, is requiring insurers to offer a standard set of benefits and charges in each plan level. The only variables are monthly premiums, doctor networks and carriers in your area.

For those in need of frequent medical care, the platinum or gold plans would reduce out-of-pocket costs for treatment. These plans have no deductible, and doctors' visits and medication are cheaper. But the trade-off is that they have higher monthly premiums. California has not yet released the premium range for these tiers.

On the flip side, a young man who never visits the doctor and wants to minimize his monthly charge could opt for a bronze plan. A 40-year-old enrolling in this plan could pay as little as $219 a month. But, if he did get sick, he'd get socked with a $5,000 deductible, $60 co-pays for primary care visits and a $300 emergency room charge.

Obamacare provides protection for those who need a lot of care by placing a cap on out-of-pocket expenses. The maximum a person in an individual platinum plan will spend a year is $4,000, while those in the other tiers will shell out no more than $6,400.

""Insurance is expensive. It's hard for anyone who isn't well off to afford it,"" said Gary Claxton, director of the health care marketplace project at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""But it is good enough that you can afford to get sick without bankrupting yourself.""

Whether potential enrollees find these plans affordable will depend on how healthy they are and whether they are currently insured.

Many individual insurance offerings currently available come with much higher deductibles, cover fewer expenses and limits on how much they'll pay out in a year. Plans on the exchange, on the other hand, are required to cover a variety of ""essential benefits,"" including maternity care, mental health services and medication.

""In many cases, depending on the plan, the coverage will be more comprehensive than what the enrollee currently has,"" said Anne Gonzalez, a spokeswoman with Covered California, which is running the state's exchange."

Although the president insists that everything is “working the way it’s supposed to,” a former HHS official has already warned that we will see a “redefinition of what ‘start’ means.”

That’s not the only thing being redefined.

The health care law was sold on three core promises: costs would go down, Americans could keep coverage they had and liked, and jobs would be created.

Instead, premiums are skyrocketing by as much as 400 percent, individuals are losing the health care coverage they currently have, and full-time jobs are being lost.

More On This...

[pullquote]

Employers across the country have been forced to refrain from hiring and are revisiting their coverage options in order to comply with the law’s costs – household names like the University of Virginia, Wegmans, Trader Joe’s, SeaWorld, UPS, Delta, Walgreens, and the Cleveland Clinic, to name a few.

Warnings about how this law will cause a ‘part-timing of America’ are coming from some of the president’s staunchest allies, such as labor unions and his hometown newspaper.

After falling behind schedule while spending over budget, the administration embarked on a frantic race to October 1.

It’s not surprising, then, that the security and functionality of the law’s many programs and data hub are in question.

It does not instill confidence that the administration was scheduled to certify the security of the health IT systems just hours before millions of Americans are expected to upload their personal information.

The administration was also months behind in doling out grants to Navigator groups for outreach and enrollment assistance, resulting in a reduction in training time by more than half and creating additional privacy concerns.

It was months behind in testing the calculator used to determine pricing online, raising questions about its accuracy. The administration even delayed the verification process entirely, choosing instead to rely on an ‘honor system’ in order to distribute taxpayer subsidies to applicants.

The vulnerabilities are startling, and one estimate says the potential for fraud could cost taxpayers $250 billion.

At the time of the final debate, then-Speaker Pelosi famously warned that we would “have to pass the law to find out what is in it.” The law was constructed behind closed doors, based on special interest deals, out of sight from the American people.

Implementation has been no different. The administration has used every opportunity to bury the law’s failures and act unilaterally to amend it along the way.

It has given waivers and delays to politically favored friends but left the rest of America to bear the full weight of the law. To quell the public’s growing discontent, the president is now mocking efforts to protect families from this looming train wreck as “crazy.”

Whether it’s ready or not, the president’s health care law will enter a new phase of implementation this week.

The American people face costly and onerous mandates, small businesses struggle to keep up with rising costs, doctors frustrated with the challenges of a government-run health care system, and the security of Americans’ health and financial information is unknown.

Add October 1 to the list of dates on which the Obama administration pretends a unworkable health care scheme is precisely what the American people were promised; an admission not yet made, but inevitable nonetheless."
http://news.yahoo.com/insurers-warn-overhaul-induced-sticker-shock-152538504--finance.html,,[],Insurers warn of overhaul-induced sticker shock,"Some Americans could see their insurance bills double next year as the health care overhaul law expands coverage to millions of people.

The nation's big health insurers say they expect premiums — or the cost for insurance coverage — to rise from 20 to 100 percent for millions of people due to changes that will occur when key provisions of the Affordable Care Act roll out in January 2014.

Mark Bertolini, CEO of Aetna Inc., one of the nation's largest insurers, calls the price hikes ""premium rate shock.""

""We've done all the math, we've shared it with all the regulators, we've shared it with all the people in Washington that need to see it, and I think it's a big concern,"" Bertolini said during the company's annual meeting with investors in December.

To be sure, there will be no across-the-board rate hikes for everyone, and there's no reliable national data on how many people could see increases. But the biggest price hikes are expected to hit a group that represents a relatively small slice of the insured population. That includes some of the roughly 14 million people who buy their own insurance as opposed to being covered under employer-sponsored plans, and to a lesser extent, some employees of smaller companies.

The price increases are a downside of President Barack Obama's health care law, which is expected to expand coverage to nearly 30 million uninsured people. The massive law calls for a number of changes that could cause premiums for people who don't have coverage through a big employer to rise next year — at a time when health care costs already are expected to grow by 5 percent or more:

— Changes to how insurers set premiums according to age and gender could cause some premiums to rise as much as 50 percent, according to America's Health Insurance Plans, or AHIP, an industry trade group that's funded by insurers.

— A new tax on premiums could raise prices as much as 2.3 percent in 2014 and more in subsequent years, according to a study commissioned by AHIP. Policyholders with plans that end in 2014 probably have already seen an impact from this.

Story continues

— Requirements that insurance plans in many cases cover more health care or pay a greater share of a patient's bill than they do now also could add to premiums, depending on the extent of a person's current coverage, according AHIP.

The Obama administration says the law balances added costs in several ways, including tax credits that will bring down what many consumers will pay for insurance.

""The health care law will bring down costs and save money for young people and families,"" said Erin Shields Britt, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services. ""It's misleading to look at one provision of the law alone. Taken together, the law will reduce costs.""

WHERE 'RATE SHOCK' MAY STRIKE

The impact of some cost hikes will be wide ranging. The new premium tax, for instance, will affect individual insurance, some employer-sponsored coverage and Medicare Advantage policies, which are privately-run versions of the government's Medicare program for the elderly and disabled.

Other price hikes will vary due to factors like a person's current coverage and age. Young people who currently have low-cost coverage may see some of the biggest hikes.

In many states, insurers charge a 60-year-old customer $5 in premiums for every $1 they collect from a 24-year-old. The logic behind that is that older people use health care more and generate more expensive claims than younger customers, so insurers need to collect more to help pay their bills.

But the overhaul will narrow that ratio to 3-to-1. That alone could cause the premium for a 24-year-old who pays $1,200 annually to jump to $1,800, according to AHIP. Meanwhile, the 60-year-old who currently pays $6,000 will see a 10 percent drop in price.

Gender also can be a factor in whether premiums go up or down. The law will prohibit insurers from setting different rates based on gender — something they currently do because women generally use more health care. That means premiums for some men could rise, while they fall for women.

Prices also may change depending on a person's current coverage. Many policies on the individual market (coverage not sold through employers) exclude maternity coverage, but that will be considered an essential health benefit under the overhaul. That could mean higher prices for some.

Vikki Swanson, 49, of Newport Beach, Calif., resents that the added benefit may lead to higher costs for her. ""I had a hysterectomy, I have no need for maternity coverage, but I have to now pay for it,"" she said.

As a self-employed accountant and financial analyst, Swanson has paid for her insurance coverage on the individual market for about 13 years. She watched her monthly premium climb from around $136 in 2001 to more than $600 before she could find cheaper coverage. She's frustrated that the overhaul may add to her bill.

""I have to pay not only my own premium but I have to subsidize everybody else,"" she said.

CUSHIONING THE BLOW

While insurers forecast instant premiums hikes starting next January, the overhaul also is expected to tame health care costs for many.

Starting next year, the law will require insurers to cover everyone who applies. That means health care costs could fall dramatically for people who have been unable to find coverage due to a chronic condition like diabetes or high blood pressure.

There also will be tax credits, or subsidies, given to people with incomes that fall within 400 percent of the federal poverty level. For 2013, 400 percent of the poverty level for all states except Alaska and Hawaii would be $94,200. These credits won't lower premiums, but they can ease the insurance bill depending on a person's income.

The credits should help the 20-something customers that insurers warn will see big premium hikes, said Linda Blumberg, an economist with the Health Policy Center of the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization. She noted that people in that age range are more likely to be either working for an employer that doesn't offer coverage or earning low wages that would entitle them to a sizeable credit.

""While these folks are potentially facing some premium increases due to all these reforms, they also are the ones most likely to get the financial help from the exchanges,"" she said.

There are other changes that will benefit young and poor people. Some may qualify for coverage under the state-federal Medicaid program for the poor and disabled, which will expand in many states next year.

Additionally, people under age 30 who face big premium hikes will be able to buy plans that charge low premiums and just provide coverage for big or catastrophic costs. Those plans also will be available to people required to pay more than 8 percent of their income for coverage.

Plus, people who are age 26 and under are eligible to receive coverage under a parent's plan, thanks to another overhaul provision that already started.

In addition to those changes, insurers will have to compete for business on the exchanges, which could restrain price hikes, said Larry Levitt, a private health insurance expert with the Kaiser Family Foundation, which analyzes health policy issues. He noted, for instance, that some are already creating narrow networks of low-cost providers to help keep costs in check.

""Plans are very focused on trying to get these premiums down,"" he said.

But Robert Laszewski, an industry consultant and former insurance executive, said that theory assumes there is no competition in the marketplace now. He noted that a small company may get quotes from as many as 10 insurers competing for business when it tries to find coverage through a broker.

""I haven't had one person in the industry remark to me, 'Gosh, I wonder what the other guy's charging,'"" he said. ""They're worried that all this stuff is so expensive, they're not going to get the pricing right."""

WASHINGTON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - A top White House technology adviser will testify at a congressional hearing on Wednesday about the troubled launch of the website at the heart of President Barack Obama's signature healthcare reform despite the administration's assertions that he was too busy.

The White House confirmed late on Tuesday that Todd Park, its chief technology officer, would comply with a subpoena to testify at a hearing of the Republican-controlled House of Representatives Oversight Committee.

The White House had asked to delay the hearing until December, saying that Park was too busy helping to fix the HealthCare.gov website, which Obama has vowed will be working smoothly for most people by the end of the month.

Technical problems with the website since its Oct. 1 rollout have prevented many Americans from enrolling in the health exchanges set up under the 2010 healthcare law, also known as Obamacare.

""The partisan subpoena issued by House Republicans on Friday was an unfortunate and unnecessary step since we made clear several times that Todd Park is willing to testify,"" said Rick Weiss, a spokesman for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.

""It wasn't a question of if, it was a question of when,"" Weiss said.

Park was a successful healthcare IT developer before he joined the Obama administration, steering Athenahealth through a blockbuster IPO, and helping start another company, Castlight, which provides data on healthcare costs.

A sought-after speaker at IT conferences, Park is popular within the technology community. More than 1,200 allies signed a petition at lettoddwork.org calling on Darrell Issa, the Republican committee chairman, to postpone Park's testimony.

""No matter what side of the aisle you sit on, Todd is one of the good guys. Let him do his job,"" the petition said.

Park, 40, helped build the original HealthCare.gov website in 2010 when he was chief technology officer at the Department of Health and Human Services. At the time, the website provided information about public and private insurance programs, sorted by zip code.

Also slated to testify are Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer at the White House budget office, Henry Chao, the deputy chief information officer at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and Frank Baitman, chief information officer for HHS."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/abortion/philosophical/selfdefence.shtml,,[],Abortion: Abortion in self-defence,"Abortion in self-defence

Even if we accept that the foetus is a person with a right to live, this doesn't mean that all abortions are wrong.

In some circumstances it may be ethical for a mother to have an abortion to defend herself from the danger to her mental or physical health that continuing with the pregnancy would cause.

Where continuing the pregnancy threatens the mother's life or health

If continuing with the pregnancy would cause the mother's death, even those most strongly against abortion accept that this is a case where abortion is ethically acceptable.

(NB: some people argue that this is a case of the doctrine of double effect rather than a self-defence argument, and that the death of the foetus is merely the side-effect of medical treatment to save the mother's life.)

It is generally accepted that a person has the right to defend themselves when they are in danger, and that they may use violence, or even kill in extreme circumstances, in order to protect themselves from physical attack.

This can apply even when the person causing the danger is entirely innocent of any bad intent, completely unaware that they are causing a danger, or is in some other way not responsible for being a danger.

Thus if a foetus (entirely innocently) endangers the life of a mother, it's argued that the mother has the right to abort it.

A person may also have the right to kill when threatened with severe harm but not actual death (e.g. a pregnancy that would permanently damage the mother but not kill her).

And a person may get someone else to take the necessary action to protect them (e.g. the doctor who performs the abortion).

There are a couple of objections to note:

in most cases the mother has brought the danger on herself by becoming pregnant - should this change the moral argument? in practical terms it won't, because if the pregnancy kills the mother it will probably kill the foetus too the mother could argue that she only consented to becoming pregnant, and did not willingly consent to having a defective and life-threatening pregnancy

unlike most cases of self-defence, the foetus isn't actually doing anything that threatens the mother - does this make a difference?

Non-physical threats to the mother

But supposing the mother is not in physical danger, what then?

There are a number of cases where some people argue that a woman should have the right to an abortion, such as:

damage to mental health

damage to family

damage to career prospects

damage to financial prospects

damage to plans for her life

The self-defence argument for abortion seems to fail here, because although a threat to life can be a defence to a charge of killing someone, none of the above would be an adequate defence in a case of homicide, nor would they be regarded as reasons that justified euthanasia.

But if we don't regard the foetus as a person with a right to live, or if we regard it as a being that doesn't have a full right to life, then these cases of self-defence may be arguable."

USA TODAY

The president launches another campaign to convince the public of the benefits of the Affordable Care Act

Obama said he%27ll make sure the law works %27if I have to fight another three years%27

Republicans criticize the law%2C dismiss White House efforts to rally support for it

WASHINGTON — After spending much of the past two months on the defensive as a result of the rocky rollout of his health care law, President Obama began a pre-holiday campaign Tuesday to boost enrollment now that the troubled online health exchange has been largely repaired.

The White House, the Democratic National Committee and the pro-Obama political group Organizing for Action say they will spend the next few weeks highlighting how Americans benefit under the law. Consumers must be enrolled in a health care plan by Dec. 23 to be on the insurers' rolls Jan. 1.

In a speech to mark the beginning of the effort, Obama took aim at Republican lawmakers who have repeatedly called for repeal of the law and have attempted to use the troubled implementation to take shots at several vulnerable Democratic lawmakers up for re-election in 2014 who supported the Affordable Care Act.

""We're not repealing it as long as I'm president,"" said Obama, who was flanked by Americans who have benefited from aspects of the law. He said, ""If I have to fight another three years to make sure that this law works, then that's what I'll do.""

The publicity blitz for Obamacare comes after the administration claimed victory in achieving its goal of getting the glitch-riddled HealthCare.gov website working for the vast majority of Americans by Nov. 30. Consumers are still experiencing some delays on the site, but the White House said there were more than 1 million visitors to the site Monday.

Though the administration can claim it has made huge strides improving the website — which serves as the online exchange for 36 states that refused to create their own exchanges — Obama is not out of the woods.

Some of the enrollment data insurers received from Americans who have signed up through the health care exchange contain errors — meaning some consumers might not be able to access the benefits Jan. 1 when they're scheduled to go into effect.

Republicans seized on a report released Tuesday by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration that found that ""critical"" pieces in security controls failed during testing and that the Internal Revenue Service's fraud detection system may not be capable of identifying ACA refund fraud.

The report was completed more than two months ago, and the IRS noted in a response that it has taken steps to bolster its fraud detection.

""The president's health care law continues to wreak havoc on American families, small businesses and our economy,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said before Obama spoke. ""And it's not just a broken website.""

After the improvements to the website, the White House is set to resume stating its case to the public that it is working to meet a huge demand from Americans for affordable health care.

Obama said he hopes to focus attention back on the benefits of the law — something he said has been lost with all the attention on the website's problems.

As a result of the law, the president said, Americans are benefiting from bans on insurers setting lifetime benefit limits. He said 7 million seniors and Americans with disabilities have saved $1,200 on prescription drug costs and 9.5 million families have received refunds from their insurers.

""What's important for everybody to remember is not only has the law helped millions of people, but there are millions more that stand to be helped,"" Obama said. ""And we got to make sure they know that.""

Several polls have shown that a majority of Americans disapprove of the law, but a majority are opposed to a total repeal.

Boehner criticized Obama as being out of touch with what Americans want, but he declined to commit to vote on replacing the president's health care law next year with a Republican plan.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., dismissed the president's effort to trumpet the law. The senator's office noted that the latest effort marks at least the 13th attempt at a public relations blitz for the law since 2009.

""Another campaign-style event won't solve the myriad problems facing consumers under Obamacare,"" McConnell said before Obama's speech.

Obama charged that McConnell and fellow Republicans are disingenuous for repeatedly calling for repeal but not offering a viable alternative for helping Americans without insurance.

""If, despite all the millions of people benefiting from it, you still think this law is a bad idea, you got to tell us specifically what you'd do … to make insurance more secure,"" Obama said. """"You can't just say the system was working with 41 million without health insurance."""

http://news.yahoo.com/last-minute-obamacare-exemption-those-canceled-plans-044422611.html,,[],Last-minute Obamacare exemption for those with canceled plans,"By Roberta Rampton WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration made a major last-minute policy shift on Thursday, saying the change would help Americans meet a looming deadline to replace insurance plans canceled because of new standards under Obamacare reforms. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said that this group of people - estimated by the administration to be fewer than 500,000 in number - will be allowed to claim a ""hardship exemption"" from the requirement in the 2010 Affordable Care Act to buy insurance. Armed with the exemption, they then have the option to buy ""catastrophic"" insurance plans - cheaper insurance with a minimal coverage level that, under the law, is normally available only to people under the age of 30. ""This is a common-sense clarification of the law,"" said Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for Sebelius. ""For the limited number of consumers whose plans have been canceled and are seeking coverage, this is one more option."" In the law, there are 14 categories of ""hardships"" that can be used to get an exemption from the mandate to buy insurance, such as a recent eviction or bankruptcy. But this is the first exemption prompted by the administration's botched rollout of the law, and comes after months of insistence that there would be no delays in implementing the individual mandate. The rocky rollout of President Barack Obama's signature policy achievement has been embarrassing and politically damaging, helping push Obama's approval ratings to the lowest point of his presidency. Part of the backlash came when millions of people received policy cancellation notices, forcing Obama to apologize for a promise he made that people who liked their insurance policies could keep them under the Affordable Care Act reforms. The latest twist comes just days before a December 23 deadline for arranging insurance coverage to begin on January 1. In effect, it will provide the administration and Democrats in Congress some political cover, because people won't be able to claim they don't have insurance purely because their policy was canceled and alternatives are too expensive. The change was suggested by a group of Democratic senators, some of whom face difficult reelection campaigns in 2014. But the exemption comes after a series of other delays in enforcing or implementing various parts of Obamacare, and instantly sparked more political criticism that the government is unevenly and unfairly applying the law. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican who is vice-chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said in a statement that the change was a ""holiday surprise"" that showed the White House was ""in full panic mode"" ahead of the deadline. ""Rather than more White House delays, waivers and exemptions, the administration should provide all Americans relief from its failed law,"" Blackburn said. The head of the lobby group for insurance companies also panned the change. ""This latest rule change could cause significant instability in the marketplace and lead to further confusion and disruption for consumers,"" said Karen Ignagni, president of America's Health Insurance Plans. MORE 'BUMPS IN THE ROAD' AHEAD Millions of Americans don't have health insurance, a gap Obamacare aimed to fix. But enrollment got off to a painfully slow start because of the poorly designed HealthCare.gov website used to shop for plans. Only 365,000 people had signed up by the end of November, when the site finally began to work well for most people. Officials said there has been a surge in enrollments in December. They said more than 70 percent are people who were stymied by the technical problems earlier on, but they declined to release new enrollment data. ""Folks have come back, and they're coming back in droves,"" one of the officials told reporters. The administration is also girding for the next phase of the rollout, when they anticipate newly insured Americans could encounter problems with coverage as they seek care at pharmacies and doctors' offices. The insurance, required by law, is sold by private companies. To prepare for gaps, officials said they have trained call center staff to connect consumers with their providers. ""This is a big transition that we are going through,"" one of the officials said. ""There will be bumps in the road."" COUNTER-NARRATIVE The White House also concluded on Thursday a three-week barrage of events designed to trumpet good news it feels has been lost amid stories about the botched rollout. It released a state-by-state report showing how many Americans have already gained new protections from reforms, such as the numbers now prevented from being denied coverage because of pre-existing medical conditions. The information provides a ""counter-narrative"" for congressional Democrats, who are anxious a backlash against the law could hurt them in 2014 elections, said Tevi Troy, a White House aide and former Deputy Health and Human Services Secretary in the George W. Bush administration. But the White House also is trying to burnish Obama's legacy achievement, he said. ""I think it's about changing the damaging story about Obamacare,"" Troy said. Republicans have repeatedly voted to repeal the law, shutting down the government for 16 days in October over the issue. They have said they will continue to push for changes. ""The fact is, premiums are going up, millions of people are losing the plans they had, and access to doctors and hospitals is being restricted as a result of Obamacare,"" said Don Stewart, deputy chief of staff to Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate. But on a conference call organized by the White House on Thursday, Democratic congressman Joaquin Castro from Texas told reporters he is not worried the law will hurt him in 2014. ""I believe that by November 2014, the reality will overtake the propaganda,"" Castro said, explaining he thinks consumers will appreciate the ""tangible benefits"" of the law and will forgive the ""glitches"" in the rollout.

She chooses to forgo coverage for one simple reason: “I never get sick.”

Despite her reluctance, Sargsyan is exactly the type of person insurance plans, states and the federal government are counting on to make health reform work.



As the clock ticks toward the 2014 launch of the Affordable Care Act, health leaders across the nation are embarking on a tough task: persuading young adults like Sargsyan to enroll. Their participation will be critical to balance out older, sicker patients more likely to sign up for health insurance as soon as they are able.

The success of the healthcare law “depends on reaching everyone who is uninsured, but particularly young people who may feel like they don’t need insurance,” said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Convincing them to spend money on insurance, he said, will be a “marketing challenge.”

Getting young adults on board will require changing cultural norms, Levitt said. “For kids in their 20s … following convention isn’t their first instinct,” he said.

The federal law allows young adults to stay on their parents’ policies until they are 26. About 425,000 people in California have taken advantage of the new benefit, officials say, leading to savings for them and their families when they go to the emergency room.

Still, more than 2 million Californians ages 19 to 34 are uninsured, according to the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research.

Beginning in 2014, nearly everyone will be required to have insurance or face a fine — $95 or 1% of their household income in the first year. Many young adults who are not covered through work or their parents may be eligible for Medicaid or the new state-based insurance market places known as exchanges.

Health officials worry that the fine, which increases over time, isn’t high enough to convince people to sign up for coverage. “The penalty itself will not convince a young person, or any other person,” said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for Covered California, the state’s exchange. “Young people will need to understand the risks of not having health insurance.”

Osvaldo Lopez, 24, of El Sereno said he understands the risks because he plays soccer and worries about getting injured. But Lopez, a student who works part time, said he can’t afford it. After graduation, he hopes to get a law enforcement job that provides insurance so he won’t have to pay for his own.

Another student, Zach Gaul, 19, said he was thankful to still be covered under his parents’ plan, even though he has to pay them a portion of his paycheck for the coverage.

“I do reckless things all the time,” he said, listing recent activities: skateboarding, bike riding, drinking, racing cars, jumping off a waterfall. “If I get hurt, I’d like to be able to afford getting airlifted out.”

Covered California is developing media messages that are “a little edgier” and specifically target young adults, Hidalgo said. The state plans to use a financial security argument, telling young people that insurance can protect them from going broke if they are hospitalized after a car accident, a broken bone or an illness.

“This will have its challenges, kind of like talking to your kids when you are trying to advise them of the right thing to do,” Hidalgo said.

Last week, the state released its rates for health insurance under the exchange. While costs vary based on age and income, young adults with low or middle incomes are likely to receive substantial subsidies — for premiums, deductibles and co-pays. For example, a 21-year-old who earns about $16,000 would pay about $45 each month for the mid-level plan. State officials point out that costs could rise in subsequent years if not enough healthy people enroll.

In an effort to educate and enroll young adults across the state, Covered California also awarded millions of dollars in grants to the University of California, Cal State L.A. and the Los Angeles Unified School District.

Many Cal State students are young, low-income and minority and probably eligible for Medi-Cal or subsidized health coverage, said Walter Zelman, chairman of the public health department at Cal State LA. Zelman, who is overseeing a $1.25-million grant, said he plans to hire graduate students at most of the Cal State campuses to lead the way on outreach. The campuses will also conduct training, hold forums and enroll as many students as possible, he said.

“Not only is this a needy population and a deserving population, but it is a population that is relatively easy to reach,” he said.

The Young Invincibles, a policy and advocacy organization, has also started a campaign and a mobile app to raise awareness about health coverage. The organization’s California director, Tamika Butler, said the group was focusing on both enrollment and education. And staff, who are young adults themselves, are telling other young people that insurance can give them financial peace of mind as well as help them get preventive and mental healthcare.

Butler said young people who learn about the benefits of insurance can spread that knowledge to friends and family. “Young people are a gateway to not just get insured themselves, but to get other community members insured,” she said.

Bianca Gonzalez, 23, said she and her family have long been uninsured and rely on herbal remedies whenever they get sick. Gonzalez, who lives in Eagle Rock, said she never thought much about insurance because she didn’t think they qualified for anything affordable. But after learning about Medi-Cal in a health policy class at Cal State L.A., Gonzalez said she realized her family may be eligible in 2014.

“It’s awesome,” she said. “If I need to go to a doctor … I will be able to go and get service without worrying about how I am gonna pay for it.”

Sargsyan, meanwhile, hasn’t seen a doctor in five years. Even though she recognizes that health plans need people like her, she doesn’t want to pay a costly monthly premium. Unless she finds a job by 2014 that offers inexpensive insurance, Sargsyan said she will probably just pay the penalty.

“God forbid something happens,” she said. “Until then, I’m living healthy and happy.”

He Joined Fnc In As A Senior White House Correspondent.']",No alternatives to ObamaCare? Republicans rebut White House claim,"President Obama has tried to defend his health care plan lately by criticizing Republicans for trying to roll back ObamaCare without offering any alternatives -- despite the fact that Republicans have offered several.

In a White House news conference a week ago, the president said: ""They used to say, 'well, we're going to replace it with something better.' There's not even a pretense now that they're going to replace it with something better.""

Moments later, Obama elaborated, saying ""they used to say they had a replacement. That never actually arrived, right? I mean, I've been hearing about this whole replacement thing for two years -- now I just don't hear about it, because basically they don't have an agenda to provide health insurance to people at affordable rates.""

The assertion makes some Republicans livid.

""For the president to say that no Republican member of Congress has put up a positive solution, or a solution to the health care challenge, is simply not true,"" said Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., who introduced his own health care bill before ObamaCare was even passed.

His wasn't the only one.

""I think the president has an incredibly short memory,"" said John Goodman of the National Center for Policy Analysis in Dallas. ""He seems to have forgotten his campaign spent millions and millions of dollars attacking the John McCain health plan. In fact, that was their major argument against John McCain.""

After the campaign, that plan was championed in Congress and co-sponsored by Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis.

Goodman explains the plan ""would grant a refundable tax credit to every American. It would treat us all same, unlike ObamaCare. It would not discourage employers from hiring anyone. It would not push us all into part-time jobs.""

Goodman was referring to criticism that the current health care law will drive employers to push workers into part-time status, due to a provision that requires some employers to offer coverage to workers logging 30 hours or more per week. The White House denies this, with a top economic adviser arguing recently that there is ""no systematic evidence that the Affordable Care Act is having an adverse impact on job growth or the number of hours employees are working.""

One analyst says most Republican plans, including the Price plan, aim to give every American the same tax benefit as those who get tax-free employer-provided health insurance -- but put the power and the money under the individual's control.

Michael Tanner of the Cato Institute said those who pay the piper, call the tune.

""If your boss controls your health care spending, your boss gets to choose your insurance. If the government gets to control your health care spending, then they get to ration care,"" he said. ""If you control your own money, then you get more choice and more control over your health care dollars.""

Price emphasizes that his and other alternatives would let consumers choose what kind of insurance they want, while ObamaCare requires consumers to buy insurance and sets guidelines for what will be offered on the market.

""We ought to be moving in the direction of patient-centered health care,"" Price said. ""Which means patients and families and doctors making medical decisions, not Washington, D.C.""

Republicans are making clear they do indeed have alternatives, including ways to protect those with pre-existing conditions, in spite of the president's comments.

Their problem, analysts say, is they don't have a single national spokesman who can step forward and say ""this is the plan,"" in the same way the president can."

In fact, many of those in the opposing Obamacare opposed it because it did not go far enough. It was not Medicare for all (single payer) nor did it have a public option. Corporate interest won the first round but they will lose the war and they know it. It is for this reason that the GOP continues to fight the battle against Obamacare just hoping that just maybe they can break it before metastasis.

When one is born, one does not choose gender, genetic makeup, or predisposition to any particular disease. As a mostly free society we do not dictate what foods people can eat, what “legal” vices they may indulge in, or whether they should be sedentary or active. We know that the vast majority will at some time get sick. Moreover, we know that some that live a very responsible and a healthy life will get sick often and some that live a rather unhealthy and irresponsible life will rarely get sick. Of course the converse is also true. My father cycled 10 miles frequently, walked 2 to 5 miles every day, ate well, got his annual exams and suddenly died of a heart attack at 77. My mother-in-law continues to eat badly, does no exercise, had a quadruple bypass and many other surgeries and thankfully remains with us.

As a civil and moral society we the people create institutions to do things that are done better together than as individuals. We don’t each build a piece of road in front of our homes or independent paths to a grocery store. Because roads, schools, national defense, satellites, etc. are of utmost importance to our continued existence, we the people collectively finance it. They are not free. We all pay towards it because individually it is impossible or unduly burdensome.

How can we not look at health insurance in that same light? How could we have sold our health and financial well-being to be traded like a commodity? You cannot be pro-life and support a health insurance system that discriminates by gender, pre-existing condition, or some other metric. Doing so is the potential abortion of a born human life.

Statewide, 50% said they backed the Affordable Care Act and 42% opposed it, according to the USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll. That runs counter to national polls that show more people disapprove of Obamacare than support it.

Latinos, who make up about half of California’s uninsured population, were even more enthusiastic, supporting the healthcare law by a 2-1 margin. Forty-nine percent of whites were opposed, with 44% in favor.

Predictably, 77% of Democrats backed the president’s healthcare plan, whereas 80% of Republicans surveyed said they were against it. Independents were more evenly split.

Cutting across partisan and racial lines, Californians as a whole were skeptical that the Affordable Care Act would live up to its name.

Sixty-five percent of respondents said people wouldn’t be able to afford the health insurance they’ll be required to have under the law’s individual mandate. Forty percent think the program will have a negative effect on what they pay for coverage, compared with 21% who expect a positive outcome.

According to the survey, 46% of registered voters expect the Affordable Care Act to be a drag on the overall economy and 34% see an economic boost. Nearly 60% think the law’s new requirements will raise healthcare costs and keep businesses from hiring more workers.

The poll was taken just as the national healthcare rollout was coming under intense criticism in Congress, even from some Democrats. Obama has apologized for the malfunctioning healthcare.gov enrollment website and for millions of Americans receiving cancellation notices because their current coverage doesn’t meet all the requirements of the healthcare law.

Those consumers have directed much of their anger at Obama’s repeated pledge that Americans could keep their existing insurance if they liked it.

California is running its own insurance exchange, as are 13 other states, and its online enrollment hasn’t experienced nearly as many problems as the federal marketplace for 36 states. But the sticker shock from higher premiums and concerns about losing access to preferred doctors and hospitals have taken a toll.

“California has had a pretty good rollout on its exchange compared to the national one, but people here are still feeling the negative repercussions of higher costs and lost policies,” said David Kanevsky of American Viewpoint, the Republican firm that helped conduct the poll for the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and The Times.

The poll was conducted jointly by American Viewpoint and Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, a Democratic polling firm in Washington. They surveyed 1,503 registered state voters by telephone Oct. 30-Nov. 5. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, and larger for subgroups.

For Obama and his signature law, much depends on Californians embracing the changes. California wants to enroll more than 2 million people by the end of next year in subsidized health insurance or an expansion of Medi-Cal, the state’s Medicaid program for the poor.

Poll respondents said they were upbeat about the law’s potential to help many of the state’s 7 million uninsured. Sixty-five percent expect there will be fewer people without coverage and 67% think patients will get more access to checkups and other preventive care.

“Fundamentally, Californians are viewing the Affordable Care Act as a mixed bag,” said Drew Lieberman of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner. “They harbor real concerns about the potential negative impact on costs and the economy.”

Diana Sackett, 61, a software engineer in Pleasanton, has many of those worries even though she strongly supports the president’s healthcare plan. She has battled cancer in the past and knows the value of quality health coverage. “In an advanced country like ours, everyone should be able to get the healthcare they need,” Sackett said.

But she isn’t optimistic that the healthcare law will stem the rising costs of medical care and fears it may even get worse with an influx of newly insured patients.

“I’m concerned it won’t really address the cost problems,” said Sackett, who pays for health insurance through her employer. “I think healthcare is still going to be pretty expensive.”

According to the poll, the changes are being implemented at a time when voters are generally satisfied with their own healthcare. Ninety percent of respondents said they were happy with the quality of their medical care and access to their doctors.

The state’s health insurance exchange, Covered California, also faces deep skepticism among its core audience.

Even uninsured Californians, who stand to benefit the most from the changes, were split. Forty-eight percent favored the law while 45% were against.

Individuals who now purchase their own policies were more negative. Forty-nine percent were opposed to the law and 44% said they were in favor.

Kathryn Davis, 29, an unemployed lab technician in San Diego, already had her doubts about Obamacare. Then she received a cancellation notice from her insurer, joining an estimated 1 million Californians who have received similar termination letters in recent weeks.

“It makes me angry I will be forced to purchase a new policy I don’t want, and fined if I don’t,” she said.

Davis said she paid $130 a month for a Blue Shield of California policy. On the state exchange, she saw a mid-level Silver plan from Blue Shield that would cost her $96 a month thanks to a federal subsidy of $187 a month based on her income.

Her annual deductible would decrease, and the coverage would be more comprehensive, including benefits such as maternity care. Even though it may be a better deal for her, Davis said she feared government spending on insurance subsidies would trigger huge tax increases.

California exchange officials say they are ramping up their marketing campaign this month to better explain the new insurance options and address some of the criticisms. People must enroll by Dec. 15 if they want coverage Jan. 1. Open enrollment in the exchange runs through March 31.

In the poll, 42% of respondents said they still didn’t have enough information about the healthcare law. Statewide, 50% of Latinos said they didn’t know enough about the overhaul.

Federico del Castillo, a 51-year-old Bellflower resident, said he couldn’t afford health insurance for himself while he searched for a new job in sales. His wife has coverage through her job, and his three young daughters are enrolled in a low-cost government program for children.

He said he’d heard about all the glitches with Obamacare, but he hoped it would make coverage affordable for him. He hears a lot of conflicting information about the program from neighbors and friends at church.

“Everyone is so confused,” Del Castillo said. “I don’t think most people are getting all the information they need.”

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/21/palin-ted-cruz-defund-obamacare,2013-09-21 00:00:00,['Sarah Palin'],EXCLUSIVE: Palin — Bombs Away on Obamacare; Cruz Is over the Target,"Americans who are fed up with Obamacare won a victory yesterday. The House voted to defund Obamacare while still funding the federal government to avoid a “devastating” shutdown. (I shall not digress, but it’s beyond distressing to hear liberals try to convince Americans that any government slowdown is comparable to “terrorism.”)

Now the battle goes to the Senate, and we’ll find out if Harry Reid is so committed to the horrendous “Un-affordable Care Act” that he’ll be the one to shut down the government to fund the unworkable Obamacare.

Let’s be clear. Republicans in Congress aren’t advocating a government shutdown. That’s why they voted in the House to fully fund our bureaucracy while defunding Obamacare. The conservatives in Congress are listening to the majority of Americans who do not want Obamacare.

Following the will of the people is apparently a novel idea in D.C. these days. Just ask Senator Ted Cruz and his liberty-loving posse on Capitol Hill who have led the charge to defund Obama’s train wreck.

Those of us who hang in there supporting a major political party with our energy, time, and contributions would like to believe that that party would praise principled conservatives like Ted Cruz and Mike Lee for following through on campaign promises. We’d like to believe that the GOP establishment would applaud the way these bold leaders have rallied the grassroots to their cause. But, no, such praise would require a commensurate level of guts and leadership, and the permanent political class in D.C. is nothing if not gutless and rudderless.

We’re now, once again, subjected to the “anonymous sources” backstabbing game. The Capitol Hill cowards are rushing to anonymously denounce Senator Cruz to any reporter with a pad and pen.

Welcome to our world, Ted. The same people have been denouncing conservatives like me for years (right after they ask for help fundraising for themselves or endorsing the latest candidate they’ve suckered into paying their exorbitant consulting fees). We can compare shiv marks next time we meet, my friend.

If the Senate doesn’t get behind Ted Cruz’s efforts to defund Obamacare, it won’t be because of any failure on Ted’s part. It’ll be because there weren’t enough principled leaders to stand with him, and that would be a tragic loss, not for Ted, but for America.

More and more Americans are waking up to the nightmare of Obamacare as its rollout continues. Hardworking families are losing their employer-provided health care coverage. Businesses are cutting back their employees’ hours to skirt Obamacare’s mandates. Americans barely scrapping by are discovering that Obamacare has made health care completely unaffordable. Those who aren’t part of a protected special interest group have been left in the cold.

When you’re living on a fixed income, having to pay hundreds of dollars more each month for health care will cut into your ability to pay for basic necessities like food, electricity, or gas (which has increased 90% under Obama). Open your eyes, America. When the full reality of Obamacare strikes home, we’ll thank God that principled leaders like Ted Cruz and Mike Lee took a stand to stop it in its tracks.

But the permanent political class is handwringing and howling that if there’s a government shutdown the media will blame Republicans for it. Here’s a little newsflash, GOP establishment: Whenever anything bad happens, the media blames Republicans for it. That’s not an excuse to roll over and play dead. It’s a call to follow the advice I give my daughters: Woman up, stand your ground, and fight like a girl!

I want no pity. I need no empathy. But use me as a barometer. Over the years, the leftwing media has falsely and irrationally accused me of everything from faking a pregnancy to abetting murder. They lie. Deal with it.

Republicans in Congress support funding the government. If the Democrats block these funding measures, a government shutdown is on them. In the meantime, stop the ridiculous hysterics. Heck, about the most significant thing that happened during the last government shutdown was Clinton hooked up with Monica.

As I said in my speech at CPAC this year, it’s time for the Senate to put itself on Cruz Control.

Ignore the peanut gallery pundits. They’ve written my political obituary so many times, I’m practically Lazarus. Now they’re trying to destroy Ted Cruz. Good luck with that, you weasels. Texans are just as tough as Alaskans. Smaller, but just as tough.

But here’s the important thing that none of these establishment backstabbers understand. It’s not the messenger that matters. It’s the message. You can try to take out someone like Ted Cruz, but that won’t stop the message from catching fire. The message is liberty, and it’s been resounding ever since a band of patriots dumped tea in Boston harbor.

The message only grows stronger. The grassroots is bigger than any one person. We the People will rise up, and we will make our voices heard. Right now, Ted Cruz is speaking for us in this Obamacare fight. God bless him for it.

Hang in there, Ted and Mike. You have millions of supporters among ordinary hardworking Americans. We support you because you don’t shy away from the fray. May your colleagues in the Senate gain the wisdom to support your excellent efforts so that you can see that the view is better from inside the bus than under it.

Oh, and a little reminder to Republican senators up for re-election in 2014: Moose season ends soon, allowing more time on one’s hands. So, we’ll be watching your votes very carefully this week."
http://news.yahoo.com/u-healthcare-gov-website-faces-tests-traffic-builds-050514927--sector.html,,[],Retooled Obamacare website traffic surges but problems remain,"By David Morgan and Lewis Krauskopf (Reuters) - A surge of visitors clogged the U.S. government's revamped healthcare insurance shopping website on Monday, signaling that President Barack Obama's administration has a way to go in fixing the portal that showcases his signature domestic policy. Facing its first big test since officials proclaimed over the weekend that they had met their deadline to make HealthCare.gov run smoothly for the ""vast majority"" of users, the site performed markedly better than it did during its disastrous launch two months ago - but was still short of the crisply running insurance marketplace Obama once touted. By 5:30 p.m. EST, the website had logged 750,000 visitors, the White House said, nearly the 800,000 daily users the refurbished site is supposed to be able to handle. In states such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Alabama, Texas and North Carolina, the rush of traffic led to the deployment of a new feature on the site - a waiting page that said there were ""a lot of visitors right now,"" and put people in line to be serviced, usually within minutes. By Monday evening, officials reported that the site was running smoothly, with no waiting. That was significant progress for a website that has become the face of one of the biggest crises of Obama's administration, one that has undermined the Democratic president's promotion of an activist government and threatened to become a drag on Democrats in next year's elections, when control of Congress will be at stake. But HealthCare.gov's hiccups on Monday fueled questions about whether it will be able to enroll several million uninsured and under-insured Americans in private coverage by the end of March. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, was passed in 2010. More immediately, the website will be pushed further by waves of visitors seeking to sign up for insurance by December 23, the deadline to get coverage that begins January 1. For all of the efforts by tech specialists to improve the site, officials still are scrambling to repair and install functions on the ""back end"" of the Obamacare system that are needed to finalize enrollments with insurers. That could create another headache for the administration starting in January, if the enrollments for some who sign up for coverage via the website are not finalized before their coverage is supposed to begin. ""The real challenges remain, and that's downstream,"" said Rick Howard, research director for the technology consultant Gartner. ""The real error rate will be in the billing transactions and how accurate the billing information is and how accurate the premium calculation is."" The administration said that in meetings with insurers and healthcare officials this week, it will refocus attention on the functions needed to handle insurance payments, including federal subsidies for low-income consumers buying coverage. Without those functions working properly, HealthCare.gov and websites for 14 state-run marketplaces could have difficulty operating in 2014. America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade group, has said because of the system's administrative shortcomings, some insurers are receiving inaccurate or duplicative information about enrollees. At the White House on Monday, Obama spokesman Jay Carney acknowledged that ""the work is not done"" on the website. Carney added that the waiting page that some visitors saw was created in part because officials knew that Monday would put a strain on the system. ""We absolutely anticipated that on this day in particular, because it is the first workday after the deadline we set ... to make sure that the website was functioning effectively for the vast majority of users, we would see a surge in visitors,"" Carney said. ENCOURAGING NUMBERS For the White House and supporters of Obamacare, the encouraging news on Monday was that the pace of enrollments in healthcare programs has increased dramatically since October 1, when the administration's enthusiastic launch of HealthCare.gov was quickly tempered by problems with the website that allowed few people to enroll. Preliminary government data indicated that about 100,000 people choose a health plan through HealthCare.gov during November, as officials and tech specialists scrambled to improve the site's capacity, according to a source familiar with the issue. In October, only about 27,000 had enrolled via the site. The federally run HealthCare.gov site handles enrollments for 36 states. The 14 other states and Washington, D.C., have their own exchanges under Obamacare. The state-run exchanges have had fewer technical problems and generally are in states that are most enthusiastic about Obamacare, so their enrollments figures have been relatively high, including 80,000 in California and 50,000 in New York. Official November data will be released in two weeks. But if the November estimate for HealthCare.gov enrollments is correct, it means at least 290,000 people have signed up for private insurance through the Obamacare exchanges. That is still far short of the administration's projection in September that nearly 500,000 people would sign up through the insurance marketplaces in the first month, according to documents obtained by congressional investigators. Ultimately, 7 million Americans were expected to sign up for private health insurance offered through the online marketplaces for 2014, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The website's issues have put that goal in doubt, and administration officials have begun playing down the importance of getting 7 million enrollees in Obamacare for 2014. On Monday, Carney emphasized that the CBO, not the White House, that produced that estimate for total enrollment. ENROLLMENT PUSH Nonprofit groups helping consumers enroll in Obamacare coverage said Monday they were encouraged by the improvements to HealthCare.gov and are starting new efforts to boost enrollment. AIDS Alabama, which had been relying largely on paper applications to sign people up until last week, noticed major improvement in the website, said Lauren Banks, the group's director of policy and advocacy. Banks said the website was still not working perfectly - the organization noticed a glitch last week that seemed to produce incorrect information about tax subsidies for low-income enrollees. Jill Hanken, who runs an Obamacare enrollment program at the Virginia Poverty Law Center, said, ""We're hearing more success stories"" about the website. ""I think things have turned the corner.""

Fox News Nation strikes again.

Sean Hannity has been following the Ted Cruz ""Obamacare is ruining all our lives"" on his Fox show, reinforcing the baseless belief in most Fox viewers that the law is somehow going to throw them to the health insurance wolves. That's despite the fact that the Fox demographic is pretty much all on Medicare. But Fox exists to reinforce Republican lies, so that's what they've been doing. Salon's Eric Stern happened to catch Hannity in the act, featuring four couples who swore they had been hurt by Obamacare, and decided to do a little fact checking . Debunking Hannity turned out to be ""appallingly easy"" for Stern when he conducted follow up interviews Hannity's guests.

First up was Paul Cox of Leicester, North Carolina, and his wife Michelle. They told Hannity that they have had to cut the hours of their employees in their construction business because they couldn't afford to insure them.



Obamacare has no effect on businesses with 49 employees or less. But in our brief conversation on the phone, Paul revealed that he has only four employees. Why the cutback on his workforce? “Well,” he said, “I haven’t been forced to do so, it’s just that I’ve chosen to do so. I have to deal with increased costs.” What costs? And how, I asked him, is any of it due to Obamacare? There was a long pause, after which he said he’d call me back. He never did.

Actually, Cox could be getting a tax credit under Obamacare to help provide insurance to his four employees. I think he probably doesn't care as much about his employees' well-being as he wanted the Fox audience to believe. The only requirement for Cox under the law is that he informs his employees of the existence of the new health insurance exchange.

Then there's Allison Denijs who told Hannity that she pays over $13,000 a year in premiums and just got a letter from Blue Cross saying that her current policy wasn't in compliance with the law, so it was being discontinued and replaced. She also has a daughter with a pre-existing condition who hasn't been covered. She's angry because Obama promised that we could keep our existing policies. Stern asked if she'd actually checked out the exchange. She hadn't. Stern found ""that they would be able to get a plan for around $7,600, which would include coverage for their uninsured daughter. This would be about a 60 percent reduction from what they would have to pay on the pre-Obamacare market.""

Not a bad deal. Likewise, Stern found a pretty good deal on the exchange for the final couple, Robbie and Tina Robison from Franklin, Tennessee. They're mad because their kids are grown, but they have to have a policy that covers things they don't want like maternity care, pediatric care, prenatal care and so forth. Welcome to health insurance, Robbie and Tina. They're also mad because their insurance agent told them they would have to pay 50-75 percent more for a plan compliant with the law.



Had they shopped on the exchange yet, I asked? No, Tina said, nor would they. They oppose Obamacare and want nothing to do with it. Fair enough, but they should know that I found a plan for them for, at most, $3,700 a year, a 63 percent less than their current bill.

Robbie and Tina need a new insurance agent. The thing for these people who are so mad that their current insurance policies are being discontinued is that they're being replaced with insurance plans that actually cover stuff. That's going to mean bigger premiums for some people, but what Hannity and all right-wing pundits and politicians leave out is that the majority of these people won't have to pay the full bill for those premiums. What Hannity-types are also not admitting is that this is a pretty tiny group of Americans, those who buy their insurance in the individual market and who were already insured. So is Obamacare hurting all Americans? Of course not, just the teeny-tiny bunch of die-hard conservatives who will refuse to be helped."

Here’s $25k.,"Sean Hannity isn’t generally a fan of handouts, but he’s made an exception for the Obamacare call-center worker who was fired from her job after talking to him.

Hannity says he’ll give $25,000 to Earline Davis, a mother of two, who was sacked after Hannity asked her questions about the Affordable Care Act on his radio program earlier this week.

“I don’t want you to have to pay a price just for taking our phone call,” Hannity told Davis during a follow-up interview. “I’m very sorry you had to go through that.” Davis agreed to speak with Hannity over the radio and said she was never told that speaking to the media wasn’t allowed.

Hannity figured that Davis’ hourly wage added up to a salary of about $25,000 for a year’s work, which he offered to pay. That wasn’t all: “I want to try and get you a new job,” he told her.

The gifts come with plenty of political baggage, of course. A champion of right-wing causes, Hannity has been an outspoken critic of President Obama and his healthcare initiatives. He wasn’t ringing up the call center to find out details of his health coverage; he was attempting to prove that the insurance program is dysfunctional and should be abandoned.

Hannity probably won’t miss the money. In 2008, he signed a radio deal that was worth an estimated $100 million over five years.

That’s quite a bit more than Davis makes, although Hannity described her estimated $13-an-hour wage as “pretty decent.”

What do you think of Hannity and his gifts to the Obamacare worker?

http://news.yahoo.com/obamacare-enrollment-low-democrats-unhappy-081903799--finance.html,,[],Obamacare enrollment low; Democrats unhappy,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama on Thursday planned to announce a fix to counter the millions of health coverage cancellations going to consumers, as the White House tried to stem Democratic impatience over a program likely to be at the center of next year's midterm elections for control of Congress.

At the same time, the administration was promising improvements in a federal website so balky that enrollments totaled fewer than 27,000 in 36 states combined. The administration had said in advance the enrollment numbers would fall far short of initial expectations. After weeks of highly publicized technical woes, they did.

A paltry 26,794 people enrolled for health insurance during the first, flawed month of operations for the federal ""Obamacare"" website.

Adding in enrollment of more than 79,000 in the 14 states with their own websites, the nationwide number of 106,000 October sign-ups was barely one-fifth of what officials had projected — and a small fraction of the millions who have received private coverage cancellations as a result of the federal law.

The administration said an additional 1 million people have been found eligible to buy coverage in the markets, with about one-third qualifying for tax credits to reduce their premiums. Another 396,000 have been found eligible for Medicaid, which covers low-income people.

Republicans were unmoved.

""Even with the administration's Enron-like accounting, fewer people have signed up for Obamacare nationwide than the 280,000 who've already lost their plan in Kentucky as a result of Obamacare mandates,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said.

Administration officials and senior congressional Democrats expressed confidence in the program's future. ""We expect enrollment will grow substantially throughout the next five months,"" said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who is in charge of the program.

""Even with the issues we've had, the marketplace is working and people are enrolling,"" she added.

Story continues

Despite the expressions, the White House worked to reassure anxious Democrats who are worried about the controversial program, which they voted into existence three years ago over Republican opposition as strong now as it was then.

Senate Democrats arranged a closed-door meeting for midday Thursday in the Capitol with White House officials, who held a similar session Wednesday with the House rank and file. Ahead of that meeting, Obama planned to speak from the White House about new efforts to help Americans receiving insurance cancellation notices.

So far, five Senate Democrats are on record in support of legislation by Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., to make sure everyone can keep their present coverage if they want to. The bill would require insurance companies to continue offering existing policies, even if they fall short of minimum coverage requirements in the law.

The measure has little apparent chance at passage, given that it imposes a new mandate on the insurance industry that Republicans will be reluctant to accept.

At the same time, a vote would at least permit Democrats to say they have voted to repair some of the problems associated with the Affordable Care Act, as many appear eager to do.

In a statement, Landrieu said Sens. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mark Pryor of Arkansas were now supporting the legislation, as is Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California. All but Feinstein are on the ballot next year.

Across the Capitol, majority Republicans in the House set a vote for Friday on legislation to permit insurance companies to continue selling existing policies that have been ordered scrapped because they fall short of coverage standards in the law.

While House passage of the measure is assured, each Democrat will be forced to cast a vote on the future of a program that Republicans have vowed to place at the center of next year's campaign.

Democratic Rep. Mike Doyle of Pennsylvania, who voted for the initial Obama health care bill, said Thursday that members of his caucus want an opportunity to go on the record in support of allowing people to keep the insurance they had.

Doyle told MSNBC in an interview that at a White House meeting Wednesday, House Democrats told Obama about ""the frustration level that many of us have"" with the health care roll-out.

Doyle said Democrats warned Obama that ""if you don't give us something by Friday"" to fix the insurance cancellation problem, then many Democrats are likely to vote for the pending House bill sponsored by Republican Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan, which would accomplish that goal.

The promise of keeping coverage was Obama's oft-stated pledge when the legislation was under consideration, a calling card since shredded by the millions of cancellations mailed out by insurers.

Obama apologized last week for the broken promise, but aides said at the time the White House was only considering administration changes, rather than new legislation.

New York%2C Philadelphia%2C a few other localities and California ban it in restaurants

McDonald%27s%2C Taco Bell and KFC dropped it from fries%2C nachos and chicken years ago

Products at grocery stores have nearly 75%25 less in them since 2005

WASHINGTON (AP) — They are among our most personal daily decisions: what to eat or drink. Maybe what to inhale.

Now that the government's banning trans fat, does that mean it's revving up to take away our choice to consume all sorts of other unhealthy stuff?

What about salt? Soda? Cigarettes?

Nah.

In the tug-of-war between public health and personal freedom, the Food and Drug Administration's decision to ban trans fats barely rates a ripple.

Hardly anyone defends the icky-sounding artificial ingredient anymore, two decades after health activists began warning Americans that it was clogging their arteries and causing heart attacks.

New York, Philadelphia, a few other localities and the state of California already have banned trans fat from restaurant food.

McDonald's, Taco Bell and KFC dropped it from their french fries, nachos and chicken years ago.

The companies that fill grocery shelves say they already have reduced their use of trans fat by nearly three-fourths since 2005.

Growers are promoting new soybean oils that they say will eliminate, within a few years, the need for partial hydrogenation, the process that creates trans fats still used to enhance the texture of some pie crusts, cookies and margarine.

Mostly, Americans' palates have moved on, and so have their arguments over what's sensible health policy and what amounts to a ""nanny state"" run amok.

When they aren't feuding over President Barack Obama's health care law, state politicians are busy weighing the wisdom of legalizing marijuana. Already 20 states and the District of Columbia have authorized it for medicinal use. Voters in Colorado and Washington state approved smoking pot just for fun.

The FDA is taking heat for delays in coming out with new rules on regular-old tobacco cigarettes under a law passed in 2009. There are the new e-cigarettes to worry about, too. More than 20 states have banned stores from selling electronic cigarettes to minors, but the federal government has yet to take them on.

New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's attempt to stop restaurants from selling sodas larger than 16 ounces, and the federal government's efforts to impose healthier lunches on school kids are causing more of an uproar than the trans fat ban.

Still, Jeffrey Levi, executive director of the nonprofit Trust for America's Health, says a national trans fat ban is ""a big deal."" After all, the FDA estimates it will prevent 20,000 heart attacks and 7,000 deaths a year.

Levi doesn't see it as evidence that federal regulators are suddenly on a roll, however.

""There are other areas where regulation is sort of stuck — everything from nutrition labeling to food safety to the tobacco regulations that have not seen the light of day,"" Levi said.

Talk of new government regulation typically stirs up libertarians and conservatives. Yet the trans fat ban hasn't provoked much beefing.

Radio host Rush Limbaugh groused that bureaucrats shouldn't regulate what people eat because it's ""none of their business"" and research on nutrition keeps changing. After all, sticks of margarine made with trans fats used to be recommended as a healthier alternative to butter.

Heritage Foundation research fellow Daren Bakst, who specializes in agriculture issues, blogged that the FDA is ""ignoring the most important issue: the freedom of Americans.""

A few fans of ready-to-spread cake frostings and microwave popcorn that still contain trans fat griped via Twitter.

They don't have to worry immediately.

The FDA must consider comments from the food industry and the public before it comes up with a timeline for phasing out trans fats, also known as partially hydrogenated oils. It could take years to get them off the market.

Michael Jacobson, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest, has been warning about the dangers since the early 1990s. Advocacy by the center helped persuade the government to add trans fat to nutrition labels beginning in 2006.

That created consumer pressure on food companies to find tasty ways to replace partially hydrogenated oil with less harmful fats. The companies' success helped clear the way for the government to consider a trans fat ban, he said.

""It's a little bit of an exception, in that it's so harmful and it was so widely used,"" Jacobson said, ""and there are substitutes so that people can't tell the difference when it's removed.""

Next on Jacobson's wish list is something that would be much harder for industry and the FDA to accomplish: reducing the salt in processed foods.

""There are estimates that it's causing around 100,000 deaths prematurely every year in this country,"" he said. ""That is just huge.""

http://news.yahoo.com/appeals-court-nycs-big-soda-161314895.html,,[],Appeals court: NYC's big-soda ban unconstitutional,"NEW YORK (AP) -- New York City's crackdown on big, sugary sodas is staying on ice.

A mid-level state appeals court ruled Tuesday that the city's Board of Health exceeded its legal authority when it voted last year to put a 16-ounce size limit on high-calorie soft drinks served in restaurants, theaters, stadiums, sidewalk food carts and many other places.

In a unanimous opinion, a four-judge panel of the state Supreme Court Appellate Division said that while the board has the power to ban ""inherently harmful"" foodstuffs from being served to the public, sweetened beverages don't fall into that category. Soda consumption is not necessarily harmful when done in moderation, the court wrote, and therefore ""cannot be classified as a health hazard per se.""

The panel didn't address whether the size limit would have infringed on personal liberties, but said that in adopting it, the health board improperly assumed broad lawmaking powers given only to legislative bodies, like the City Council.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the driving force behind the regulation, promised a quick appeal.

""Today's decision is a temporary setback, and we plan to appeal this decision as we continue the fight against the obesity epidemic,"" he said in a statement.

The American Beverage Association, which had been among the groups challenging the rule, applauded the ruling, which was the second to find that the Board of Health had overstepped its authority. A similar lower court ruling in March kept the regulation from taking effect.

""With this ruling behind us, we look forward to collaborating with city leaders on solutions that will have a meaningful and lasting impact on the people of New York City,"" said Beverage Association spokesman Christopher Gindlesperger.

New York's effort to cap soda portions has drawn praise from health experts lauding it as a groundbreaking step in America's war on extra weight and ridicule from late-night TV hosts ribbing the mayor as a nutrition nanny.

Story continues

The drinks limit follows other Bloomberg efforts to nudge New Yorkers into better diets. His administration has forced chain restaurants to post calorie counts on menus, barred artificial trans fats from restaurant fare and challenged food manufacturers to use less salt.

Bloomberg and city Health Commissioner Thomas Farley saw soft drinks as a sensible next front in a necessary fight: reining in an obesity rate that rose from 18 to 24 percent of adults in the city within a decade. Studies have tied heavy consumption of sugary drinks to weight gain. A 20-ounce Coke packs more calories than a McDonald's hamburger. Diabetes, linked to excessive sugar intake, is now among the leading causes of death in New York.

Bloomberg leaves office at the end of the year, and it is unclear whether his successor will continue the legal fight. Only one candidate, Public Advocate Bill de Blasio, supports the ban. City Council President Christine Quinn, another candidate, has said she believes the city has the right to impose the ban, but wouldn't have done it herself. All the other leading candidates oppose it.

Many city residents view the drink limits as well-intentioned but too big of a reach into private conduct.

""Obesity is a big problem in our society, and that's where all the impetus for this comes from,"" said Francesca Delavega, 26, who moved to the city three years ago from Minnesota. ""But I think people in New York also like being able to do whatever they want. And that's kind of one of the things we're known for.""

Writing for the appeals panel, Justice Dianne T. Renwick did leave a slight crack in the door for some type of restriction on beverage sizes.

Nothing in the decision, she wrote, is intended to ""express an opinion on the wisdom of the soda consumption restrictions, provided that they are enacted by the government body with the authority to do so.""

(Susan Walsh/AP)

After decades of the food pyramid, Americans can look to a new model for healthy eating, ‘MyPlate’, the new symbol of proper nutrition from the USDA which was announced Thursday. As Brian Vastag reported:

After devoting decades to designing a pyramid, then honing and refining that design, the nation’s nutrition experts have settled on what they believe is the perfect geometry to represent what we should eat — a plate.

Arriving in the midst of an obesity epidemic, this new at-a-glance guide to healthful eating is meant to remind consumers to limit heavy foods and beef up on the greens.

“MyPlate” promotes fruits and vegetables, which cover half the circle. Grains occupy an additional quarter, as do proteins such as meat, fish and poultry. A glass of milk rests to the side. Desserts have been banished to the desert.

At a media-heavy roll-out Thursday morning at USDA headquarters, the famously foodie first lady presided. With the White House vegetable garden in full leaf, Michelle Obama armed her crusade against the country’s obesity problem with what nutritionists and food lobbyists are already calling a powerful image.

“It’s brilliant in its simplicity,” said Robb MacKie, head of the American Bakers Association, which represents bread makers. “It’s something the average American can look at and get a visual feel for how they can fill up a plate at a meal.”

To avoid upstaging the first lady, the USDA made a select group of academics and food industry representatives sign non-disclosure forms at a private unveiling of the image three weeks ago, several sources said. Still, word leaked, leading to early rave reviews from hard-to-please corners of the foodieverse – and sighs of relief that the food plate’s predecessor, USDA’s confusing MyPyramid, had finally been dismantled.

USDA officials have said the old ‘MyPyramid’ was too complex and did not give people an easy way to compare their meals to the ideal balance recommended. As AP explained:

USDA officials say the pyramid was tired out, overly complex and tried to communicate too many different nutrition facts at once. The new symbol, unveiled Thursday at the department with first lady Michelle Obama in attendance, is simple and gives diners an idea of what should be on their plates when they sit down at the dinner table.

“It’s grabbing the consumers’ attention that we are after this time, not making it so complicated that perhaps it is a turnoff,” said Robert Post of USDA’s Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion. “There is something really inviting about this familiar setting for meal time.”

The department is planning to use social media as one way of grabbing attention, posting advice every day on Twitter, for example. The accompanying website, choosemyplate.gov, will be written on the chart. It will eventually feature interactive tools that help people manage their weight and track exercise.

Post, who has spent two years developing the plate and the website, said the new chart is designed to be “more artistic and attractive” and to serve as a visual cue for diners.

Gone are any references to sugars, fats or oils, and what was once a category called “meat and beans” is now simply “proteins.” Next to the plate is a blue circle for dairy, which could be a glass of milk or a food such as cheese or yogurt.

Even though the plate is divided into four sections, the servings aren’t supposed to be proportional. Every person has different nutritional needs, based on age, health and other factors. The symbol, based on a new set of dietary guidelines released in January, is a general guideline.

‘MyPlate’ has thus far been well received, especially in comparison to the older model. As Jennifer LaRue Huget reported:

A huge improvement over the baffling MyPyramid icon that it replaces, MyPlate is as easy as pie to understand; its designers smartly saved the fine print about how to actually fill the wedge-shaped spots on the plate for the Web site, ChooseMyPlate.gov. MyPlate, like the Food Pyramids before it, is meant to convey the key messages of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans in a simple, consumer-friendly fashion.

It’s no fun, finding nothing to be snarky about with this particular use of federal funds. But, really, this plate thing, though not all that original, makes sense. And it probably will prove to have legs. In her remarks at the news conference at which MyPlate was introduced this morning, first lady Michelle Obama pointed out that the icon is “simple enough for children to understand, even at the elementary school level. They can learn to use this tool now and use it for the rest of their lives.”

Obama also said, “This is a quick, simple reminder for all of us to be more mindful of the foods that we’re eating, and as a mom, I can already tell how much this is going to help parents across the country.”

“When mom or dad comes home from a long day of work, we’re already asked to be a chef, a referee, a cleaning crew. So it’s tough to be a nutritionist, too. But we do have time to take a look at our kids’ plates. As long as they’re half full of fruits and vegetables, and paired with lean proteins, whole grains and low-fat dairy, we’re golden. That’s how easy it is.”

What a perfect way to celebrate the document that is a testament to our liberties and that ensures our rights such as the right to freedom of speech.

On Constitution Day, September 17, 2013 I attended the Obamacare town hall meeting sponsored by St. Louis radio station 97.1 and Americans for Prosperity [Koch brothers].

So what free speech were we subjected to? Dr. Randy Tobler, a physician and radio personality, showobama_syringe_smallered slides depicting President Obama in doctor scrubs, smiling broadly and holding an oversize syringe. The label? “This is going to hurt!”

Another slide had a caricature of President Obama, a large figure, looming over the shoulder of a doctor who was leaning down toward a young child in diapers with a thermometer in his mouth. The label? “Oh, don’t mind me….”

One graphic Dr. Tobler presented showed pieces and parts of what we learned was a medical device from the last century. Apparently it was some sort of pipe used to clear the lungs. Dr. Tobler said that Obamacare is like that pipe, “blowing smoke up your arse.”

Those slides may have been in bad taste but we can all agree with his right to show them. Certainly the 500 or so people in the auditorium enjoyed them; the slides were received with laughter and cheers.

Dr. Tobler showed the slides while freely expressing his view of the horrible “truths” about the effects of Obamacare, “the worst bill ever passed by the United States Congress.” Tobler said:

…with Obamacare we will have insurance but no access to care. The law will “take the wind out of the sails of medical care in the U.S. Doctors will be so overburdened that patients will get fewer services. Patients will only be seen for 7 minutes when and if they can get an appointment. Electronic medical records are costly and doctors will spend too much time dealing with regulations.

He even said that doctors (whom he earlier said care about their patients welfare) would have an incentive to withhold care.

We will be like Canada and Great Britain with patients having to wait months for hip replacements and even for mastectomies. And remember those death panels? There is one - under Obamacare we will experience the death of medical ingenuity in this country. And what about Medicare? Reimbursements will go down by 750 billion dollars.

One woman, a member of the progressive group, Women’s Voices Raised for Social Justice, and Vice President of Missouri Health Care for All, took her opportunity to voice her objection to Dr. Tobler’s remark about the 750 billion dollars. She went to the microphone and said that the $750 billion is being removed from overpayments to private Medicare Advantage plans that charged 14% more than traditional Medicare. She reminded the audience that even Paul Ryan accounted for this removal in his proposed budget.

How were her comments received? Her free speech was booed, and the moderator of the panel made fun of her. On her way back to her seat a man stuck out his foot as though he was stretching, trying to trip her. After she sat back down in her seat on the aisle a woman walked by, punched her hard in the arm and said, “There’s a liberal in every crowd.”

Another woman took the microphone to refute the claim that the majority of Missourians voted against the individual mandate in the health care law. She remarked that the majority of the small number who voted opposed the mandate. Her remarks were not only jeered, but the microphone was turned away so she could no longer speak.

The Missouri legislature’s Speaker of the House, who hosted the town hall meeting, talked about the “facts that shape his policy,” calling on the audience to continue the work of dismantling Obamacare to rid ourselves of that “free plastic health insurance card.” [It doesn’t exist.] Missourians, he noted, voted by a margin of 11.5 percent for Romney, thereby agreeing that the law should be overturned. He told the audience that “We don’t know what is in the law, because “tens of thousands of regulations are being drafted every day.” He called Obamacare “the largest entitlement in the history of the United States” and complained that every state is doing something different. He even blamed President Obama for funds being taken from hospitals for uncompensated care.

No microphone was available to let the audience know that the hospital funds are being lost because Missouri refused to expand Medicaid. If more people are given care under Medicaid, hospitals would receive payments for these patients and have less need for the funds.

One voice of reason among the panelists was Vince Blair, an insurance agent. Blair presented a factual account, with explanatory slides, of what people need to know about how to purchase insurance on the new marketplace. He even encouraged people to go to the online exchange if they are uninsured. He assured the audience that if they are on Medicare they will not lose their benefits but will be unaffected by the new law.

What format should a town hall meeting take? One simple definition describes it as an informal public meeting where everyone in the community is invited to attend and participate in the discussion. Our Constitution Day town hall was a 90-minute, scripted program to present the “facts” as represented by the Speaker of the Missouri House of Representatives and a physician who opposes the Affordable Act.

At our town hall, only one side of the issue was presented by the speakers. When the audience jeered those who disagreed with the speakers, and the moderator and panelists mocked the questioners, and the microphone was kept from an audience member, the real mockery being made was that of our tradition of fairness and discussion at a public forum."

Whether the law ultimately accomplishes its aim of making the insurance markets nationwide more competitive — and plans more affordable — will only become clear over time. Experts expect some insurers to drop out after a year or so, while some other companies may decide to enter, depending on how the markets evolve. Insurers will have to figure out how to offer plans that most people can afford but still provide coverage to those with expensive medical conditions — and, for investor-owned plans, how to make a profit in the meantime.

“A rush to judgment will be just that,” said Dan Mendelson, the chief executive of Avalere Health, a consulting group. “It’s not going to be possible in 2014 to make a strong valid judgment of whether the exchanges are working or not.”

Insurers already active in the market are the most likely to show up on the exchanges. Blue Cross plans, for example, have already established relationships with local hospitals and physician groups, as well as state regulators. “We don’t have to recreate the wheel because the Blue plans are already there,” said Daniel J. Hilferty, the chief executive of Independence Blue Cross, a nonprofit headquartered in Philadelphia.

In California, Anthem Blue Cross, Health Net, Kaiser Permanente and Blue Shield of California will remain big players. Most likely to be missing from any given exchange are many of the national insurers, whose business is focused mainly on providing coverage to workers through their employers — companies liked UnitedHealth Group, Aetna and Cigna.

WellPoint, which operates Blue Cross plans in 14 states and is the nation’s largest provider of individual and small business policies, has little choice but to compete because many of its customers will be buying insurance on the exchanges.

But the other companies may delay entering any given exchange until they see a real chance to gain customers. Given the uncertainty over how well the exchanges will function, and whether enough healthy people will enroll, insurers are likely to enter only those markets where they already have a sizable number of existing customers."

The article, essentially, says what a lot of people here at dailykos have been saying for a while, that once people start signing up for and receiving health insurance under Obamacare it will become increasingly difficult for Republicans to be able to kill it off.

The article, written by a Meghan Foley, states what the rest of us suspected, but most Americans have not necessarily been exposed to...a more objective assessment of Obamacare from a long term view and how the entire politics of the situation changes once those millions and millions of people who sign up start receiving benefits.

This could just be an “outlier” article, so to speak, from someone tired of regurgitating the Republicans' talking points day after day, and who sees the situation as fluid. But, my guess is that even the lazy national news media (which usually finds it easier to just “go with the flow” rather than actually engage in real journalism) will soon become tired of the same old anti-Obamacare rhetoric and Republican talking points and will start looking for a new “angle.”

The headline says it all: “For GOP, it's Time to Stop Criticizing Obamacare.”

Unless healthcare.gov or the Obama administration hand them a new reason to continue the negative onslaught (it will be a great relief to finally see the “drip,” “drip,” “drip” phase of negative Obamacare news be finally over with), the fact that this article appeared at all, least of all on a very mainstream outlet such as yahoo.com gives me hope that, perhaps, we're beginning to turn a corner regarding Obamacare (and the president's poll numbers, too (?)).

Can it be said that Obamacare is now turning a corner due to this one article? No. But, hopefully, this is an indicator.

It sure would be good to start the new year with a fresh media narrative regarding Affordable Care Act."

Even as President Obama and congressional Republicans gear up for a new budget battle, Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which together provide coverage to more than 1 in 5 Americans and almost 1 in 3 Californians over the course of a year, appear off-limits despite their huge price tag.

The president protected Medicaid in 2011 when Congress and the White House slashed $1.2 trillion in federal spending, including on Medicare — the healthcare plan for seniors and disabled people — as part of a deal to raise the nation’s debt limit.

Medicaid was spared again last month in the budget compromise that raised tax rates on high-income households — a deal that included even more Medicare cuts.

Now, with Obama banking on a dramatic Medicaid expansion next year under his landmark healthcare law, the White House is drawing another bright line around the program. The president explicitly defended Medicaid in his inaugural address, and top aides have amplified his words since.

“Medicaid cuts, from this president, from this administration, are not on the table,” Gene Sperling, the head of the National Economic Council at the White House, declared in a speech Thursday to a healthcare conference, explicitly ruling out even cuts that the administration previously had considered.

“We’ve made a tough choice” to wall off Medicaid from cuts, he said, making the budgetary trade-off explicit: “It means we will have to look harder for Medicare savings.”

A major reason for the White House position is the key role that Medicaid plays in Obama’s health reform effort. The president’s law is slated to provide nearly $1 trillion in new federal aid to states over the next decade to help them open Medicaid to all low-income Americans for the first time starting in 2014. That is central to the law’s program for expanding insurance coverage to an estimated 30 million people by 2022.

Preserving Medicaid funding became even more crucial to the Obama administration after the Supreme Court ruled last summer that states were not required to expand their Medicaid coverage. Administration officials are working hard to convince states to expand and do not want any federal funding cuts that could discourage governors from implementing the law.

“There is a big irony,” said Ron Pollack, executive director of Washington-based Families USA, a leading Medicaid advocate. “The fact that the Supreme Court undermined the Medicaid expansion is now resulting in greater support and a deeper commitment to making sure the program is not cut back.”

Paying for Medicaid remains a major challenge for states. The program has been jointly funded by states and the federal government since it was created. And many states, including California, Illinois and New York, have had to make painful cutbacks in recent years to balance their budgets by reducing physician fees and paring benefits, such as dental care.

At the same time, Republicans are working to slash Medicaid spending to balance the federal budget. They advocate turning the program into a block grant to states, which they say would be more efficient and also put a limit on future federal spending.

Cutting Medicaid was a centerpiece of budget plans pushed by Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), the House Budget Committee chairman. Ryan’s running mate on the GOP presidential ticket, Mitt Romney, advocated similar cuts.

House Republicans are gearing up for another run at trimming Medicaid as they prepare a budget blueprint that they say would balance the budget in 10 years without raising taxes, a goal that would likely require trillions of dollars in new cuts.

“The need for reform is that much more urgent,” said Rep. Todd Rokita (R-Ind.), who sponsored legislation last year backed by 48 GOP lawmakers to cap federal Medicaid spending, which would have effectively cut approximately $2 trillion over the next decade. “It is a matter of saving these things for future generations.”

But congressional Republicans, who tried unsuccessfully in the 1990s to scale back Medicaid, will likely have an even harder time now.

Enrollment in Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which was created in 1997 to expand government-subsidized coverage for children, has surged by more than 70% since 2000 as states expanded their safety nets after businesses laid off workers or eliminated health benefits.

That has meant Medicaid, a program established in 1965 to help Americans on welfare, is increasingly essential to millions of working families who cannot afford health insurance and to elderly and disabled Americans in need of long-term care. Medicaid is the single largest payer for nursing homes in the country.

“This is now a middle-class entitlement that touches far more Americans than many people realize,” said Colleen M. Grogan, a Medicaid authority at the University of Chicago. Half of all Americans in 2011 either received Medicaid or had a friend or family member who received it, according to a national survey by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation.

Romney and other conservatives criticized this as a debilitating dependency during the 2012 presidential campaign. But many state leaders — Republican and Democratic — have come to rely on Medicaid, despite its flaws, to protect their most vulnerable residents.

Medicaid also draws important support from influential hospital and physician groups, which have rallied behind the program even as many criticize it for paying too little. Without Medicaid, many medical providers would have to care for even more patients unable to pay their bills.

Just last month, a coalition of medical societies, including several from conservative states, helped defeat an attempt by congressional Republicans to cut federal aid intended to increase Medicaid fees paid to primary care physicians.

Similar lobbying in state capitals has also convinced several Republican governors to drop opposition to expanding Medicaid under the healthcare law. Most recently, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer announced last month that she would take the assistance, after an intense lobbying effort by hospitals and businesses, which argued that without the additional aid healthcare providers would be swamped by uninsured patients.

Medicaid’s political clout will only increase in the coming years as close to 20 million more Americans come to depend on the program under the Affordable Care Act, Grogan predicted. In some states, as much as a quarter of the population could soon be on Medicaid.

Federal spending on the program, which topped $262 billion last year, is expected to surpass $581 billion by 2021, according to estimates by independent actuaries at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Obama’s healthcare law is creating other challenges for many states, which are scrambling to get ready for the historic Medicaid expansion while also trying to ensure their programs pay for healthcare more efficiently.

“We’re a long way from seeing many of these issues resolved,” said Diana Dooley, California’s health and human services secretary, who oversees one of the most cash-strapped Medicaid programs in the country. “But I’m encouraged that there seems to be a recognition of the importance of the Medicaid program. The conversations are going in the right direction.”

Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Vista), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, obtained the tally from meeting notes compiled by officials inside the “war room” at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which was overseeing the rollout of the insurance marketplace.

The White House has declined to say how many people have signed up in the new health insurance marketplace, and Kathleen Sebelius, the Department of Health and Human Services secretary, testified this week that her department has not been able to collect accurate data.

Department spokeswoman Joanne Peters said late Thursday that the documents released by the committee “appear to be notes. They do not include official enrollment statistics.”

The department plans to release enrollment statistics “on a monthly basis” once reliable information is available, Peters said. “We are focused on providing reliable and accurate information and we do not have that at this time.... We have always anticipated that the pace of enrollment will increase throughout the enrollment period,” she said.

Issa’s committee obtained the documents after requesting them from the contractors developing the website for the administration. The committee subpoenaed Sebelius on Thursday for additional documents, including those related to attempted and completed enrollments.

The administration said Thursday that dozens of computer engineers from top technology firms have been brought in as part of its “tech surge” to help fix the problems with the site.

The website where Americans can shop for health insurance is central to the new healthcare law, which mandates that all individuals carry policies by March 2014 or face a penalty. Since the site’s troubles became clear, officials have also noted that insurance can be sought over the phone or in person at facilities helping to usher in the program.

According to the notes obtained by Issa’s committee, six enrollments happened on Oct. 1. On the next day, there were 248. Officials hope to enroll 7 million people for coverage next year.

Obama stood behind his signature law this week, reminding Americans of the benefits, including provisions that prohibit companies from denying coverage for people with preexisting medical conditions.

In a congressional hearing on Wednesday, Sebelius apologized for botched debut, taking responsibility as the administration scrambles to get the site running properly. The administration has promised to have the site running smoothly by the end of the month.

Washington (CNN) - Support for the country's new health care law has dropped to a record low, according to a new national poll.

And a CNN/ORC International survey released Monday also indicates that most Americans predict that the Affordable Care Act will actually result in higher prices for their own medical care.



CNN/ORC International survey full results

Only 35% of those questioned in the poll say they support the health care law, a 5-point drop in less than a month. Sixty-two percent say they oppose the law, up four points from November.

Nearly all of the newfound opposition is coming from women.

""Opposition to Obamacare rose six points among women, from 54% in November to 60% now, while opinion of the new law remained virtually unchanged among men,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. ""That's bad news for an administration that is reaching out to moms across the country in an effort to make Obamacare a success.""

According to the survey, 43% say they oppose the health care law because it is too liberal, with 15% saying they give the measure a thumbs down because it is not liberal enough. That means half the public either favors Obamacare, or opposes it because it's not liberal enough, down four points from last month.

Sixty-three percent say they believe the new law will increase the amount of money they personally pay for medical care, which may not be a good sign for a law known as the ""Affordable Care Act.""

The survey also indicates that 42% say they will be personally worse off under Obamacare, with 16% saying the law will help them, and four in 10 saying it will have no effect on them.

Just over six in 10 say they believe they will be able to receive care from the same doctors that they now use, with 35% saying they will not be able to see the same doctors.

The Affordable Care Act, which is the signature domestic achievement for President Barack Obama, was passed along party lines in 2010, when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress. Since that passage, Republicans have fought to either repeal, defund, or severely restrict the law. A push by congressional conservatives to defund the law was the catalyst for October's 16-day long partial federal government shutdown, the first in nearly two decades.

The roll out of the law was extremely flawed, from the rocky startup of HealthCare.gov in October to the controversy over millions of Americans being told they would lose their current insurance plans because they didn't meet standards mandated by the new health care law.

Despite all the problems, the President said things are starting to improve, adding that more than 500,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act through HealthCare.gov during the first three weeks of December.

""So all told, millions of Americans, despite problems with the website, are now poised to be covered by quality affordable health care,"" he said at a news conference.

“I feel like I’ve been taken to the cleaners,” salesman Neal Campbell told NBC News senior investigative reporter Lisa Myers in a Sunday report. Campbell, who has a wife and three children, says Obamacare is breeding resentment and anger. “We feel betrayed, lied to, and we’re pissed off.”

“How is this helping the average American that’s working 40 to 50 hours per week?” asked salesperson Terry Hardcastle. “How are we supposed to live?”

Cathy Smith agreed. “You don’t make that much money to begin with,” said Smith with tears in her eyes. “…the prescriptions are going to kill me.”

Under Obamacare, the workers’ employer faced a 50% increase in costs to keep worker plans at the same benefit and deductible levels. To remain economically viable, the dealership decided to give each worker an extra $2,400 and let them find plans on their own. Small business insurance broker Michael Harp says it’s all part of the new Obamacare reality for small businesses and their workers: “The overwhelming majority, they’re paying much higher rates and they have lower benefits.”

Service adviser Steve Williams said Obamacare has destroyed the era of affordable health care.

“The days of low deductibles and all that stuff are gone,” Williams told NBC. “It’s not going to get any better. It’s just going to get worse.”

The NBC News report comes as the Obama administration and its progressive allies are reportedly readying yet another public relations campaign in the hopes of resuscitating Obamacare’s lugubrious approval ratings. The administration’s media blitz will highlight the stories of people who scored taxpayer-funded Obamacare coverage.

The strategy, however, risks further angering the millions of middle-class workers who lost their insurance coverage due to Obamacare or whose premiums and deductibles are soaring in order to pay for the very Obamacare “winners” the administration plans to highlight.

According to the latest CNN poll, Obamacare is at a record low 35% approval rating."

There are important questions about whether the fix President Obama offered today for Americans whose insurance policies were cancelled will help them, whether it will hinder the broad goals of the health insurance reform law, and whether it will satisfy the opponents of reform. We will start to address them later on the editorial page.

But this was also one of those moments when a nation takes stock of its president. And it seemed worth noting here that Mr. Obama has dealt another blow to his own already damaged credibility with this latest reminder of how he and his team bungled the rollout of health care reform.

Hovering over the press conference at the White House today was the question of whether Mr. Obama lied — whether he deliberately said what he knew not to be true with the intention of deceiving people — when he said repeatedly that Americans who like their policies would be able to keep them.



“There is no doubt that the way I put that forward unequivocally ended up not being accurate,” Mr. Obama said today.

He said he was thinking of the 95 percent of insured Americans who are covered by group insurance provided by employers, unions, Medicare or Medicaid. He also said he believed that a “grandfather clause” would cover those in the remaining 5 percent who wanted to hang onto current policies even if they were not as good as what is available on the new exchanges.

Those explanations are not likely to be terribly persuasive even to those who liked Mr. Obama and supported health care, but have come to doubt him. His political enemies will scoff at them.

I have seen no proof that Mr. Obama knew the details of the grandfather clause when he made his famous promise. But there had to be many, many people in his administration who did know the details. They could have, and should have, told the president that what he was saying was flat wrong – that the grandfather clause would not deliver on his broadly drawn promise.

In order to be covered, you had to have a policy that you bought before the law was signed in 2010 and was still in effect without significant changes at the end of 2013 — no major change in premiums, co-pays or coverage. How likely is that in the volatile world of individual health insurance, where policies last for a year and are subject to change at the whim of insurance companies?

On one level, it should surprise no one that a politician faced with either seeming like a liar or seeming like a fool would choose the fool. But that still leaves us with the disturbing impression — and not for the first time in this administration — that Mr. Obama sometimes shoots from the hip, that he is still struggling to handle the politics of the presidency after nearly five years in office, and that he is surrounded by people who are too incompetent or too weak to help him."

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']",Justices poised to strike down entire healthcare law,"The Supreme Court’s conservative justices said Wednesday they are prepared to strike down President Obama’s healthcare law entirely.

Picking up where they left off Tuesday, the conservatives said they thought a decision striking down the law’s controversial individual mandate to purchase health insurance means the whole statute should fall with it.

The court’s conservatives sounded as though they had determined for themselves that the 2,700-page measure must be declared unconstitutional.

“One way or another, Congress will have to revisit it in toto,” said Justice Antonin Scalia.

Agreeing, Justice Anthony Kennedy said it would be an “extreme proposition” to allow the various insurance regulations to stand after the mandate was struck down.

Meanwhile, the court’s liberal justices argued for restraint. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the court should do a “salvage job,” not undertake a “wrecking operation.” But she looked to be out-voted.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said they shared the view of Scalia and Kennedy that the law should stand or fall in total. Along with Justice Clarence Thomas, they would have a majority to strike down the entire statute as unconstitutional.

An Obama administration lawyer, urging caution, said it would be “extraordinary” for the court to throw out the entire law. About 2.5 million young people under age 26 are on their parents’ insurance now because of the new law. If it were struck down entirely, “2.5 million of them would be thrown off the insurance rolls,” said Edwin Kneedler.

The administration indicated it was prepared to accept a ruling that some of the insurance reforms should fall if the mandate were struck down. For example, insurers would not be required to sell coverage to people with preexisting conditions. But Kneedler, a deputy solicitor general, said the court should go no further.

But the court’s conservatives said the law was passed as a package and must fall as a package.

The justices are scheduled to meet Wednesday afternoon to debate the law’s Medicaid expansion.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/23/Senate-fight-Reid,2013-09-23 00:00:00,['Jenny Beth Martin'],Senate Republicans Can Stop Reid from Funding Obamacare,"When Establishment Republicans and their Democrat comrades claim there is no path to victory in the fight to defund Obamacare, they are intentionally muddying the waters. Do not confuse blundering political expedience with winning.

There is a clear path to victory and the folks comprising the new Republican leadership emerging in the House and Senate are smart enough and bold enough to take that path.

They’re playing to win and deserve our support.

Understanding the options available to these new leaders requires an understanding of a few of the basics of Senate rules and process. Otherwise folks like Karl Rove will tell you to “do the math” counting Democrat Senators without telling you that Senate Republicans have the ability to change the formula.

To help simplify an explanation of the Senate process, think of it like a football game where the rules and timing are set, but there are different plays at your disposal. Winning requires playing the game with a focus on fundamentals.

Let’s go with one possible scenario that could unfold this week. As early as Monday, the Senate could agree to take up the House bill passed last Friday that funds everything in the government but Obamacare. The Senate can do this by something called “unanimous consent,” if no one Senator objects, or if one Senator does object, they can put it to a vote requiring 60 votes to pass. For the purposes of this exercise, let’s say one or the other is successful and the bill goes to the Senate floor for consideration.

What happens next in this process is debate on the Senate floor begins, where each side argues for or against the bill.

During this debate period, Democrat Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid could offer an amendment to strip out the language in the House bill that defunds Obamacare. Reid would also likely choose not to allow any other amendments to the bill. That is within his power as the leader of the majority party in the Senate. The hard and fast rules, however, require Reid to file his amendment for consideration and reveal for all to see what’s in the amendment before the debate is over.

This is where things can get deceptive. Establishment Republicans would let you believe the next step in the process is the Senate has a vote on Reid’s amendment. What these politicians are not telling you is Sen. Reid cannot get a vote on his amendment to put Obamacare funding back in the House bill unless some of the Republicans agree to it.

Here’s how that happens.

We last left the House bill on the Senate floor being debated. To end that debate period, 60 Senators have to vote to do so. In Capitol Hillspeak, that vote to end debate is called reaching “cloture.” Currently, there are 52 Democrats, two independents (who work with the Democrats) and 46 Republican Senators. Republicans can win that cloture vote with 41 votes, and debate continues on the Senate floor until Democrats can get 60 votes to stop it.

A vote for cloture is a vote to fund Obamacare. The people understand this, so Senators beware.

Bottom line: Reid cannot get a vote on his amendment that would strip Obamacare defunding out of the House bill unless six Republicans agree to let that vote take place.

That’s called leverage in anyone’s playbook. Reid loses his advantage. He will have to negotiate on the rest of the process–like whether his amendment to fund Obamacare requires 60 votes to pass. Or not. That’s up for negotiation, too, if Senate Republicans fight for it.

If Republicans hold together on this, Reid will not be able to change the House bill. That leaves Harry Reid with some tough choices. Senate Democrats running for re-election do not want to be forced to vote against the House bill that defunds Obamacare.

Republicans can use this leverage to force Senate Democrats to make concessions.

Americans lucky enough to have a job right now are losing their healthcare plans they liked and wanted to keep. Obamacare is causing full-time jobs to become part-time jobs to get under the 30-hour workweek mandate. Doctors are choosing to retire rather than comply with the Obamacare boondoggle. We are seeing this every single day in the newspapers.

Even the unions hate Obamacare.

If Republicans will force Senate Democrats to support Obamacare in this vote, some will bolt or they will lose their elections next year. By then, Obamacare will have reached out and touched everyone. The consequences in some instances could be fatal.

When Democrats and Establishment Republicans shriek “government shutdown,” and “the military won’t be paid,” or “law enforcement won’t be paid,” and every other item in the parade of horribles they’ll put forth, remember this: the House can keep sending bills to the Senate to fund anything they want.

Air traffic controllers? Done! Military? Done! Border Patrol? Done!

Funding the government at this point is this and only this: the Senate must stop holding America hostage and vote to fund the government, in whole or piece by piece, without Obamacare in it.

In life and as in the game of football, you can never win the victory if you choose to punt every time you touch the ball."

The rally at the state capitol in Raleigh on Monday night was one of the largest since the protests began this spring, drawing about 2,000 people, including 64 protesters who refused to leave the legislative chambers and were arrested.

The protests have gained momentum since a few dozen people first rallied against the political shift to the right in a state that Barack Obama won in the 2008 presidential election but lost in 2012. Some 700 people have been arrested in acts of civil disobedience over issues ranging from natural gas drilling to school vouchers to voting rights.

Republican legislators have largely stayed mum in the midst of the protests, though some state officials have grumbled about the cost of the arrests and the impact on the state.

""I'm fielding calls every day, ‘What the heck's going on (over) there?'"" the state's Commerce Secretary Sharon Decker told a crowd of reporters Monday. ""The current environment makes it very challenging to market North Carolina.""

This week, the protest zeroed in on a bill passed last week by the North Carolina state Senate requiring abortion clinics to conform to the same safety standards as ambulatory surgery centers, a regulation currently met by only one of the state's five clinics.

Opponents say it will limit access to safe abortions. Supporters of the measure say the higher standards will make abortion safer.

Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican, criticized senators for pushing the regulations through without a public hearing.

The state House of Representatives has scheduled a public hearing on the proposed regulations for Tuesday.

The bill makes North Carolina the latest state to consider abortion restrictions. The issue has dominated politics in Texas in recent days, after Democratic state Senator Wendy Davis spent 11 hours on the senate floor in an effort to stall the measure.

On Monday, a U.S. federal judge temporarily blocked a part of a new Wisconsin law, signed on Friday by Republican Governor Scott Walker, that opponents say will close two of the four abortion clinics in the state if enforced.

Cecil Bothwell, a city councilman from Asheville, North Carolina, made the four-hour bus ride to Raleigh with about 100 of his constituents. He said state lawmakers want to have it both ways when it comes to the state's role in health care.

""It amazes me that they claim they don't want government intervening in health care issues, yet they want to tell women what to do with their bodies,"" Bothwell said.

Melissa Reed, a vice president of Planned Parenthood Health Systems, brought a petition with 10,000 signatures opposing the measure.

Like many at Monday's protest, Tanya Glover, 34, who lives in Harnett County, a rural area outside of Raleigh, wore pink.

As she lined up with her father to be arrested, she said the legislature's lean education budget will slash services for her special needs child.

""This state has gone to hell and it's hurting my family,"" said Glover.

By Scott Malone

BOSTON, April 8 (Reuters) - The top White House adviser on health care said on Monday she did not anticipate how lengthy and persistent the political opposition would be to healthcare reform - U.S. President Barack Obama's signature domestic legislative achievement.

The administration had not anticipated opposition to the Affordable Care Act of 2010, nicknamed ""Obamacare,"" would drag on years after the law's passage, said Kathleen Sebelius, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services.

Despite its goal to provide health coverage to more than 30 million uninsured Americans and improve the quality of medical care delivered across the country, many voters have balked over concerns the law will raise healthcare costs and increase government involvement in their personal decisions.

""The politics has been relentless and that continues,"" Sebelius said. ""There was some hope that once the Supreme Court ruled in July and then once an election occurred there would be a sense that, 'This is the law of the land, let's get on board, let's make this work.' And yet we will find ourselves having state by state political battles.""

One factor that contributed to the law's unpopularity for a large segment of the American public is the fact that its benefits have taken several years to impact people directly. Only in 2014 will many of its broadest benefits take effect, extending health coverage to millions more people.

At the same time, Republican governors and legislatures in states including Texas, Louisiana and South Carolina have refused to set up state-run exchanges where individuals would be able to buy insurance and have rejected the law's provision to allow more low-income people to enroll in Medicaid insurance.

""It is very difficult when people live in a state where there is a daily declaration, 'We will not participate in the law,' for them to figure out whether they are going to benefit,"" Sebelius said at an event at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, presented in collaboration with Reuters.

Opponents of Medicaid expansion have argued that states could find themselves saddled with untenable financial burdens if the federal government later cut back its funding to the program.

Loudest among them has been the voice of Texas' Republican Governor Rick Perry, who has described the Medicaid program as ""a broken system.""

Other prominent Republicans have sought to compromise - in Florida, Governor Rick Scott has sought, so far unsuccessfully to persuade his legislative colleagues to accept the Medicaid expansion.

The law also faces continued opposition from corners of the $2.8 trillion U.S. healthcare industry.

Sebelius, addressing the issue of feared increases in health insurance premiums because of the law, said competition to provide a set of mandated basic benefits would help.

""For the first time ever in the history of the United States, they'll have to compete for service and customers, not by cherry-picking the market (and) trying to figure out who can only insure people who promise never to get sick,"" she said.

Now, with its online insurance marketplaces days from opening for business, the White House is focused on a task that many of the law’s supporters complain is overdue: explaining it.

On Thursday, the president debuted a healthcare primer in a speech meant to convince young, uninsured Americans that they will find insurance coverage to suit their budgets.

The speech was laced with political jabs at congressional Republicans who want to gut or delay the program, but mostly it was a direct plea to Americans to give the new virtual marketplace a try when the six-month enrollment period opens Tuesday.

“This is real simple,” Obama told the crowd at a community college in Largo, Md. “It’s a website where you can compare and purchase affordable health insurance plans side by side, the same way you shop for a plane ticket on Kayak, same way you shop for a TV on Amazon.”

“You’ve got new choices,” he said. “You’ve got new competition because insurers want your business, and that means you will have cheaper prices.”

The administration has faced considerable criticism from fellow Democrats for not selling the Affordable Care Act, as the law is called, in the 3 1/2 years since Obama signed it into law. White House officials have countered that until the benefits became clear to consumers through the online system, such efforts would have been futile.

A few glitches in that system are popping up. Small businesses in almost three dozen states will have to use paper forms to sign up until November because that part of the online system isn’t ready to go.

Republican critics noted the irony of what was supposed to be a cutting-edge digital operation resorting to snail mail and, as one GOP staffer scoffed in an email, “facsimile machines!”

But advisors to the president are hoping that the shopping experience of comparing plans, with subsidies and lower premiums available for many users, will win people over.

Obama and his White House have their work cut out for them. Polls show that uninsured Americans, the primary target for the law’s new marketplaces, are wary. A Pew Research survey conducted last week found that the uninsured were as likely to disapprove of the law as they were to approve of it, with about one-third of those without insurance saying they thought the law would have a negative effect on them. Only half of the uninsured surveyed knew that the law offered subsidies.

“The policy is complicated. It doesn’t lend itself to slogans and one-liners,” said Patrick Griffin, former legislative director for President Clinton and now the academic director of the Public Affairs and Advocacy Institute at American University. “This is really the critical moment for the president, as people get to know the program.”

Attracting consumers, particularly young, healthy ones whose support is essential for the system to hold costs down, has been priority No. 1 for the Obama administration during much of this week. Most everyone, from the commander in chief to rank-and-file staff, has explained details to the media.

Obama’s speech will be followed by a series of events in which White House and agency officials will fan out to participate in conferences, briefings and online conversations with target groups.

In a preview of the online sign-up, White House Deputy Senior Advisor David Simas showed more than three dozen reporters how the “experience” works.

Applicants answer questions about their age and income, then find plans for which they are eligible. They can select from four plan levels — bronze, silver, gold or platinum — and compare premium costs, coverage and providers.

The administration has invested heavily in time and money to make sure the online prompts work, knowing that one glitchy experience can turn off a potential customer and create a talking point for the law’s opponents.

“News flash: There will be glitches. When glitches arise, we will fix them. This is what you do,” Simas said, noting that other complex healthcare initiatives have also had problems when they were rolled out. “We are confident that, when things arise, there are teams and people in place that will address them and remediate.”

The federal government has been training people at community centers, clinics and hospitals to guide applicants through the process. Call centers will be open 24 hours a days to help resolve problems.

Even the looming government shutdown, which could start Tuesday, won’t threaten the rollout of the president’s signature plan, administration officials vowed. Key workers already have been designated as “core and essential” and will continue to work even as other government employees are furloughed.

The program, Obama said at Prince George’s Community College, “is going to happen in five days.”

On Capitol Hill, opponents of the law were hard at work to prove him wrong.

House Republicans want a one-year delay of the healthcare program in exchange for granting Obama’s request to raise the national debt limit by Oct. 17.

“The president says, I’m not going to negotiate,” House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said Thursday after talking over the strategy with colleagues. “I’m sorry, but it just doesn’t work that way.”

A Minnesota health care provider is testing a new program in the hopes of reducing ER admissions and keeping people healthier: they’re sending paramedics on house calls to some of the area’s sickest patients who might otherwise end up in the ER.



The need for such out-of-the-box solutions is clear. In the last year, one in five Americans went to the ER at least once for an estimated 130 million visits. The cost of all those ER visits is staggering, considering that the price for treating some of the most common conditions can range from an average of $750 all the way up to $73,000.

“We don’t screen for insurance at the door,” said Dr. Joey Duren, an emergency physician with North Memorial Healthcare System in Minnesota. “So in our country now, a big thing is that the emergency department is a safety net for people who don’t have insurance.”

Patients with chronic conditions like asthma and diabetes can spiral out of control without regular monitoring and land in the ER multiple times in a single year. The number of repeat patients is often staggering; some of whom visit dozens of times each month, according to North Memorial's chief medical officer, Dr. Kevin Croston.

“What’s really the biggest cost in health care are the chronic conditions where there are readmissions to the emergency department,” Duren said. “We realized we needed to create care that stopped that.”

That’s where house calls from the community paramedics came in. Since the program began last October paramedics have made more than 1,000 home visits, at a fraction of the cost for a trip to the ER. Although North Memorial doesn't have data yet on the savings, officials believe the program will help reduce admissions.

“The role of this community paramedic is helping people get on top of their chronic disease processes so they aren’t getting so sick that they need to come to us in the emergency department,” Duren explained. “We’re controlling their diseases so they can be handled in an outpatient setting versus having to come here or be admitted to the hospital for multiple days because they’ve gotten so far behind in their insulin for their diabetes or their COPD has gotten out of control.”

Chris Anderson is among the first group of paramedics who were specially trained to make house calls. He quickly recognized the value of those home visits.

“It’s when you get to spend more time with [patients], you get to find out what’s going on, what’s truly bothering them, what they need the most help with,” Anderson said.

The house calls have been a life-saver for folks like 65-year-old Victoria Denbleyker, who suffers from multiple, hard-to-manage chronic conditions, like diabetes, congestive heart failure, and rheumatoid arthritis—problems that used to routinely send her to the ER.

With doctors, Denbleyker said, “you don’t have that much time to really talk to them, even if you get the maximum amount of time, which is half an hour. Sometimes there are too many things going on. “

Without consistent monitoring, Denbleyker’s condition can rapidly descend into the danger zone.

“My system can change in a heartbeat,” she said. “I never know what is coming next. So the fact that they know what is going on with me means a lot.”

The Minnesota project started last October. To figure out which patients might benefit from the program, the hospital searched for anyone who had used the ER nine or more times in a year.

Nine was “the number we had to land on for our own survival mode,” said North Memorial's Croston.

Think that’s a lot?

“We’ve had some patients that were here 23 times in a month,” he said.

Croston said, “readmission rates are down for us as a health system, and that’s largely due to the fact that we’re intervening once they leave the hospital or once they leave the emergency department.”



Barb Andrews, who runs the program, says it’s a new way of thinking about health care.

“It gives us, as paramedics, an opportunity to be proactive rather than reactive,” she said. “The community paramedics empower [patients] to be able to manage their own health better in the home.”

And ultimately, she said, that can “keep them out of the hospital, keep them out of the nursing home.”"

He said he saw the hit job Sean Hannity did where he paraded 3 families into his studio. It turned out Obamacare would save two families almost 60% on their insurance and had no effect on the other.

He then discussed NBC’s David Gregory’s incompetence. Mitt Romney told Gregory that each state should craft policies to ensure all citizens are insured and pre-existing conditions are covered. That is exactly what Obamacare does. Gregory did not respond with that fact.

GOPAC’s David Avella saw the media coverage from the GOP’s alternate state of reality. In his mind the media did not report the millions of Americans being hurt by Obamacare. In his mind insurance rates are doubling and tripling. These statements of course are provably false.

Avella also complained about a middle aged man having to have a policy that includes maternity care. Anthony Weiner came back forcefully to illustrate the stupidity of his position. Anthony Weiner reminded him that people buy cars with hooks for baby carriers even though most would not use it. He said, “We do all kinds of things to make things better for all consumers that not every consumer gets.”

Anthony Weiner reminded Avella that currently every one with insurance pays for the uninsured right now in an inefficient manner, emergency rooms. He then reminded Avella that the private health insurance market is the substance of Obamacare. “That’s your idea”, he said.

Anthony Weiner is a very good debater. He is good at making his point very expressively. It is a shame he could not convert that very well read rhetoric into substantive action during his time in the House Of Representatives.

“Boy, the food at this place is really terrible,” says one.

“Yeah, I know,” says the other. “And such small portions.”

Last week, the administration announced it was delaying by a year the implementation of one of Obamacare’s provisions, the requirement that large employers provide health insurance. You’d think the opposition party, which has spent four years denouncing the health-care reforms, would be delighted by the reprieve. But on Wednesday, Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee held a hearing to condemn the administration — for incomplete enforcement of the law they hate.

“This committee intends to get an explanation,” proclaimed Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.), chairman of the subcommittee holding the hearing. “This committee has serious questions about how and why this alarming decision was made and the effect that delaying this key provision will have on other provisions of the law.”

It was kind of the chairman to show such thoughtful concern for a law he wants repealed. And if Brady saw the delay as “alarming,” others were apoplectic. “Boy, I’ll tell you,” Rep. Sam Johnson (R-Tex.) said, beginning his remarks. “I hate to see a dictatorship come into this country, but it sure looks like that’s what’s happening with health care.”

“We see this as definitely something that leans toward socialism,” proclaimed Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.).

President Obama was called a dictator and a socialist for passing Obamacare. Now he’s a dictator and a socialist for postponing it? “The irony of objecting to the delay of a program you’ve been trying to stop is no doubt lost on this room,” observed Rep. Jim McDermott (Wash.), the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee.

It’s a safe bet that Republicans aren’t really concerned about the delay, which the administration said last week that it had granted at the request of employers and which was applauded by business groups. Rather, Republicans used the delay as a chance to make the case, yet again, that the entire health-care law should be ditched. They are planning to vote soon on repealing the law — for the 38th time, give or take.

“This law is literally just unraveling before our eyes,” judged Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), the former vice-presidential candidate. “I don’t know how you can conclude that this is not a total fiasco.” In an extended cobbler’s metaphor, he said Democrats wrote the law “on Christmas Eve and shoehorned that into law, which is what we have today, and so we see all these shoes dropping.”

Chairman Brady revealed his motives when he used his opening statement to cite polling on the law’s unpopularity. “Clearly, the rollout of Obamacare is in disarray,” he exulted.

This unqualified opposition is counterproductive for House Republicans. On health care, as on immigration, their approach amounts to a search-and-destroy mission. They could work with Democrats to remove problematic pieces in the health-care law, and they could compromise with Democrats on legislation that would secure the borders. But instead they are devoted to shutting down both.

Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.) made the point when he asked the four witnesses called by the Republicans whether Obamacare should be fixed or repealed. The replies:

“Repealing and replacing.”

“Repealing and replacing.”

“Repeal and replace.”

“Repeal it.”

“The major obstacle that the Affordable Care Act faces today is there’s so much opposition for political reasons alone to see that this thing fail, and not whether this is going to help small businesses or help Americans throughout the country,” Kind said. “And that’s the real tragedy with these type of hearings.”

Replied Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) “Do we want to repeal this? You bet your life. Caught red-handed.” Roskam rejected the idea “that somehow a desire to see something fail is somehow unjust.”

But Republicans don’t have much of a viable alternative. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor touted a bill this spring to help people with preexisting health problems get insurance, but conservative opposition forced him to pull the bill from the floor.

In the case of the “employer mandate,” even a number of liberals agree that it’s a bad policy. Republicans could probably find support for repealing that provision, if they weren’t hellbent on repealing the whole law.

But it’s so much more cathartic to call a hearing, assume a posture of umbrage, and use words such as “calamity” and “fiscal time bomb,” and “socialism” and “dictatorship.”

USA TODAY

A Reagan appointee takes Obama to task ... for kowtowing to conservatives

%27Plan B%27 morning-after pill would be sold without an Rx%2C regardless of age

Federal judge overturns HHS ruling that limited sales to women 17 and older

WASHINGTON — Conventional politics flew out the window Friday in a federal judge's scathing attack on the Obama administration for banning the sale of over-the-counter contraceptives to young girls.

Usually, when a conservative court takes President Obama to task, you can bet it's for being too liberal. But in this case, federal District Court Judge Edward Korman — appointed to the Eastern District of New York by Ronald Reagan — castigated the administration for kowtowing to conservatives.

Korman ordered that ""morning-after"" contraceptives be sold nationwide without a prescription regardless of age, within 30 days. (The pill, popularly known as ""Plan B,"" typically works up to 72 hours after intercourse.) That overturns a decision made by Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius in 2011 that limited over-the-counter sales to women 17 and older.

Sebelius had overruled her own Food and Drug Administration, which has consistently ruled that the drugs are safe, citing the need to protect young girls from unwanted pregnancies. She was backed by Obama himself, the father of two young girls, who said it was only ""common sense"" that the drug not be available ""alongside bubble gum or batteries.""

""Common sense"" weren't the words that came to Korman's mind in his blistering, 59-page ruling. He called Sebelius' decision ""obviously political."" He said she forced the FDA to ""ride roughshod"" over its own policies. He said her reasons were ""so unpersuasive as to call into question her good faith.""

Korman's frustration stems in part from the duration of the case. He has been dealing with it for a decade, since the White House under President George W. Bush interfered with FDA decision-making. As a result, a drug considered safe by health and science advocates has been denied to many preteens and younger teens — in a country with declining but still higher teen pregnancy rates than any other developed nation.

So we have Korman, the Republican appointee, ordering the morning-after pill made available without a prescription to young girls — over the protestations of the Obama administration. And now we await the administration's response — on a day when politics as usual was anything but."

Washington (CNN) - It's a playbook on the bruising field of health care politics, complete with ""x's and o's.""

The House Republican strategy memo, entitled ""Because of Obamacare... I lost my insurance,"" offers samples of talking points, social media, videos, digital flyers, op-eds, and a fact sheet for GOP lawmakers doing battle against the president's signature legislative achievement.

[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='JimAcostaCNN']

Obtained by CNN, and reported first by Roll Call, the playbook was released late last month. A Republican source who provided the strategy memo to CNN says it will be updated and released to GOP House members Thursday.

""The administration now has a serious competence problem. Healthcare.gov is so much more than a website. The website should have been the easy part,"" the playbook reads.

The disclosure of the memo, produced by the office of House Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, comes amid a sustained Republican onslaught against the Affordable Care Act.

President Obama has noted the highly organized opposition to his signature legislative achievement.

“One of the problems we’ve had is one side of Capitol Hill is invested in failure,” Obama said at a Wall Street Journal event with some of the nation's top CEO's Tuesday.

White House spokesman Eric Schultz said the GOP's ""18 page playbook of partisan attacks is 18 pages longer than their health care plan.""

""In the playbook, there’s not a single word devoted to helping constituents enroll or offering an alternative idea to help Americans gain access to quality, affordable care,"" he added.

A spokesperson for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Democrats will continue to back the program.

""While Republicans continue to fixate on sabotaging health reform and root for failure, House Democrats will continue to stand tall in support of the Affordable Care Act, work to strengthen the health reform law as implementation continues, and ensure that millions of uninsured Americans get coverage,"" Drew Hammill said in a statement."

State officials said the Covered California website got 645,000 hits during the first day of enrollment, far fewer than the 5 million it reported Tuesday.

The state exchange had cited the 5 million figure as a sign of strong consumer interest and a major reason people had so much difficulty using its $313-million online enrollment system.

Dana Howard, a spokesman for Covered California, said the error was the result of internal miscommunication.

“Someone misspoke and thought it was indeed 5 million hits. That was incorrect,” he said.

Full coverage: Obamacare rolls out

Howard said the revised Web traffic still represents a huge response. He said the number of unique online visitors Tuesday was 514,000 and the state received 19,000 calls.

Meantime, Californians were still running into computer problems and long hold times during the second day of enrollment under the federal healthcare law.

Those glitches have prompted Covered California to shut down its online enrollment system twice.

First, the state took it down from 9 p.m. Tuesday until 7 a.m. Wednesday to make technical fixes. Then Covered California took enrollment offline for two hours Wednesday morning because information on health plans wasn’t loading properly, according to the state.

These problems could frustrate consumers and hamper enrollment efforts. California is trying to sign up more than 2 million people through next year, the most of any state.

Some consumers said they were able to create an account on the state’s website at www.coveredca.com, but the system crashed after that.

People calling for information continued to face wait times of 30 minutes or more. Some call-center representatives at the exchange told people they were having trouble accessing the state system themselves, further slowing down the enrollment process.

State officials say they are taking steps to remedy these service issues. California has about 300 people answering calls now, and it plans to add an additional 150 employees next month at a call center opening in Fresno.

Supporters of the healthcare law said there’s still time to iron out problems before coverage takes effect Jan. 1 on these new exchange plans. Enrollment runs through March 31.

Obamacare Q&A: Explaining your options



Insurers limiting doctors, hospitals in new exchange market



Demand is strong as Obamacare enrollment starts in California"
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/05/10/obama-wades-back-into-health-care-debate/,2013-05-10 00:00:00,[],Obama declares health care law 'is here to stay' as he steps up defense,"Caught between nervous Democrats and emboldened Republicans, President Obama on Friday stepped up the sales pitch on his health care overhaul as the final elements of his top domestic achievement go into effect. With his legacy and the law's success at stake, Obama said: ""The law is here to stay.""

Behind the scenes, the White House readied a campaign-style effort to get healthy young people to sign up for the insurance ""exchanges"" in order to keep premium costs from skyrocketing. On Capitol Hill, House Republicans are planning yet another vote to try to try to repeal the law.

The insurance exchanges are the centerpiece of the landmark overhaul of the nation's health insurance system and the White House mobilization is crucial to the success of the health care law and, by extension, to Obama's place in history as the first president in decades to expand health care coverage.

""There's a lot that this law is already doing for Americans with insurance,"" Obama said during a Mother's Day-themed event at the White House. ""There's a lot more that's going to happen for folks who don't have insurance.""

But he cautioned: ""We still have a lot of work to do in the coming months to make sure more Americans can buy affordable health coverage.""

And he urged the public not to be swayed by what he said were scare tactics from critics of the law who might blame it for rising premiums.

""Don't be bamboozled,"" he said.

Underscoring the policy and political consequences, the White House plans to employ both the resources of government as well as those of his reconfigured political operation as it aimed to enroll 7 million people in health insurance exchanges between Oct. 1 and the end of March. The goal is to get 30 million people to sign up within five years.

However, the composition of those signing up for the new exchanges matters just as much as the overall totals. In order to keep premium costs down, officials say they must register 2.7 million healthy people between the ages of 18 and 35 in order to counteract the costs of ensuring seniors and people with health problems.

The effort comes as the public remains divided over the health care law. As a result, the White House is planning an election-like campaign to target those uninsured or individually insured young people, an effort reminiscent of the sophisticated voter outreach that helped Obama win twice win the White House. The administration has identified where many of the healthy and uninsured young live and will be working with health clinics, hospitals, churches and other groups to sign them up for the exchanges.

Organizing for Action, an outside political group supporting Obama, will also be involved in the effort to promote the exchanges.

Administration officials say one-third of the young people they need to sign up for the exchanges live in California, Texas and Florida. Just over 50 percent are minorities and 57 percent are men.

The administration's challenge is to overcome both confusion and lack of awareness about the law. A new poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation showed more than 4 in 10 Americans didn't know the Affordable Health Care Act was still law or was being implemented, and about half feel they don't have enough information about the law to know how it will affect them.

However, the officials said they expect some of those views to shift after the exchanges are fully operational, in part because many Americans will realize their health didn't change and those that are uninsured will see the benefits of the law.

Besides enrolling needed participants, the White House effort is designed to rally the public around the health care law to stave off yet another challenge from Republicans. Three years after it became law, the health care overhaul remains a target of GOP lawmakers determined to overturn it.

""Women and families don't need Obamacare's higher costs, 20,000 pages of red tape and regulations, or to be forced off plans they currently have and like, in order to get cancer screenings or other preventive care,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in a statement ahead of Obama's remarks. ""As implementation draws closer, the president owes it to these women and all Americans to be straight about those consequences. Rather than another campaign-style event, the President has an obligation to warn all Americans about the train wreck that's headed our way."""

In California, state officials have released premium rates so residents can figure what they'll pay for coverage if they buy insurance through the exchange there. Same in Indiana. And Ohio, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont and Washington.

People will see huge price spikes in some of those states. People will save money in others.

And what will happen in Illinois? Big hike? Big cut? That's a mystery.

State officials have submitted proposed insurance plans and rates to the federal government, but they won't reveal the numbers to the public. The feds won't either.

So people are left, for now, to guess.

Illinois officials once expected that as many as 16 insurers would sell some 250 health plans via the exchange. But only six insurers, including the state's largest, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, have signed up. They will offer 165 insurance plans. UnitedHealthcare, the state's second-largest insurer, decided not to participate.

Does the relative lack of competition, the absence of a big player like UnitedHealthcare and the Obamacare demands for certain coverages mean that Illinois rates will be higher than they are now?

Sounds like a real possibility. But Illinois officials won't say if bad news is coming. Maybe they're waiting for the PR firm that was awarded a $35 million contract last month to promote the Illinois exchange to get up to spin speed.

We're getting a sense of what will happen in other states. California officials say some people will pay as much as 29 percent below the current market rate for coverage. New York says people will pay at least 53 percent less than they do now for comparable plans. But Florida warns that consumers who buy individual policies will pay 30 to 40 percent more. Ohio says people should brace for an average 41 percent jump.

In Illinois ... silence.

It's time for Illinois health care officials to clue in the rest of us. What will health coverage cost here?"

Americans are getting slammed by Obamacare right now. Workforces are decimated as health care prices rise. Public opinion is on our side. If now was not the time to unite and fight it, when was? Those who are attacking Cruz and Lee’s efforts have forgotten how negotiations are won.

Use as an example the negotiations a governor of energy-rich Alaska must engage in with powerful multinational oil tycoons. In my experience, I found that the key to achieving success for the people you’re elected to serve is to take a firm position, stand solid, and negotiate from there when the other guy is ready to take you seriously. You fight as hard as you can with whatever small edge you’ve got until the other guy respects you enough to wise up, sit down, and come to a mutually acceptable agreement. You get nothing at all if you preemptively surrender before the battle even commences.

Imagine how much stronger the GOP’s hand would have been if every Republican (and those Democrats who’ve finally admitted Obamacare’s devastating flaws) stood together against cloture in order to prevent Harry Reid from cutting off debate and stripping Obamacare defunding from the bill?

Not only would there have been pressure on red state Democrats up for re-election to join the right cause, there would have been pressure on Reid and the White House to negotiate agreements. Even if the GOP couldn’t have defunded all of Obamacare, they could have negotiated some relief for average Americans who now feel they can do nothing but brace for the coming train wreck. We average Americans know we’ll never get the exemptions and favors Obama gave his political cronies and Congress, but any relief for the middle class would have been welcomed.

But Republicans got nothing from squabbling with each other and denouncing (on and off the record) the brave men who tried to do something.

Ted Cruz and Mike Lee fought to fulfill the campaign promises every Republican made, and their actions have been revelatory for all of us.

Hunters know what flushing dogs do. Cruz and Lee were acting as the grassroots’ flushing dogs. Their actions showed us who was willing to stand up for hard working Americans and who wasn’t. We thank Senators Vitter, Paul, Crapo, Enzi, Fischer, Roberts, Scott, Heller, Grassley, Toomey, Moran, Rubio, Shelby, Risch, Inhofe, Portman, and Sessions for standing with Cruz and Lee.

In 2010, a galvanized grassroots rallied against Obamacare to carry Republicans to victory. But in 2012, many in the grassroots stayed home, and we saw how that turned out for the GOP.

Unfortunately, the message of some politicians today seems to be: “Whoopsie, seems I can’t fulfill my election promises, but vote for me again and I promise to do what I promised last time.”

Sorry, that doesn’t cut it. America, you deserve better. If they can’t do anything with the power you gave them through their elected office, then you deserve someone else to give it a try.

2014 is just around the corner, and we’re ready for it. Support those who do us a favor by flushing out politicians wanting to hide. Retrieving liberty must be the point in all this."

These are some of the reasons why CNNMoney readers say they'll opt to pay a penalty for not having health insurance in 2014, rather than sign up for a policy in the state-based exchanges or through their companies.

""I would love to have insurance, but we just don't have the money,"" said Sandra Czop, 58, of Bloomingdale, Ill. ""We need that $100 to put food on the table. We have no money to put gas in the car.""

Czop, a mortgage loan officer whose business is down 60% and whose husband is unemployed, summed up the sentiments of many readers. Though subsidies are available to those earning less than 400% of the poverty level, the premiums are still too high for many Americans.

Have questions on Obamacare? Join our Facebook chat on Friday.

For 2014, the penalty is either $95 per adult or 1% of family income, whichever results in a larger fine. (Income is defined as total income above the filing threshold, which is $10,000 for an individual and $20,000 for a family in 2013.) That's still a lot less than premiums, which are generally $200 to $300 a month on average for a silver plan.

So a person making $50,000 would not be eligible for a subsidy and would pay full price -- typically around $2,400 to $3,600 a year in premiums -- for a plan. If he declined to get insurance, he would only be subject to a $400 penalty for the year.

A couple earning that amount would receive a roughly $1,300 subsidy, leaving them to pay about $4,750 in premiums for the year. But that compares to a $300 penalty.

For some folks, health insurance just isn't a good deal. Take Jessica Birge, 29, who is studying nursing and works as a medical assistant. Her job gives her $100 a month for medical expenses, though she does have dental and vision coverage through her employer. But she doesn't have a lot of medical expenses since she rarely goes to the doctor, opting instead to go to a local clinic for her annual exams.

Though she knows she needs insurance in case she gets into an accident, she doesn't think Obamacare is very affordable.

""I don't really want to pay a penalty, but it's more economical for me to pay $300 a year [in fines] than $200 to $300 a month for insurance I don't use,"" said Birge, acknowledging she may get insurance in several years, when the penalties get more onerous.

Some people are opting to remain uninsured, even though they have access to coverage on the job. Since they don't go to the doctor much, they just prefer to pay for their health care out of pocket.

Christie Egeston, 35, could get insurance at her lab job, but instead she puts money into the flexible spending account at work to cover her yearly checkup.

""I don't really feel I need health insurance,"" said Egeston, who lives in Avondale Estates, Ga. ""If the penalty is less than what I'm paying for the year in insurance, it balances out.""

And, of course, there are people who will not sign up for Obamacare because they fundamentally oppose the idea of a health insurance requirement. That's the camp Jim Moore of Denver falls into.

""I'm just so opposed to the legislation and Obama's big government agenda,"" said Moore, 62, a contract certified public accountant. ""There's no way I'm giving my health care records to the government. I and many people need to make a statement."""

(CNN) —

For the first time, someone in the Obama administration apologized for the problem-plagued Obamacare website.

Marilyn Tavenner also said on Tuesday that the online troubles were being resolved and the overall program was working, albeit slower and less successfully than hoped.

In the first congressional testimony from a government official on the botched launch of HealthCare.gov, the head of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told the House Ways and Means Committee that the “vast majority” of consumers would be able to successfully use the site by the end of November.

“I want to apologize to you that the website does not work as well as it should,” she said, adding that HealthCare.gov “can and will be fixed.”

The hearing served as a hot seat for Tavenner, whose agency has been blamed for the website troubles causing a political headache for President Barack Obama and his signature health care reforms, as well as a venting session for Republicans after their failed efforts to scuttle the reforms.

Tavenner reports to Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who has come under fire for the problems that plagued the introduction of the enrollment website.

Some congressional Republicans demand her resignation or firing, and Sebelius will face a hearing by the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday.

She is expected to tell that committee the initial experience of HealthCare.gov has been frustrating for many, and unacceptable.

But she will also defend Obamacare, according to prepared remarks.

“The fact is that the Affordable Care Act delivered on its product: quality, affordable health insurance. The tremendous interest shown in HealthCare.gov shows that people want to buy this product. We know the initial consumer experience at HealthCare.gov has not been adequate. We will address these initial and any ongoing problems, and build a website that fully delivers on this promise of the Affordable Care Act,” Sebelius is expected to say.

The health secretary will provide figures for the site, which has had more than 20 million unique visits to date. Over the past few weeks, nearly 700,000 applications have been submitted. People are also signing up through a call center, paper applications and in-person assistance.

“By enlisting additional technical help, aggressively monitoring errors, testing to prevent new issues from cropping up, and regularly deploying fixes to the site, we are working to ensure consumers’ interaction with HealthCare.gov is a positive one, and that the Affordable Care Act fully delivers on its promise,” Sebelius will say.

In an exclusive interview last week, the health secretary told CNN that Obama didn’t know of the problems with the Affordable Care Act’s website until after its troubled launch on October 1. This was despite the fact that insurance companies had been complaining and the site crashed during a prelaunch test run.

Policies canceled

More trouble for Obama came out of the testimony, as Tavenner conceded that some people with individual health coverage – rather than the group coverage that most Americans have – will be forced to get new policies because of increased requirements under the 2010 Affordable Care Act.

“These individuals in a small group, our individual markets, had no protections” before the reforms became law, Tavenner explained.

Until now, such consumers “could be kicked out any time for pre-existing conditions” or realize too late that their policies failed to cover hospitalization or cancer treatments, Tavenner said. The reforms protect them by requiring a minimum standard of coverage, she added.

For some, that means more expensive policies and any change breaks the oft-repeated pledge by Obama that “if you like your plan, you can keep your plan” when he was pushing for Congress to pass his signature reforms.

Republican Rep. Aaron Schock of Illinois hammered Tavenner on that point, noting a constituent who got a letter telling her that the health care reforms caused the cancellation of her current plan with a more expensive alternative in its place.

“She has health insurance that she likes. She’s been paying her premium. She wants to keep it. But she can’t,” Schock said. “Isn’t that a lie?”

Tavenner responded that some insurers changed or discontinued plans that failed to meet the Obamacare requirements, even though present coverage could still be offered in some cases under a “grandfather” provision in the legislation, despite lacking the full benefits of the reforms.

She advised anyone being forced to get a new policy to examine all options under the new system, including the possibility of getting federal subsidies if they are eligible.

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation website, 15.4 million people had individual health care coverage in 2011, representing about 5% of the population. The vast majority of Americans – at least two-thirds of the population in 2011 – had coverage through their employer, Medicare, Medicaid or other public providers and will not be affected by changes involving individual coverage.

At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney said “a significant portion” of the 5% of people with individual coverage will end up paying less for better policies when they shop around in the new exchanges.

“One of the issues that the Affordable Care Act was designed to address was the need to provide greater security to those Americans forced to seek insurance on the individual market,” Carney said.

On Capitol Hill, a top House Democrat told reporters on Tuesday that his party “should have been more precise” when making the pledge about people keeping coverage they liked.

“I think preciseness would have been better,” said Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland.

He added that the promise was made to try to allay the fears of the majority of Americans who get health coverage from their employers or government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.

Partisan exchanges

As expected, Tuesday’s hearing included fiery partisan exchanges, with Republicans saying the website problems foreshadow deeper problems that threaten higher premiums and government intrusion in future health coverage while Democrats accused them of trying to kill reforms that benefit millions of Americans.

Under GOP questioning, Tavenner said initial figures on how many people have enrolled so far for health coverage under the reforms won’t be available until mid-November.

She noted that the administration has expected the initial enrollment to be small, but noted that the enrollment period ends on March 31.

When asked by Republicans about the expected initial low enrollment, Tavenner pointed out that a similar dynamic occurred with implementation of the Massachusetts health care law, when people waited until the final deadline approached to sign up.

To GOP Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, the committee chairman, low enrollment signals the failure of the health care reforms, which need young people, and people who are less expensive to insure, to sign up so insurers can offer affordable plans in markets that include older and people who are more expensive to cover.

“I fear we can see a fundamental breakdown of the insurance market where premiums will skyrocket, pricing millions of Americans out of health care,” he said.

Later, Republican Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas asked Tavenner for a guarantee that consumers will be able to obtain coverage required by the health care law before the deadline.

“What I can guarantee is that we have a system that is working. We are going to improve the speed of that system,” she said.

But Brady interrupted her.

“Excuse me,” he said. “You are saying the system right now is working?”

Tavenner didn’t budge, responding: “I am saying it is working. It is just not working at the speed that we want and at the success rate that we want.”

Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey lambasted Republicans on the panel for choosing to pile on the website woes in their continuing attempt to dismantle Obamacare instead of working with Democrats to improve settled law.

Citing the political battle last decade over the Bush administration’s Medicare prescription drug benefit opposed by Democrats, Pascrell noted “we lost the policy fight” then but chose to help make the program work instead of trying to discredit or undermine it.

Standing up and pointing at his GOP colleagues, Pascrell shouted: “How many of you stood up to do that? None. Zero. Zero.”

Website problems

Late Tuesday, officials said the data hub behind the Obamacare website was experiencing an outage, prohibiting customers from submitting new applications.

Verizon, which provides some technology services behind HealthCare.gov, said federal officials asked the company to provide additional computing and storage ability.

“At the request of HHS’s deputy CIO, we are now undertaking infrastructure maintenance, which should be complete overnight,” Verizon spokesman Jeffrey Nelson said. “We anticipate the strengthened infrastructure will help eliminate application downtimes.”

A key tech malfunction brought down the site Sunday.

In prepared testimony for the hearing, Tavenner said private contractors hired to create the website “have not met expectations.” Asked about that statement, she cited one of the contractors – CGI Federal, which has a contract worth as much as $200 million for its work on the system.

In the latest surprise to emerge during the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, people seeking insurance on the ObamaCare exchanges are finding the plans limit access to some of the best-ranked hospitals and cancer centers in the country.

The access problem is a byproduct of the effort to drive down costs of subsidized coverage, prompting insurance companies to shy away from more expensive facilities.

That doesn't necessarily mean someone buying insurance through ObamaCare is locked out of those hospitals. In some cases, patients could go ""out of network"" in order to use the medical center of their choosing -- but would have to pay more in the process.

According to a former top health care adviser for the White House, that's how the program was designed.

Challenged on ""Fox News Sunday"" over why Americans are losing access to their current doctors and hospitals, ObamaCare architect Ezekiel Emanuel claimed President Obama did not mislead on that point, despite his refrain that if people liked their doctors and policies they could keep them.

""The president never said you were going to have unlimited choice of any doctor in the country you want to go to,"" Emanuel said. ""He didn't say you could have unlimited choice.""

In a remark that has since generated considerable controversy, Emanuel added: ""If you want to pay more for an insurance company that covers your doctor, you can do that.""

Indeed, The Financial Times reported that most plans being sold on the exchanges in New York, Texas and California do not offer access to some of the top medical centers in those states.

New York's Memorial Sloan Kettering, Houston's MD Anderson Cancer Center and Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Medical Center are left out of most plans -- meaning those who want to go there would likely have to pay more.

Watchdog.org, in a recent report, found that 11 of the top 18 hospitals (as ranked by U.S. News & World Report) were connected with just one or two insurance carriers on the exchanges. In Ohio, for instance, the Cleveland Clinic was connected with one insurance company.

Asked about the shifting policies under ObamaCare and their impact on choice, a representative with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center released a statement to FoxNews.com saying, ""all patients deserve access to top tier cancer care"" -- and that while not everyone needs to come to MD Anderson, ""we believe both insurance providers and our health care system must work together to ensure patients have that option so that all of us have the best chance of beating cancer.""

Though some complain about these centers' high costs, the statement argued that ""our country's leading cancer centers help bring down the cost of care for all patients by conducting research that leads to new and better treatments, better cancer fighting strategies and increased efficiencies that lead to cost savings.""

""We're very concerned,"" Thomas Priselac, president of Cedars-Sinai Health System in California, told The Financial Times. ""[Insurers] know patients that are sick come to places like ours. What this is trying to do is redirect those patients elsewhere, but there is a reason why they come here. These patients need what it is that we are capable of providing.""

It's not just the insurance companies that are deciding to drop certain hospitals from their plans. In some cases, the hospitals themselves are opting out, unwilling to go along with proposed lower rates.

Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, defended the insurance industry's move to trim costs where it can -- noting that the law's benefit requirements end up raising costs.

""Establishing high-value provider networks is one way health plans can help make coverage more affordable for consumers, which is particularly important at a time when costs are increasing due to the new health insurance tax and minimum benefit requirements included in the health care reform law,"" he told FoxNews.com.

Emanuel, though, said ""the issue isn't the selective networks.""

""People are going to have a choice as to whether they want to pay a certain amount for a selective network or pay more for a broader network,"" Emanuel said.

Under the law, people who do not have insurance have until the end of March to sign up in order to avoid a penalty. For those wishing to get new coverage by Jan. 1, the deadline to sign up is Dec. 23.

Despite problems with HealthCare.gov and other state-based exchanges, officials say they're improving the websites and making progress in signing more people up as the deadlines near.

The Post also reports that, like everything else surrounding ObamaCare, this announcement is not even close to true.

The faulty $600 million site has been improved over the course of the last two months. Still, though, it can only handle 50,000 users at a time. Moreover, the site still loads slowly and the capacity for 50,000 users hasn’t yet been fully tested.

Earlier this month, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the administration’s goal was to make the site usable for 80% of users — another moving of the goal posts since the White House announced November 30 as a target date.

Other deadline misses include the HealthCare.gov program that allows small businesses to enroll online. This feature, known as SHOP, has been delayed until after the 2014 midterm elections. What hasn’t been postponed, though, are the insurance policy cancellations already plaguing small business owners.

In order to re-insure their employees, business owners will now have to work through a broker or insurance agent. That is if the the increased costs and hassles surrounding ObamaCare don’t result in small business owners deciding that insuring their employees just isn’t worth it. CBS News reported last week that this is already happening.

The Wall Street Journal reports that technical problems will still inhibit HealthCare.gov from verifying users’ identities and the transmission of accurate enrollment data to insurance providers. The fallout of the latter problem won’t be readily apparent until someone who has been told they are insured tries to visit a doctor or emergency room only to discover their insurer has no idea who they are.

Some crucial parts of HealthCare.gov are not even built yet, including the mechanism that pays your insurance carrier the part of your premium covered by the federal government — the infamous subsidy.

Some reports claim that in order for ObamaCare to meet its March 30 enrollment goal of 7-plus million enrollees (this number is necessary to make the system financially viable), somewhere around 54,000 people must sign up daily. Currently, only around 7,000 enrollments are occurring daily.

Granted, this is a big improvement over last month’s enrollment numbers, but two times zero is still zero.

If they hang tight, Democrats face challenges from their left in blue enclaves and from the right in purple or red ones. Moreover, they will need to discredit the president and this particular effort if they are to keep alive that liberal cult of big government. It’s not all big government that is unworkable, just this mess made by Obama."

By mid-November, the 14 state-based marketplaces reported data showing enrollment has nearly doubled from last month, jumping to about 150,000 from 79,000, according to state and federal statistics. The nonprofit Commonwealth Fund, which has been tracking the data, called the most recent numbers “a November enrollment surge.”

The latest figures from the state-run exchanges, combined with totals on the federal exchange, bring the national number to at least 176,000. While the pace of enrollments increased this month, sign-ups are still well below early projections.

On Friday, the Obama administration announced that it is giving consumers an extra week in December to sign up for coverage that begins Jan. 1, in light of troubles with federal enrollment. Insurers worried that the change would not give them enough time to process applications.

Health policy experts said the momentum from state exchanges is encouraging.

California, which has had about 80,000 sign-ups, is now reporting about 2,000 enrollments per day. New York and Washington state reported enrollment numbers in the tens of thousands as of this week.

A total of 27,000 enrollments were reported in October for the federal marketplace in which 36 states are relying on HealthCare.gov; the number has not been updated in November.

“It’s not all doom and gloom,” Kaiser Family Foundation President Drew Altman said. “What this says is that the problems are system problems, not problems with demand or interest.”

Health policy experts have always expected that enrollment would be slower in October because coverage doesn’t begin until January. What they did not expect was the array of technical issues that would make it difficult for even the most eager shoppers to purchase coverage.

The state exchanges that have performed well “were just better equipped and ready to handle high capacity” of users, said Sara Collins, a vice president at the Commonwealth Fund, a health policy nonprofit group. They worked out some of their technical issues, testing early on in the summer, she said.

Those states have also conducted stronger outreach, aggressively targeting young people, who generally have fewer health problems and are considered critical to the success of the exchanges.

Some of the state exchanges are seeing the pace of enrollment pick up daily. California has been out in front; the state’s enrollments have grown steadily in November and now account for nearly half of all health law sign-ups. The state has had its strongest two weeks of enrollment this month.

“We’re seeing much larger numbers than we expected,” Covered California Executive Director Peter Lee told reporters this week.

Connecticut officials say they have seen about 14 percent of their expected enrollees sign up through mid-November. The state has had about 8,000 people enroll in private coverage.

And in Washington state, health law enrollment in private plans has jumped from 7,341 at the end of October to 11,742 through Nov. 14.

“We’re definitely seeing interest continuing to build,” exchange spokesman Michael Marchand said. “I fully suspect we may have half our enrollment coming in in December.”

Meanwhile, the federal government is giving consumers even more time, allowing them an extra week in December to sign up for coverage to begin Jan. 1. The previous Dec. 15 deadline has been pushed back to Dec. 23, said Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency overseeing HealthCare.gov. She said that the date was changed in consultation with insurers and that the administration was confident carriers would have enough time to process applications.

But industry officials raised concerns that the shortened period would not be enough time to complete the many tasks required after someone hits “submit” on an application and before a benefit card arrives in the mail.

“It makes it more challenging to process enrollments in time for coverage to begin on January 1,” said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans.

Insurers are worried that a flood of new applications at the last minute, combined with the inaccurate enrollment data they are receiving from HealthCare.gov, will leave them scrambling to verify information and receive payment.

Health and Human Services officials also announced Friday that insurers in Florida, Texas and Ohio will launch a pilot program to allow consumers to directly enroll in coverage, bypassing HealthCare.gov. This type of enrollment was always supposed to be an option for consumers, but the online system has not worked properly.

The administration also confirmed Friday that it is pushing back next year’s open enrollment by one month, so that it begins Nov. 15 instead of Oct. 15 and ends in early January instead of December.

Republicans accused the administration of a blatantly political effort to shift the sign-up period until after the Nov. 4 election and delay bad news that might result from the next round of open enrollment.

But from a policy perspective, the deadline change also gives insurers an extra month to set rates for 2015. Insurance companies would have until May 2014, instead of April, to file their rates. With the current open enrollment ending March 31, insurers have long complained that it would be difficult to know, for example, how sick a particular group of people are and how to factor in that information in setting premium rates for the following year.

Also Friday, Jeffrey Zients, who was appointed by Obama in October to fix HealthCare.gov’s problems, said he was “very confident” that the federal site would be able to handle 50,000 simultaneous users by the end of this month. “The site was originally intended to handle this load, and improvements will bring it up to this level,” Zients said. “We will have the capacity that was intended.”"

McDonald III, the current president of the pharmacy: “Two days after that final audit was issued, Barbara J. McDonald, your mother and president of Marra’s Pharmacy, wrote Governor Cuomo in an attempt to have him intervene in your dispute with O.M.I.G.”

“After your mother’s letter to Gov. Cuomo,” the letter continued, “O.M.I.G. further reduced the findings of Medicaid overpayments.” The agency eventually settled for $268,000.

Mr. McDonald, formerly the mayor of Cohoes and now a Democratic state assemblyman, said Friday he was happy to cooperate and provide the voluminous file showing why his family had fought the audit, eventually suing the state, and why the amount had been reduced. “We’ll be even happier when they review it and realize there was nothing wrong,” he said.

Far from receiving favoritism, he said, his small pharmacy was almost destroyed by an unforgiving government bureaucracy and is now being swept into a politicized inquiry. Medicaid requires prescriptions to be kept for six years so the government can verify that its payments are justified, but his mother mistakenly believed they could be destroyed after five, and did so. The audit sample showed 30 prescriptions missing. Auditors estimated the pharmacy had been improperly reimbursed by Medicaid by at least $1.4 million, an extrapolation technique used by James Sheehan, then the Medicaid inspector, that providers protested.

“My mother is 78,” Mr. McDonald said. “She’s devoted her life to the pharmacy.”

A second letter from the committee went to John Navarra, owner of Town Total Nutrition Inc. in Manhattan, which had been overpaid through Medicaid by more than $10 million, according to a 2007 preliminary audit. After it was disputed, the inspector general repeatedly reduced the recovery demand, eventually settling for $521,291, less than 5 percent of the initial finding."

Accidents -- in cars, on ski slopes, walking down the street -- happen even to the affluent. And Obamacare is intentionally structured to prevent people who go without insurance from acquiring it only after they need it. You can only sign up for health insurance during an annual open-enrollment period. So if you get hit by a car two months after you ignored the open enrollment, you’re not going to want to wait for the next enrollment period before you get health care. It’s going to cost you."
http://news.yahoo.com/obama-says-nowhere-healthcare-gov-debacle-181259150--sector.html,,[],Obama says 'nowhere to go but up' after HealthCare.gov debacle,"By Roberta Rampton WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama's popularity has taken a beating over the botched October 1 launch of Obamacare, but in a television interview set to air on Friday, Obama said he believes Americans eventually will appreciate his signature healthcare reform. Reflecting on his poll numbers in an interview with ABC's Barbara Walters, Obama said: ""I've gone up and down pretty much consistently throughout. ""But the good thing about when you're down is that usually you got nowhere to go but up,"" Obama added, according to excerpts released by ABC. The interview was taped last week as the Obama administration scrambled to meet a self-imposed November 30 deadline to overhaul HealthCare.gov, the website used in 36 states to shop for insurance under the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare. Americans trying to use the website have been stymied by errors and slow speeds. The problems meant only 27,000 people were able to use the website to sign up during the first month, and there is now a backlog of Americans to get through the system by a December 23 deadline. ""I continue to believe and (I'm) absolutely convinced that, at the end of the day, people are going to look back at the work we've done to make sure that in this country, you don't go bankrupt when you get sick, that families have that security,"" Obama told ABC. ""That is going be a legacy I am extraordinarily proud of."" Obama officials have said the website should work better for most people by Saturday, although they have warned it will not be perfect. Before the launch, Obama had assured Americans the website would be as easy to use as Amazon or Kayak, and also promised that people could keep existing insurance plans if they so chose. But he found himself having to apologize to Americans after falling short on both promises. In the interview Obama said he wants to find out why he was caught by surprise. ""Obviously my most recent concern has been that my website's not working ... and we're evaluating why it is exactly that I didn't know soon enough that (it) wasn't going to work the way it needed to,"" Obama said. ""But my priority now has been to just make sure that it works."" (Reporting by Roberta Rampton. Editing by Andre Grenon)"

The pace of sign-ups accelerated in November after the Obama administration worked to solve technical problems with healthcare.gov. Officials say there has been an even bigger increase in traffic in recent weeks.

Through November, just over 137,200 Americans have picked an insurance policy through healthcare.gov and nearly 227,500 through the 14 state-run exchanges, according to new federal figures released Wednesday. That's up from a total of 106,000 who signed up in October.

These figures reflect people who have selected an insurance plan, but not all have paid their first month's premium, which activates the coverage. An additional 1.94 million people have been determined eligible to enroll, but have not yet picked a policy.

Americans have until Dec. 23 to select a policy if they want coverage to start Jan. 1. They must start paying their premiums by the end of this year, or they may see their policy selection canceled. Open enrollment for those who want coverage in 2014 ends March 31.

Share your story: Are you signing up for Obamacare?

Federal officials said they think they are on track to reach their goals and noted that many people wait until the last minute to enroll.

""We're not exclusively focused on reaching a particular number. What we're focused on is reaching the millions of people who are really looking for affordable health care coverage,"" said Michael Hash, director of the Office of Health Reform in the Department of Health and Human Services.

Total enrollment is not the only important measure, Hash said. The viability of the exchanges depends on how many enrollees sign up in each state and the mix of participants.

""It's really about who signs up and where,"" he said.

Obamacare must attract younger, healthier people to offset the higher costs of the older and sicker. Otherwise, premiums could jump for 2015.

Only a handful of state exchanges have released demographic data of those picking plans. California, for instance, said that younger residents age 18 to 34 accounted for about 22.5% of the sign ups in October, just about the share they represent in the state population.

Sign-ups vary widely by state. More than 107,000 Californians have picked plans, while only 44 Oregonians have. Florida leads the way in the federal exchange, with nearly 18,000 people picking plans, while North Dakota has only 265 sign-ups.

Only about 41% of the total number eligible to enroll so far qualify for subsidies, less than half of initial projections.

Separately, just over 803,000 people have been determined eligible for Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Only half of states and the District of Columbia have opted to expand this public health program.

While federal officials have addressed many of the technical issues that plagued consumers' ability to sign up for a plan, they continue to wrestle with transmitting accurate applications to insurers. Officials say they think 90% of transaction forms are accurate, but are still working with insurers to match applicants records."

Special for USA TODAY

Al-Qaeda has had a presence in the region for a decade at least

Al-Qaeda militants rose from a few hundred in 2010 to more than a thousand in 2012

Imams worry that military-heavy tactics push people into the arms of militancy

MUKALLA, Yemen — After more than a decade of U.S. counterterrorism efforts and drone strikes in Yemen, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula remains a potent and growing force.

Some say it is time for a change in strategy.

Imam Abu al-Harith Omar bin Salem Bawazeer said he is one of many Muslim clerics who are part of a campaign to persuade Yemenis to reject the militancy and jihadist ideology al-Qaeda spreads in Yemen. He sees signs of success.

""These efforts not only have a significant role in raising awareness but have led to some coming back … they abandoned this (al-Qaeda) ideology,"" he said.

But he worries that the military-heavy tactics of the U.S.-backed central government in Sanaa are pushing people into the arms of militancy.

""Unfortunately, our efforts have not been supported by the state,"" Bawazeer said.

Mukalla is a picturesque port on the eastern edge of the Gulf of Aden famous for its abundant fish. Traditional wooden boats bob in clear green water along the town's crumbling corniche overlooked by the former palace of long-gone sultans.

Al-Qaeda has had a presence in the region for a decade at least, often recruiting from the thousands of mujahedin who returned home after fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan. The Yemeni government has partnered with the U.S. military to crush the group.

Al-Qaeda in the Arabia Peninsula as the Yemen branch calls itself has not been wiped out. In fact, it has been described by the Obama administration as the most lethal wing of the core group that attacked New York and Washington on Sept. 11, 2001. Its self-stated goal is to impose by an Islamic cleric-run caliphate in Yemen and the Middle East free of non-Muslim influence.

AQAP has been accused of a failed 2009 assassination attempt on a Saudi prince and the British ambassador in Sanaa. In May 2012, a suicide bomber killed more than 100 Yemeni soldiers rehearsing for a military parade.

AQAP has also been implicated in Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab's failed 2009 Christmas Day bombing and Faisal Shahzad's attempted 2010 Times Square bombing, along with a failed plot to down cargo flights bound for Chicago.

More recently it has shown it can operate militarily as well despite joint U.S.-Yemen attacks against it. This month AQAP allegedly launched a coordinated attack against a military base in Mukalla. Fighters dressed in Yemeni security forces uniforms seized the building and killed several soldiers before being driven out.

Long before the U.S.' drone program in Yemen began in earnest in 2011, and five years prior to the 2009 creation of AQAP, Bawazeer began warning of the threat posed by the ideology of al-Qaeda and its insurgent arm, Ansar al-Sharia.

An imam and head of an Islamic institute for Koranic and Sharia studies based in Mukalla, the provincial capital of Hadhramaut, Bawazeer along with scholars and tribal sheikhs have been running programs for Yemeni youth who are susceptible to AQAP's message justifying violence.

Bawazeer and his colleagues said an alternative solution must be found to the primarily military one used by the government. But he said their warnings and labors have not been heeded by the government and the threat has spread.

John Brennan, Obama's former chief counterterrorism adviser and now head of the CIA, noted recently that the number of al-Qaeda militants in Yemen had risen from a few hundred in 2010 to ""more than a thousand"" in April 2012.

However, Yemen's government said it has not failed to act against the dissemination of al-Qaeda's ideology.

Jabri Ibrahim Hassan Kamil, general director of preaching and guidance for a government ministry, said state-run programs training imams to promote moderate Islam have been used successfully across the country along with educational and media campaigns against al-Qaeda's extreme interpretation of Islam.

""If it weren't for these (government) efforts, al-Qaeda would now be pervasive in the country,"" Kamil said. ""The aim is to disseminate moderation and rationalize the religious discourse.""

Bawazeer said he has repeatedly been rebuffed when he has asked for help from the government and international organizations to rehabilitate former al-Qaeda militants and prevent new recruits through media campaigns, education programs and cultural activities.

He said his work along with fellow imams and tribal leaders prevented insurgents from taking over towns in the southern provinces of Abyan and neighboring Shabwah when security broke down during Yemen's political uprising of 2011. But some have paid with their lives.

Salim Ahmed bin Ali Jaber, a friend of Bawazeer's, denounced the militants during Friday prayers in an August 2012 sermon to his congregation in the small village of Khashamir in northern Hadhramaut. He challenged al-Qaeda to show him ""one piece of evidence in Islam that said killing is justified,"" according to Salim's brother-in-law, Faisal bin Ali Jaber.

Faisal bin Ali Jaber said he tried to persuade him to tone down his challenge to the militants but Salim Ahmed bin Ali Jaber told him he was determined to speak out.

""If I don't use my position to make it clear to my congregation that this ideology is wrong, who will?"" Salim told his brother-in-law.

The following evening, Faisal said Salim was killed by what he said was a U.S. drone strike as Salim stood outside the village mosque talking to three strangers who had come looking for him. The strike may have targeted the strangers, but no one knows because the United States will not comment on strikes.

Southern Hadhramaut's security director, Fahami Mahroos, agrees that the response to terrorism can't depend on military or law enforcement, a sentiment expressed by President Obama as well. Mahroos said the strategy against al-Qaeda needs to be a dual offensive: firstly tackling their ideology via religious scholars and secondly with military action.

But he conceded that there is a huge lack of cooperation between the central government and local community leaders in confronting the extremist ideology.

""The main responsibility should be laid on the local people and community leaders,"" Mahroos said. ""Maybe the government doesn't have the skills or the abilities to do this.""

The Obama administration strategy has largely been to keep taking out senior leaders of al-Qaeda, Katherine Zimmerman, a scholar with the American Enterprise Institute, told the House Committee on Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence last month.

In Yemen, the strategy has killed senior leader Anwar al Awlaki, USS Cole bombers Abdul Munim al Fathani and Fahd al Quso, AQAP senior operative Mohamed Said al Umdah, spiritual leader Adil al Abab, and deputy leader Said al Shihri. But AQAP has still managed to expand during that time, Zimmerman said.

Bawazeer said two things he believes are needed to reverse the trend and challenge al-Qaeda's ideology: a guarantee for those who leave al-Qaeda and go through rehabilitation won't be automatically re-arrested, and support from international aid agencies to fund projects, small businesses and help provide jobs.

""As long as these two things were guaranteed then things would be easier,"" he said.

Frank Cilluffo, director of the Homeland Security Institute at George Washington University, agreed in testimony before Congress last month.

""Ideology is the lifeblood that sustains al-Qaeda,"" he said.

Bawazeer may not be there to challenge that ideology. He and several of his family members have received multiple death threats from al-Qaeda because of his work and don't want to be involved, Bawazeer said.

""Now I'm really discouraged to go on,"" he said. ""I've stopped."""

The Human Rights Watch organization urged that country’s government on Monday to reject a proposed law providing for adulterers to be stoned to death.

“It is absolutely shocking that 12 years after the fall of the Taliban government, the Karzai administration might bring back stoning as a punishment,” said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. Afghan President Hamid Karzai ""needs to demonstrate at least a basic commitment to human rights and reject this proposal out of hand.”

The Islamist Taliban militia that governed Afghanistan from 1996 until U.S.-led forces toppled its government in late 2001 used to put convicted adulterers to death by shooting them or stoning them.

A Justice Ministry-led working group is calling for a return to stoning adulterers “if there are four eyewitnesses,” Reuters reported Monday.

The Guardian newspaper reported that another punishment being considered was flogging.

Human Rights Watch urged international donors to use what leverage they have to convince Karzai to reject the proposal.

The group said the draft proposal metes out harsh punishments to men and women who have sex outside of marriage.

They face “stoning to death if the adulterer or adulteress is married,” and the punishment will be carried out in public in a predetermined location, HRW quoted the draft as saying.

What if they’re unmarried? Then they face “whipping 100 lashes.”

Human Rights Watch’s appeal came as President Barack Obama’s national security adviser, Susan Rice, was in Afghanistan to assess the situation there ahead of the planned pullout of U.S.-led combat troops by the end of next year.

“On behalf of President Obama, she is thanking the men and women who are away from their families this Thanksgiving and serving in harm’s way,” the White House said in a statement.

“She will hear directly from U.S. troops, diplomats, and development professionals about our efforts as we move toward the responsible conclusion of our combat mission at the end of 2014 and as we continue to strengthen Afghanistan to ensure that it can provide security, governance, and opportunity for its people,” the White House said."

BJP Vice-President Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi questioned whether the UPA is a government or a theatrical production. Is this a government or a theatrical production?

Rahul Gandhi earlier in the day said he personally felt that what the government is doing on the ordinance is wrong.

If we actually want to stop corruption then we cannot make these compromises,"" he added. The fate of the proposed ordinance to bypass the apex court's ruling on barring convicted MPs and MLAs looked uncertain yesterday after President Pranab Mukherjee summoned Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and Law Minister Kapil Sibal to seek a clarification. The Union Cabinet had approved an ordinance to reverse the Supreme Court judgment mandating the immediate disqualification of lawmakers convicted for a criminal offence punishable with a jail term of more than two years. The ordinance seeks to reverse the Supreme Court judgement that had not only disqualified lawmakers convicted of offences with two years or more in jail, but also barred from contesting elections. The ordinance will allow convicted legislators to continue in office, if the appeal against the conviction is admitted by a higher court within 90 days. In a landmark verdict delivered on July 10, the apex court ruled that MPs or MLAs shall stand disqualified from holding the membership of the house from the date of conviction. ""The only question is about the vires of section 8 (4) of the Representation of the People Act (RPA) and we hold that it is ultra vires and that the disqualification takes place from the date of conviction,"" said an apex court bench of Justices A.K. Patnaik and S.J. Mukhopadhaya. The apex court, however, said that its decision will not apply to MPs, MLAs or other lawmakers who have been convicted and have filed their appeals in the higher courts before the pronouncement of this verdict. According to the provision of Representation of the People Act, a lawmaker cannot be disqualified in the event of his conviction in a criminal case if he or she files an appeal in the higher court.

He Can Be Reached At Adam.Shaw Foxnews.Com.']",Pope Francis is the Catholic Church’s Obama – God help us,"Pope Francis is undergoing a popularity surge comparable to the way Barack Obama was greeted by the world in 2008. And just as President Obama has been a disappointment for America, Pope Francis will prove a disaster for the Catholic Church.

My fellow Catholics should be suspicious when bastions of anti-Catholicism in the left-wing media are in love with him.

Much is being made of his ‘compassion’ and ‘humility,’ but kissing babies and hugging the sick is nothing new. Every pope in recent memory has done the same, yet only now are the media paying attention. Benedict XVI and John Paul II refused to kowtow to the liberal agenda, and so such displays of tenderness were under-covered.

[pullquote]

But Francis is beating a retreat for the Catholic Church, and making sure its controversial doctrines are whispered, not yelled – no wonder the New York Times is in love.

More On This... Pope Francis’ unexpected Hanukkah gift

Just like President Obama loved apologizing for America, Pope Francis likes to apologize for the Catholic Church, thinking that the Church is at its best when it is passive and not offending anyone’s sensibilities.

In his interviews with those in the left-wing media he seeks to impress, Francis has said that the Church needs to stop being ‘obsessed’ with abortion and gay marriage, and instead of seeking to convert people, “we need to get to know each other, listen to each other and improve our knowledge of the world around us.”

This softly-softly approach of not making a fuss has been tried before, and failed. The Second Vatican Council of the 1960’s aimed to “open the windows” of the Church to the modern world by doing just this.

The result was the Catholic version of New Coke. Across the West where the effects were felt, seminaries and convents emptied, church attendance plummeted, and adherence to Church doctrine diminished.

John Paul II and Benedict XVI worked hard to turn this trend around, but now Pope Francis wants the bad old days to resume.

Proof of this is Francis’ aforementioned statement of the Church being obsessed with controversial issues and the need to rebalance by talking about it less.

That Francis didn’t see that this would be translated into headlines of “Pope tells Catholics to shut up about things that offend Sandra Fluke” by every left-wing media outlet shows a terrifying naivety.

Nor do his comments reflect reality.

For years, the majority of priests didn't dare cover controversial topics in their homilies in fear of getting angry letters from pick-and-choose Catholics outraged that their pastor dared to say something out of line with the Democratic Party.

Most parishioners therefore haven’t heard the Church’s argument on controversial topics. Consequently, usage of contraception is only slightly lower in Catholics than in the general population, and support of gay marriage is actually higher in Catholics than the general population. Perhaps talking about it even less isn’t the answer?

In trying to please the media and the modern world, Francis mistakes their glee for respect. Just like Obama thought he’d won over Putin by promising a reset, Francis thinks by talking vacuously about the poor, he will be respected. And it is vacuous -- the pontiff recently asked why it’s news that the stock market drops but not when an old person dies. When your leader is asking, “Why isn’t the newspaper a laundry list of obituaries?” you know you elected the wrong guy.

What effect is this having? For all we’re being told about how ‘disenfranchised’ Catholics are being brought back by Francis ‘reaching out,’ a recent Pew Research study showed that in America, the number of people who identify as Catholic has actually decreased. Lesson: rubbing the egos of Church-hating left-wingers doesn’t make more Catholics, it just makes the Church less respected.

Francis not only panders to enemies and professional grievance mongers, but also attacks his allies. Just as Obama snubs Britain and Israel, Pope Francis swipes at practicing Catholics.

So not only has he insulted, and severely damaged the work of, pro-life and pro-marriage groups with his comments, he has also gone on the attack, dismissing Catholics who attend the older rites in Latin as ‘ideologizing’ and being guilty of ‘exploitation.’ Apparently “Who am I to judge?” doesn’t apply here.

On world matters, Francis’ statements are embarrassing. About communism, a destructive ideology that slaughtered millions of Catholics, he said:

“Learning about it through a courageous and honest person was helpful. I realized…an aspect of the social, which I then found in the social doctrine of the Church.""

Not such kind words for the free market, however. In his recent apostolic exhortation he slammed unfettered capitalism, calling it ‘a new tyranny.’

Apart from the fact that there is no major nation practicing unfettered capitalism (like Obama, Francis loves attacking straw men) there is more real tyranny in socialist cesspools like Francis’ home of Argentina than in places where capitalism is predominant.

In the document he rejects the free market and calls for governments to overhaul financial systems so they attack inequality. In doing so he shows himself painfully misguided on economics, failing to see that free markets have consistently lifted the poor out of poverty, while socialism merely entrenches them in it, or kills them outright.

Like Obama, Francis is unable to see the problems that are really endangering his people. Like Obama he mistakes the faithful for the enemy, the enemy for his friend, condescension for respect, socialism for justice and capitalism for tyranny.

As a Catholic, I do hope Francis’ papacy is a successful one, but from his first months he seems hell-bent on a path to undo the great work of Benedict XVI and John Paul II, and to repeat critical mistakes of the past.

Having assumed for months that the United States was unlikely to intervene militarily in Syria, the Defense Department has been thrust onto a war footing that has made many in the armed services uneasy, according to interviews with more than a dozen military officers ranging from captains to a four-star general.

Former and current officers, many with the painful lessons of Iraq and Afghanistan on their minds, said the main reservations concern the potential unintended consequences of launching cruise missiles against Syria.

Some questioned the use of military force as a punitive measure and suggested that the White House lacks a coherent strategy. If the administration is ambivalent about the wisdom of defeating or crippling the Syrian leader, possibly setting the stage for Damascus to fall to fundamentalist rebels, they said, the military objective of strikes on Assad’s military targets is at best ambiguous.

“There’s a broad naivete in the political class about America’s obligations in foreign policy issues, and scary simplicity about the effects that employing American military power can achieve,” said retired Lt. Gen. Gregory S. Newbold, who served as director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the run-up to the Iraq war, noting that many of his contemporaries are alarmed by the plan.

New cycle of attacks?

Marine Lt. Col. Gordon Miller, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, warned this week of “potentially devastating consequences, including a fresh round of chemical weapons attacks and a military response by Israel.”

“If President [Bashar al-Assad] were to absorb the strikes and use chemical weapons again, this would be a significant blow to the United States’ credibility and it would be compelled to escalate the assault on Syria to achieve the original objectives,” Miller wrote in a commentary for the think tank.

A National Security Council spokeswoman said Thursday she would not discuss “internal deliberations.” White House officials reiterated Thursday that the administration is not contemplating a protracted military engagement.

Still, many in the military are skeptical. Getting drawn into the Syrian war, they fear, could distract the Pentagon in the midst of a vexing mission: its exit from Afghanistan, where U.S. troops are still being killed regularly. A young Army officer who is wrapping up a year-long tour there said soldiers were surprised to learn about the looming strike, calling the prospect “very dangerous.”

“I can’t believe the president is even considering it,” said the officer, who like most officers interviewed for this story agreed to speak only on the condition of anonymity because military personnel are reluctant to criticize policymakers while military campaigns are being planned. “We have been fighting the last 10 years a counterinsurgency war. Syria has modern weaponry. We would have to retrain for a conventional war.”

Dempsey’s warning

Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has warned in great detail about the risks and pitfalls of U.S. military intervention in Syria.

“As we weigh our options, we should be able to conclude with some confidence that use of force will move us toward the intended outcome,” Dempsey wrote last month in a letter to the Senate Armed Services Committee. “Once we take action, we should be prepared for what comes next. Deeper involvement is hard to avoid.”

Dempsey has not spoken publicly about the administration’s planned strike on Syria, and it is unclear to what extent his position shifted after last week’s alleged chemical weapons attack. Dempsey said this month in an interview with ABC News that the lessons of Iraq weigh heavily on his calculations regarding Syria.

“It has branded in me the idea that the use of military power must be part of an overall strategic solution that includes international partners and a whole of government,” he said in the Aug. 4 interview. “Simply the application of force rarely produces and, in fact, maybe never produces the outcome we seek.”

The recently retired head of the U.S. Central Command, Gen. James Mattis, said last month at a security conference that the United States has “no moral obligation to do the impossible” in Syria. “If Americans take ownership of this, this is going to be a full-throated, very, very serious war,” said Mattis, who as Centcom chief oversaw planning for a range of U.S. military responses in Syria.

The potential consequences of a U.S. strike include a retaliatory attack by the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah — which supports Assad — on Israel, as well as cyberattacks on U.S. targets and infrastructure, U.S. military officials said.

“What is the political end state we’re trying to achieve?” said a retired senior officer involved in Middle East operational planning who said his concerns are widely shared by active-duty military leaders. “I don’t know what it is. We say it’s not regime change. If it’s punishment, there are other ways to punish.” The former senior officer said that those who are expressing alarm at the risks inherent in the plan “are not being heard other than in a pro-forma manner.”

President Obama said in a PBS interview on Wednesday that he is not contemplating a lengthy engagement, but instead “limited, tailored approaches.”

A retired Central Command officer said the administration’s plan would “gravely disappoint our allies and accomplish little other than to be seen as doing something.”

“It will be seen as a half measure by our allies in the Middle East,” the officer said. “Iran and Syria will portray it as proof that the U.S. is unwilling to defend its interests in the region.”

Still, some within the military, while apprehensive, support striking Syria. W. Andrew Terrill, a Middle East expert at the U.S. Army War College, said the limited history of the use of chemical weapons in the region suggests that a muted response from the West can be dangerous.

“There is a feeling as you look back that if you don’t stand up to chemical weapons, they’re going to take it as a green light and use them on a recurring basis,” he said.

An Army lieutenant colonel said the White House has only bad options but should resist the urge to abort the plan now.

“When a president draws a red line, for better or worse, it’s policy,” he said, referring to Obama’s declaration last year about Syria’s potential use of chemical weapons. “It cannot appear to be scared or tepid. Remember, with respect to policy choices concerning Syria, we are discussing degrees of bad and worse.”"
http://news.yahoo.com/us-runs-resistance-over-strike-syria-214642532--politics.html,,[],US runs into resistance over strike on Syria,"PARIS (AP) — The U.S. tried to rally support on Saturday for a military strike against Syria, running into resistance from the American public and skeptics in Congress and from European allies bent on awaiting a U.N. report about a chemical attack they acknowledge strongly points to the Assad government.

President Barack Obama prepared for a national address Tuesday night as a growing number of lawmakers, including fellow Democrats, opposed the use of force. The American public didn't yet appear persuaded by Obama's argument that action is needed to deter the future use of chemical weapons. Meanwhile, a U.S. official released a DVD compilation of videos showing victims of the Aug. 21 attack near Damascus.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who met with more than two dozen European foreign ministers on Saturday, insisted that international backing to take strong action against Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime was growing, not receding.

Kerry noted that the ministers, who held an informal meeting of the European Union in Vilnius, Lithuania, made powerful statements condemning the attack, and that increasingly there was a sense of conviction that Assad was to blame. Kerry said the U.S. had agreed to provide additional information to those ministers who were not yet convinced that Assad orchestrated the attack.

The EU endorsed a ""clear and strong response"" to a chemical weapons attack but didn't indicate what type of response they were backing. It also said that evidence strongly points to the Syrian government. Still, the EU urged the U.S. to delay possible military action until U.N. inspectors report their findings.

The Europeans were divided on whether military action would be effective. Britain's Parliament has voted against military action. France had been ready to act last week but held off when Obama declared that he would seek the backing of Congress. French President Francois Hollande's announcement appeared to catch French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius off guard.

Story continues

Earlier on Friday, Fabius told EU foreign ministers that there was no need to wait for the U.N. report because it would simply confirm what was already known — that the chemical weapons attack had occurred — but would not say who was responsible.

Hollande indicated Saturday that the U.N. report could be ready in a matter of days, and he would then be prepared to make a decision on a French intervention.

""I said ... that I wanted to wait for the inspectors' report, which I know will be ready within a very reasonable time period, that is, not that far from the decision of the U.S. Congress,"" he told French television after meeting with Lebanese President Michel Suleiman in Nice, France. ""So, at that moment, I'll have all the necessary elements that will let me tell the French people the decision I have made for France.""

However, Martin Nesirky, chief U.N. spokesman, insisted that there would be no preliminary report.

The report on the Aug. 21 attack will be given to the U.N. Security Council and other member states once the lab analysis is complete, Nesirky said.

""We are not saying when that will be, except as soon as feasible,"" he told The Associated Press. ""This is a scientific timeline, not a political timeline.""

Kerry traveled Saturday from Lithuania to Paris to meet with French official and representatives of the Arab League. He joined French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius in hailing the EU statement.

""Some don't believe in taking military action ever at all,"" Kerry said. ""And some want to wait for one thing or another, but the overwhelming support is moving in the direction of holding the Assad regime accountable.""

Kerry added: ""This is growing, not receding in terms of the global sense of outrage of what has happened.""

Fabius said if no action were taken, there would be little hope for a political solution to the crisis.

Obama and other administration officials were preparing a dayslong push to gain public and congressional support for a strike on Syria. Obama himself was to sit down Monday for interviews with a half-dozen broadcast and cable networks.

The challenges they faced were apparent Saturday. Sen. Mark Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat facing a tough bid for a third term, said he would oppose military action, and at least 150 people picketed outside the White House against Obama's request.

Pryor said in a statement that the administration had not met his criteria for gaining his support: a compelling national security interest, a clearly defined mission with a definitive end, and a coalition of allies.

""Unless there's some new information or some new development or circumstance, I just don't see me changing my vote at this point,"" he told The Associated Press in an interview.

Protesters at the White House, chanting ""They say more war; we say no war,"" said their picket line marked a line Congress should not cross as it prepared to vote on the issue. Demonstrations also took place in New York City, Boston and Indianapolis and in Louisiana and Michigan.

In Britain, an anti-regime monitor of the fighting in Syria says it has been compiling a list of the names of the dead from the Aug. 21 attack and that its toll has reached 502. The Obama administration reported 1,429 people died, including 426 children, citing intelligence reports. The Assad government blames opposition forces for the deaths.

""Punishment is not at odds with a political solution,"" Fabius said. ""Bashar Assad will not participate in any negotiation as long as he believes himself to be invincible.""

Saturday's developments left both the U.S. and Europeans in a waiting game.

While the Europeans awaited the U.N. inspection report, the Obama administration waited to see if Congress would back a use of force. Meantime, administration officials continued to lobby lawmakers by phone to vote to authorize a limited military strike against the Assad regime.

The first Senate vote, expected Wednesday, was likely to be on a resolution authorizing the ""limited and specified use"" of U.S. armed forces against Syria for no more than 90 days and barring American ground troops from combat. A final vote in the 100-member chamber was expected at week's end.

A House vote is likely the week of Sept. 16.

Asked about the American public's uneasiness about getting involved in another conflict, Kerry reiterated his view that the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian conflict was a threat to the U.S.

""This case has not yet been made to the American people for more than a few days and we will continue to make the case to the American people,"" Kerry said in Paris. ""This concerns ever American's security.""

The DVD compilation of videos of victims of the gas attack near Damascus was shown to senators during a classified briefing on Thursday, and some of the videos were first broadcast Saturday on CNN. Supporters of the Syrian rebels had posted the videos on YouTube.

Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein of California requested the material from the CIA, and members of her committee watched the videos on Thursday. The DVD is a compilation of footage of victims of the Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack in the suburbs of the Syrian capital of Damasacus that were posted on YouTube by supporters of the Syrian rebels.

The U.S. official, who was granted anonymity to discuss the subject of a classified briefing, said the videos were also referenced in the government's four-page intelligence assessment, released last week, that blamed the Syrian government for the chemical attack.

American military forces are long gone, and Iraqi officials say Washington’s political influence in Baghdad is now virtually nonexistent. Hussein is dead. But Iran has become an indispensable broker among Baghdad’s new Shiite elite, and its influence continues to grow.

The signs are evident in the prominence of pro-Iran militias on the streets, at public celebrations and in the faces of some of those now in the halls of power, men such as Abu Mehdi Mohandis, an Iraqi with a long history of anti-American activity and deep ties to Iran.

During the occupation, U.S. officials accused Mohandis of arranging a supply of Iranian-made bombs to be used against U.S. troops. But now Iraqi officials say Mohandis speaks for Iran here, and Prime Minister Nouri Maliki recently entrusted him with a sensitive domestic political mission.

Iran’s role reinforces its strategic position at a time when the world looks increasingly hostile to Tehran, the capital. It faces tough international sanctions for its disputed nuclear program and fears losing longtime ally Syria to an insurgency backed by regional Sunni Muslim rivals.

Western diplomats and Iraqi politicians say they are concerned that the Islamic Republic will be tempted to use proxies in Iraq to strike at its enemies, as it has done with Lebanon-based Hezbollah.

American officials say they remain vital players in Iraq and have worked to defuse tension between Maliki and his foes.

During a visit to Baghdad on Sunday, however, Secretary of State John F. Kerry was unable to persuade Maliki to stop Iranian flights crossing Iraqi airspace to Syria. The U.S. charges that Iranian weapons shipments are key to propping up Syrian President Bashar Assad; Maliki says there is no proof that Tehran is sending anything besides humanitarian aid. Kerry’s visit was the first by a U.S. Cabinet official in more than a year.

Overall, Iraqi officials and analysts say, Washington has pursued a policy of near-total disengagement, with policy decisions largely relegated to the embassy in Baghdad. Some tribal leaders complain that the Americans have not contacted them since U.S. troops left in late 2011.

Iraq’s political atmosphere has deteriorated. Maliki has ordered the arrest of his former finance minister, a Sunni. Disputes in the north between the central government and leaders of the semiautonomous Kurdish region are unresolved.

“The Americans have no role. Nobody listens to them. They lost their power in this country,” said Deputy Prime Minister Saleh Mutlaq, a Sunni, commenting on the disappearance of the Americans as a broker for most of Iraq’s disputes.

The vacuum has been filled in large part by Iran and by Iraq’s Sunni neighbors, each intent on wielding maximum influence in a country that stands as a buffer between Shiite Iran and the largely Sunni Middle East.

“At the moment, Iran has something akin to veto power in Iraq, in that Maliki is careful not to take decisions that might alienate Iran,” said Karim Sadjadpour, an expert on Iran with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

An Iraqi Shiite politician who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject, described Iran’s objectives this way: “Controlled instability in Iraq and a submissive or sympathetic Islamist Shia government in accord with Iran’s regional interests, most importantly regarding Syria.”

Maliki turned to Shiite Islamist parties and figures tied to Iran to stay in power after a close election in 2010. He has fended off challenges since then with the support of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who fears the expansion of Sunni power if Syria or Iraq collapses. Maliki has convinced the Iranians that he is the only one who can hold his country together, according to Iraqi politicians.

Iran has forcefully backed quasi-political and military groups in Iraq such as the Badr Organization, Khitab Hezbollah and Asaib al Haq, and encouraged them to support Maliki.

The Badr Organization was funded and trained by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard in the 1980s to fight Hussein. Both Khitab Hezbollah and Asaib al Haq have professed their admiration for Khamenei while declaring their ambition to transform themselves into political and social movements.

Leading Iraqi Shiite officials describe the emergence of such overtly pro-Iran groups as a healthy development after the U.S. military withdrawal.

“These imitators of Khamenei and before that [Ayatollah Ruhollah] Khomeini were in hiding. Now they have become public and known,” said Sheik Hamam Hamoudi, a Shiite member of parliament and a longtime resident of Iran before the U.S. toppled Hussein.

At a gathering last month at a sports club, members of Khitab Hezbollah greeted enthusiastic visitors under a portrait of Khamenei and banners showing a fist clenching a black Kalashnikov rifle rising from a map of the Middle East. Guests received a book, graced by a portrait of Khamenei, that describes a war pitting Iran and its allies against the West.

Mohandis, said to secretly head the militia, first rose up against Hussein in the late 1970s. Facing arrest, he moved to Kuwait. A court there later convicted him in absentia of taking part in the bombing of the U.S. and French embassies in 1983.

Mohandis fled to Iran, where he joined the Badr Organization, and he now heads its political bureau in Baghdad. He returned to Iraq after the U.S.-led invasion and was elected to parliament under his birth name, Jamal Jaffar. He fled again when the Americans were alerted to his true identity. In 2009, the Treasury Department labeled him a threat to Iraq’s security.

But after the last U.S. troops withdrew in December 2011, he came back.

During the interim, Iraqi officials say, he cultivated a close relationship with Qassem Suleimani, the head of Iran’s Quds Force, which is responsible for Iran’s relations with Iraq. For any Iraqi official or politician visiting Tehran, Mohandis accompanied Iran’s spy chief to the meetings.

Advertisement

In a show of his new prominence, Mohandis was dispatched by Maliki with three senior members of his Dawa Party members to Iraqi Kurdistan last month.

According to those with knowledge of the meeting, Mohandis was sent to try to smooth over a dispute regarding rights to oil-rich Kirkuk and other territory in the north. Mohandis argued for an alliance between the Kurds and Shiites, given regional instability and ongoing Sunni protests in Iraq.

“Mohandis is Iran’s Iraqi emissary or messenger,” said a senior Iraqi official, who insisted on anonymity because of the topic’s delicacy. “When he is in a meeting, people know he speaks for the Quds Force and Suleimani. He speaks for them more than the Iranian Embassy.”

Another enforcer of Iranian interests has been Hadi Amri, a hardened militia veteran whom Maliki appointed to the post of transportation minister. In the dispute over Iranian overflights to Syria, Amri and Maliki have ignored U.S. requests to inspect Iranian planes.

Advertisement

The Asaib al Haq militia was blamed for the killing of five U.S. soldiers in 2007 and the abduction of five Britons, four of whom were killed. Sunni Arabs also blame it for some of the worst attacks on their community during Iraq’s sectarian warfare.

The Americans jailed the militia’s leader, Qais Khazali, but Maliki pushed for him to be transferred to Iraqi custody and join the political process as an alternative to more fundamentalist Shiite groups.

Since his release, Khazali has emerged as a Shiite fundamentalist political force funded, according to his foes and other Iraqi politicians, by Iran. He has organized offices across the country with the aim of recruiting prominent individuals and communities to his cause.

Interim mayor took over from ex-mayor who resigned amid corruption allegations

Charges against interim Mayor Michael Appelbaum stem from real estate projects

Applebaum has repeatedly denied that he did anything wrong

MONTREAL (AP) — Montreal's interim mayor, who vowed to clean up the corruption scandals rocking the city, now faces fraud charges himself.

Michael Applebaum faces 14 charges, including defrauding the government and corruption in municipal affairs. He was arrested at his home early Monday.

Applebaum took over as interim mayor of Canada's second-largest city last November, after former mayor Gerald Tremblay resigned amid corruption allegations.

""The corruption and collusion will no longer be tolerated,"" Robert Lafreniere, the head of Quebec's anti-corruption unit, told a news conference Monday.

""No one is above the law and you cannot hide from the law.""

Applebaum, 50, is the latest in a long list of Quebec politicians and businesses to come under scrutiny in recent months.

The province is enduring a high-profile public inquiry that has uncovered links between the construction industry and organized crime.

The charges against Applebaum stem from alleged acts that occurred before he became mayor. While officials offered few details, they said the charges relate to real estate projects between 2006 and 2011, when he served as borough mayor.

Now, local politicians and Quebec's provincial government are calling on Applebaum to step down.

Jean-François Lisee, the provincial cabinet minister responsible for the city, told reporters Monday Applebaum should do ""the responsible thing"" for the good of the city.

Denis Coderre, a longtime federal politician and a mayoral candidate in the fall election, said Montrealers shouldn't get too discouraged.

""The rotten apples, they'll be taken out,"" he told reporters. ""But we can't put everyone in the same basket.""

Applebaum had promised not to run in the upcoming election, slated for this November. But his appointment was enough to make history: he became the first Anglophone mayor of the city in exactly 100 years.

Signs of trouble arrived soon afterward.

Anti-corruption officials raided City Hall last February. They also targeted offices in various boroughs, including the one Applebaum represented for many years.

Applebaum has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

His arrest comes just a month after Gilles Vaillancourt, the former longtime mayor of neighboring Laval, was arrested on corruption charges.

The provincial police allege that Vaillancourt's city government was essentially a criminal organization, with officials there allegedly enriching themselves off local construction deals.

The situation was so bad that the Quebec government placed Laval under trusteeship.

Quebec Premier Pauline Marois said that step won't be required in Montreal.

Responding to a reporter's question about whether Applebaum should step down, Marois said ""I don't think he really has a choice.""

Danielle Pilette, a political scientist at the Universite de Quebec a Montreal, said Applebaum's arrest is further evidence of how deep the city's corruption problem goes.

""It shows that these corruption allegations are not only in the outer suburbs, as we've seen before, but also in the heart of the city,"" Pilette said, referring to Applebaum's central borough of Cote-des-Neiges-NDG.

In the neighboring province of Ontario, Toronto Mayor Rob Ford is embroiled is his own scandal, amid allegations that the leader of Canada's largest city appeared in a video smoking crack cocaine. The video has not been released publicly."

He Previously Covered South Asia Mumbai', 'India', 'National Security The Washington Bureau.']",U.S. toll for Syria higher than others’,"The death toll given by the Obama administration for an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack is far higher than confirmed counts of two key allies and a main activist group, which said it was shocked by the U.S. figure.

In pressing Congress to authorize a military strike against Syria, the administration has asserted that the government of President Bashar Assad killed 1,429 people, including at least 426 children, in an Aug. 21 attack on the suburbs of Damascus.

But Britain and France have cited far lower numbers of confirmed deaths, raising questions about the intelligence the White House is using to make its case to launch missile strikes against Syria.

U.S. officials say they can’t disclose how they derived their figure without compromising intelligence, but they say it is based on a variety of sources and they stand by it.

British intelligence organizations said last week that they believed at least 350 people had been killed. French intelligence said Monday that it had confirmed at least 281 deaths through open-source videos, although its experts had created models that were consistent with as many as 1,500 deaths.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, generally regarded as one of the most reliable sources of information on casualty figures in Syria, says it has confirmed 502 deaths, including 80 children and 137 women. Rami Abdul-Rahman, a Syrian expatriate who runs the organization from his home in Britain, said he was shocked by the White House’s count.

“I don’t know where this number came from,” Abdul-Rahman said in a phone interview.

He said some Syrian opposition groups disseminate propaganda and exaggerated death tolls in an attempt to sway American politicians.

“The U.S. took this high number from one part of the Syrian opposition that is supported by the U.S. government,” Abdul-Rahman said. “We don’t trust them.”

U.S. intelligence officials said they didn’t base their assessment on reports from any single opposition group.

Adding to the confusion, a day after Secretary of State John F. Kerry said that “the United States government now knows that at least 1,429 Syrians were killed in this attack,” President Obama on Saturday only referred to “well over 1,000"" fatalities.

Kerry didn’t cite any casualty figures in his testimony Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. And according to an official familiar with a formal intelligence assessment sent to Congress, the document did not include those figures.

The casualty figures are important because the administration is resting its case for military action in part on the scale of the attack. A senior administration official said a previous use of chemical weapons by Assad’s military caused “100 to 150"" casualties, which prompted the Obama administration to offer lethal aid to Syrian rebels, but not to contemplate direct military action.

“This is a much larger scale of use,” the official said Friday. “It’s indiscriminate.”

U.S. intelligence officials said Tuesday that foreign intelligence agencies use different methods and resources and often arrive at different casualty counts. A British official in Washington said the British estimate was lower because it was released a few days before the American one.

Shawn Turner, a spokesman for the U.S. director of national intelligence, said, “The information that led to our understanding of the scale of the attack came from a number of sources, including international and Syrian medical personnel, videos, witness accounts and social media reports.

Advertisement

“We’ve said from the beginning that our estimates were preliminary and that we expect to update the number as we obtain more information,” he said.

A senior administration official, who would not be quoted by name discussing classified intelligence, said that Obama was not signaling any retreat from the higher figure and that officials believed the death toll could even go beyond 1,429.

A second official said, “The president has no intelligence reason to walk back from that number.”

The precision of the U.S. figure, given the initial confusion surrounding the attack and the often contradictory reports of the violence in Syria, also raised questions among some observers.

Anthony Cordesman, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote Monday that the U.S. estimate was “absurdly over-precise” and that Obama’s language created “a mix of contradictions over the most basic facts.”

Syria’s political and military opposition is severely fragmented. The U.S. figure more closely matches reports by pro-opposition organizations such as the Local Coordination Committees and the United Revolutionary Medical Office in eastern Ghouta, a Damascus suburb hit by the alleged chemical attack.

The latter group said it had documented at least 1,302 deaths, about two-thirds of which were women and children. That figure was cited by the U.S.-based Syrian Support Group, which has a federal license to funnel aid to Syrian rebels.

Story highlights NEW: Centrist candidate Rouhani is top vote-getter in very early results State media reports about 70% voter turnout in a nation of 50 million eligible voters If no candidate gets a majority, there will be a runoff next week The last election resulted in bloody street protests known as the ""Green Movement""

(CNN) —

The lines extended into the streets at times Friday, as voters waited to pick their choice to succeed two-term President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the country’s 11th presidential election.

Some 70% of some 50 million registered voters – men and women, young and old – turned out according to state broadcaster Press TV, to pick a man who’ll deal with high-stakes challenges domestically and internationally.

And now the results are starting to trickle in.

Based on two sets of still very early results, centrist candidate Hassan Rouhani had more votes than any other candidate, Interior Ministry officials said early Saturday.

As of about 7:15 a.m. Saturday (10:45 p.m. ET Friday), Rouhani had 834,859 votes; Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf had 320,562; Saeed Jalili had 257,822; Mohsen Rezaei had 214,368; Ali-Akbar Velayati had 106,144; and Mohammad Gharazi had 25,324.

Even counted cumulatively, these votes represented a small fraction of the total vote. If the 70% turnout figure is correct, there would be about 35 million votes; the early results reflect about 1.76 million.

When the final tally does come in, that doesn’t necessarily mean the election is over. If no single candidate gets more than half the vote, the top two finishers will face off in a runoff next Friday, June 21.

That victor will take Ahmadinejad’s mantle as one of the most visible figures, at a time it’s dealing with widespread sanctions tied to international anger over its nuclear program.

But he won’t be Iran’s most powerful man. That distinction belongs to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has been Iran’s supreme leader since 1989. He’s got plenty of backing, from conservative citizens to loyalist militia groups to, most notably, the Revolutionary Guard.

Earlier, British Prime Minister David Cameron told CNN’s Richard Quest that the international community “will have to deal with whatever the situation is.”

Powerful support

It was Iran’s Guardian Council, an unelected body made up of six clerics and six lawyers operating under the oversight of the supreme leader, that drew up the restricted list of candidates from the 680 who initially registered.

The final six contenders didn’t include any women. Nor did they include Ahmadinejad’s aide and protege Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, who was among those excluded by the Guardian Council.

Velayati, Ghalibaf and Jalili, who is Iran’s chief nuclear negotiator, are considered close to Khamenei and would be unlikely to challenge his authority. Of the three, Jalili has seen the most popular support going into the vote.

Rouhani had the backing of the highly influential former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and appears to have won over parts of Iran’s subdued reform movement.

Hours into the voting Friday, Rouhani complained of a voting irregularity. A reform candidate, Mohammed Aref, who dropped out of the race earlier in the week, was still on some ballots.

Rouhani was worried that voters might mistakenly select Aref, which would amount to a vote thrown away. It was not clear how many ballot papers were concerned.

CNN’s view on the streets of Tehran

Iran’s semi-official Mehr News reported via Twitter that voting lines got longer in the afternoon, and that there were insufficient voting slips in some polling stations.

CNN’s Erin Burnett on 2013 vs. 2009 elections

2009 chaos

Four years ago, when allegations of election fraud sparked widespread protests, Iran’s police and the Basij, a feared paramilitary group, cracked down on the opposition Green Movement.

Protesters were jailed, and human rights groups alleged many were tortured and killed behind bars while the government quashed the uprising.

Reform politicians representing the movement, including Ahmadinejad’s election rival, former Prime Minister Mir Hossein Moussavi, have been under house arrest since 2011.

Despite the unrest, Ahmadinejad’s re-election was formally certified by the clerical establishment.

Since his reelection, conservative politicians close to the supreme leader have assailed Ahmadinejad for being too liberal, and he has often been at odds with Khamenei.

Some of Ahmadinejad’s associates have faced heavy repression, and hardliners attempted to link the president to the largest embezzlement case in the country’s history.

Ahead of the vote this time round, campaigning was more muted although Khamenei’s office repeated his call to the ballot boxes Friday with posts on social networking site Twitter.

“I humbly expect from our nation to participate all in #IranElection & do this as soon as possible,” the supreme leader’s post said.

Voting is not mandatory in Iran, but there are major incentives to push people to the polls. An active voter has a better shot at promotions in the workplace and preference when it comes to collecting social welfare benefits.

This can be vital in an economy that is chronically weighed down by international sanctions over nuclear concerns.

Khamenei also tweeted a jab at the United States, which has often led the charge to tighten those sanctions.

“I have heard that #USpoliticians said they don’t recognize #IranianElection. Hell with their recognition!” he said.

Clampdown on dissent?

Rights group Amnesty International said this week that it was “concerned by evidence that the Iranian authorities are intensifying their clampdown on dissent” in the run-up to the vote.

“Those targeted include political activists, journalists and other media workers, trade unionists, advocates of greater rights for Iran’s religious and ethnic minorities, students and others. In many cases, the full reasons for arrest and detention are not known; in others, those arrested have been brought before the courts on sweeping but vaguely worded charges, convicted and sentenced to prison terms,” it said.

The head of language services for BBC World Service, Liliane Landor, also complained Thursday of “unacceptable harassment” of its staff and other independent journalists in Iran.

“The BBC is very concerned by the unprecedented levels of intimidation being suffered by families of BBC Persian Service staff living in Iran in the final days of the presidential election campaign,” she said.

“The harassment has included threats that relatives will lose jobs and pensions and be prevented from traveling abroad. For the first time the lives of BBC Persian TV staff living in the UK have also been threatened.”

Iran’s Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance, Mohammad Hosseini, said more than 2,000 local reporters and 450 foreign journalists were covering the election in Iran.

The head of the Foreign Reporters Bureau within the ministry, Alireza Shirvani, said the number of foreign reporters covering the presidential election had increased by about 15% compared with four years ago.

It is now up to Egypt’s government — and its opponents — to create the political and economic consensus that can leverage the American money to turn around their failing state.

Secretary of State John Kerry, who announced the aid in Cairo on Sunday, made clear that the responsibility for finding common ground falls first on President Mohamed Morsi. Mr. Morsi’s job is to persuade the political opposition to join him in a suite of economic reforms that would raise taxes, trim energy subsidies and pave the way for a much larger $4.8 billion loan package from the International Monetary Fund. The I.M.F. loan, in turn, would open the door to even more aid and investment from financial institutions and other countries.

Cooperation is also required of the opposition. Egypt desperately needs strong democratic institutions and a more robust economy to right itself and move toward a better future. Instead, the various combatants have settled into a pattern of recurring political and economic crises, betraying the revolution that overthrew the dictator Hosni Mubarak. The latest setback occurred last week when the main opposition group, the National Salvation Front, warned that it would boycott parliamentary elections scheduled for late April because Mr. Morsi’s Islamist-led government had failed to guarantee that the vote would be free and fair.

Their concerns are legitimate. Instead of working toward an inclusive government, Mr. Morsi and his party have consolidated power, rushed through a flawed, bitterly contested Constitution, failed to reform a corrupt police force, and proposed a new law that will severely limit the right to peaceful assembly and encourage further police abuse. Yet the opposition itself has not offered a coherent alternative that could challenge the Muslim Brotherhood at the ballot box. And boycotting the parliamentary elections seems self-defeating."

THE graying man flashing fury in the Rose Garden on behalf of the Newtown families, the grieving man wiping away tears after speaking at the Boston memorial service, is not the same man who glided into office four years ago.

President Obama has watched the blood-dimmed tide drowning the ceremony of innocence, as Yeats wrote, and he has learned how to emotionally connect with Americans in searing moments, as he did from the White House late Friday night after the second bombing suspect was apprehended in Boston.

Unfortunately, he still has not learned how to govern.

How is it that the president won the argument on gun safety with the public and lost the vote in the Senate? It’s because he doesn’t know how to work the system. And it’s clear now that he doesn’t want to learn, or to even hire some clever people who can tell him how to do it or do it for him.

It’s unbelievable that with 90 percent of Americans on his side, he could get only 54 votes in the Senate. It was a glaring example of his weakness in using leverage to get what he wants. No one on Capitol Hill is scared of him."

Well, it’s not looking good. Mr. Monti’s party appears likely to come in fourth; not only is he running well behind the essentially comical Silvio Berlusconi, he’s running behind an actual comedian, Beppe Grillo, whose lack of a coherent platform hasn’t stopped him from becoming a powerful political force.

It’s an extraordinary prospect, and one that has sparked much commentary about Italian political culture. But without trying to defend the politics of bunga bunga, let me ask the obvious question: What good, exactly, has what currently passes for mature realism done in Italy or for that matter Europe as a whole?

For Mr. Monti was, in effect, the proconsul installed by Germany to enforce fiscal austerity on an already ailing economy; willingness to pursue austerity without limit is what defines respectability in European policy circles. This would be fine if austerity policies actually worked — but they don’t. And far from seeming either mature or realistic, the advocates of austerity are sounding increasingly petulant and delusional."

But there is something else that goes without saying, but still needs to be said loudly: We, America, are not just hired lawyers negotiating a deal for Israel and the Sunni Gulf Arabs, which they alone get the final say on. We, America, have our own interests in not only seeing Iran’s nuclear weapons capability curtailed, but in ending the 34-year-old Iran-U.S. cold war, which has harmed our interests and those of our Israeli and Arab friends.

Hence, we must not be reluctant about articulating and asserting our interests in the face of Israeli and Arab efforts to block a deal that we think would be good for us and them. America’s interests today lie in an airtight interim nuclear deal with Iran that also opens the way for addressing a whole set of other issues between Washington and Tehran.

Some of our allies don’t share those “other” interests and believe the only acceptable outcome is bombing Iran’s nuclear facilities and keeping Iran an isolated, weak, pariah state. They don’t trust this Iranian regime — and not without reason. I don’t begrudge their skepticism. Without pressure from Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and the global sanctions on Iran they helped to spur, Iran would not be offering to scale back its nuclear program today."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/01/21/Why-Bibi-Is-Not-Intimidated-by-Obama,2013-01-21 00:00:00,['Shmuley Boteach'],Why Bibi Is Not Intimidated by Obama,"I’m sure Jeffrey Goldberg got it right. Whatever the reason the President leaked his unhappiness with Bibi to Goldberg just a few days before the Israeli election–whether in an effort to influence the vote against Bibi, serve payback to Bibi for a perceived preference for Romney, or because the President could simply no longer suppress his dissatisfaction–it must indeed be unnerving to be the most powerful man on earth and have the elected leader of a tiny Middle Eastern country defy you. Especially when that country, in your opinion, owes you so much!

You are their only reliable friend who watches helplessly as that little nation continues to isolate itself through its self-destructive policies. According to Goldberg, Obama has “become inured to what he sees as self-defeating policies of his Israeli counterpart…Obama said privately and repeatedly, “Israel doesn’t know what its own best interests are… Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation.”

If only Israel would recognize the President’s genius. If only it would stop building in Jerusalem and E1 and allow the President to sprinkle his magic peace dust, then Hamas would beat its rockets into ploughshares and Hezbollah would turn its bombs into pruning hooks. But no. Ungrateful to the last, Bibi insists on disobeying the President and claiming all of Jerusalem as Israel’s undivided capitol.

No doubt the President is likewise mystified at the Israeli people as well. How could the polls show that they will this week re-elect the intransigent Prime Minister who is doing so much to harm their country? The most powerful man on earth is reduced to watching from the sidelines and complaining to journalists that he knows how to protect Israel far better than the Israelis themselves.

Such an ungrateful nation.

And yet, perhaps the Israelis have finally figured out that they are a sovereign people whom, while immensely grateful to America for its friendship and support, are still best qualified to judge their security needs better than anyone else. Perhaps they have come to understand that another Democratic president named Bill Clinton, whom noone would argue has a sincere love of the Jewish people and a Jewish son-in-law, still pushed Israel into the Oslo agreements that left a thousand Israeli civilians blown to bits. Perhaps they have come to understand that if Chuck Hagel, President Obama’s nominee for Secretary of Defense, was correct that, as a legislator from Nebraska he was “not an Israeli senator. I’m a United States senator,” then the Prime Minister of Israel is the likewise the leader of the Jewish state who must put the security of the Israeli people even before a nod of approval from the President of the United States.

Over the past four years Bibi has grown into one of Israel’s greatest ever leaders. The country is booming economically and in terms of security. Cranes dot the skyline of expanding Israeli cities, terror incidents are negligible compared to the Clinton era, and unlike the anemic American economy, Israel is humming along at about four percent annual growth. And if President Obama is right that, in spite of this prosperity, Israel is isolated in world opinion, then it is arguably no more so than it has been in the past, and, besides, what is better, a popular Israel riddled with dead Jews or an unpopular Israel filled with living ones?

But what President Obama does not understand about Netanyahu is that the inflexibility he accuses him of is born not of a narrow-minded obstinacy but rather of a confident Jewish pride and deep-seated conviction that has been Bibi’s lifelong hallmark.

In my desire in 1990 to launch a robust response to anti-Israel speeches at the Oxford Union, I booked Netanyahu to lecture at the University. Bibi, just 41 years old, had already electrified the world as Israel’s most capable defender at the UN. Bibi agreed to come with a single stipulation: “If I’m already making the trip, then work me like a horse.”

We obliged.

We picked him up in a special branch police car and as we drove through the grandeur of Oxford’s ancient center, he commented on the majesty of British academia and its incongruence with some of the petty anti-Israel sentiment that is often expressed within its halls. Arriving at St. Antony’s College for a private forum with Oxford Middle East experts, Bibi put one foot on a chair and for the next 90 minutes held forth on the justice of Israel’s cause, surrounded as it was by nation’s sworn to its destruction. As he finished, the attacks came in fast and furious in what had to be one of the most hostile audiences he ever addressed. He did not blink, he did not flinch, he did not bend. When the last question ended, he turned to me to ask what next. After two more speeches, we took him to my home where we had arranged a dinner with Rhodes Scholars, many of them Jewish, most critical of Israeli policy. This time Bibi was softer in presentation but just as firm in conviction. Israel was a righteous nation, focused on maintaining democracy and human rights while facing existential threats on nearly every border. He spoke to the students of their responsibility to be proud defenders of their people and never bend in the face of opposition. The climax of the day was a lecture at the Union itself. Palestinian and Jewish protesters rallied outside in their hundreds with the rallying cry: “Net-an-ya-hu you should know, we support the P-L-O.” Bibi left his security bubble and walked over to the protesters. “Come inside and listen. Then you can protest. I’ll answer every question you ask.”

Many left their barricades and joined the large crowd inside. What followed was one of the great speeches I have heard, a mesmerizing presentation of the need for democracy across the Middle East and the liberalization of Arab governments that deny their citizens their God-given human rights. At its high point Bibi said, “Many of us in Israel have buried children and lost brothers, in fulfillment of a simple dream for Jews to finally live and prosper in a country of their own in peace.” He did not have to mention whom he was referring to as even his detractors knew of Entebbe and the hero-brother he had lost.

Again he was bombarded with hostile questions. He responded patiently but forcefully. When he finished he was given a standing ovation by most of the students in the hall. It was a night few of us would forget.

No Israeli Prime Minister has ever been as American as Bibi. And yet no Prime Minister has so successfully resisted the pressure from the leader of a country he loves so much for a country he loves even more. And the Israeli people, in supporting Bibi regardless of the absence of a stamp of approval from President Obama, are finally realizing that Israel cannot ultimately be protected from Washington but Jerusalem, especially when the current American Administration is not in step with the strong sympathy of the American people for a tiny and just nation fighting for its life.

White House has said it%27s likely chemical weapons were used

Israeli officials confirm airstrike on Syria

So far%2C the U.S. has limited aid to humanitarian purposes

President Obama said on Friday he does not foresee a situation in which deploying U.S. troops to Syria would be helpful.

""As a general rule, I don't rule things out as commander in chief, because circumstances change,"" Obama told reporters during his visit to Costa Rica on Friday. ""Having said that I do not foresee a scenario in which boots on the ground in Syria — American boots on the ground in Syria — would be good for America but would also be good for Syria.""

Obama's comments come a little more than a week after the White House said it is very likely that Syrian President Bashar Assad had used chemical weapons against his people. The president had previously set use or transfer of chemical weapons by Assad as a ""red line"" that would elicit an unspecified response from the Obama administration.

Obama, however, has cautioned that more proof is needed before the United States escalates its involvement in Syria.

The two-year conflict in Syria has left more than 70,000 dead, according to U.N. estimates. While the U.S. has provided tens of millions of dollars in humanitarian aid to rebel groups, the Obama administration has thus far resisted arming the resistance.

""In terms of any additional steps we take, it's going to be based number one on the facts on the ground, number two what's in the interest of the American people and our national security,"" Obama said. ""As president of the United States, I am going to make those decisions based on the best evidence and after careful consultation. Because when we rush into things, when we leap before we look, then not only do we pay a price, but we often also see unintended consequences on the ground. It's important for us to do it right and that's exactly what we're doing right now.""

Late Friday, U.S. officials told the Associated Press that Israel launched an airstrike into Syria. The airstrike, first reported by CNN, came hours before Obama's news conference in Costa Rica.

It did not appear that a chemical weapons site was targeted, and one official said the strike appeared to have hit a warehouse.

Israeli officials confirmed the airstrike on Syria hours later, according to AP, saying it targeted a shipment of advanced missiles.

""Israel is determined to prevent the transfer of chemical weapons or other game-changing weaponry by the Syrian regime to terrorists, specially to Hezbollah in Lebanon,"" Israeli Embassy spokesman Aaron Sagui said in an e-mail to the AP late Friday.

Loiko Has Covered Wars', 'Crises', 'Daily Life In Russia', 'The Former Soviet States For The Los Angeles Times Since']",Kremlin: Edward Snowden revokes request for Russian asylum,"MOSCOW -- Edward Snowden has withdrawn an application for asylum in Russia, apparently deciding that he couldn’t abide by President Vladimir Putin’s insistence that he stop leaking U.S. secrets, a Kremlin spokesman said Tuesday.

“True, Snowden did voice a request [to be allowed] to stay in Russia,” presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. “At the same time, having found out yesterday about Russia’s position outlined by President Putin ... he rejected his intention and his request to get a chance to stay in Russia.”

The Kremlin spokesman reiterated Putin’s position, announced Monday, that the former U.S. National Security Agency contractor must stop activities “aimed at damaging our American partners” if he wanted to be granted asylum in Russia.

“As far as we know he is not going to give those up,” Peskov said.

Putin also said that, regardless of Snowden’s application, Russia would not turn him over to U.S. authorities for prosecution.

According to the WikiLeaks organization, which is helping Snowden, the fugitive has applied for asylum in 20 other countries. Among them, according to WikiLeaks, is Venezuela, whose president, Nicolas Maduro, was wrapping up a two-day visit to Moscow on Tuesday. There has been speculation that Maduro might allow Snowden to accompany him back to Caracas.

However, Maduro told reporters that he was not aware of an asylum request. He said that instead of taking Snowden home with him, he would return to Venezuela with “numerous agreements related to investments in the oil and gas sphere.”

At the same time Maduro -- a persistent critic of the United States who has inherited the mantle of the late President Hugo Chavez -- praised Snowden for telling “the big truth to prevent wars.”

The other countries listed by WikiLeaks were: Austria, Bolivia, Brazil, China, Cuba, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, India, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, Norway, Poland, Spain and Switzerland.

Most of those countries have extradition agreements with the United States.

Leonid Kalashnikov, deputy head of the foreign relations committee of the lower house of Russia’s parliament, said that Putin, like his counterpart in Ecuador, doesn’t want to quarrel with the United States over Snowden.

“The way the Kremlin presents it, Putin wants to save face before the nations by not bowing to the United States. But at the same time, he doesn’t want to sacrifice what positive aspects still remain in U.S.–Russian relations over the fugitive,” Kalashnikov said. “I am very sorry for Snowden, who keeps being rejected by the countries he was counting on for protection.”

“His situation is dire but not hopeless, as the Kremlin will now do its best to find a safe place for him in a third country,” Kalashnikov added. “The Kremlin can’t afford to risk Snowden being intercepted by the United States in the process, because then Moscow will discredit itself in the eyes of the rest of the world.”

http://ph.news.yahoo.com/-bejeweled--keeps-enrile-busy-amid-senate-inquiry-080615383.html,,[],'Bejeweled' keeps Enrile busy amid Senate inquiry,"What's keeping Senator Juan Ponce Enrile busy since he resigned from his post as Senate President?



Well, Enrile's new position as Senate minority leader has obviously given him more time to do the things he could not afford to do when he was still busy leading the Senate in the 15th Congress.



On Wednesday, the Senate minority leader was seen enjoying a popular game, Bejeweled, on his tablet while waiting for his turn to speak before the Senate committee hearing.



Observers from the Senate saw how Bejeweled entertained Enrile, who had to wait long for his colleague Senator Jose ""Jinggoy"" to finish asking questions about the sex-for-flight scandals in the Middle East.



""I'm now at Level 271,"" a grinning Enrile later admitted in an interview.



Enrile explained he enjoys playing Bejeweled more than playing Candy Crush because he doesn't like eating candies. He also confessed he was not into computer games when he was still Senate President.

""It was only during the campaign when I started (playing),"" he told reporters.



During the United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) last summer, Enrile said he found time to tinker with his iPad.



And yes, he is convinced that games like Bejeweled are effective mind exercises.



""My former secretary at the law office downloaded this game on my iPad,"" the veteran lawmaker said



""I like it because it exercises my mind. And it challenges me to know how fast I can solve one level,"" he added.

Senator Teofisto ""TG"" Guingona led the Senate probe on the issue as chair of Senate committee on blue ribbon.



Enrile attended the Senate's first hearing on sex-for-flight scandal, which implicated Philippine Labor Attache Adam Musa.



And it seemed like playing Bejeweled inspired Enrile to grill Musa for his alleged shortcomings in handling the case of an abused Filipina worker while she was still working in Saudi.



During the Senate inquiry, Enrile said Musa failed to meet his duty to protect the welfare of overseas Filipino workers.



The Filipina worker sought help from Musa after she reported that her employer sexually abused her. After quitting her job, Musa's office took the Filipina in to work as a janitress.



The worker then accused Musa's driver of trying to rape her, another case that should have been properly investigated if only the Philippine labor official did not allow his staff to immediately settle by paying financial damages.



The settlement of the case, Enrile pointed out, also prevented Musa to look into the woman's first complaint of abuse against her previous employer in Saudi.

(CNN) —

President Barack Obama flies across the Atlantic on Wednesday for a trip that takes him to Senegal, South Africa and Tanzania, his second visit to sub-Saharan Africa since taking office.

The trip aims to bolster investment opportunities for U.S. businesses, address development issues such as food security and health, and promote democracy.

It comes as China aggressively engages the continent. The Asian nation is pouring billions of dollars into Africa, running oil and mining firms, and replaced the United States in 2009 as the largest trading partner.

Obama’s predecessor, George W. Bush, will be in Africa at the same time.

Bush has made multiple visits to Africa since leaving office, and will be in Zambia next week, where he’s working with his global health initiative to renovate a cervical cancer screening and treatment center.

While the 44th and 43rd president are not scheduled to meet, first lady Michelle Obama and her predecessor, Laura Bush, will attend the African First Ladies Summit in Tanzania on July 2.

Obama’s trip is being overshadowed by the declining health of South Africa’s revered former president, Nelson Mandela, who is in critical condition at a Pretoria hospital.

Mandela, who emerged from prison after 27 years to lead South Africa out of its dark days of apartheid, is considered the father of modern day South Africa.

Obama will be in Senegal Thursday and Friday. He arrives in South Africa on Saturday, where he will spend the weekend taking part in a host of activities, including meeting with the nation’s leaders and visiting Robben Island, where Mandela spent a majority of his prison term.

He will spend Monday and Tuesday in Tanzania, and is expected back in Washington on July 3.

The president made a brief trip to Ghana during his first term in July 2009.

Sarah Palin for taking TODAY show host Matt Lauer “to the cleaners” Monday by refusing to buy progressive media’s talking points about Americans losing insurance and Republicans needing to appeal more to moderates than their base to win elections.

Regarding the five percent of Americans that the White House conceded were losing their health insurance plans after President Barack Obama had promised that would not happen under Obamacare, Limbaugh said these were merely just the “first wave of cancellations,” and eventually Obamacare will impact “everybody,” because all of the plans will eventually not qualify “by design.”

“Where do you get this five percent?” Palin asked Lauer.

It’s not five percent. It’s most Americans will not be able to keep the healthcare policy and programs that they had desired. The new programs that are being forced down our throat are unaffordable. Some of them are still being told, “Well if you like that insurance policy and that coverage, you still will be able to keep it, it’s just going to cost you a little bit more.” That’s the point. If it’s going to cost you more, then it’s not the same policy.

Limbaugh praised Palin for her response and then said she took Lauer “to the cleaners” for also calling him out on the misguided “trick” the mainstream media always use on Republicans to get them to nominate candidates who will lose in the general election.

“Remember that old saw what the Democrat consultants always used to tell the Republicans and they would believe it?,” Limbaugh said. “The Republican Party gets tricked so easily. They get tricked into not criticizing Obama, they get tricked into not being for what they should be for, and they even get tricked into campaigning for only 20% of the vote.”

Limbaugh blasted consultants for turning candidates “into squishy, linguini-spined moderates, on the theory that’s how you get the independents.”

“So the Republicans have been tricked into shutting up, and every four years they’ve been tricked into campaigning for 20% of the voting public, the independents,” Limbaugh said. “They’re winning the independents and they’re losing elections. You know why? Because they are abandoning their base, and the assumption is the base is always gonna be with you, but the Tea Party is not the case.”

Limbaugh made the point that now that independents are abandoning Obama, the media are calling them “moderates.”

“The independents–and I know who you are, and you independents know who you are, and you were made to feel special by the media. You were portrayed as the really smart people,” Limbaugh said. “You weren’t ideologues. You decided things issue by issue. You had open minds, not closed minds. You weren’t bigots like the Tea Party. Oh, no, no, no! You independents, you were the cream of the crop–until you stopped voting for Democrats. Now you’re dirt. Now you’re scum.”

He praised Palin for her response to Lauer, whom he blasted for repeating mainstream media talking points that his producer gave him.

“When you stand in the middle of the road, you’re going to get hit on both sides of the road,” Palin said. “We need to take a stand, especially on this Obamacare, and support those who are just fulfilling their campaign promises. So many politicians ran for reelection and for election saying they would do anything in their power to de-fund the statist socialized medicine program called Obamacare.”"

Editor’s note: Lucian Kim is a journalist who was based in Russia for eight years and chronicled the Moscow protest movement on his blog at luciankim.com. The views expressed are his own.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry’s euphoria over securing Russia’s joint sponsorship of a Syrian peace conference didn’t last very long. Soon after Kerry’s triumphant visit to Moscow in May, reports surfaced that Russia had made another weapons shipment to beleaguered Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad.

Russia’s open support for the regime in Damascus didn’t stop Barack Obama from trying yet again to get President Vladimir Putin on board at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland this week. The Obama administration is being either naive or delusional in its belief that Russia will ever pull in the same direction over Syria. Putin will back al-Assad to the bitter end.

The Kremlin’s support can’t just be explained by Syria’s arms purchases or its hosting of the only Russian naval facility in the Mediterranean Sea. Putin’s rationale for propping up al-Assad is rooted in the past and goes to the core of how he views his own claim to power. By continuously misreading Russian intentions, the Obama administration is abdicating its leadership role – and granting al-Assad extra breathing room.

For one, Russia has been a guardian of the status quo at least since the 19th century. After revolutionary fervor swept Europe in 1848, Czar Nicholas I helped the Austrian monarchy crush a Hungarian uprising. Later, the Soviet Union was just as interested in keeping out the contaminating influence of western liberalism, putting down an anti-communist rebellion in Hungary and invading its satellite Czechoslovakia to quash a reform-minded government. Even the five-day war with Georgia in 2008 can be seen as a police action designed to punish an enemy and reestablish order on Russia’s southern border.

More from GPS: Why Russia won't cut Syria loose

A second motivation for Kremlin intransigence over Syria is the memory of the Mujahideen, the U.S.-armed Islamic fighters who turned the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan into an unwinnable guerilla war. Russians don’t forget that Osama bin Laden funded the Islamic resistance in Afghanistan, and that al Qaeda and the Taliban both grew out of the Mujahideen. Putin holds a deep-seated suspicion that the West still aids Islamic extremists to damage Russian interests, for example in Russia’s predominantly Muslim North Caucasus region. It should come as no surprise that Russia opposes arming religiously motivated rebels in Syria.

The third reason follows from the second: a continuing belief that the U.S. will use any means – be it a smart bomb, a pro-democracy grant or Twitter – to achieve global domination. Mention of a no-fly zone over Syria doesn’t just remind Russian leaders of Libya, but also of their own impotence to stop U.S.-led interventions in Iraq and the former Yugoslavia. At times it seems the Kremlin has become a victim of its own anti-American propaganda. In any case, thwarting the U.S. over Syria is a kind of late revenge and raises Putin’s stature at home as a lone, defiant leader.

Finally, the Kremlin has to insist that al-Assad is the only legitimate leader of Syria because anything else would imply that street protests and outright rebellion are valid ways to change a government. As a KGB agent in East Germany, Putin watched as people power knocked down the Soviet empire like a house of cards in 1989. Now, as Russia’s supreme leader, he cannot condone regime change abroad or countenance its possibility at home.

Never has Russia looked so out of place at a G8 summit as this year. The wording on Syria in the final communiqué expressed “strong support” for the proposed peace conference, hardly a cause for hope.

Any course of action is fraught with danger. But pretending that Putin’s mind can still be changed is beginning to look like an excuse for inaction. In the meantime, al-Assad is using the delays to consolidate his gains and create facts on the ground."

The lower rating of BBB+, down from A- before, was still within Fitch’s scale of debt considered to be of investment grade for bondholders. But the agency gave Italy’s debt a “negative” outlook.

An inconclusive national election late last month has thrown the government into gridlock, and Fitch said it was “unlikely that a stable new government can be formed in the next few weeks.” As a result, reforms needed to reverse an economic recession that Fitch described as one of the deepest in Europe seemed unlikely to be enacted any time soon.

The downgrade comes after Moody’s, a rival ratings agency, late last month warned that the risk of prolonged political uncertainty in Rome could have implications “well beyond Italy itself,” and could threaten the ratings of other members of the union."

But don’t think for a moment that Vladimir Putin has lost his edge. In a bluntly worded commentary published in Thursday’s New York Times, the Russian president castigated the idea of American “exceptionalism,” essentially called the United States an international bully and said he “carefully studied” President Obama’s speech Tuesday to the nation on Syria, and determined that he disagreed with it.

Still, Putin said his “working and personal relationship with President Obama is marked by growing trust,” and he welcomed Obama’s willingness to work with Russia on a plan to place Syria’s chemical weapons under international control.

“If we can avoid force against Syria, this will improve the atmosphere in international affairs and strengthen mutual trust,” he wrote. “It will be our shared success and open the door to cooperation on other critical issues.”

TRANSCRIPT: Obama makes his case to the nation

It is unusual, but not unheard of, for a foreign leader to publish commentary in an American newspaper as a way of influencing U.S. public opinion. Putin began his piece by saying that the furor over Syrian chemical weapons “prompted me to speak directly to the American people and their political leaders.” He added, “It is important to do so at a time of insufficient communication between our societies.”

Putin warned that a unilateral U.S. military response to Syria’s alleged use of chemical weapons would undermine the United Nations and violate international law. “The law is still the law, and we must follow it whether we like it or not,” he said -- words that will no doubt be parsed by human rights campaigners in Russia who have accused Putin’s government of bending the law and court system to its own purposes.

In some of the most stinging criticism of the United States, Putin wrote that it was “alarming that military intervention in internal conflicts in foreign countries has become commonplace for the United States.” He added that “millions around the world increasingly see America not as a model of democracy but as relying solely on brute force.”

The Russian president ended with a critical discussion of Obama’s speech, in which the American president laid out the reasons for intervention in Syria but said he wanted to explore Russia’s idea for a peaceful resolution to the crisis. Obama also explained why the United States was uniquely equipped to act, and talked about its history of leadership in international crises.

“That’s what makes America different,” the president said. “That’s what makes us exceptional.”

Seizing on that, Putin said: “I would rather disagree with a case he made on American exceptionalism. ... It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation. ... We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord’s blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal.”

Words seldom, if ever, heard before from a Russian head of state.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/12/02/Energy-Drives-Asian-Military-Confrontation,2013-12-02 00:00:00,['Chriss W. Street'],Energy Drives Asian Military Confrontation,"China’s Ministry of Defense on November 30th began enforcing an expanded Air Defense Identification Zone, which now covers a huge off-shore expanse that includes the disputed oil rich Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea.

Forced to rely on the Middle East for oil for electrical production, Asian energy costs are surging, and supply has become unstable due to the continuing Arab Spring turmoil. With American domestic energy costs falling as supplies surge due to the boom in fracking for shale oil and gas, Chinese manufacturers are becoming economically uncompetitive on a cost basis compared to the U.S. producers. With China, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea equally desperate to save jobs by exploiting potentially cheap and abundant off-shore oil, energy economics will drive military confrontations in Asia.

The Chinese claim the discovery and control of the Diaoyu islands from the 14th Century, but Japan took control of the islands from 1895 until its surrender to the U.S. at the end of World War II. During the United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands after 1945, it was discovered that oil reserves might be found under the sea near the islands. In anticipation of the turnover of the Senkaku islands, Japan declared a 100 mile ADIZ around the islands in 1969. Since reverting back to Japanese control under the 1971 Okinawa Reversion Agreement, sovereignty around the islands has been disputed by the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, and South Korea.

The new Chinese rules require that aircraft must ask for permission to fly in the ADIZ; aircraft in the zone must identify and keep in communication with Chinese authorities; all aircraft must “follow the instructions of the administrative organ of the East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone”; and warn “China’s armed forces will adopt defensive emergency measures to respond to aircraft that do not cooperate in the identification or refuse to follow the instructions.” In response to these new Chinese edits, the U.S. flew two unarmed B-52 bombers from Guam on November 25th without notification. Then on 29th, the People’s Liberation Army Air Force scrambled Su-30 and J-11 warplanes in response to 10 flights of Japanese F-15s, E-767s and P-3s; U.S. P-3s and EP-3s; and South Korean fighter jets flying through the ADIZ.

The 1919 Paris Convention for the Regulation of Aerial Navigation recognized the principal of freedom of the skies as an extension of “freedom of the high seas” that limited territorial sea claims of coastal nations to 12 nautical miles off their shores. The Convention on International Civil Aviation of 1944 updated air rights, but it was the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) which created the framework for exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in waters previously regarded as high seas. The three basic obligations of the treaty: (1) the duty to refrain from the unlawful threat or use of force; (2) the duty to have “due regard” to the rights of others to use the sea; and (3) the duty to observe applicable obligations under other treaties or rules of international law.

The United States extended what had been its 12 nautical mile territorial sea into a “high seas” Air Defense Identification Zone in response to heightened tensions with the Soviet Union caused by the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. America claims continental ADIZs extending 300 nautical miles in some Atlantic areas and more than 400 nautical miles in Southern California. The United States also maintains ADIZs off the coast of Alaska extending out at least 350 nautical miles into the Bering Sea, similar distance into the Arctic Sea off Alaska’s northern coast, 250 nautical miles around Guam, and up to 250 nautical miles north of the Hawaiian Islands.

The U.S. from 1870 to 1970 dominated manufacturing and won two wars on the back of oil and gas prices that averaged a third of the world’s price. But shrinking domestic production after 1972 destroyed America’s energy cost advantage by the 1980s. Once expanded Middle East oil production equalized energy costs for the world, American manufacturers began relocating jobs to Asia to stay competitive with lower labor costs.

But U.S. natural gas prices have fallen from $15 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) in 2000 to about $3.50 mcf today. This compares to rising natural gas prices that are $10 mcf in Europe, $12 mcf in China and $17 mcf in Japan. If this cost advantage holds or widens as America exploits its spectacular abundance of shale to frack for oil and gas, Asian employment will fall as huge amounts of manufacturing relocates to the United States.

No country has more risk from high energy prices than China, which passed the U.S. in 2010 as the world’s largest manufacturer. China passed Russia to grab the number two spot behind the U.S. in defense spending. Fearing the Peoples’ Liberation Army would become the dominant military power in East Asia, Japan has launched a crash rearmament drive that by next year will have ballooned defense outlays past France and the U.K. to the number four spot, just behind Russia.

The width of China’s new ADIZ does not extend beyond the international EEZ standard, but according to Stratfor Reports: “Beijing is testing U.S. responses in the Western Pacific, as China attempts to shape a new maritime balance in the area. All sides will use the current standoff to recalibrate the balance of power over energy and maritime geopolitics that, much like during the Cold War.”

Japan retaliated early this year to China’s growing military assertiveness by extending its ADIZ around the Senkaku Islands by another 15 miles. The current western border of the zone extends at its closest point to just 81 miles off the Chinese mainland. In this escalating tit for tat, between July and September the Japanese military was forced to scramble fighter jets 80 times in response to Chinese warplane and drone intrusions.

Beijing seems distressed enough about the potential loss of millions of manufacturing jobs that they are willing to threaten the use of military force to assert a sphere of influence that will capture most of the off-shore oil and gas drilling rights in the East and South China seas. Facing U.S.-Japan and U.S.-South Korea security agreements, China is employing tools like the ADIZ to force regional competitors to readjust their behavior in light of China’s ambitions and naval heft.

China’s confrontations may not be intended to lead to a clash, but when armed and dangerous nations play chicken with modern weapons, the risk of a military miscalculation and accidental war accelerates."

Rice has called or come to a secluded contemporary house here, intelligence reports at hand, to brief President Obama about the chaotic world that has followed him on vacation.

On Wednesday, Ms. Rice, the national security adviser, delivered a particularly troubling report: Egypt’s military had begun a bloody operation to clear two camps of demonstrators protesting on behalf of that country’s ousted president, Mohamed Morsi. Among the options she laid out was a plan already on the table to pull the United States from joint military exercises with Egypt.

After Mr. Obama left to play golf, Ms. Rice, 48, returned to her own lodgings to consult with aides at the White House. After 5 p.m., the two spoke again, and Mr. Obama signed off on the plan.

The White House announced Tuesday that President Obama, Vice President Biden and the first lady will not attend the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, in February, a pointed snub by an administration that is feuding with Russian leaders on a range of foreign policy and human rights issues.

The U.S. delegation will be led by a former Cabinet secretary and a deputy secretary of state, and it will include two openly gay athletes — tennis legend Billie Jean King and ice hockey player Caitlin Cahow — in an apparent bid to highlight opposition to Russia’s anti-gay laws.

This will mark the first time since the Summer Games in Sydney in 2000 that a U.S. Olympic delegation did not include a president, first lady or vice president. The White House made the announcement in a news release late Tuesday.

Officials said Obama’s schedule would not permit him to attend the Games during a two-week period beginning Feb. 7, although they did not specify what the president would be doing instead. Obama, a major sports fan, is “extremely proud” of the U.S. team and “looks forward to cheering them on from Washington,” White House spokesman Shin Inouye said in a statement.

The U.S. delegation “represents the diversity that is the United States,” Inouye said. “All our delegation members are distinguished by their accomplishments in government service, civic activism, and sports.”

Mikhail Mordasov/For The Washington Post Wait 1 second to continue.

In keeping top officials away from Sochi, the United States joins France and Germany among the nations whose senior government leaders will not attend. The Human Rights Campaign, a leading gay rights group, hailed the announcement and called Russia’s anti-gay laws “heinous.”

“The inclusion of gay athletes is incredibly important and sends a potent message about the inclusive nature of our democracy,” said Fred Sainz, a spokesman for the group.

The Obama administration’s relationship with Russian President Vladi­mir Putin has deteriorated this year as the two countries have clashed on several issues. The United States blamed Russia, along with China, for blocking a United Nations resolution authorizing potential military intervention in Syria in the summer, and the two countries have failed to agree on a pact for broader nuclear disarmament.

The White House also was angered by Russia’s decision to grant temporary political asylum to Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who leaked thousands of classified documents detailing the United States’ broad spying apparatus.

In September, Obama canceled a planned bilateral meeting with Putin ahead of an economic summit in St. Petersburg. Among other things, he cited Russian laws, passed in June, that ban the distribution of any materials to minors that suggest homosexual relationships are normal or attractive.

The president met at the summit with civil rights activists instead.

During a news conference in August, Obama said he did not believe it was appropriate for the United States to boycott the Winter Games altogether, as it did in 1980 by staying away from the Summer Games in Moscow after the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan.

“We’ve got a bunch of Americans out there who are training hard, who are doing everything they can to succeed,” he said. “Nobody is more offended than me by some of the anti-gay and lesbian legislation that you’ve been seeing in Russia.”

Obama added that he hoped some openly gay or lesbian athletes would win a medal, which would “go a long way in rejecting the kind of attitudes that we’re seeing there. And if Russia doesn’t have gay or lesbian athletes, then it probably makes their team weaker.”

Cahow, a two-time Olympian, said in an interview with Go Athletes that she believed it made sense for United States to compete in the Sochi Games, comparing it to the example of Jesse Owens, the black track and field star who competed in the 1936 Berlin Olympics in Nazi Germany.

“He demonstrated the greatness of who he was as an African-American athlete,” she said.” It’s precisely the same philosophy we should be taking to Russia. I don’t think any athletes are going to go over there just to protest Russian policy. That makes no sense. They’re going to go over there because they want to compete.”

Janet Napolitano, the former secretary of homeland security who is now the president of the University of California system, will head the U.S. delegation to the opening ceremonies, while Deputy Secretary of State William J. Burns will head the delegation for the closing ceremonies.

U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul and Obama aide Rob Nabors are also scheduled to attend, along with Olympic medalists Bonnie Blair, Brian Boitano and Eric Heiden."

14 border guards were killed in the clashes with bandits in southeast Iran, state media say

Authorities in Iran hanged 16 ""anti-Iran"" rebels Saturday in response to deadly overnight clashes between bandits and border guards in southeast Iran, the country's Fars news agency reported.

Local attorney-general Mohammad Marzieh said the 16 were hanged Saturday morning in the city of Zahedan, in Sistan and Baluchestan province, the semi-official news agency said.

""We had issued warnings previously that bandits and anti-Iran group members who commit acts causing damage to innocent people or security and military personnel will face reciprocal action by us,"" he is quoted as saying.

""This morning, in retaliation for the martyrdom of border guards at the town of Saravan, we hanged 16 members of of these anti-Iran groups. The judiciary will absolutely not tolerate such actions by these groups.""

Official news agency IRNA said 14 Iranian border guards were killed in the clashes in the Saravan city area, near Iran's border with Pakistan's Balochistan province. Six more were injured and three taken hostage, the news agency said. It earlier said as many as 17 security personnel had died.

Ali Abdollahi, Iran's deputy interior minister, told IRNA that the provincial governor had sent a team to investigate the incident.

He told the news agency that only authorized reports by the interior ministry regarding the killing of the soldiers and border guards should be trusted.

Abdollahi said the ""terrorist activities"" in Saravan appeared to have initiated over the border in Pakistan. Iran expects Pakistan to do more to secure its borders in line with mutual agreements, he said.

Iran's President Hassan Rouhani urged the interior ministry to take strong measures to deal with terrorism, IRNA said.

He also called on the foreign ministry to work out a deal with Pakistan to avoid this kind of incident happening again, the news agency said.

Rouhani also expressed his condolences to the families of the border guards killed in the incident.

Additional security and military forces from elsewhere in the province have been sent to the border area, the news agency said."

U.S. cancels exercises with Egyptian military

The Obama administration needs to revamp its entire Middle East strategy of remaining impartial in conflicts in Egypt and elsewhere because it risks giving anti-American radicals an opening to take over, analysts said.

""We don't take sides with any particular party or political figure,"" President Obama said Thursday in his first statement on a crackdown by Egyptian police on anti-government protests that left more than 500 supporters of ousted president Mohammed Morsi dead.

Obama canceled exercises with the Egyptian military and encouraged the country's leaders to restore the democratic process, protect peaceful demonstrators and refrain from victimizing minorities.

Obama's message boils down to ""we're just sitting by and watching,"" said Michael Doran, who served as a deputy assistant secretary of Defense and a senior director at the National Security Council under President George W. Bush.

Instead, Obama should jump into the Middle East fray and deal with regional issues that threaten U.S. interests and allies, Doran said.

Rather than focus on peace between Israel and the Palestinians, he should pull together allies in Europe and Persian Gulf states such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia that have propped up the Egyptian economy with multiple billion-dollar cash infusions to formulate a cohesive policy for the region, Doran said.

That means making U.S. aid to Egypt's military and Gulf support to Egypt's general fund conditional on Egyptian leaders adopting a clear path to democracy. To get Gulf states to agree, Obama has to address their concerns in Syria, Iraq and Iran, places where Shiite Muslim forces are warring with Sunni Muslims and where U.S. policy is also lacking, Doran said.

""We have to have a regional strategy that's well run,"" Doran said. ""We're not going to get strategic accommodations with our major partners if we don't have a regionwide approach.""

Obama's foreign policy priorities were perhaps best described June 30 by his then-national security adviser, Tom Donilon, who told CNN that the administration determined ""that we were over-invested in our military efforts in South Asia and in the Middle East"" compared with Asia as whole and set about to reorient its attention elsewhere.

Thursday, Obama pledged to work with Egyptians ""who support a future of stability that rests on a foundation of justice and peace and dignity,"" but he offered no proposals for achieving that goal.

Tamara Wittes, who as deputy assistant secretary of State from 2009 to 2012 coordinated U.S. democracy policy in the Middle East, said the United States should start by encouraging the Egyptian government to immediately take concrete steps toward an inclusive political system and show its sincerity by holding accountable those responsible for Wednesday's killings.

That means ""allowing people who believe they've been treated outside the rule of law to press their cases,"" Wittes said.

Those in power should try again to reach out and compromise with willing opponents among the Muslim Brotherhood or its followers, she said.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the canceled maneuvers are a strong message to Egypt's rulers.

""The United States has made it clear that the Egyptian government must refrain from violence, respect freedom of assembly and move toward an inclusive political transition,"" he said.

Egypt's leaders have demonstrated indifference to U.S. exhortations about democracy and justice. Elliott Abrams, a former deputy assistant to Bush on Middle East issues, said that attitude solidified when the Obama administration failed ""to call a coup a coup"" when a freely elected president, Morsi, was deposed July 3.

That convinced the generals that ""we need them a lot more than they need us"" and that the U.S. president is willing to ignore U.S. law to remain on good terms with them, Abrams said.

The United States has to accept it has very little influence in Egypt and cutting off aid will not cause Egypt's army ""to snap to attention,"" Abrams said.

Instead, the rationale should be ""we're doing this for us, so we have a foreign policy we can sell, that stands up to our moral standards,"" Abrams said. ""You can't turn to an army that just killed 500 mostly unarmed people and say here's your next aid package."""

(CNN) —

Any great speech about the Israeli-Palestinian peace process should leave everyone feeling a bit uncomfortable. Given that all involved have contributed to the troubled situation on the ground, all must challenge themselves to create the changes that are necessary.

By this measure and virtually any other fair metric, President Barack Obama’s address to Israeli students Thursday was a great speech. Boldly, pointedly and deftly, he provided a virtuoso display of political leadership and international statesmanship.

It stands as a companion piece to his great speech in Egypt early in his first term about America and the Arab world. And his great speech in the Czech Republic about nuclear disarmament. And his great Nobel Prize acceptance speech. And his many other great addresses. And like each of those resonant, masterful moments, the measure of the remarks will be in the follow-up, in the change they actually produce.

5 things to know about Obama’s first presidential visit to Israel

It is, after all, easier to be a speechmaker than a peacemaker. And in the wake of Obama’s energizing address, he must now face greatly raised hopes that he will follow up on his words more successfully than he has the Cairo or Prague remarks. As Brookings Institution analyst and longtime U.S. diplomat Martin Indyk noted on CNN afterward, the president has now “raised expectations sky-high that he himself is going to work to make peace possible.”

It remains to be seen whether that happens, but for a moment it is worth considering why the speech was so effective and important. Let’s start by counting the people the president made uncomfortable.

We must begin with Obama’s host for this visit to Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Surely, Netanyahu must have been pleased with the repeated and persuasive statements from Obama since his arrival in Israel that he and the United States remain committed to a special relationship with Israel and to helping ensure Israeli survival. This was precisely the kind of affirmation that the Israelis hoped for from this trip, salve to the wounds – many Netanyahu brought on himself – acquired in the run-up to last fall’s presidential elections.

But of all the slights and bumps of the past months, the president’s remarks – in a sly but unmistakable way – delivered the toughest blow to date to Netanyahu despite their powerful pro-Israeli rhetoric and images. Because Obama sent a message to Netanyahu that if need be he would go over his head to the Israeli people.

Obama, Netanyahu agree on preventing nuclear-armed Iran

To receive this message, Obama picked a young audience that he knew represented a different portion of Israel’s vibrant polity, and he had them cheering and applauding, not just at the expressions of friendship, but at tough remarks about how unconstructive Netanyahu’s settlement policies have been and how vital it is to establish a safe, prospering state for the Palestinians.

By the end, despite efforts to put an enthusiastic face on the event, Netanyahu must have been grateful there have been no Israeli politicians offering an alternative vision as clear as Obama’s. Had there been, Netanyahu might have been working Thursday’s speech as a commentator on Fox News.

Indeed, Obama’s remarks about how all must share the aspirations of Palestinian children must have resonated particularly well with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. But because this was a good and thus fair speech on the issue of peace, the president likely also made Abbas a bit uneasy with the forcefulness of his commitment to Israel’s existence as a Jewish state, a commitment that cuts directly to an issue on which even the most constructive members of the Palestinian leadership have been reluctant to show flexibility.

Abbas, however, was certainly nowhere nearly as directly affronted as the Hamas leaders in Gaza, whom the president unceremoniously slammed for their rocket attacks and for their inattentiveness to the needs of the Palestinian people entrusted into their care. Further, of course, in calling out the terrorist nature of Hezbollah, the president sent yet another message concerning his willingness to confront that organization’s sponsors in Tehran.

In fact, it has seemed frequently throughout this trip that it has been more about standing together with Israel on Iran, toughening the approach to Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria and working to support Jordan than it has been about the Israelis and the Palestinians.

John King: Walking through Ramallah and Gaza, political differences become real

But even on this last point, the speech again succeeded in making another group uncomfortable. Because in the end, it was the most potent speech an American president has ever given in Israel about the peace process, the most personal statement of commitment to it. And therefore it must have made very uncomfortable the small group of American diplomats and national security specialists who are going to have to follow through and try to live up to its promise with their actions.

In the end, Obama must make himself central to this process, actively and continuously, or the hopes it has raised will once again be cruelly deflated.

On the other hand, were he to follow through on this and help advance peace through the establishment of an independent Palestinian state that agreed to the secure existence of Israel, he would also be doing much to live up to the promise of his other earlier addresses. Like those calling for better relations with the Islamic world in Cairo and advancing the cause of peace in Prague and in Oslo.

North Korea warned Seoul on Saturday that the Korean Peninsula had entered ""a state of war."" It also threatened to shut down a border factory complex that is the last major symbol of cooperation between the Koreas.

""We've seen reports of a new and unconstructive statement from North Korea. We take these threats seriously and remain in close contact with our South Korean allies,"" said Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council. ""But, we would also note that North Korea has a long history of bellicose rhetoric and threats, and today's announcement follows that familiar pattern.""

North Korea's threats are seen as part of an effort to provoke the new government in Seoul to change its policies toward Pyongyang, and to win diplomatic talks with Washington that could get it more aid. The moves also are seen as ways to build domestic unity as North Korea's young leader, Kim Jong Un, strengthens his military credentials.

In recent days, the U.S. flew a pair of nuclear-capable B-2 stealth bombers over an uninhabited South Korean island, dropping dummy munitions as part of annual defense drills that North Korea views as rehearsals for an invasion. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel also announced that the U.S. will fortify its defenses against a potential North Korean missile attack on the U.S. by adding more than a dozen missile interceptors to the 26 already in place at Fort Greely, Alaska.

North Korea said in a statement Saturday that it would deal with South Korea according to ""wartime regulations"" and would retaliate against any provocations by the U.S. and South Korea without notice.

""Now that the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK have entered into an actual military action, the inter-Korean relations have naturally entered the state of war,"" said the statement, which was carried by the official North Korean news agency and referred to the country by its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Provocations ""will not be limited to a local war, but develop into an all-out war, a nuclear war,"" the statement said.

The White House has stressed the U.S. government's capability and willingness to defend itself and its allies and interests in the region, if necessary.

""We remain fully prepared and capable of defending and protecting the United States and our allies,"" Hayden said.

In the National Defense Commission’s “important statement” carried on its state-run Korea Central Television, Pyongyang said that if the U.S. is “sincerely interested in keeping the peace and security in the region, including the mainland United States,” the two countries should hold high-level talks.

Proposing the two countries meet at a venue and date of Washington’s choice, Pyongyang said they could discuss issues such as “easing the military tension” and denuclearization. The communist state also emphasized that there shouldn’t be any precondition to the talks, and that how the situation unfolds depends solely on the U.S.

“We assert, internally and externally, that denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is our people’s unchanging will,” the statement said, adding that it is the task for the party and its people as it is “the legacy of the late leader and the general.”

“The special statement seems to reflect Kim Jong Un’s will to deal with the U.S.,” said professor Yang Moo-jin of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. “Kim Jong Un’s special envoy to China, Choi Ryong-hae, has expressed that Pyongyang will resolve the current tension through talks and negotiations. The suggestion this time seems to be on the same line as that.”

North Korea has been globally criticized and seen sanctions expand in the wake of its long-range rocket launch in December, which they claimed to be for scientific purposes only. The hard-line communist state also carried out a nuclear test in early February, saying that it was in response to Washington’s “hostile policy.”

But earlier this month North Korea changed its war-like attitude and called for rare working-level talks with Seoul ahead of President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping’s meeting in California. However, what would have been the first high-level talks in more than two years between the two Koreas never took place because the North shelved the meeting, expressing dissatisfaction over the South’s choice of its delegates early last week.

Obama and Xi agreed to push for the denuclearization of North Korea, while Seoul announced that President Park Geun-hye will discuss denuclearization with Xi at their meeting this month.

The last high-level talks between the U.S. and North Korea were in February 2012. First Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Kim Kye-gwan of North Korea met with U.S. State Department special representative Glyn Davis in Beijing, and reached an agreement calling for Pyongyang to halt its nuclear tests in return for U.S. aid.

In the statement, however, Pyongyang officials confirmed that they will “keep their nuclear-state status, whether others acknowledge it or not,” until the “external nuclear threats completely come to an end.”

“Now the ball is on the U.S. side,” said professor Yang. “If Pyongyang and Washington had some discussion beforehand through a New York channel, there are higher chances of the talk being actualized. But if this is just North Korea insisting the two come together, there is less chance of the U.S. agreeing.”"

Beginning in the early morning Tuesday with the killing of a Finance Ministry official with a bomb attached to his vehicle and continuing for hours, the attacks were a devastating reminder of the violence that regularly afflicts Iraq. And they somehow seemed more poignant coming on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the American-led invasion.

By midmorning, the familiar sight of black smoke rose above a cityscape of palm fronds, turquoise-tiled mosque domes and squat concrete buildings. By midafternoon, the numbers had stacked up: 57 dead and nearly 190 wounded in separate attacks that included 17 car bombs, 2 adhesive bombs stuck to cars, and a killing with a silenced gun.

Most attacks hit Shiite neighborhoods. Their targets varied: restaurants, a bank, a vegetable market and a parking garage. Others were near a courthouse and a university, and some seemed to have no target other than innocent passers-by. Many Iraqis say they worry about an increase in sectarian tensions. Though there were no immediate claims of responsibility, the attacks were carried out in the fashion of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, the Sunni insurgent group weakened but not vanquished by the American military."

Washington (CNN) - President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry made explicit the administration's renewed attempts to negotiate a peace deal between Israel and Palestine Saturday as the United States begins to assume a more muscular role in talks.

At the Brookings Institution's annual Saban Forum on Middle East issues and U.S.-Israeli relations, Obama and Kerry each spoke about a budding interim deal that would work towards a two-state solution.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

""Peace is possible today,"" declared Kerry, who just returned this week from his eighth trip to the region. There, he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who remain ""as determined as ever"" to negotiate a peace deal, he said.

We are ""closer than ever"" to realizing a two-state solution, he added.

""I think it's possible in the next several months to arrive at a framework that does not address every single detail, but gets us to a point where everybody recognizes better to move forward than move backwards,"" Obama told Haim Saban, an Israeli-American media mogul who hosted the president for a public Q&A.

""I think that we're now at a place where we can achieve a two-state solution in which Israelis and Palestinians are living side-by-side in peace and security, but it's going to require some very tough decisions,"" he continued.

Some very tough decisions that make up the bulk of negotiations from here on. As Kerry pointed out, the basic outline of a deal has been clear all along: It must deal with borders, security, refugees, Jerusalem, mutual recognition and end of claims.

But reaching a consensus on those issues will take a lot of work, and Obama reminded his audience that there is only so much the U.S. can do.

""The only way this is going to be resolved is if the people of Israel and the Palestinian people make a determination that their futures and the futures of their children and grandchildren will be better off with peace than with conflict,"" he said. ""The U.S. can be an effective facilitator of that negotiation and dialogue. We can help to bridge differences and bridge gaps. But both sides have to want to get there.""

One aspect of that facilitation was an extensive security plan written by American military commanders for their Israeli counterparts. Headed by retired four-star Gen. John Allen, whose last assignment was as top brass in Afghanistan, the in-depth analysis reports on how Israel can maintain its security in a two-state solution - a concern that has impeded negotiations in the past.

On the Palestinian side, both Obama and Kerry made assurances not only that their most basic demands would be met, but also that a new Palestine could emerge, one that was a true partner to Israel.

""Israel and Jordan must know that they will have a reliable and responsible neighbor, not a failed state between them,"" said Kerry.

Obama went into further detail, discussing an interim deal that would initially only include the West Bank, not Gaza. Once Gazans saw the success, he argued, they would push for their own peace.

""If there is a model where young Palestinians in Gaza are looking and seeing that in the West Bank, Palestinians are able to live in dignity, with self-determination, and suddenly their economy is booming and trade is taking place... that’s something that the young people of Gaza are going to want,"" he said.

For all the talk of meeting Israel and Palestine's needs, though, Obama and Kerry seemed clear-eyed about the challenges ahead, including a transition period where Israel might have to yield some of its security demands and Palestine might be required to show restraint and patience.

But four months into a nine-month deadline set by Kerry, Israelis and Palestinians have little tangible progress. At least now, they also have what looks like increased attention from Washington.

Iran is maybe the most aggressive country in the world, and it’s not just against Israel.”

Saudi Arabia and other gulf states view Iran as a regional nemesis whose nuclear program is only one element of a broader effort to project power. The rivalry is made more bitter by the sectarian dimension and competition over supplying oil to the world. The Saudi leadership has long been uneasy with Mr. Obama’s handling of the Arab uprisings that began in 2011, which it sees as a threat to the regional order. The president’s overtures to Iran add to a growing impatience and exasperation among Arabs in the gulf over Washington’s retreat from threats to strike Syria, whose civil war is viewed as a proxy for the larger sectarian and strategic battle unfolding across the region.

“The gulf states, and the Iranians, still see this as a balance-of-power struggle,” said Salman Shaikh, director of the Brookings Doha Center. “And Obama’s warning and Rouhani’s charm offensive, as well as what they would see as a hoodwinking of the United States on the nuclear issue, could have far-reaching consequences on the balance-of-power struggle.”

Mustafa Alani, a Dubai-based security analyst, said the Saudis think Mr. Obama is “not a reliable ally, that he’s bending to the Syrians and Iranians.” Mishaal al-Gergawi, a political analyst based in the United Arab Emirates, said, “There is a lot of cynicism, and it feeds into the notion that Obama is very naïve — he was naïve with the Muslim Brotherhood, naïve with Bashar al-Assad, and he is now naïve with Iran.”

Israeli analysts, too, worry over what they see as the Obama administration’s weak and wavering policies toward the Middle East. After the Syria chemical weapons crisis, some said the phone call only upped the ante for a diplomatic victory that could lead Washington to accept what Jerusalem would consider a “bad deal” with Iran, which insists its nuclear program is for civilian purposes only."

His Latest Novel Is', 'The Paladin.']",David Ignatius: People power rises again,"“Authoritarianism in the name of Islam is dead,” messaged one Egyptian activist last Sunday, as millions gathered in the streets to denounce the rule of President Mohamed Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood government.

What happened over the next few days combined elements of a popular uprising and a military coup. The mass protest against Morsi showed the strength of dissent. But the Egyptian army’s role in toppling Morsi Wednesday was a reminder that the danger of authoritarianism is still very much alive in the Middle East, whether it’s under religious or nationalist guise.

The United States so far has been largely irrelevant to events in Egypt. I wish the Obama administration had been doing more to back moderates in the Middle East, overall, but in Egypt, the United States deliberately played the role of mediator rather than decider. The army wanted a public American “green light” for its coup, but it didn’t get one.

Perhaps the best thing that can be said on this July 4th is that the Egyptian people are writing their own history. They may be making mistakes along the way, and I wish we weren’t seeing a general in uniform seizing the stage again. But for once, the Middle East conspiracy theorists who always see America as the controlling force in events seem to have been wrong. President Obama has been a back-seat passenger.

The target of this week’s protests was Morsi, but the mass demonstrations recalled the giddy days of the February 2011 revolution that toppled President Hosni Mubarak. The basic message was the same: We are citizens. We want dignity and human rights. We aren’t afraid of autocratic leaders or their thugs. That revolt led to military rule, too, but its spirit was one of idealism and democracy.

“It’s a second revolution,” Ahmed Said, a leader of Egypt’s National Salvation Front, told the Guardian newspaper. He was right. The danger is that, as in the French, Russian and Iranian revolutions, we are in a prolonged period of violence and instability that will only end with a new dictator.

What’s fascinating is that the new challenge to religious parties in the Middle East transcends sectarian lines. The protest against the Muslim Brotherhood in Sunni Egypt is matched by a similar renewal of dissent in Shiite Iran, where the 2009 Green Revolution was crushed by government repression.

The unlikely emblem of change in Iran is Hassan Rouhani, who was elected president last month. He’s part of the clerical establishment that has run Iran for the past three decades. So it’s premature to assume that Rouhani’s election signals any breakthrough in stalled negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program.

But Rouhani’s victory does tell us something about the Iranian public mood: Among the six candidates who ran in the June 14 election, Rouhani was the most critical of the status quo; he called for reforms and new ties with the West. The fact that he won 51 percent of the vote (with a 73 percent turnout) marked a break from the tutelage of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who appeared to favor national security adviser Saeed Jalili.

“We have no other option than moderation,” Rouhani said during the campaign. What this will mean in practice isn’t clear, but Rouhani has urged in his writings that Iran engage with the West, rather than depend on Russia and China.

Protesters have also shaken the Islamic populism of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He has been an “authoritarian rock star,” in the words of William Dobson, the author of “The Dictator’s Learning Curve.” But even Erdogan triggered a backlash after years of squeezing the Turkish media, courts and military. “The shared experience of repression, combined with collective frustration at mounting top-down efforts to regulate public life . . . brought citizens from different walks of life together” in Turkey, wrote Emiliano Alessandri, Nora Fisher Onar and Ozgur Unluhisarciklion the Foreign Affairs Web site.

This new wave of activism in the Middle East isn’t pro- or anti-American. It’s something else — a movement of empowered citizens who don’t want the old secular dictatorships of Hosni Mubarak’s era, and don’t want a new Islamic authoritarianism, either. This core of “people power” surfaced in the initial “Arab Spring” of 2011, but a chill developed as the Muslim Brotherhood gained control in Egypt and chaos prevailed in Libya and Syria. Despite these setbacks, this week showed there is still a popular movement for democratic change that resists dictation from anyone.

“I have never seen anything like this, not even during February of 2011. This is a genuine popular movement, no organisation whatsoever,” tweeted Egyptian writer Bassem Sabry late Tuesday.

For U.S. officials, recent events are a reminder that the Middle East is still in the early stages of a long-running process of transformation. Morsi’s election in 2012 offered the Muslim Brotherhood a chance to show that it could govern Egypt effectively. It has flunked the test — and the Egyptian military has lost patience with the failed experiment.

On America’s Independence Day, we celebrate the triumph of our democracy. But David McCullough reminds us in his book “1776” that in January of that revolutionary year, George Washington despaired that “few people know the predicament we are in.” It took America another 12 years to write and ratify a workable Constitution. In the Middle East, the convulsive democratic transition is just beginning.

(CNN) —

Two car bombs targeting Christians killed at least 38 people in southern Baghdad on Christmas.

In Afghanistan, two rounds of “indirect fire” hit the U.S. Embassy compound in Kabul, but no one was hurt.

The incidents highlight the security challenges with which both Iraq and Afghanistan are grappling.

Both countries have had a heavy U.S. military presence until recently.

The departure of U.S. forces from Iraq has done little to curb the near-daily cycle of violence. In Afghanistan, U.S. and Afghan officials are working on an important security pact to outline the future of American troops in Afghanistan.

18 dead in Christmas Day attacks near Iraq churches

Iraq attacks

In Iraq, a car bomb exploded outside a church in southern Baghdad just as worshipers were leaving a Christmas Day service, killing many. In another attack Wednesday, a car bomb went off at an outdoor market where many Christians shop, police said.

Altogether, at least 38 people were killed and some 70 others were wounded, the Interior Ministry said. The bomb outside the church killed 27 and wounded 56. The market attack left 11 dead and 14 wounded.

The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad condemned the attacks – in the Dora area of Baghdad – targeting “Christians celebrating Christmas.”

“The Christian community in Iraq has suffered deliberate and senseless targeting by terrorists for many years, as have many other innocent Iraqis. The United States abhors all such attacks and is committed to its partnership with the Government of Iraq to combat the scourge of terrorism,” according to a statement released by the embassy.

Iraq has experienced an uptick in sectarian violence this year as tensions simmer between the disaffected minority Sunni community and the Shiites, who dominate the government.

The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom notes that many people in small religious minority communities in Iraq, including Christians, have fled the country over the last decade and those that remain are “particularly vulnerable,” facing “discrimination, marginalization, and neglect.”

Sectarian warfare, especially between Sunnis and Shiites, raged during the Iraq War. Half or more of the pre-2003 Iraqi Christian community is thought to have left Iraq, the commission said in its 2013 annual report.

In 2003, there were thought to be 800,000 to 1.4 million Chaldean Catholics, Assyrian Orthodox, Assyrian Church of the East members, Syriac Catholics and Orthodox, Armenian Catholics and Orthodox, Protestants and evangelicals in the country, the group said.

Now, according to community leaders, the estimated number of Christians stands at around 500,000, the report said.

Afghanistan attack

Two rounds of “indirect fire” hit the U.S. Embassy compound in Kabul, the embassy said. No one was injured.

“At approximately 6:40 local time in Kabul, approximately two rounds of indirect fire impacted the U.S. Embassy compound. All Americans are accounted for and no injuries were sustained,” the embassy said in a statement Wednesday. “The Embassy continues to investigate the attack.”

The embassy did not elaborate on what kind of rounds were fired, or where in the compound they landed.

A claim of responsibility was posted on the Taliban’s official website. The group said it fired missiles at the U.S. Embassy and the main base of NATO, which leads the military coalition known as the International Security Assistance Force.

The incident comes at a pivotal time in U.S.-Afghan relations. The two countries are working on an important security pact. The deal will lay out the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan after 2014 when the NATO-led force of some 80,000 troops is scheduled to leave.

This month, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel was in Afghanistan and said the security pact will be agreed upon despite a failure so far to forge a deal.

Resignation, coming less than two years after his confirmation, could signal a coming shakeup of the national security team.

1. Chuck Hagel is anti-Israel.

In 2006, I interviewed then-Sen. Hagel for a book I was writing on U.S. policy toward the Arab-Israeli negotiations. Quotes from that interview, such as his comment that “the Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people up here,” have been used by his detractors to argue that he is hostile toward Israel.

By congressional standards, Hagel is quite independent on Israel. He believes in a special U.S.-Israel relationship but not one in which the United States accepts Israeli actions uncritically. And he isn’t as emotionally connected to Israel as some of his former colleagues in Congress — such as Rep. John Lewis (Ga.) or Sen. Mark Kirk (Ill.) — are. But in our interview, his writings and his voting record on military aid to Israel, Hagel has been clear that Israel is a small, democratic ally in a dangerous neighborhood worthy of support.

As for Hagel’s observation about the Jewish lobby, it was an impolitic description; support for Israel rests on millions of Christians, too. But as anyone who’s lived in Washington or followed ­U.S.-Israeli politics knows, Hagel was just stating the obvious. The ­pro-Israel community and lobby have a strong voice, though hardly a veto over U.S. policy. Members of Congress also know how powerful the pro-Israel community is — they’re just not willing to admit it publicly, let alone challenge it. Hagel is one of the few who does.

2. Hagel isn’t qualified.

Was Donald Rumsfeld? Nobody had a better resume for the position: a former member of Congress and defense secretary under Gerald Ford, with management expertise from his days in the private sector. Yet, as George W. Bush’s Pentagon chief, Rumsfeld helped conceive and direct a disastrous war in Iraq that cost thousands of lives and trillions of dollars and eroded American credibility.

What matters isn’t just credentials, but a candidate’s judgment and discretion. We need a defense secretary who be tough and realistic about when, how and why America projects its military power abroad. Like Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Republican secretary of war, Henry Stimson, Hagel believes in bipartisan foreign policy; like Robert Gates, he is an analyst and a skeptic. And that’s what we need today — pragmatists and doubters, not ideologues.

Hagel has management experience: He was deputy administrator of the Veterans Administration under President Ronald Reagan and chief executive of the USO in the late 1980s. And he has foreign policy and intelligence credentials: He’s co-chairman of the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board and a member of the defense secretary’s Policy Advisory Board.

Further, Hagel — who would be the first enlisted, decorated combat veteran to run the Pentagon — personally understands the costs of war. Having been wounded in combat, he would be uniquely committed to the well-being of U.S. troops. This would give Hagel real authority to run the Pentagon and deal with the generals. As Ryan Crocker, a former U.S. ambassador to Iraq and Afghanistan, recently put it: “Hagel would run the Defense Department; it would not run him.”

3. As defense secretary, Hagel would be a dominant force in shaping U.S. foreign policy.

In this administration, nobody is, except the president. Obama is the most controlling foreign policy and national security president since Richard Nixon. He dominates, not delegates, foreign policy decisions. Hagel would manage the drawdown and extrication from Afghanistan. But Obama wouldn’t delegate much high-level policy to him.

Hagel’s 2009 comments urging the United States to engage with Hamas to moderate its behavior, his 2006 refusal to sign a letter pressing the European Union to declare Hezbollah a terrorist organization and his opposition to unilateral sanctions on Iran have concerned many. These views are out of sync with U.S. policy, but that wouldn’t matter much. Hagel wouldn’t have a say or influence in these matters.

Hagel’s doubts about using force against Iran would provide a contrarian view if and when Obama weighs whether to strike. But the big decisions will be the president’s call.

4. Hagel is an appeaser who’s reluctant to use force.

Hagel is a realist, not a crusader. And he’s certainly not a pacifist. He takes enormous pride in the U.S. military. He voted for the Iraq war in 2002 but later turned against it, and he opposed the 2007 troop surge. He clearly is wary of getting involved in military adventures abroad in which the United States might end up owning faraway places that it can’t control, let alone fix (see Syria). This isn’t being soft, it’s being smart. On Iran, Hagel hasn’t ruled out the use of force, but he believes in going to great lengths to avoid it.

As for reducing the defense budget, any new Pentagon chief will face a decision — not whether to cut, but by how much. Unlike Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, who was reluctant to cut, Hagel is on record saying that the Pentagon should be pared down. But it’s a complex process with many oars in the water, not just the defense secretary’s. And sequestration notwithstanding, no one wants to or would be able to gut the military.

5. The flap over Hagel’s nomination is about his views.

Much of the opposition is based on Hagel’s persona and the positions he’s taken. But it goes deeper. It’s really about opposition to Obama.

Opposing Hagel is a way for Republicans to remind the president not to take them for granted. He can’t have his way without taking their views into account on the debt ceiling, gun control and even national security appointments — an area traditionally regarded as presidential purview. As we saw with Susan Rice, the president’s first choice for secretary of state, who took herself out of the running because of congressional pressure, Republican pushback has influenced Obama.

Attacking Hagel also is a chance for conservative Republicans to reassert their views on foreign policy, such as American exceptionalism, and to stand up for U.S. values and intervention abroad, which they think Obama has abandoned.

Finally, the hammering of Hagel on Israel partly reflects the pro-Israel community’s belief that, like his nominee, Obama is too soft on Iran and too tough on Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. When Hagel appears before the Senate, it’s Obama’s policies that will be up for debate just as much as his nominee.

(CNN) —

A mission to evacuate Americans from South Sudan was aborted Saturday when an aircraft carrying U.S. military members was fired upon as it prepared to land in Bor, wounding four of them, the Pentagon said.

The most severely damaged aircraft was thought to have been hit in the fuel line, a military official speaking on condition of anonymity said.

All three aircraft – CV-22 Ospreys – were diverted to Entebbe, Uganda, which is not where their flights originated, the official said. Another aircraft then flew the wounded to Nairobi, Kenya, U.S. Africa Command said in a statement.

The four service members were in stable condition after treatment, the statement said.

Pentagon officials were trying to determine how to mount another effort to evacuate the roughly three dozen Americans in South Sudan, where they have been working for the United Nations, a senior U.S. official said on condition of anonymity.

Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel was “reviewing options,” Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said. “Whatever we do it will be in coordination with the State Department,” he added.

The White House said U.S. President Barack Obama was briefed before dawn Saturday while aboard Air Force One after landing in Hawaii, then met with his national security team on the matter.

The fighting has displaced as many as 100,000 people, many of whom have crossed the Nile River, he said, adding that he feared a humanitarian disaster was unfolding.

South Sudanese President Salva Kiir blamed soldiers loyal to his former vice president, Riek Machar, for starting this month’s violence.

Tensions have been high in South Sudan since July, when Kiir dismissed Machar and the rest of the Cabinet. The move inflamed tensions between Kiir’s Dinka community and Machar’s Nuer community.

Casualties include soldiers and number in the hundreds, the government said.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Kiir on Saturday and discussed ways to halt the violence. It was Kerry’s second call to Kiir since Thursday night.

“Secretary Kerry emphasized that only through leadership and political dialogue will the challenges facing South Sudan be resolved,” State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement.

The two men “discussed the need to prevent ethnic violence, their concern for the welfare of thousands of internally displaced persons fleeing the conflict, as well as for the safety of U.S. citizens in South Sudan, and they agreed to speak again soon,” she said.

Meanwhile, the State Department issued an emergency message for U.S. citizens, calling on them to avoid the area around the airport in Bor. Limited flights were continuing from Juba International Airport.

On Friday, Kerry said he was sending a special envoy – Ambassador Donald Booth – to the country.

“Now is the time for South Sudan’s leaders to rein in armed groups under their control, immediately cease attacks on civilians, and end the chain of retributive violence between different ethnic and political groups,” Kerry said in a statement.

Saturday’s violence wasn’t the first this week to harm foreign troops in South Sudan. On Thursday, attackers killed two Indian army peacekeepers, wounded a third, and killed 20 of 30 civilians who were seeking refuge at the United Nations’ Akobo base, the U.N. said.

In a news release, the African Union called for an immediate truce.

It said that the chairwoman of the AU Commission, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, was “profoundly dismayed at the recent turn of events” and condemned the killing of innocent civilians and U.N. peacekeepers in Bor as a war crime.

South Sudan became the world’s newest country when it split from Sudan in July 2011. The split happened after a 2005 peace agreement ended years of civil war between the largely Animist and Christian south and the Muslim-dominated north.

The deal led to a January 2011 referendum in which people of the south voted to secede from Sudan.

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — With the announcement on Saturday that the U.S. and Russia have reached an agreement on securing Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, the American threat of U.S. military action was effectively taken off the table.

After more than two weeks of saber-rattling — and an unsuccessful effort by President Obama to win congressional and public support for a limited military strike — it was a last-minute diplomatic push led by the Russians that saved the day.

But the Obama administration is wading into the deal — which will undoubtedly be scrutinized by a Congress that is distrustful of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian President Bashar Assad — with eyes wide open.

""The international community expects the Assad regime to live up to its public commitments,"" Obama said in a statement Saturday afternoon. ""While we have made important progress, much more work remains to be done.""

Secretary of State John Kerry was even more blunt about U.S. caution.

""We have committed to a standard that says verify and verify,"" Kerry said at news conference in Geneva, where he and his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, announced the framework of the agreement to secure and destroy the Syrian chemical weapons stockpile.

In previous comments, Obama has made clear that trusting the Russians and Assad will not be easy.

The president's relationship with Putin is famously tense, with the two sparring over Syria policy and Putin's decision to give temporary asylum to former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden after he leaked a treasure trove of classified information on U.S. intelligence surveillance practices.

And the Russian president didn't engender any American confidence when he penned a commentary in The New York Times earlier this week in which he slammed Obama for speaking of American exceptionalism in making his case for military action against Syria and made the dubious claim that the rebels were responsible for chemical attacks against it own people.

""We are not just going to take Russia and Assad's word for it. We need to see concrete actions to demonstrate that Assad is serious about giving up his chemical weapons,"" Obama said in his weekly radio address that aired Saturday morning and was taped ahead of the deal being announced.

Among the fine details of the deal, which was hatched out over three days by Kerry and Lavrov, are: Syria's chemical weapons stockpile must be removed or destroyed by 2014, international inspections will begin by November, and the Syrians will offer full disclosure of its arsenal within a week.

The two sides also agreed that any potential violations by the Syrians would be taken to the United Nations Security Council — where the Russians have veto power — for response.

That element of the deal allows both sides to claim that they stood their ground on potential use of force for further violations by the Assad regime. Putin said it was unrealistic for the Americans to call on Assad to hand over weapons when facing the threat of military action, while Obama has refused to cede his authority to take such action.

If the framework is implemented, it would meet Obama's goals of taking away the Assad regime's ability to conduct another chemical attack. But the White House will have a harder time making its case that it truly held Assad responsible for carrying out the brutal Aug. 21 attack that killed 1,400 Syrian civilians on the outskirts of Damascus.

Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that under the terms of agreement ""Syria's willingness to follow through is very much an open question.""

The deal is far from perfect, and requires the administration to take a leap of faith in trusting the Syrians and Russians to keep their part of the deal.

But for Obama, it offered the best way out of his unpopular call for military action.

""Obama is a winner on this substantively, but the optics on this are bad,"" said Jim Walsh, an expert on international security at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's security studies program. ""Syria doesn't get bombed, and Assad is happy about that. The Russians are winners because they look like they are birthing a diplomatic solution to what was going to be another war in the Middle East.

""Obama is not going to get credit for this because of his critics at home, but on the substance it is a win,"" Walsh added.

After the last two weeks, the White House will take it."

If you’re trying to decide what to think about the deal struck between the major powers and Iran in Geneva, here’s a suggestion – imagine what would have happened if there had been no deal.

In fact, one doesn’t have to use much imagination. In 2003, Iran approached the United States with an offer to talk about its nuclear program. The George W. Bush administration rejected the offer because it believed that the Iranian regime was weak, had been battered by sanctions, and would either capitulate or collapse if Washington just stayed tough.

So there was no deal. What was the result? Iran had 164 centrifuges operating in 2003; today it has 19,000 centrifuges. Had the Geneva talks with Iran broken down, Iran would have continued expanding its nuclear program. Yes they are now under tough sanctions, but they were under sanctions then as well.

More from CNN: 20 questions about the deal

And yet, the number of centrifuges grew exponentially (Despite all the sanctions and sabotage, keep in mind, the costs of a nuclear program are small for an oil rich country like Iran.)

Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has been opposed to a deal. But is it in Israel’s interest that Iran’s program keep growing in size and scope? That’s a strategy that assumes that either Iran is heading for collapse, or that a military strike will take place that would permanently destroy Iran’s entire nuclear program. This seems more like wishful thinking than tough strategizing.

The agreement that the major powers have gotten in Geneva essentially freezes Iran’s program for six months – and rolls back some key aspects of it – while a permanent deal is negotiated. In return, Iran gets about $7 billion of sanctions relief, a fraction of what is in place against it. The main sanctions – against its oil and banking sectors – stay fully in place.

More from GPS: What would JFK have done about Iran?

This is a sensible deal – signed off on by France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China – but it is just an interim deal and not a historic rapprochement. And that’s why so much of the opposition to it is misplaced.

Washington has many points of disagreement with Tehran, from its opposition to Israel and its support of Hezbollah to its funding of Iraq militias. This is not like the opening to China – it’s more like an arms control deal with the Soviet Union, with two wary adversaries trying to find some common ground.

Many countries in the Middle East – from Israel to Saudi Arabia – have legitimate concerns about Iran. But many of these countries have also gotten used to having a permanent enemy against whom they could rail, focusing domestic attention, driving ideological and sectarian divides, and garnering support.

The Middle East is undergoing so much change. Perhaps this is one more change. And perhaps Iran will come in from the Cold. For now, this deal is just one step, not a seismic shift. But it is still a step forward."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/05/world-public-opinion-syria_n_3876187.html,2013-09-05 00:00:00,"['Executive Business', 'Global News Editor', 'The Huffington Post', 'Al Jazeera English Presenter']",World Public Opinion Sharply Opposed To Syria Strikes,"As the Obama administration seeks allies for its as-yet lonely campaign to inflict punitive missile strikes on Syria, those plans are confronting substantial distrust and resistance from citizens around the globe.

A joint report drawn from The Huffington Post's seven international editions finds striking public opposition to military intervention in Syria, with polls showing weak support for a strike in much of Europe as well as in the United States and Canada.

In the United States, only 25 percent of those surveyed in late August in a HuffPost/YouGov poll expressed support for a military strike in reaction to the lethal chemical weapons attack blamed widely on the regime of Syrian president Bashar Assad.

A poll conducted by the Pew Research Center and wrapped up Sept. 1 -– almost two weeks after the chemical weapons attack -– found only 29 percent in favor of a strike.

In France, where President Francois Hollande has pledged to join the United States in taking on Syria, public support for military intervention has been running at 45 percent, according to a recent CSA survey for Atlantico. Another poll conducted by Ifop for the newspaper Le Figaro found 55 percent in favor of intervention, yet only 41 percent approved of France joining in a military response.

In Britain, where polls have long shown consistent opposition to any form of intervention in Syria, neither allegations of chemical weapons use by the Assad regime nor the push for action from leaders in London and Washington has altered the opinion of a war-weary public.

A ComRes poll for the Independent newspaper published on Monday found that only 29 percent of people believe Britain should join the United States in launching air strikes against Syria to deter Assad from using chemical weapons, while 57 percent are outright opposed. Four out of five people assert that any military action against Syria requires the approval of the United Nations.

ComRes chairman Andrew Hawkins told The Huffington Post UK that he doesn’t believe a forthcoming report from the United Nations weapons inspectors will “move the dials, and neither would further chemical crimes by Assad -– at least on the scale seen so far.”

In Germany, public opinion has been running 58 percent against striking Syria, according to public television. And in Italy a recent poll by the IPR Institute found that 52 percent of the public opposed an attack on Syria even absent Italian involvement. About 57 percent of Italians opposed allowing Italian military bases to be used in assisting foreign strikes engaged in strikes.

No polls have been conducted to gauge Canadian opinion on military intervention, but fatigue from involvement in Afghanistan and a few anti-Syrian-intervention protests suggest Canadians are not eager to jump in. Canada has signaled that it will not offer military support for a potential U.S.-led strike on Syria, while lending voice to calls for action.

Signs of public opposition from around the globe resonate as a rebuke to the Obama administration as it presses to unleash weapons on Syria in response to a chemical weapons attack there blamed for the deaths of some 1,400 people.

Public resistance reflects a marked predilection against military intervention following disastrous wars involving foreign forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. This sentiment appears to run especially deep in France, which played a leading role in interventions in Libya and Mali over the past two years.

“In Mali, France went in alone, and in Libya, it was the spearhead,"" Jerome Fourquet, who heads the Opinion department at Ifop, told Le Huffington Post. ""Public opinion considers it not the job of the French to be the world’s policeman.”

Public opposition also speaks to a palpable distrust of the intelligence touted in Washington as justification for firing on Syria. Memories of the run-up to the Iraq war and bogus claims that then-Iraqi president Saddam Hussein harbored weapons of mass destruction have carried over to the conflict at hand.

Among the British public, the ComRes poll found that 62 percent of voters felt the “experience of the Iraq war means that Britain should keep out of any military conflicts in the Middle East for the foreseeable future.""

Another poll conducted by Survation for the Mail on Sunday newspaper found that 81 percent of people opposed to military action cited Iraq as an influence. Around 40 percent said that calls for air strikes in Syria by former Prime Minister Tony Blair –- a leading architect of the Iraq war -- had weakened, rather than strengthened the British government’s case.

Much of the public opposition to Syria strikes reflects the fact that the conflict there is viewed as a confined event -– a humanitarian disaster, yes, and a potentially dangerous regional crisis, but not a direct threat to people living in the countries being asked to marshal a military response.

Governments in Washington, London, France and Ottawa have portrayed the Assad regime's alleged use of chemical weapons as a threat to humanity everywhere -– the sort of cruelty and incivility that cannot be allowed with impunity. Yet despite efforts by President Barack Obama to stoke fears of chemical-weapon attacks against Americans and their allies, few people outside Syria fear for their own safety.

Hawkins, the ComRes chairman described “two key requirements” to gaining public support for military intervention abroad -- first, “a credible threat to the security of British citizens” and, second, “a reasonable prospect of success.""

Neither appears to apply to the Syria crisis, leaving those leaders pursuing military strikes at direct odds with their publics.

Still, analysts note that public opinion on armed intervention tends to be volatile, with patriotic surges and an impulse to support military forces typically following initial armed strikes.

Such was the dynamic in France in the case of Libya. In early March 2011, the French public was largely opposed to intervention in Libya, with only 36 percent expressing support in polls. But less than a month later, following the first French strikes in Libya, public support surged to 66 percent.

“What we saw was a patriotic reflex with public opinion rallying to the flag,"" Fourquet said. ""All the more so because risks were limited, as the intervention consisted exclusively of air strikes.”

And yet this same tendency for public opinion to fluctuate tends to work in reverse when military campaigns drag on: By the summer of 2011, as Moammar Gadhafi's regime fell in Libya, French approval for continued national involvement had just slipped below the 50 percent mark.

Another source of public unease is a sense that the military strikes could provoke an unforeseen regional conflagration, requiring a larger and more perilous intervention. So warns even a former member of the Syrian National Council, the coalition of opposition parties seeking to oust Assad.

""I could theoretically favor targeted and limited strikes, to exercise pressure and relaunch the political process, because there will be no military solution,"" the former SNC member, Randa Kassis, said in an exclusive interview with HuffPost Maghreb. ""But the problem with these strikes is the response of the regime. How will Western countries react then? Have they considered the risk. If one response leads to the next, what will the consequences be? A regional war, perhaps? I am against intervention, because we don't know the consequences.""

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-visit-kenya-only-1-day-africa-far-161055464.html,,[],Obama visit to Kenya? Only 1 day in Africa so far,"JOHANNESBURG (AP) — President Barack Obama promised to visit his father's homeland — Kenya — before the end of his presidency, but of the 51 country visits Obama made the last four years, America's first black president spent less than a day in sub-Saharan Africa. That could now change.

Presidential travel trends suggest Obama is likely to spend more time in Africa in his second term, a presidential historian said. Freed of domestic campaign politics, second-term presidents can travel more in a continent that has less strategic importance than Europe and Asia. A rising terror threat in Mali has also heightened the region's profile.

And then there's the promise: ""I'm positive that before my service as president is completed I will visit Kenya again,"" Obama said in a June 2010 interview with Kenya's state broadcaster.

That statement should mean a lot, because presidents don't make such promises lightly, said Brendon Doherty, an associate professor of political science at the U.S. Naval Academy who studies presidential travel patterns.

""Presidents do take special pleasure in traveling to places where they have ancestral ties,"" Doherty said, noting visits by Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and even Obama to Ireland, where each had family ties. ""Given the large role that Africa plays in the family history of President Obama, I'd be really surprised if he didn't travel there in the second term.""

Both Clinton and President George W. Bush took extended trips through Africa in their second terms. Clinton visited six countries in sub-Saharan Africa; Bush visited five. Obama's only visit to sub-Saharan Africa as president was a stopover of less than 24 hours in Ghana. While a U.S. Senator, Obama visited Ethiopia and Kenya, where he has several relatives.

""He is a Kenyan who many people want to see in person. I am proud that he is a Kenyan and that he is the president of a superpower,"" said Sam Ochieng, a political leader in Nairobi's largest slum, Kibera.

Story continues

Laura Seay, assistant professor of political science at Morehouse College who runs a blog called Texas in Africa, said Africa is a low priority for most American presidents because of geopolitical interests and historical ties, ""and that was the case in the Obama administration."" She added, though, that Africa is becoming more important to U.S. foreign policy interests.

Even that one trip to Ghana was better than some predecessors. Clinton did not travel to sub-Saharan Africa in his first term, and Reagan never did. President George H.W. Bush traveled to Somalia; President Jimmy Carter, the first president to go to sub-Saharan Africa while in office, traveled to Nigeria.

An Associated Press review of presidential travel shows Europe and North America got the most visits during the Carter-to-Obama period. France led with 24 visits; the U.K. had 23; Canada and Germany had 20; Mexico and Italy had 19.

J. Peter Pham, an Africa specialist at the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C. think tank, noted that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made Africa a diplomatic priority in Obama's first term, visiting 23 of the continent's 54 countries. Pham said Obama has yet to fully deploy ""the immense personal capital"" he has on reserve in Africa.

The White House and State Department declined to comment on whether Obama will spend more time in Africa. Johnnie Carson, the State Department's top Africa official, said this month that the Obama administration has helped Somalia stabilize and South Sudan gain independence and that the U.S. has provided more aid to Africa the last four years than any other country.

Obama's national security adviser said in November that the president's time is the White House's most valuable resource, and Doherty said Obama's lack of time in Africa reflects compelling global priorities, not a lack of importance for Africa.

Though Obama's father is Kenyan, there is a perception that the younger George W. Bush did a lot more for Africa and Africans, said Seay, especially after the creation of the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR, a $15 billion commitment to fight HIV/AIDS.

But even if Obama hopes to visit his father's homeland, he may not be able to politically if Kenya's March presidential election turns as violent as the last one. One top presidential contender faces trial at the International Criminal Court over accusations he orchestrated tribal violence that killed more than 1,000 Kenyans in 2007-08.

""It's certainly the case that presidents of both parties spend more time in countries that have long traditions of clean democratic elections,"" said Doherty, the author of ""The Rise of the President's Permanent Campaign."" ''I would not be surprised if the aftermath of the Kenyan elections last time added to the president's team's hesitance to send him to Kenya.""

Seay said that if this year's election goes smoothly, she wouldn't be surprised if Obama visits. Many in Kenya would love to see that happen.

""He is a symbol for hope, and a role model for upcoming politicians who can change the way Kenya is run by following his footsteps,"" said Ochieng, the Kenyan political leader. ""Kenyan politicians can learn from Obama that politics should be issue-based, not the tribal kind of politics we practice here.""

But on Wednesday, Mr. Rouhani set off a political storm here and in Iran, with an acknowledgment and condemnation of the Holocaust that landed him in precisely the kind of tangled dispute he had hoped to avoid.

Mr. Rouhani, in an interview on Tuesday with CNN, described the Holocaust as a “crime that the Nazis committed towards the Jews” and called it “reprehensible and condemnable.” It was a groundbreaking statement, given that his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, denied the systematic extermination of Jews during World War II. Mr. Rouhani largely repeated his comments in a meeting with news media executives on Wednesday.

But a semiofficial Iranian news agency accused CNN of fabricating portions of Mr. Rouhani’s interview, saying he had not used the word Holocaust or characterized the Nazi mass murder as “reprehensible.” Mr. Rouhani spoke in Persian; officials at CNN said they used an interpreter provided by the Iranian government for the interview, which was conducted by Christiane Amanpour.

The dispute over his comments reflects the extreme delicacy of the Holocaust as an issue in Iranian-American relations. More broadly, it speaks to the political tightrope Mr. Rouhani is walking, trying to negotiate a nuclear deal with the United States that will ease sanctions to please everyday Iranians, without provoking a backlash by hard-liners."

Chivers', 'Eric Schmitt']","Taking Outsize Role in Syria, Qatar Funnels Arms to Rebels","The Obama administration quietly blessed the shipments to Libya of machine guns, automatic rifles, mortars and ammunition, but American officials later grew concerned as evidence grew that Qatar was giving the weapons to Islamic militants there.

American and Arab officials have expressed worry about something similar happening in Syria, where Islamists in the north have turned into the most capable section of the opposition, in part because of the weapons from Qatar. Saudi Arabia recently has tried to wrest control from Qatar and take a greater role in managing the weapons shipments to Syrian rebels, but officials and outside experts said the Qatari shipments continue. The greatest worry is over the shoulder-fired missiles — called man-portable air-defense systems — that Qatar has sent to Syria since the beginning of the year. Videos posted online show rebels in Syria with the weapons, including the Chinese FN-6 models provided by Qatar, and occasionally using them in battle.

The first videos surfaced in February and showed rebels wielding the Chinese missiles, which had not been seen in the conflict previously and were not known to be in Syrian government possession. .

Western officials and rebels alike say these missiles were provided by Qatar, which bought them from an unknown seller and brought them to Turkey. The shipment was at least the second antiaircraft transfer under the Qataris’ hand, they said. A previous shipment of Eastern bloc missiles had come from former Qaddafi stockpiles.

The shipments were small, the Western officials and rebels said, amounting to no more than a few dozen missiles. And rebels said the Chinese shipments have been plagued with technical problems, and sometimes fail to fire. The first FN-6s were seen in the custody of groups under the Free Syrian Army banner, suggesting that they were being distributed, at least initially, to fighters backed by the United States and not directly to extremists or groups with ties to Al Qaeda.

American and Arab officials said that Qatar’s strategy was a mixture of ideology — the ruling family’s belief in a prominent role for Islam in political life — and more hard-nosed calculations.

“They like to back winners,” one Middle Eastern official said.

In meetings with Mr. Obama, the leaders of Jordan and the United Arab Emirates have expressed a host of grievances about the Qatari shipments and have complained that Qatar is pursuing a reckless strategy."

New Brunswick has had 1,954 confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic started just over a year ago. There have been 1,773 recoveries so far. A total of 295,822 tests have been conducted, including 1,339 on Sunday. UNB residence elevator eyed as possible source Public Health is investigating whether an elevator could be the source of transmission in the University of New Brunswick's Fredericton campus residence COVID-19 outbreak that still stands at 12 positive cases, as of Monday. Last week, Public Health and UNB looked into the ventilation system at Magee House and determined ""the risk is minimal,"" said Department of Health spokesperson Bruce Macfarlane. ""Public Health officials are now focusing their efforts to determine surface contacts within the elevator as the potential source of transmission,"" he said in an email. UNB's Magee House residence has about 180 adults and children living in the 101 apartment-style units, according to resident Martin Kutnowski.(Ed Hunter/CBC) According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, COVID-19 spreads from an infected person to others through respiratory droplets and aerosols (smaller droplets) created when an infected person talks, sings, shouts, coughs or sneezes. COVID-19 can also spread by touching something that has the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes with unwashed hands, the agency's website states. The outbreak at Magee House involves the variant first reported in India, which has two mutations that make it ""more concerning than all the others,"" Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Jennifer Russell has said. It is ""very, very, very aggressive in terms of being contagious and causing more severe symptoms."" Magee House is a seven-storey apartment-style residence designed for mature students, some of whom have families. The residents remain in isolation as Public Health deals with the outbreak. Paul Mazerolle, president and vice-chancellor of the University of New Brunswick, says isolation needs to happen at Magee House to prevent the spread of COVID-19.(Ed Hunter/CBC) Meanwhile, the UNB campus reopened Monday, as did the adjacent St Thomas University campus and nearby New Brunswick Community College campus, more than a week after they moved to essential services only in response to the outbreak. Faculty, staff and students can now go on campus as long as they follow relevant operational guidelines. ""COVID is difficult,"" said Paul Mazerolle, president of the University of New Brunswick. ""The uncertainty creates concern and we're not through this."" Monday marks day nine of the Magee House lockdown, and a third round of mass testing was scheduled for residents and staff on Sunday. As of Monday afternoon, Public Health was still awaiting the results. Alex Hill-Stosky, who lives with his family in Magee House, said many people in the building are either anxious or angry because of the lockdown. ""A lot of people feel we are test subjects rather than people,"" said the engineering student. Residents of Magee House at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton are in quarantine after at least 12 people tested positive for COVID-19. (Maria Jose Burgos/CBC) Mazerolle said he understands people are concerned and worried about their personal freedoms, but it's important to limit the spread of the virus. ""To minimize the potential spread, unfortunately people's movements need to be restricted for a limited period of time. … If we didn't restrict movement, we could be in a much worse situation."" Students have also expressed concerns over the residence's ventilation system. Mazerolle said the ventilation system has been checked twice and deemed safe by engineers with Public Health and the Department of Environment. ""From what I've been told by the experts, there's no evidence to suggest that the ventilation system is putting people at risk for COVID-19. Mazerolle expects Magee House to reopen on Saturday. ""We're looking forward to this coming to an end,"" he said. Public Health said the isolation period for Magee House individuals who have tested negative throughout the process could end Saturday. Meanwhile, the isolation for residents and staff of UNB's Elizabeth Parr-Johnston residence could be lifted as early as Wednesday, depending on the results of retests taking place Monday, said Public Health. So far, all test results have been negative. George Street Middle School reopens George Street Middle School in Fredericton reopened Monday, six days after students, staff and their families were urged by Public Health to self-isolate last week following a confirmed case of COVID-19. In a letter to parents on Sunday, Public Health said students and staff can return to school, and their families can return to work, with the exception of those who have been told by Public Health to self-isolate for 14 days. New Brunswick Public Health confirmed a case of COVID-19 at George Street Middle School in Fredericton last week.(Elizabeth Fraser/CBC) ""Custodial services have been through the school disinfecting high touch areas,"" said Dr. Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health. ""Everyone who has not been identified as a close contact should feel confident to return to normal activities."" The George Street and UNB cases are linked, Public Health said earlier. Voting in self-isolation Elections New Brunswick is encouraging people who are under COVID-19 isolation and haven't voted in the May 10 municipal election yet but wish to do so to contact their local returning office to find out what options are available. With election day less than a week away, the options available are starting to decrease, said Kim Poffenroth, municipal election officer. Municipal election officer Kim Poffenroth asks everyone to be patient as election officials, who are all temporary workers hired for just a few days of work, do their best to deliver these elections during the 'unusual and challenging circumstances of this pandemic.'(Screenshot/ParlVu) ""Our municipal returning officers will gladly work with these individuals to determine the best way to arrange for them to vote, based on their current situation,"" she said in a statement. Options may include voting by mail, if time permits, curbside voting, and other forms of contactless voting. ""We will do our utmost to make sure every New Brunswicker is provided with the opportunity to vote, while at the same time respecting public health rules and protecting the thousands of people working for us during these elections,"" Poffenroth said.

Story highlights NEW: Centrist candidate Rouhani is top vote-getter in very early results State media reports about 70% voter turnout in a nation of 50 million eligible voters If no candidate gets a majority, there will be a runoff next week The last election resulted in bloody street protests known as the ""Green Movement""

(CNN) —

The lines extended into the streets at times Friday, as voters waited to pick their choice to succeed two-term President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the country’s 11th presidential election.

Some 70% of some 50 million registered voters – men and women, young and old – turned out according to state broadcaster Press TV, to pick a man who’ll deal with high-stakes challenges domestically and internationally.

And now the results are starting to trickle in.

Based on two sets of still very early results, centrist candidate Hassan Rouhani had more votes than any other candidate, Interior Ministry officials said early Saturday.

As of about 7:15 a.m. Saturday (10:45 p.m. ET Friday), Rouhani had 834,859 votes; Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf had 320,562; Saeed Jalili had 257,822; Mohsen Rezaei had 214,368; Ali-Akbar Velayati had 106,144; and Mohammad Gharazi had 25,324.

Even counted cumulatively, these votes represented a small fraction of the total vote. If the 70% turnout figure is correct, there would be about 35 million votes; the early results reflect about 1.76 million.

When the final tally does come in, that doesn’t necessarily mean the election is over. If no single candidate gets more than half the vote, the top two finishers will face off in a runoff next Friday, June 21.

That victor will take Ahmadinejad’s mantle as one of the most visible figures, at a time it’s dealing with widespread sanctions tied to international anger over its nuclear program.

But he won’t be Iran’s most powerful man. That distinction belongs to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has been Iran’s supreme leader since 1989. He’s got plenty of backing, from conservative citizens to loyalist militia groups to, most notably, the Revolutionary Guard.

Earlier, British Prime Minister David Cameron told CNN’s Richard Quest that the international community “will have to deal with whatever the situation is.”

Powerful support

It was Iran’s Guardian Council, an unelected body made up of six clerics and six lawyers operating under the oversight of the supreme leader, that drew up the restricted list of candidates from the 680 who initially registered.

The final six contenders didn’t include any women. Nor did they include Ahmadinejad’s aide and protege Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, who was among those excluded by the Guardian Council.

Velayati, Ghalibaf and Jalili, who is Iran’s chief nuclear negotiator, are considered close to Khamenei and would be unlikely to challenge his authority. Of the three, Jalili has seen the most popular support going into the vote.

Rouhani had the backing of the highly influential former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and appears to have won over parts of Iran’s subdued reform movement.

Hours into the voting Friday, Rouhani complained of a voting irregularity. A reform candidate, Mohammed Aref, who dropped out of the race earlier in the week, was still on some ballots.

Rouhani was worried that voters might mistakenly select Aref, which would amount to a vote thrown away. It was not clear how many ballot papers were concerned.

CNN’s view on the streets of Tehran

Iran’s semi-official Mehr News reported via Twitter that voting lines got longer in the afternoon, and that there were insufficient voting slips in some polling stations.

CNN’s Erin Burnett on 2013 vs. 2009 elections

2009 chaos

Four years ago, when allegations of election fraud sparked widespread protests, Iran’s police and the Basij, a feared paramilitary group, cracked down on the opposition Green Movement.

Protesters were jailed, and human rights groups alleged many were tortured and killed behind bars while the government quashed the uprising.

Reform politicians representing the movement, including Ahmadinejad’s election rival, former Prime Minister Mir Hossein Moussavi, have been under house arrest since 2011.

Despite the unrest, Ahmadinejad’s re-election was formally certified by the clerical establishment.

Since his reelection, conservative politicians close to the supreme leader have assailed Ahmadinejad for being too liberal, and he has often been at odds with Khamenei.

Some of Ahmadinejad’s associates have faced heavy repression, and hardliners attempted to link the president to the largest embezzlement case in the country’s history.

Ahead of the vote this time round, campaigning was more muted although Khamenei’s office repeated his call to the ballot boxes Friday with posts on social networking site Twitter.

“I humbly expect from our nation to participate all in #IranElection & do this as soon as possible,” the supreme leader’s post said.

Voting is not mandatory in Iran, but there are major incentives to push people to the polls. An active voter has a better shot at promotions in the workplace and preference when it comes to collecting social welfare benefits.

This can be vital in an economy that is chronically weighed down by international sanctions over nuclear concerns.

Khamenei also tweeted a jab at the United States, which has often led the charge to tighten those sanctions.

“I have heard that #USpoliticians said they don’t recognize #IranianElection. Hell with their recognition!” he said.

Clampdown on dissent?

Rights group Amnesty International said this week that it was “concerned by evidence that the Iranian authorities are intensifying their clampdown on dissent” in the run-up to the vote.

“Those targeted include political activists, journalists and other media workers, trade unionists, advocates of greater rights for Iran’s religious and ethnic minorities, students and others. In many cases, the full reasons for arrest and detention are not known; in others, those arrested have been brought before the courts on sweeping but vaguely worded charges, convicted and sentenced to prison terms,” it said.

The head of language services for BBC World Service, Liliane Landor, also complained Thursday of “unacceptable harassment” of its staff and other independent journalists in Iran.

“The BBC is very concerned by the unprecedented levels of intimidation being suffered by families of BBC Persian Service staff living in Iran in the final days of the presidential election campaign,” she said.

“The harassment has included threats that relatives will lose jobs and pensions and be prevented from traveling abroad. For the first time the lives of BBC Persian TV staff living in the UK have also been threatened.”

Iran’s Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance, Mohammad Hosseini, said more than 2,000 local reporters and 450 foreign journalists were covering the election in Iran.

The head of the Foreign Reporters Bureau within the ministry, Alireza Shirvani, said the number of foreign reporters covering the presidential election had increased by about 15% compared with four years ago.

Called the Apollo Lunar Landing Legacy Act, the bill was introduced Monday (July 8) by Rep. Donna Edwards of (D-Md.) and was co-sponsored by Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas).

The bill (House Resolution 2617) was referred to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, and in addition to the House Committee on Natural Resources. [See photos of the Apollo moon landing sites today]

Protect sites for posterity

Noting that the Apollo lunar program was one of the greatest achievements in American history, the bill notes that, as commercial enterprises and foreign nations acquire the ability to land on the moon, ""it is necessary to protect the Apollo lunar landing sites for posterity.""

In part, the bill calls for no later than one year after the date of enactment of the act, ""there shall be established as a unit of the National Park System the Apollo Lunar Landing Sites National Historical Park.""

Creating such a park will expand and enhance the protection and preservation of the Apollo lunar landing sites, the bill states, ""and provide for greater recognition and public understanding of this singular achievement in American history.""

Astronauts and instruments

In the bill, ""Apollo lunar landing sites"" refer to all areas of the moon where astronauts and instruments connected to the Apollo program between 1969 and 1972 touched the lunar surface.

The bill also spotlights the artifacts on the surface of the moon associated with the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission, ""which had an instrumentality crash land on the lunar surface April 14, 1970,"" the bill states.

Exactly what this passage suggests isn't spelled out, although on April 14, 1970, the Apollo 13 mission's Saturn IVB upper stage impacted the moon north of Mare Cognitum. That human-caused impact crater, which is roughly 100 feet (30 meters) in diameter, has been imaged by the super-sharp camera system onboard NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.

Lunar National Park duties

The Secretary of the Interior is identified in the bill as the administrator of the historical park. That agency would work with NASA under an agreement that hammers out respective duties and responsibilities to manage the park.

Those duties include ensuring the proper monitoring of the Apollo lunar landing sites; managing access to the sites, including through coordination with other spacefaring nations and entities; and ensuring an accurate cataloguing of items in the park (in conjunction with the director of the Smithsonian Institution).

The bill also calls for the heads of the Department of the Interior and NASA to ""submit the Apollo 11 lunar landing site to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for designation as a World Heritage Site"" no later than one year after the park's establishment.

Really? An entire segment on a handshake? Good grief; pandering to an audience — Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) December 10, 2013

—

The irony of an MSNBC anchor accusing another network of pandering to their audience requires no explanation.

Todd joins CNN, Politico’s Dylan Byers, and a number of other elite members of the media in revealing his frustration over negative coverage of a historic handshake between a Cuban dictator and an American president. It should also be noted that until today, meetings of any kind between an American president and another world leader were considered legitimate news.

Because of this sudden change in policy, the pushback from the mainstream media on the handshake has been fierce. Few would question the media’s devotion to Obama and their support for his left-wing agenda. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the media fears the handshake will overshadow the positive coverage the media is already giving to Obama’s Memorial speech.

When challenged on this pandering charge, Todd responded that he does not pander to his audience:

—

@jpodhoretz I don’t pander to an audience. — Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) December 10, 2013

While Todd is certainly very good at his job and much more professional than his MSNBC colleagues, anyone who watched The Daily Rundown’s obsession over gun control in the wake of Sandy Hook or the show’s relentless tearing down of Mitt Romney over rape comments made by an Indiana Senate candidate, could argue that while better, Todd has been far from perfect in this regard.

But back to my question: When exactly did a historic handshake between an American president and a world leader stop being news? When did dissecting the handshake, eye contact, and body language of such a meeting stop being a media sport?

Apparently, the moment such a meeting might distract from giving Obama a positive news cycle.

(CNN) —

Anti-Semitism, arguably the most enduring and murderous ethnic prejudice in human history, has always adapted to the prevailing social, political and technological conditions.

In our global age of international flows and world politics and communication, anti-Semitism has become global, and it is in no small measure due to digital technologies: the Internet and satellite television. Anti-Semitism now reaches vast parts of the world where there are no Jews. And the people who rely most on the Internet, the young, are the most innocent and susceptible to believing the prejudices they come across.

Digital technology has become a game changer for anti-Semitism, and for prejudices and hatreds in general, including against African-Americans.

Never before has prejudice toward Jews been so widely present around the world in places where the hated people are present and especially where they don’t even live, as a Pew Global Attitudes Survey of 24 countries reveals. Jews form .2% of the world’s population, with the vast majority in just two countries, Israel and the United States. Yet in Europe, where Germans and many other Europeans slaughtered 6 million Jews in the Holocaust, a shocking amount of anti-Semitism still exists.

Across the Arab world there is almost uniformly poisonous anti-Semitism, including instances of Arab leaders, imams, and ordinary people saying that Jews are the children of apes and pigs. More amazing is that in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia, anti-Semitism is widespread. Fifty percent of Brazilians, 43% of Nigerians, and 55% of Chinese surveyed by Pew said they had an unfavorable opinion of Jews, even though in Brazil Jews form .05% of the population, and in the other countries there are barely any Jews at all. Even in the United States, where anti-Semitism is lowest among major countries, according to the Anti-Defamation League’s index of anti-Semitism, “15 percent of Americans fall in the most anti-Semitic cohort.”

Digital technology has critically contributed to the explosion of anti-Semitism in five ways:

While before a person had to be personally exposed, through people or perhaps a book, to vile characterizations of Jews, today anti-Semitism is prominently available everywhere anytime – to those seeking it out or to the innocent person just looking for information. Typing “Jew” into Google or Bing returns a top site (sometimes No. 2) called JewWatch, which is a vast emporium of anti-Semitic accusations and hatred claiming 1.5 billion pages in support of its mission to defame and eliminate Jews and their supposed power. This is but one of tens of thousands of anti-Semitic hate sites, which include a growing alternative to Wikipedia, called Metapedia, which seeks to create (currently in 18 languages) an anti-Semitic informational universe.

Second, while before new anti-Semitic accusations and initiatives traveled slowly if at all, today they can spread like wildfire over entire regions or the world, picked up by news or community websites coursing through the Internet and beamed to viewers on national, regional, or international television networks. This can be true of blood libels such as that Jews harvest Palestinian organs, of alleged plots to conquer and colonize Patagonia, or–more routinely–false accusations of Israeli atrocities. It is true of the frequent speeches by political and religious leaders urging the annihilation of Jews.

Third, you now have for the first time international and virtual communities of anti-Semitic hatred. Through digital technology, anti-Semites find validation from and communion with anti-Semites elsewhere in their own countries and around the world. Everything we know about prejudice shows that when it is shared in communities, and especially when political or religious leaders openly express hatred of a group, such bigotry is powerfully sustained and spread.

Fourth, the Internet and digital technology has integrated different streams of anti-Semitism into a global anti-Semitic amalgam. Muslim anti-Semites adopt anti-Semitic Christian motifs (to win Christians to their cause), regularly depicting in speeches and political cartoons the Palestinians as the modern crucified Christ! Leftist anti-Semites, neo-Nazi anti-Semites, old fashioned Christian anti-Semites, and, of course Arab and Islamic anti-Semites share common cause in their demonization of Israel.

Fifth, digital technology has also lifted all anti-Semitic restraints. With the anonymity of the Internet, and with the total lack of anti-Semitic inhibition coming from the Arab and Islamic worlds – its commonplace demonizing and dehumanization characterizations of Jews and calls for the extermination of Jews around the world – what anti-Semites say and see as thinkable action goes well beyond, in ferocity and murderousness, even Nazi Germany’s profoundly anti-Semitic discourse. Not just the Jews of Israel but Jews everywhere are endangered.

Digital technology has transformed anti-Semitism into an essential part of the substructure of prejudice around the entire world. To become inundated with it, all you have to do is, innocently or not, enter the word “Jew” into your browser, and then start clicking.

But this surge in anti-Semitism also shows the way to combating it, by using legal means and political pressure to get Internet providers, social media sites and search engines to adhere to their own terms of usage, and to the laws of democratic countries – especially forceful in Europe – which prohibit hate speech.

Edward Snowden has been given asylum in Russia

Lon Snowden says he doubts his son will return to the U.S.

Edward Snowden was stuck at a Moscow airport for more than a month

MOSCOW (AP) — Four former U.S. government officials who met with former National Security Agency systems analyst Edward Snowden said Thursday that he is adjusting to life in Russia and expresses no regrets about leaking highly classified information. Separately, Snowden's father arrived to see his son.

The Americans, who once worked for the CIA, FBI, Justice Department and NSA, have criticized the U.S. government and in some cases exposed what they believed was wrongdoing in the its security agencies. They are the first Americans known to have met with Snowden since he was granted asylum in Russia in August.

In interviews with The Associated Press, they described spending the previous evening with Snowden to present him with the Sam Adams Award for Integrity in Intelligence.

""He spoke about going out and about and getting to understand Russia and its culture and the people,"" said Thomas Drake, a former NSA executive who gave inside information to a newspaper about an electronic espionage program that he saw as invasive. ""This is where he lives now, and so where you live is your home.""

Snowden's father, Lon, did not say when or where he would meet his 30-year-old son, but expressed optimism about his situation.

""You know, I have heard so many things through the media, and my assumption is certainly, given the circumstances, he's doing as well as could be expected,"" Lon Snowden told the AP shortly after he arrived in Moscow. ""He's safe and he's free, and that's a good thing.""

The elder Snowden said he doubts his son will return to the United States, where he is charged with violating the Espionage Act for disclosing the NSA's surveillance of phone and Internet usage around the world.

The four former U.S. officials refused to say where they met with Snowden or where he is living.

""For his own safety it's best that no one else knows where he actually lives,"" Drake said. ""But I believe he is making the best of his circumstances and is living as normally as possible.""

Like Snowden, Drake was indicted under the Espionage Act, but the felony charges were dropped before trial and he was convicted on a lesser charge and sentenced to one year of probation and community service.

Drake and the other Americans — Raymond McGovern, Jesselyn Radack and Coleen Rowley — said Snowden was in good spirits and still believes he did the right thing in disclosing the NSA surveillance program.

They said they saw no evidence that Snowden was under the control of Russian security services, as many in the U.S. government believe.

""He spoke very openly about a whole range of things, a number of which I won't get into here, but it certainly didn't involve any kind of manipulation by the Russian government or anyone else for that matter,"" said Radack, a former Justice Department adviser now with the Government Accountability Project. ""He definitely is his own person and makes his own decisions and says and does what he wants to.""

Snowden's asylum status has strained the already tense relationship between the U.S. and Russia."

Officials opened door to direct talks if conditions are met

Gaining China%27s commitment%2C Kerry said%2C was no small matter

Concerns raised that North may deliver another provocation soon

TOKYO (AP) — The United States and Japan on Sunday offered new talks with North Korea to resolve the increasingly dangerous standoff over its nuclear and missile programs, but said the reclusive communist government first must lower tensions and honor previous agreements.

North Korea has a clear course of action available to it, and will find ""ready partners"" in the United States if it follows through, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters.

Japan's foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, who appeared with Kerry at a news conference, was more explicit, saying that North Korea must honor its commitment to earlier deals regarding its nuclear and missile programs and on returning kidnapped foreigners.

The officials agreed on the need to work toward a nuclear-free North Korea and opened the door to direct talks if certain conditions are met.

Their comments highlight the difficulty in resolving the North Korean nuclear situation in a peaceful manner, as pledged by Kerry and Chinese leaders in Beijing on Saturday.

Gaining China's commitment, Kerry insisted, was no small matter given Beijing's historically strong military and economic ties to North Korea.

The issue has taken on fresh urgency in recent months, given North Korea's tests of a nuclear device and intercontinental ballistic missile technology, and its increasingly brazen threats of nuclear strikes against the United States.

U.S. and South Korean officials believe the North may deliver another provocation in the coming days with a mid-range missile test.

""The question,"" Kerry said, ""is what steps do you take now so we are not simply repeating the cycle of the past years."" That was a clear reference to the various negotiated agreements and U.N. Security Council ultimatums that North Korea has violated since the 1990s.

""We have to be careful and thoughtful and frankly not lay out publicly all the options,"" Kerry said.

Given their proximity and decades of hostility and distrust, Japan and South Korea have the most to fear from the North's unpredictable actions.

Kerry said the U.S. would defend both its allies at all cost.

He also clarified a statement he made Saturday in Beijing, when he told reporters the U.S. could scale back its missile-defense posture in the region if North Korea goes nuclear-free.

It appeared to be a sweetener to coax tougher action from China, which has done little over the years to snuff out funding and support for North Korea's weapons of mass destruction program.

China fears the increased U.S. military presence in the region may be directed at it as well.

Kerry said America's basic force posture wasn't up to debate. ""There is no discussion that I know of to change that,"" he said.

But he said it was logical that additional missile-defense elements, including a land-based system for the Pacific territory of Guam, deployed because of the Korean threat could be reversed if that threat no longer existed.

""There's nothing actually on the table with respect to that. I was simply making an observation about the rationale for that particular deployment, which is to protect the United States' interests that are directly threatened by North Korea,"" Kerry said.

Kerry's visit to Japan followed two days of meetings in South Korea and China."

In an apparent first for a world leader visiting the White House, Chilean President Sebastian Pinera on Tuesday briefly co-opted the President of the United States’ – in this case obviously Barack Obama – Oval Office desk.

""I’m going to sit at the President of the United States’ desk,"" Pinera states in Spanish before undertaking the bit of foolery that reportedly broke all manner of long-held White House protocols for visiting leaders, according to a YouTube video of the unfortunate event.

[pullquote]

Pinera then decisively rounds the hallowed workspace at which Lincoln, Roosevelt – both Teddy and Franklin D. -- JFK and 40 others penned into law untold acts of world-changing legislation, not to mention declarations of war and related political bric-a-brac – and makes himself rather comfortably at home, although without, thankfully, going so far as to put his feet up on the desk.

Perhaps to break the obvious tension, Alfredo Moreno Charme, the Chilean Minister of Foreign Affairs, reportedly asked a seemingly awestruck Obama, ""How many other presidents have done the same?""

To his credit, a cordial and by-then-bemused Obama, who quickly recovered from his initial and barely perceptible bout of surprise, responded in Spanish, “Este es el unico,” or, “This is the only one.”

Boisterous laughter ensued among the more than dozen or so dignitaries arranged around the history-laden room, at which point Pinera awkwardly justified the gaffe by explaining, ""You know my daughter was born here.”

And, indeed, Pinera, a billionaire businessman who ascended in 2010 to his country’s highest office, has rather rich American ties.

He reportedly spent some early childhood in New York City, and attended Harvard University before attaining a degree from the prestigious school. However, his political career has reportedly been beset by the sort of obvious failures he rarely – if ever – experienced in the business world.

The reported ample archive of his sundry missteps has reportedly given way to his countrymen’s characterization of similar clownishness as the one apparent on Tuesday in the Oval Office as “Pineri-cosas.”"

In the latest ratcheting up of the administration’s effort to stop Congress from adding to existing sanctions, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Americans are in a deeply antiwar mood and implied that voters might turn their anger on lawmakers if a failure of diplomacy leads to military action to prevent Iran from getting the bomb.

“The American people do not want a march to war,” Carney told reporters.

“The American people justifiably and understandably prefer a peaceful solution that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and this agreement, if it’s achieved, has the potential to do that,” he said, referring to the deal that the U.S. and five other nations have been negotiating with Iran. “The alternative is military action.”

The administration has been lobbying against new sanctions on Iran since last summer, contending they could drive Tehran from the negotiating table or splinter the international coalition that has been cooperating on sanctions, which are designed to convince Tehran it should to accept limits on its nuclear program. New economic penalties, on top of years of earlier sanctions, could also strengthen hard-liners in Tehran who want to see the collapse of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s diplomatic initiative, officials warn.

Many nations fear Iran is seeking a nuclear weapons capability, despite its contention that it is seeking peaceful applications of nuclear energy.

Diplomats from the U.S., France, China, Russia, Germany and Britain said they had been unable to seal a preliminary deal with Iran during weekend talks in Geneva aimed at launching comprehensive negotiations on Tehran’s nuclear program. They said lower-level officials would return to Geneva on Nov. 20 to resume efforts to end the diplomatic stalemate.

Many U.S. lawmakers of both parties have spurned the administration’s appeals. Some members of Congress believe that the two rounds of international negotiations since mid-October have shown the administration is ready to accept too lenient a deal, and they want to sharply step up pressure on Iran.

The administration intensified its lobbying effort this week. Vice President Joe Biden called Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), and Secretary of State John F. Kerry plans to meet in closed session Wednesday with members of the Senate Banking Committee, which is weighing legislation that would mirror sanctions approved by the House in August.

Kerry will ask for a “temporary pause” in sanctions to make sure that “our legislative strategy and our negotiating strategy are running hand in hand,” Jen Psaki, a State Department spokeswoman, said Tuesday.

Suzanne Maloney, an Iran specialist at the Brookings Institution’s Saban Center, said the White House warning about antiwar sentiment is effective. But the alternative to diplomacy “is not war, it’s lousier diplomatic options,” she tweeted.

Mỹ và Anh cảnh báo sẽ “đáp trả mạnh mẽ” nếu xác nhận ̣được Chính phủ Syria đã sử dụng vũ khí hóa học hồi tuần trước.

Thủ tướng Anh David Cameron và Tổng thống Mỹ Barack Obama đã có cuộc điện đàm kéo dài 40 phút vào thứ Bảy ngày 24/8, văn phòng ông Cameron cho biết.

Cả hai đều “quan ngại sâu sắc” trước việc “ngày càng có nhiều dấu hiệu cho thấy chính quyền Syria đã thực hiện nhiều cuộc tấn công sử dụng vũ khí hóa học.”

Chính phủ Syria và phe đối lập đã cáo buộc nhau về vụ tấn công này.

Quân nổi dậy và các nhà hoạt động đố́i lập cáo buộc các lực lượng ủng hộ Tổng thống Syria Bashar al-Assad đã tấn công hóa học xung quanh thủ đô Damascus vào ngày 21/8, trong khi truyền hình nhà nước cáo ngược lại quân nổi dậy.

'Xem xét các lựa chọn'

“Hội đồng Bảo an Liên Hiệp Quốc đã kêu gọi cho các thanh sát viên của Liên Hiệp Quốc hiện đang ở Damascus tiếp cận hiện trường ngay lập tức,” thông cáo của Phố Downing cho biết.

“Việc Tổng thống Assad không chịu hợp tác với Liên Hiệp Quốc cho thấy chế độ này có điều gì đó phải giấu giếm.”

Thông cáo cũng cho biết Cameron và Obama đã “lặp lại rằng việc sử dụng rộng rãi vũ khí hóa học sẽ dẫn đến sự đáp trả mạnh mẽ của cộng đồng quốc tế và hai nhà lãnh đạo đã ra lệnh cho các quan chức xem xét tất cả các lựa chọn.

Tổng thống Obama trước đó đã cho triệu tập Hội đồng An ninh Quốc gia để xem xét những sự lựa chọn hành động tại Syria.

“Tổng thống đã yêu cầu các cơ quan tình báo thu thập thông tin và chứng cứ để xác định điều gì đã xảy ra tại Syria,” một quan chức Nhà Trắng nói với hãng tin Pháp AFP.

“Chúng tôi đang có một số sự lựa chọn đã sẵn sàng vào lúc này, và chúng tôi sẽ hành động hết sức cẩn trọng để đưa ra những quyết định dựa trên lợi ích quốc gia cũng như những đánh giá của chúng tôi về việc làm thúc nào để thúc đẩy các mục tiêu ở Syria.”

Hôm thứ Bảy ngày 24/8, Bộ trưởng Quốc phòng Mỹ Chuck Hagel nói Lầu Năm Góc đã trình các lựa chọn lên cho ông Obama và ông cũng cho biết quân đội Mỹ đã được di chuyển để chuẩn bị cho một hành động có thể nhằm vào Syria.

Thông tín viên chính trị của BBC, Iain Watson, nói ông hiểu rằng “đáp trả mạnh mẽ” nêu trong thông cáo trên không bao gồm “đổ quân trên bộ.”

Tuy nhiên những lựa chọn khác cũng không bị loại trừ, ông nói thêm, trong đó có khả năng không kích.

Watson cũng cho biết một số nghị sỹ Bảo thủ đã nói rõ rằng họ không muốn Thủ tướng Cameron can thiệp quân sự vào Syria nào mà không tham vấn họ trước tiên.

Trong lúc này, Bác sỹ Không Biên giới (MSF) nói các bệnh viện họ hỗ trợ ở Syria đã chữa trị khoảng 3.600 bệnh nhân với triệu chứng của chất độc thần kinh và 355 người trong số này đã chết.

MSF, vốn nói họ không thể “xác nhận một cách khoa học” có hay không việc sử dụng vũ khí hóa học, cho biết các bệnh nhân đã được đưa đến ba bệnh viện ở Damascus hôm 21/8.

Tổ chức này cũng cho biết nhân viên tại các bệnh viện đã báo cáo về số lượng lớn các bệnh nhân đổ đến trong vòng chưa đầy ba tiếng đồng hồ, với các triệu chứng co giật, nhãn cầu bị giãn và khó thở.

Giám đốc điều hành MSF Bart Janssens nói các triệu chứng trên cùng với việc “các bệnh nhận ồ ạ̣t đổ vào trong thời gian ngắn”, là bằng chứng mạnh mẽ cho thấy nhiều người đã hít phải chất độc thần kinh trên diện rộng."

Iran is maybe the most aggressive country in the world, and it’s not just against Israel.”

Saudi Arabia and other gulf states view Iran as a regional nemesis whose nuclear program is only one element of a broader effort to project power. The rivalry is made more bitter by the sectarian dimension and competition over supplying oil to the world. The Saudi leadership has long been uneasy with Mr. Obama’s handling of the Arab uprisings that began in 2011, which it sees as a threat to the regional order. The president’s overtures to Iran add to a growing impatience and exasperation among Arabs in the gulf over Washington’s retreat from threats to strike Syria, whose civil war is viewed as a proxy for the larger sectarian and strategic battle unfolding across the region.

“The gulf states, and the Iranians, still see this as a balance-of-power struggle,” said Salman Shaikh, director of the Brookings Doha Center. “And Obama’s warning and Rouhani’s charm offensive, as well as what they would see as a hoodwinking of the United States on the nuclear issue, could have far-reaching consequences on the balance-of-power struggle.”

Mustafa Alani, a Dubai-based security analyst, said the Saudis think Mr. Obama is “not a reliable ally, that he’s bending to the Syrians and Iranians.” Mishaal al-Gergawi, a political analyst based in the United Arab Emirates, said, “There is a lot of cynicism, and it feeds into the notion that Obama is very naïve — he was naïve with the Muslim Brotherhood, naïve with Bashar al-Assad, and he is now naïve with Iran.”

Israeli analysts, too, worry over what they see as the Obama administration’s weak and wavering policies toward the Middle East. After the Syria chemical weapons crisis, some said the phone call only upped the ante for a diplomatic victory that could lead Washington to accept what Jerusalem would consider a “bad deal” with Iran, which insists its nuclear program is for civilian purposes only."

He watched a Marine lay a wreath in honor of victims of a 1998 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in this city on the Indian Ocean. He made no remarks.

And with that, one of his last appearances on his weeklong tour of Africa, Obama ended his trip much as it began — quietly.

Obama’s first tour of the continent as the first African American president was less a whirlwind swing marked by places of personal meaning and displays of political energy than a carefully planned trek to stops familiar to other U.S. presidents. Obama’s trip included remembrances of great leaders and reflections on history, but was largely absent the typical cultural scenes: no safaris, no dancing, no posing with tribesmen.

That subdued tenor was to some extent because of a twist of timing. Obama’s trip came as Nelson Mandela lay gravely ill in a Pretoria hospital and much of South Africa was consumed by news of the beloved elder statesman’s condition and ugly disputes between Mandela family members.

The president’s sojourn in South Africa became a two-day tribute to a man he calls a personal hero, culminating in a visit to Mandela’s former jail cell and a speech calling on Africans to keep pushing for social change.

But the aura of earnestness was also a nod to the reality of tight economic times. With the U.S. economy still in a slump, the White House was mindful of the appearance of staging trips that look like vacations. As officials finalized Obama’s plan, the Washington Post reported that the trip could cost $60 million to $100 million, a reflection of the massive security operation that envelops the president in the post-Sept. 11 era. The report put the White House on high alert for images that might be seen as frivolous globe-trotting.

Obama’s three-country itinerary was striking compared with some other presidential tours. In 1998, President Clinton visited six countries in 12 days, which included a day-and-a-half safari in Botswana. That trip cost $42.8 million, not including the Secret Service’s expenses, which are classified, according to a government report to Congress.

The first U.S. president to visit South Africa, Clinton was accompanied by a delegation of prominent African Americans and addressed the country’s Parliament and Mandela, who was then president.

President George W. Bush went twice to Africa. In 2003, he drew smaller crowds than those that had flocked to see Clinton. But his commitment to fight AIDS in Africa helped make him popular. When he returned in 2008, Bush declared that Liberia felt like “home” and in Monrovia broke into a jubilant dance with traditional dancers.

Obama, in one of his few moments working a crowd, briefly grooved with a drum circle in Senegal. The president beamed and began to sway a bit — but stopped short of dancing.

The president, who visited Ghana for a day in 2009, traveled with First Lady Michelle Obama and their daughters, Sasha and Malia, his mother-in-law, Marian Robinson, and niece Leslie Robinson. They moved at a stately pace through Africa, opting not to fly at night. The seven-day trip included almost three full travel days.

There would be no safari, only an announcement of aid to stop rhinoceros poaching. The closest Obama got to seeing rural Africa was a chat with two farmers who were brought to the lawn of the president’s luxury hotel in Dakar, Senegal, to explain agricultural improvement programs. “And I know that millet and maize and fertilizer doesn’t always make for sexy copy,” he said, asking reporters to give the event some coverage.

The president’s visit included only flashes of Obama’s ties to the continent. As he arrived in Tanzania on Monday, he noted, “Obviously, my family on my father’s side is from East Africa. They spent some time actually in Tanzania.” But he did not explain further. His father was born and is buried in Kenya. His step-grandmother still lives there.

In one strange this-is-your-life moment, Senegal’s President Macky Sall toasted Obama at an official dinner by introducing a man who Sall claimed was a minor, and unnamed, character in Obama’s 1995 memoir “Dreams From My Father.” Although Obama enthusiastically shook the man’s hand, it wasn’t clear that the president remembered him.

More recent figures in Obama’s biography featured more prominently in the trip. As he toured Senegal, South Africa and Tanzania, Obama often found himself and his policies compared to his predecessor. Then, on Tuesday, Bush was at Obama’s side, for the memorial of the embassy bombing.

The Republican former president was visiting East Africa for a meeting of first ladies hosted by his wife, Laura Bush. The event is part of the AIDS-relief and development work the couple began in the White House and has continued since. The U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, started by Bush, is often hailed as model for grand-scale development work and presidential legacy-making.

As he announced his own smaller initiatives, Obama was mindful that his efforts could not match Bush’s financial investment given the budget battles he faces with the Republican-controlled House.

Still, Obama aimed to leave his own imprint. He touted his $7-billion plan to upgrade power infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa, where nearly two-thirds of the population has no access to electricity. Obama visited the Ubungo Power Plant, a once-shuttered facility that was reopened with help from private investors and the Millennium Challenge Corp., another Bush-era program.

Obama’s Power Africa program aims to expand such efforts. He said the U.S. would also support smaller projects, such as distribution of the “Soccket” ball, a soccer ball that stores kinetic energy and can power a reading light. “You can imagine this in villages all across the continent,” he said.

http://news.yahoo.com/kerry-trip-brazil-colombia-could-chilly-072328629.html,,[],"Kerry trip to Brazil, Colombia could be chilly","BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met Monday with Colombian officials negotiating with the nation's largest guerrilla army to find peace in the South American country for the first time since 1964.

Kerry is visiting Colombia and Brazil this week in an attempt to build warmer relations with two U.S. allies in Latin America. But the visits may be hindered by resentment after reports about an American spy program that widely targeted data in emails and telephone calls across the region.

Disclosures by National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden could chill talks on several fronts. Those include trade, energy, counternarcotics, and even discussions about the Oct. 23 state dinner that President Barack Obama is hosting for Brazil's president, Dilma Rousseff.

Kerry arrived late Sunday in Bogota, the Colombian capital. The country is holding peace talks to end a half century-old conflict with the Western Hemisphere's most potent rebel army, a rebel force diminished in strength thanks in considerable measure to U.S. military and intelligence support.

Later Monday, Kerry planned to meet with Colombia's president, Juan Manuel Santos.

Santos said last week that he wanted clarification from Washington on whether U.S. intelligence-gathering in Colombia had overstepped the countries' joint operations against drug traffickers and illegal armed groups. The U.S. has supplied Colombia with eavesdropping equipment, technicians and aerial surveillance.

Santos said in an interview with The Associated Press that Vice President Joe Biden called him about the issue following revelations by Snowden that U.S digital snooping has targeted allies as well as foes. Santos said Biden offered a series of technical explanations. Asked if he was satisfied with them, Santos replied, ""We are in that process.""

Biden also called Rousseff to express what Brazil's communications minister, Helena Chagas, said was ""his regret over the negative repercussions caused by the disclosures."" Biden invited Brazilian officials to Washington to get details about the spy program.

Story continues

Rousseff told Biden that the privacy of Brazilian citizens and the country's sovereignty cannot be infringed upon in the name of security, and that Brazil wanted the U.S. to change its security policies and practices.

During Kerry's visit, the U.S. wants to show its support for the peace talks between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, which are taking place in Cuba. Kerry also will raise the case of Kevin Sutay, a former member of the U.S. Army who is being held by rebels.

Colombia is one of the United States' closest allies in the region, but the reports about the spying program have rankled Colombian officials.

Brazil's O Globo newspaper reported last month that citizens of Colombia, Mexico, Brazil and other countries were among the targets of a massive NSA operation to secretly gather information about phone calls and Internet communications worldwide. The reports were based on information provided by Snowden.

Last week, Brazil's Foreign Minister Antonio Patriota was at the United Nations with counterparts from other South American nations to express their indignation about the spy program to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

The Obama administration has worked to forge stronger ties with Latin America. In May, Obama took a three-day trip to Mexico and Costa Rica. Biden has visited Colombia and Brazil, where he said stronger trade ties and closer cooperation in education, science and other fields should usher in a new era of U.S.-Brazil relations this year.

Brazil has received much attention in recent months because of Pope Francis' visit and preparations for the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics to be held in Rio de Janeiro.

Thousands of demonstrators have staged anti-government protests since June demanding better public services in return for high taxes they pay. Under considerable domestic pressure, Rousseff announced a $4 billion program to improve transportation, sewage and public housing in Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city.

The protests have weakened her domestic support, but she can bolster her poll numbers with a strong stand against the U.S. over the spying allegations, said Carl Meacham, former Latin America adviser on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

""I think the tone of the visit will be a bit tense because of these issues raised by the surveillance (program) and I think Secretary Kerry will have to speak to that,"" he said.

That assessment was shared by Michael Shifter, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue

""I don't think this is going to be a warm 'abrazo,'"" said Shifter, using the Spanish word for ""hug."" ''I think it will be businesslike."""

The document detailed how there was no proof Iraq was connected to 9/11 or tied to al Qaeda's role in 9/11, that Iraq neither had WMDs nor was it a threat to the U.S., lacking intention and capability to attack. Unfortunately, not enough members of Congress performed due diligence before they approved the war.

Here are some key questions which President Obama has yet to answer in the call for congressional approval for war against Syria. This article is a call for independent thinking and congressional oversight, which rises above partisan considerations.

The questions the Obama administration needs to answer before Congress can even consider voting on Syria:

Claim #1. The administration claims a chemical weapon was used.

The UN inspectors are still completing their independent evaluation.

Who provided the physiological samples of sarin gas on which your evaluation is based? Were any other non-weaponized chemical agents discovered or sampled?

Who from the United States was responsible for the chain of custody?

Where was the laboratory analysis conducted?

Were U.S. officials present during the analysis of the samples? Does your sample show military grade or lower grade sarin gas?

Can you verify that your sample matches the exact composition of the alleged Syrian government composition?



Further reading: Brown Moses blog; McClatchy News report; Global Research report.

Claim #2: The administration claims the opposition has not used chemical weapons.

Which opposition?

Are you speaking of a specific group, or all groups working in Syria to overthrow President Assad and his government?

Has your administration independently and categorically dismissed the reports of rebel use of chemical weapons which have come from such disparate sources as Russia, the United Nations, and the Turkish state newspaper?

Have you investigated the rumors that the Saudis may have supplied the rebels with chemicals that could be weaponized?

Has the administration considered the ramifications of inadvertently supporting al Qaeda-affiliated Syrian rebels?

Was any intelligence received in the last year by the U.S. government indicating that sarin gas was brought into Syria by rebel factions, with or without the help of a foreign government or intelligence agents?

Further reading: Global Research report; Wall Street Journal article; Reuters story; Zaman story (in Turkish -- see Google translate from Turkish to English); Atlantic Sentinel story; AP story

Claim #3: The administration claims chemical weapons were used because the regime's conventional weapons were insufficient

Who is responsible for the conjecture that the reason chemical weapons were used against the Damascus suburbs is that Assad's conventional weapons were insufficient to secure ""large portions of Damascus""?

Claim #4: The administration claims to have intelligence relating to the mixing of chemical weapons by regime elements

Who saw the chemical weapons being mixed from August 18th on?

Was any warning afforded to the Syria opposition and if not, why not?

If, on August 21st a ""regime element"" was preparing for a chemical weapons attack, has an assessment been made which could definitively determine whether such preparation (using gas masks) was for purpose of defense, and not offense?

Further reading: McClatchy report; Brown Moses blog



Claim #5: The administration claims intelligence that Assad's brother ordered the attack

What is the type of and source of intelligence which alleges that Assad's brother personally ordered the attack?

Who made the determination that Assad's brother ordered the attack, based on which intelligence, from what source?

Further reading: here

Claim #6: The administration claims poison gas was released in a rocket attack

Who was tracking the rocket and the artillery attack which preceded the poison gas release?

Did these events occur simultaneously or consecutively?

Could these events, the rocket launches and the release of poison gas, have been conflated?

Based upon the evidence, is it possible that a rocket attack by the Syrian government was aimed at rebels stationed among civilians and a chemical weapons attack was launched by rebels against the civilian population an hour and a half later?

Is it possible that chemical weapons were released by the rebels -- unintentionally?

Explain the 90-minute time interval between the rocket launch and chemical weapon attacks.

Has forensic evidence been gathered at the scene of the attack which would confirm the use of rockets to deliver the gas?

If there was a rocket launch would you supply evidence of wounds from the rockets impact and explosion?

What is the source of the government's analysis?

If the rockets were being tracked via ""geospatial intelligence,"" what were the geospatial coordinates of the launching sites and termination locations?

Claim #7: The administration claims 1,429 people died in the attack

Secretary Kerry claimed 1,429 deaths, including 426 children. From whom did that number first originate?

Claim #8: The administration has made repeated references to videos and photos of the attack as a basis for military action against Syria

When and where were the videos taken of the aftermath of the poison gas attack?

Further reading: FAIR.org report

Claim #9: The administration claims a key intercept proves the Assad regime's complicity in the chemical weapons attack

Will you release the original transcripts in the language in which it was recorded as well as the translations relied upon to determine the nature of the conversation allegedly intercepted?

What is the source of this transcript? What was the exact time of the intercept? Was it a U.S. intercept or supplied from a non-U.S. source?

Have you determined the transcripts' authenticity? Have you considered that the transcripts could have been doctored or fake?

Was the ""senior official,"" whose communications were intercepted, a member of Assad's government?

How was he ""familiar"" with the offensive? Through a surprised acknowledgement that such an attack had taken place? Or through actual coordination of said attack? Release the transcripts!

Was he an intelligence asset of the U.S., or our allies? In what manner had he ""confirmed"" chemical weapons were used by the regime?

Who made the assessment that his intercepted communications were a confirmation of the use of chemical weapons by the regime on August 21st?

What is the source of information that the Syrian chemical weapons personnel were ""directed to cease operations""?

Is this the same source who witnessed regime officials mixing the chemicals?

Does the transcript indicate whether the operations they were ""directed to cease"" were related to ceasing conventional or chemical attacks?

Will you release the transcripts and identify sources of this claim?

Do you have transcripts, eyewitness accounts or electronic intercepts of communications between Syrian commanders or other regime officials which link the CW attack directly to President Assad?

Who are the intelligence officials who made the assessment -- are they U.S. intelligence officials or did the initial analysis come from a non-U.S. source?

Further reading: FAIR.org report and AP story; Washington Post editorial



Claim #10: The administration claims that sustained shelling occurred after the chemical weapons attack in order to cover up the traces of the attack

Please release all intelligence and military assessments as to the reason for the sustained shelling, which is reported to have occurred after the chemical weapons attack.

Who made the determination that was this intended to cover up a chemical weapon attack? Or was it to counterattack those who released chemicals?

How does shelling make the residue of sarin gas disappear?

Story highlights NEW: UK withdraws staff from British embassy in Yemen, follows U.S. lead Sources: Members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula are planning an attack The United States has heightened its security stance across the Mideast and Africa Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri tells operatives in Yemen to ""do something""

(CNN) —

A pair of suspected U.S. drone strikes killed four al Qaeda militants in Yemen as the United States maintained a heightened security alert in the country and urged all Americans to leave immediately.

Security sources told CNN about the strikes but didn’t offer additional details. A Yemeni official said four drone strikes have been carried out in the past 10 days.

None of those killed on Tuesday were among the 25 names on the country’s most-wanted list, security officials said.

It is unclear whether the strikes were related to the added security alert in the country after U.S. officials intercepted a message from al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri to operatives in Yemen telling them to “do something.” The message was sent to Nasir al-Wuhayshi, the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terror group’s Yemeni affiliate. U.S. intelligence believes al-Wuhayshi has recently been appointed the overall terror organization’s No. 2 leader.

Also Tuesday, the State Department urged Americans in Yemen to leave immediately, citing terrorist activities and civil unrest. All non-emergency U.S. government personnel were also told to leave.

Two U.S. military transport aircraft landed in Yemen on Tuesday to evacuate American citizens.

“In response to a request from the U.S. State Department, early this morning the U.S. Air Force transported personnel out of Sana’a, Yemen, as part of a reduction in emergency personnel,” Pentagon press secretary George Little said in a statement.

Little also said, “The U.S. Department of Defense continues to have personnel on the ground in Yemen to support the U.S. State Department and monitor the security situation.”

The UK Foreign Office also announced it had temporarily withdrawn all staff from the British embassy and would keep the facility shut until employees are able to return.

Washington takes precautions

Acting on the intelligence information, the United States heightened its security stance, issuing a worldwide travel alert and closing a number of embassies and consulates over large areas of the Middle East and Africa this week.

List of U.S. embassies and consulates closed this week

The State Department said the substantial security steps reflect an “abundance of caution” over intelligence information that indicated final planning by al Qaeda in Yemen for possible terrorist attacks on Western targets to coincide with the end of Ramadan this week.

Three sources told CNN that the United States has information that members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula are in the final stages of planning for an unspecified attack. Recent jailbreaks in Pakistan, Iraq and Libya all have the fingerprints of al Qaeda operations.

Prison breaks are among reasons for heightened security

On Monday, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters that U.S. anti-terrorism efforts had decimated al Qaeda’s global leadership and greatly diminished its core in Afghanistan and Pakistan, saying the threat had “shifted to some of these affiliates, in particular AQAP.”

Separately, American special forces units overseas have been on alert for the past several days awaiting a mission to attack potential al Qaeda targets if those behind the most recent terror threats against U.S. interests can be identified, a senior Obama administration official told CNN.

The official declined to identify the units or their locations because of the sensitive nature of the information. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel put the units on alert last week, the official said.

Russian media reported that Snowden would be allowed to leave the transit zone where he has been holed up for more than a month following a government decision to consider his request for temporary asylum. But he was turned back at passport control because he did not have all the paperwork he needed, a Russian immigration official told The Times.

“This situation is not standard for Russia. We have come across some bureaucracy,” Snowden’s lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, told reporters after meeting with his client in the transit zone of Moscow’s Sheremetyevo-2 International Airport. “His documents are still being reviewed. Let’s wait for some time and hope that the question will be resolved in the next few days.”

The Russian Federal Migration Service issued a certificate Wednesday, in effect stating that the agency was reviewing the application Snowden submitted last week seeking temporary shelter, the RIA-Novosti news agency reported.

The document reportedly allows him to leave the airport transit zone where he arrived June 23 with a revoked U.S. passport, which did not allow him to legally enter Russia or board a flight elsewhere.

The Federal Migration Service would not officially confirm or deny the reports. “We don’t have this information yet,” agency spokeswoman Svetlana Gordeyeva said.

Earlier this week, Kucherena told the Times that the certificate would allow Snowden to cross the Russian border and finally leave the airport transit zone.

“Snowden started passing through passport control, but some important documents were lacking, and he had to stay in the transit zone for at least another day,” said a Federal Migration Service official, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Snowden doesn’t have a valid passport, and he needs a whole set of different papers to cross the border into Russia. ”

He said Snowden had to be fingerprinted and fill in a new form.

In the last two weeks, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said more than once that Russia will not extradite Snowden to the United States but has also expressed hope that the former NSA contractor would leave Russia for some other country soon.

It was unclear where Snowden, 30, would stay once he leaves his airport limbo. His lawyer said only that Snowden plans to stay in Russia for some time.

“He wants to study Russian culture,” Kucherena said in an interview with Rossiya-24, a Russian television news network. “But his security remains his priority.”

Several Russian human rights groups have offered to assist Snowden in his efforts to evade a U.S. extradition warrant seeking his return to face espionage and theft charges.

Snowden told Kucherena that he is not a rich man but still has some money. Kucherena said he brought Snowden a new pair of jeans, some T-shirts and a book: Fyodor Dostoevsky’s “Crime and Punishment.”

Gregory N. Hicks, the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Libya at the time of the Benghazi terrorist attacks; Mark I. Thompson, a former Marine and now the deputy coordinator for Operations in the agency’s Counterterrorism Bureau; and Eric Nordstrom, a diplomatic security officer who was the regional security officer in Libya, the top security officer in the country in the months leading up to the attacks.

During the months of December and January, Breitbart News specifically asked the State Department switchboard for Benghazi witness Hicks’ contact information; the State Department claimed his location was unknown and they therefore ccould not provide information as to Hicks’ whereabouts.

Meanwhile, another individual Breitbart News asked the State Department switch board about, who is not on the current witness list but may have had information about the deadly Benghazi attacks, was still correctly listed in with the State Department switchboard. Hicks is a veteran Foreign Service officer whose previous postings included Afghanistan, Syria, and Yemen.

Rep. Jason Chafetz (R-UT) told Fox News in November that Ambassador Christopher Stevens, one of the four Americans ultimately killed in the Benghazi attack, called Hicks for help during the embassy attack.

“He said shortly after 9:40 PM what happened is his phone rang and he didn’t recognize the number so he didn’t answer it. And then it rang again and again he didn’t answer it because he didn’t recognize the number,” Rep. Chaffetz said. “But then given the persistence he did answer it.

The investigation appears to center around Midlothian Sgt. Steven Zamiar, a 13-year veteran who helped oversee the suburb's force as deputy chief until a recent political shake-up. It remains unclear exactly what about Zamiar — or the small department — has drawn the attention of federal investigators.

Zamiar, 46, won't say. The suburb's recently appointed police chief, Harold Kaufman, would say only that ""numerous"" people from the department have been questioned in the inquiry.

The village has received two federal grand jury subpoenas this year. The first sought Zamiar's personnel file, specifically requesting records related to allegations of misconduct by the officer, among other documents.

The second subpoena arrived in late June seeking police logs and call records tied to three days in 2011, along with the department's policy manuals regarding ""use of force by police officers.""

On one of those days, Zamiar filed an incident report saying he used a baton to subdue a suspect after an early morning chase outside a bar — at a time department records show he was not clocked in. Charges against the suspect for assault and resisting an officer were later dropped, according to court records.

Zamiar confirmed the federal investigation but declined further comment.

""I don't really have anything to say about it,"" Zamiar said. ""It's an investigation, that's all I know.""

Zamiar remains on duty with the department. The village told the Tribune there was no record of any internal investigations of Zamiar in the last three years.

The suburb's former police chief, David Burke, told the Tribune he thought the investigation centered on a burglary of Zamiar's car in front of his Midlothian home.

Police records show that in 2010 Zamiar chased suspects from his house and called police. Police records show the two 19-year-old suspects were caught and charged with felony burglary. Court records show both pleaded guilty and received probation.

As for the 2011 case, it was early on Thanksgiving when Zamiar reported that he saw a crowd being pushed out of a local bar by security.

Zamiar's time sheets for that day don't show him clocked in, but Zamiar wrote in his incident report that he was working in the area and approached the scene at the bar.

After learning there was a fight, Zamiar said a witness pointed out the suspect. Then after a brief chase, Zamiar said the suspect ""turned toward me in an aggressive manner.""

""At this time I utilized my ASP Baton and the subject was taken into custody without further resistance,"" Zamiar wrote.

Zamiar said the suspect later complained of pain but signed a refusal for medical treatment.

The suspect's attorney declined to comment.

Zamiar has faced past allegations of abuse. He was accused in 2007 of giving a suspect a concussion while trying to arrest him. That case was settled.

Early in his career, Zamiar faced three other lawsuits alleging excessive force, all within his first year on the beat. The village denied the allegations in all cases and court records appear to show one was settled, while the other two were dropped.

Records related to the suits were received by the grand jury in response to the first subpoena.

A look at Zamiar's work history in the village also shows a number of recognitions. Among several citations for achievement are commendations for drug busts as well as his work when a knife-wielding assailant went on a rampage at a shopping center, leaving a 1-year-old dead.

Zamiar also has a record of attending numerous courses in recent years, including special training in the proper use of force. Records show he completed three such courses the same year that he said he used his baton in the 2011 incident.

Burke, who appointed Zamiar deputy chief in 2011, said Zamiar is a good cop.

""(Zamiar) doesn't know what's going on. They won't tell him either,"" Burke said. ""He's losing sleep, and he's quite upset about it. He's never done anything wrong.""

Story highlights Experts: Beyond human suffering, Syria has practical implications for Americans Syria is ""Iran's arm in the Middle East,"" geopolitical strategist says Syria is bordered by countries in which the U.S. has a vested interest Oil prices could be affected by continued conflict in Syria

(CNN) —

In between taking care of their families, working and trying to keep up with everyday life, many Americans have caught at least a couple stories about Syria. Many probably know that clashes between government forces and protesters who want the country’s president to relinquish power have become increasingly bloody over the past several months. Much of that violence has been represented in online videos, ostensibly that Syrians have posted, suggesting the slaughter of children and families.

It’s horrible. No one would argue anything else. But there is violence in many corners of the world. Why should what’s happening in Syria be especially important to Americans? It’s clear a lot of people think it’s not. Several readers reacted to Tuesday’s top story on CNN about Syria by commenting: “Zzzzzz not our problem” and “Anyone surprised? *yawn*.”

“We are afraid to ask this question – ‘Why care?’ – because it’s like saying we don’t mind that there’s a humanitarian crisis happening or that people are suffering,” said Hillary Mann Leverett, a Washington-based professor, blogger and one of the nation’s foremost Middle East and Syria experts. She is a former National Security Council adviser to President George W. Bush and has interviewed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for a book about Syria authored by her husband, Flynt Leverett, also a Middle East expert.

“People have to know it’s allowed to take a discussion beyond the human suffering,” she said. “There are huge, practical consequences for the United States when it comes to Syria.”

Like what?

CNN asked Hillary Mann Leverett; Joseph Holliday, a former U.S. soldier turned foreign policy analyst; and Robert Zarate, a geopolitical strategist with Capitol Hill experience, to explain why Americans should care about Syria.

1. Geography. Think of Syria as the Middle East’s core. When it’s weak and destabilized, the body is susceptible to serious injury. Violence in Syria could easily spill into bordering Iraq, where the United States recently ended a war that ran from March 2003 to December 2011 and where U.S. troops and American civilians still work.

Beyond Iraq, Turkey, a U.S. ally, borders Syria as do Jordan and Lebanon. If Lebanon is shaken too badly by conflict in Syria, Lebanon could fall into a civil war as it did decades ago, Holliday said. That kind of conflict would spark yet another serious political and diplomatic problem that the United States would inevitably have to address.

2. Al Qaeda. The United States’ No. 1 enemy would appreciate another failed state from which to operate in the Middle East.

3. Iran. Syria supports Iran. Iran has had a contentious relationship with the United States for decades. Remember Bush’s “Axis of Evil”? That trifecta was Iran, North Korea and Iraq.

“Syria is Iran’s arm in the Middle East,” Zarate said. “Iran has used Syria as a staging ground to train and support militants who have crossed into Iraq to hurt our troops and to train for other terrorist activities.”

Each expert CNN spoke with pointed out that Iran has a nuclear program. Whether it has capabilities for nuclear weapons is something the United States and most of the world doesn’t know.

4. Oil prices. Though Syria produces far less oil than Libya, for example, violence in Syria could affect global oil speculation and prices, Leverett said. Ultimately, that affects how much American consumers pay at the pump.

5. The economy, stupid. Leverett and Zarate note that many in the United States may not think about the Iraq war now, but they say it’s important not to forget that war cost an estimated $1 trillion. Whether one supports or opposes military intervention in Syria, the costs incurred by any approach will affect the American economy.

6. Global reputation. “People around the world are looking for some kind of consistency in our foreign policy, and we’ve been criticized for not having that, not having anything close to consistency during the Arab Spring,” Zarate said.

The United States intervened, with NATO leading the way, in Libya. In 2011, Washington supported, at least in words, the Egyptians in their revolt against then-Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, he said. Each time, the United States argued that those actions were in accordance with America’s national values, he said, and its responsibility as a global leader to defend democratic principles."

Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas requested an audit to determine whether officials violated the law in shipping the vests a decade ago to the Southeast Asian country. A Gardena official also said she would be asking for an investigation into her city being used as an intermediary for the unusual transaction.

The announcements Tuesday were prompted by a Times investigation published over the weekend that found that sheriff’s ballistic vests were shipped to Cambodia and not declared to customs officials, as required by federal law. Instead, they were stuffed inside one of a number of patrol cars that the Sheriff’s Department was shipping directly to Cambodia, avoiding the rigorous vetting process the U.S. government requires to prevent body armor from getting into the wrong hands abroad.

Sheriff’s media representatives gave The Times differing accounts about the transaction, initially denying any sheriff’s officials were involved in sending the vests to Cambodia, then offering explanations contradicted by records and interviews. The officials involved in the transaction refused to discuss it.

“Federal, state and local statutory, legal and policy violations may have occurred with these transactions,” read a motion by Ridley-Thomas.

Gardena Mayor Pro Tem Rachel Johnson said she was troubled by the alleged role that the city’s mayor, Paul Tanaka, played in the sales. Tanaka is the second-in-command at the Sheriff’s Department.

She said she also wanted to know why her city manager approved the transaction. Records showed the city manager pledged under the penalty of perjury that the vests were intended for Gardena, despite later telling federal authorities he knew they would be diverted to Cambodia.

“I’m concerned about the appearance of a cover-up,” Johnson said in an interview with The Times.

It is not unusual for U.S. law enforcement agencies to donate used or obsolete equipment to other departments, including foreign ones. But in this case, the vests were shipped using an intermediary and were not declared on their way out of the country. The vests were ostensibly sold to Gardena, but were never claimed by the city before being shipped to Cambodia.

The U.S. Customs Service launched an investigation into the sale of the vests in 2002, and federal agents were told that the transactions were coordinated by Tanaka, according to records obtained by The Times. A sheriff’s spokesman called Tanaka’s role minimal, saying it was a former undersheriff who called the Gardena city manager to coordinate the sales.

Customs agents decided not to seek criminal charges, concluding that there wasn’t enough evidence to show that anyone involved in the transactions knew the relevant export laws. One expert told The Times that that rationale was “curious” because authorities don’t have to prove knowledge of the law to press charges.

After closing the case, federal authorities referred the matter to sheriff’s investigators, but the department did not conduct its own investigation. But a sheriff’s spokesman said the department did nothing wrong and sent the vests through Gardena because they were under the mistaken impression that county rules prevented them from dealing directly with foreign nations. Prompted by The Times’ inquiry, Sheriff Lee Baca asked the county auditor-controller’s office to examine the sale, and Baca’s spokesman called that review “a complete vindication.” But Baca only told the auditor-controller that the vests were sold to Gardena, not that Gardena was a go-between to get the vests to Cambodia.

The audit Ridley-Thomas proposed would include that, and determine if any sheriff’s or Gardena officials committed “any fraudulent or illegal activity.” If his motion is approved and the audit is launched, the final report would be forwarded to county and federal prosecutors for further action.

Johnson, who is running to replace Tanaka as mayor of Gardena, said she was a city clerk at the time of the transactions and never knew about them. “I’m very disappointed that [Tanaka] has involved our city manager, our city resources in these questionable practices,” she said.

Sheriff’s spokesman Steve Whitmore said that both Baca and Tanaka do not object to the new probes: “Don’t forget this has been looked at by the feds and they said nothing was wrong.”

http://news.yahoo.com/obama--top-national-security-aides--meet-on-syria--151942054.html,,[],"Obama, top national security aides, meet on Syria","President Barack Obama spoke Saturday with top military, intelligence, diplomatic, political and legal advisers at the White House to plan the U.S. response to the Syrian government’s alleged massacre of civilians with chemical weapons, the White House said.

Obama “received a detailed review of a range of potential options he had requested be prepared for the United States and the international community to respond to the use of chemical weapons,” his press office said.

Senior aides have publicly ruled out sending American troops into Syria or establishing a “no-fly” zone over pockets of the country – but the use of force,potentially missile strikes from ships or airplanes outside Syrian territory -- were very much on the table.

“We have a range of options available, and we are going to act very deliberately so that we're making decisions consistent with our national interest as well as our assessment of what can advance our objectives in Syria,” a White House official told reporters by email before the meeting.

“In coordination with international partners and mindful of the dozens of contemporaneous witness accounts and record of the symptoms of those killed, the U.S. intelligence community continues to gather facts to ascertain what occurred,” the White House said after the meeting.

Rebels fighting to oust Bashar Assad have charged that more than 1,300 people, many of them children, were killed this week by the regime.

Assad's government has denied responsibility, and countered that the rebels themselves were behind it. On Saturday, it also warned the United States against military action, saying that would send a “ball of fire” through the Middle East.

The White House meeting participants, either in person or via secure communications, included Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, White House chief of staff Denis McDonough, National Security Advisor Susan Rice, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey.

Story continues

It also included U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power, White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, Deputy Attorney General James Cole, Deputy National Security Advisor Antony Blinken, Homeland Security and Counterterrorism advisor Lisa Monaco, Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications Benjamin Rhodes and Biden National Security Advisor Jacob Sullivan.

Why so many lawyers? Obama has emphasized the need to act in a way that does not violate international law.

The president also spoke to British Prime Minister David Cameron.

""The president and prime minister will continue to consult closely regarding this incident, as well as possible responses by the international community to the use of chemical weapons,"" the White House said. ""The United States and UK stand united in our opposition to the use of chemical weapons.""

Obama and Hagel have publicly said that America’s response will come soon.

“I think the international community is moving swiftly, first, in getting the facts, what did happen, and getting the intelligence right, and all the other factors that go into a decision that I believe will be made swiftly, should be made swiftly,” Hagel told reporters aboard his plane on the way to Malaysia.

“If, in fact, this was a deliberate use and attack by the Syrian government on its own people using chemical weapons, there may be another attack coming,” Hagel said.

Obama signaled an escalation of the U.S. role in Syria in a CNN interview aired Friday , noting that confirmation of a mass chemical weapons attack would threaten “core national interests” of the United States. At the same time, the president and other senior officials have repeatedly said that they are mindful of the potential downsides of any military action, including getting pulled into a deeper role and stoking anti-U.S. sentiment in the region.

Meanwhile, top military officers from the United States, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, Britain and France were set to meet in Jordan in the coming days. A White House official called it a “regularly occurring, long-planned conference.”"

Story highlights A 2,700 year-old silver chalice may be a new token of friendship between the United States and Iran It had been in New York since 2003, when an art dealer smuggled it to New York Iran's cultural heritage chief hopes its return will mark a lively cultural exchange with the U.S. Mohammad-Ali Najafi says the ice between Washington and Tehran has thawed

(CNN) —

A 2,700 year-old silver chalice may be a new token of friendship between the United States and Iran, at least that’s the way Iran’s cultural heritage chief sees it.

Whatever the case, Mohammad-Ali Najafi was palpably delighted Friday to see the ancient Persian artifact return to its homeland. The ceremonial drinking vessel – or rhyton – had gotten snagged in a U.S. customs warehouse for years, held up by bad diplomatic relations.

It had been in New York since 2003, when an art dealer smuggled it into the country from Iran.

Customs officials have long wanted to return the rhyton to Iran, according to a New York Post report. But decades of frigid relations between Washington and Tehran kept it frozen in bureaucratic limbo.

Winning hearts

President Obama broke that ice Friday with a historic phone chat with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, as the Islamic republic’s leader was just about to leave the United States.

It was the first time a U.S. president has spoken to his Iranian counterpart since 1979.

The thaw may have been enough to free up the rhyton, which takes the shape of a mythical beast with the body of a lion and the head of a bird of prey. It was fashioned in the Achaemenid era, the early Persian Empire, around 700 BC.

The State Department announced in a tweet that the United States returned it this week. U.S. officials handed it off directly to Najafi’s delegation, he said.

“We are taking this as America’s souvenir to the Iranian people,” Najafi told CNN.

A souvenir from abroad is something Iranians don’t take as trivial. It has a special place of warmth in Persian culture.

He will present it Saturday to the nation after he lands in Tehran. “I believe this will have a very positive affect on the Iranians,” he said.

And what wins Najafi’s heart has a good chance of pleasing Iran’s new president. Hassan Rouhani recently appointed Najafi as one of a dozen vice presidents, making him the guardian of the country’s most important museums and cultural institutions.

Najafi, himself a progressive reform politician, who has run for office in the past, accompanied Rouhani to New York, where the Iranian president spoke at the United Nations General Assembly.

Cultural charm offensive

In their phone conversation, the two presidents spoke about Tehran’s nuclear program, Obama said.

“Resolving this issue, obviously, could also serve as a major step forward in a new relationship between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran.”

It will be a long path to restored relations, the president said, but it could lead to the end of crippling economic sanctions against Iran, which could help “the Iranian people fulfill their potential.”

If Najafi has his way that potential will include the exchange with the United States of a lot of art, artifacts and archeology – set to classical music.

“I adamantly believe in cultural diplomacy, and I believe the thing that could improve relations between US and Iran after the years and softens the harshness of this relationship is cultural diplomacy,” he said.

He appears to have already kicked off a cultural charm offensive towards the United States in his short time in office.

Najafi has met with officials from New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art about potential exhibitions of Iranian artifacts, he said. He has parlayed with academics from the near Eastern studies program of University of Chicago.

“We agreed to have a joint program in future studies and research on these artifacts.”

As far as Najafi is concerned, the times of extreme tension between the countries are over.

“Mr. Rouhani, in an event held for Iranians last night (Thursday) specifically said that ‘the ice between Iran and US has been melted,’ and I think if this is accurate, which I’m certain that it is, we will have no problems in the areas of education, sciences and culture in the next few months.”

Najafi is also interested in seeing the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra play next year in Tehran.

If they can pull it off, he said, the concert would mark the 50th anniversary of the last time the orchestra played there.

If the diplomatic tone makes the music, Najafi seems eager to strike up the orchestra.

Recent leaks of classified documents have pointed to the role of a special court in enabling the government’s secret surveillance programs, but members of the court are chafing at the suggestion that they were collaborating with the executive branch.

A classified 2009 draft report by the National Security Agency’s inspector general relayed some details about the interaction between the court’s judges and the NSA, which sought approval for the Bush administration’s top-secret domestic surveillance programs. The report was described in The Washington Post on June 16 and released in full Thursday by The Post and the British newspaper the Guardian.

U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, the former chief judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, took the highly unusual step Friday of voicing open frustration at the account in the report and court’s inability to explain its decisions.

“In my view, that draft report contains major omissions, and some inaccuracies, regarding the actions I took as Presiding Judge of the FISC and my interactions with Executive Branch officials,” Kollar-Kotelly said in a statement to The Post. It was her first public comment describing her work on the intelligence court.

The inspector general’s draft report is among the many documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, touching off a roiling national debate about the proper balance between the government’s reach into Americans’ lives and the effort to protect the nation in the Internet age.

View Graphic See the inner workings of the NSA’s PRISM program

The document portrays the surveillance court as “amenable” to the government’s legal theory to “re-create” authority for the Internet metadata program that had initially been authorized by President George W. Bush without court or congressional approval. The program was shut down in March 2004 when acting Attorney General James B. Comey and senior leaders at the Justice Department threatened to resign over what they felt was an illegal program.

Kollar-Kotelly disputed the NSA report’s suggestion of a fairly high level of coordination between the court and the NSA and Justice in 2004 to re-create certain authorities under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the 1978 law that created the court in response to abuses of domestic surveillance in the 1960s and 1970s.

“That is incorrect,” she said. “I participated in a process of adjudication, not ‘coordination’ with the executive branch. The discussions I had with executive branch officials were in most respects typical of how I and other district court judges entertain applications for criminal wiretaps under Title III, where issues are discussed ex parte.”

The perception that the court works too closely with the government arises in large part from the tribunal’s “ex parte” nature, which means that unlike in a traditional court, there is no legal sparring between adversaries with the judge as arbiter. Instead, a Justice Department official makes the case for the government agency seeking permission to carry out surveillance inside the United States. No one speaks for the target of the surveillance or the company that is ordered to allow its networks to be tapped or to turn over its customers’ data.

Some critics say the court is a rubber stamp for government investigators because it almost never has turned down a warrant application. However, that high batting average doesn’t take into account changes the court requires in some requests and other applications that the government withdraws.

For about 30 years, the court was located on the sixth floor of the Justice Department’s headquarters, down the hall from the officials who would argue in front of it. (The court moved to the District’s federal courthouse in 2009.) “There is a collaborative process that would be unnatural in the public, criminal court setting,” said a former Justice official familiar with the court.

Kollar-Kotelly, who was the court’s chief judge from 2002 to 2006, said she could not comment further on the matter because “the underlying subjects” in the report generally remain classified by the executive branch.

Other judges on the court have confided to colleagues their frustration at the court’s portrayal, according to people familiar with their discussion.

The inspector general’s report, combined with persistent refusals by the government to declassify the opinions, have left the public in the dark about the court’s legal justifications for approving the broad surveillance programs.

“The court is a neutral party, not a collaborator or arm of the government,” said one government official close to the court. “But the information out there now leaves people wondering how and why the court endorsed these programs.”

The court historically has authorized in secret hearings classified warrants to wiretap the calls and monitor the movements of suspected criminals. After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, far-reaching programs to gather Internet and telephone content and metadata were launched under presidential authority, without congressional action or approval from the surveillance court.

The Internet metadata portion of that program had to be revamped after Comey and other Justice officials threatened to resign. Metadata are information indicating facts such as an e-mail’s sender and recipient and its time and date, but not its content.

In May 2004, the NSA briefed Kollar-Kotelly on the technical aspects of that program’s collection, according to the report. She also met with the NSA director, Lt. Gen. Michael V. Hayden, on two successive Saturdays during the summer of 2004 to discuss the issue, the report said.

“It was very professional,” Hayden said in an interview. “We of course had to explain to her what it was we had been doing, what it was we wanted to do, how we would do it, what kind of safeguards we felt able to put in. We left it to her judgment whether there was proportionality in terms of was this worth doing, in the balance between security and liberty.”

He said in response to her concerns, the agency made some technical adjustments so that “the odds were greater that you’d pick up fewer protected communications of U.S. persons.”

Said Hayden: “She wasn’t in league with us. We were down there presenting what we thought was appropriate.”

On July 14, 2004, the surveillance court for the first time approved the gathering of information by the NSA, which created the equivalent of a digital vault to hold Internet metadata. Kollar-Kotelly’s order authorized the metadata program under a FISA provision known as the “pen register/trap and trace,” or PRTT.

The ruling was a secret not just to the public and most of Congress, but to all of Kollar-Kotelly’s surveillance court colleagues. Under orders from the president, none of the court’s other 10 members could be told about the Internet metadata program, which was one prong of a larger and highly classified data-gathering effort known as the President’s Surveillance Program, or PSP.

But the importance of her order — which approved the collection based on a 1986 law typically used for phone records — was hard to overstate.

“The order essentially gave NSA the same authority to collect bulk Internet metadata that it had under the PSP,” the inspector general’s report said, with some minor caveats including reducing the number of people who could access the records.

On May 24, 2006, Kollar-Kotelly signed another order, this one authorizing the bulk collection of phone metadata from U.S. phone companies, under a FISA provision known as Section 215, or the ”business records provision,” of the USA Patriot Act.

As with the PRTT order, the Justice Department and NSA “collaboratively designed the application, prepared declarations and responded to questions from court advisers,” the inspector general’s report said. “Their previous experience in drafting the PRTT order made this process more efficient.”

The court also agreed in 2007 to permit the government to collect the content of e-mails and phone calls to and from the United States when “there is probable cause to believe” that one of the parties is a member of al-Qaeda or an associated terrorist group. That program, known today as PRISM and described in documents obtained by The Washington Post, eventually was authorized by Congress.

Kollar-Kotelly could be a stern taskmaster when she thought the NSA was overstepping its bounds. In 2004, she temporarily shut down the government’s surveillance program when she learned of a key NSA failure, The Post reported in 2006. The agency was not properly walling off information gained in warrantless surveillance and may have been using the information to obtain court warrants, which was forbidden. In 2005, the problem resurfaced and she issued a strong warning to the government that it had to fix the problem or would face trouble obtaining court warrants.

Kollar-Kotelly “understood the problems that the government, particularly the Defense Department and the intelligence community, were facing in trying to keep this country safe,” said Robert L. Deitz, former NSA general counsel under Hayden.

But, he said, the court was no rubber stamp. “The judges ask searching questions,” he said. “If they don’t get the right answer, they don’t stamp things ‘reject.’ They say, ‘I’m not signing this.’ Then we go back and say, ‘Okay, we’ve got to do this the following way.’ ”

Still secret are the 2004 decision accompanying the PRTT court order and the legal opinion accompanying the 2006 business records order.

A former senior Justice Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the subject’s sensitivity, said he believes the government should consider releasing declassified summaries of relevant opinions.

“I think it would help” quell the “furor” raised by the recent disclosures, he said. “In this current environment, you may have to lean forward a little more in declassifying stuff than you otherwise would. You might be able to prepare reasonable summaries that would be helpful to the American people.”

Lawmakers and civil-liberties advocates have been pushing the Obama administration for several years to declassify these opinions and other opinions from Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel that explain the legal justification for these programs.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has led an effort to review these opinions to see what, if anything, can be declassified. But Robert S. Litt, ODNI general counsel, has argued that declassification can be difficult when so much of the legal reasoning is intertwined with facts that need to remain secret lest they tip off enemies about surveillance methods.

Still, the former official explained, segregating relevant facts from classified material is routinely done in criminal proceedings under the Classified Information Procedures Act. In those cases, the government can extract the information that is relevant to the defense, the judge approves it, and it is provided to the defense.

“This is not unheard-of in the unclassified world, and some kind of summary document can be generated,” the former official said. “Maybe that’s a middle ground that can be done.”

As much as these policy changes are being trumpeted as evidence of how far China has come, they really are a reminder of how far China and its leaders have to go.

In the wake of the shutdown of the federal government last month, Chinese President and Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping took the opportunity to remind the world of the failings of the American political system. Year after year, as China's foreign exchange reserves have piled up, the leaders of the regime have gone to great pains to critique America for its profligacy and political instability, among myriad other failings. China's much heralded rise, and its ambitions to supplant American leadership, reflect not just its growing economic and military power, but the values of frugality, stability and conservatism Chinese leaders eagerly contrast with the chaos and moral decay of the west.

Little is ever said amidst these frequent rebukes of the role that America has played in enabling the resuscitation of the Chinese people, to say nothing of the Chinese Communist Party itself, from the depths of economic calcification reached in the 1970s. Much is made of the success of the market reforms instituted under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping beginning in 1978, and indeed the growth trajectory of China's GDP has been extraordinary. But the success of China's economic transformation could not have happened absent the free trade policies of the United States, and to a lesser extent western Europe, that enabled that growth.

Under American global leadership since the end of World War II, international trade policies have uplifted the Asian continent out of severe poverty. Japan led the way, in the wake of the devastation of WWII, building a manufacturing juggernaut enabled by American business insight and market access. The Japanese model of export driven economic growth and development then became the model for the Asian tiger nations of Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea, which like Japan have risen from abject poverty a half-century ago to among the highest levels of per capita income in the world.

That was the American half-century. As we opened our markets, our share of global GDP steadily declined. Our trade policies actively supported the rise of Asia out of poverty and the globalization of our leading corporations. That real middle class incomes stagnated at home should have come as no surprise. It was simple economics.

But the Asian Tigers, and even Japan, were relatively small countries, who as trading partners were able to build their domestic economies around export trade with America without destroying the host upon which they fed. Through that economic period, there were unintended consequences that exacerbated the challenges we now face. The combined reinvestment of Asian nation trade surpluses in US dollars -- and the similar practice embraced by OPEC nations selling us oil -- led to relative stability in the US dollar and enabled steady increases in US borrowing without the increases in US interest rates or declines the value of dollar assets that would otherwise have undermined Asian growth.

But it was trade in goods and services with China and India, respectively, that ultimately showed the limit of the export driven model, as the damage to the US economy and middle class has now become too extreme to ignore. The challenges we now face -- underinvestment in infrastructure, chronic deficit spending, and socially debilitating inequality -- have conspired to contribute to the fraught domestic politics that President Xi now trumpets as the rationale for the world to turn to China for future leadership. China's gleaming new cityscapes -- and the Chinese dream of Xi's rhetoric -- are being built not upon the ingenuity of the Chinese system, but instead upon the hollowing out of the American economy.

The policy changes Xi and his colleagues announced this week only draw attention to the depravity that remains central to the Chinese system. Even as there is a rising wealthy population within the Chinese elite and urban cores, economic growth within China remains dependent upon the Foxconn-style factory model that is one step short of a slave economy. The Communist Party social and economic policies continue to drive Chinese peasants from their land while securing billions of dollars in stolen wealth for Party members. Dissent and banned religious practice remains punishable by prison and the Orwellian ""re-education"" that is to be moderated, but not eliminated, under recently announced Party reforms.

The Party plans to modify the decades old one-child policy is perhaps the most shocking reminder of the starkly immoral nature of Communist Party control over the most intimate aspects of Chinese personal life. Unauthorized pregnancies continue to be aborted by force up until birth, and children found to have been born in violation of the law remain at risk of being ""confiscated"" by police. The proposed may relax the rules surrounding who is to be allowed more than one child, but does nothing to curtail this most fundamental power of State control over the population.

This week, the US aircraft carrier George Washington arrived in the Philippines from Hawaii. The stories were so familiar from other disasters in recent years. The helicopters arriving over the horizon, coming to the aid of the population devastated by Typhoon Haiyan needing not just food and water, but the most basic help from building and securing aid distribution capacity, to recovering, identifying and burying the dead. The carrier and accompanying ships brought aid, logistics and people trained and capable of responding to the need on the ground.

Nine years ago, in the days following the 2004 tsunami, it was the US carrier Abraham Lincoln and the Navy hospital ship Mercy that steamed from the Persian Gulf to Banda Aceh, that city on the northern tip of Sumatra that had born the brunt of the tsunami and seen tens of thousands of its residents die. Like Banda Aceh, the Philippines are located close to the Chinese mainland -- just 700 miles from Hong Kong -- yet once again it was an American flotilla that steamed over 5,000 miles to bring critical aid, while the Chinese sat on their hands.

Last month, President Xi trumpeted China's rising essential role in the region at the Asia-Pacific meetings that President Obama chose not to attend due to turmoil in Washington. Yet just a few weeks later, he was nowhere to be seen as the people of the Philippines faced their crisis. The Chinese government committed just $100,000 to the Philippines relief effort after the typhoon struck.

President Xi has a long way to go to build the credibility of China as a modern state to be looked to by the world for leadership. Just the name of its recent meeting, the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party, is a reminder that while much in the world has changed over the past quarter century -- from the fall of the Berlin wall to the Arab spring -- China remains a throwback the Cold War era. As much as Xi would like to show the world the face of a man whose time in Iowa left him an admirer of American freedoms, the pronouncements from his first plenum are a stark reminder of the deep corruption and cruelty that lie at the heart of the Chinese system, and of the ghosts of Tiananmen that still haunt the Chinese leadership.

But it is the response to Typhoon Haiyan that has demonstrated how far China has to go before it will be embraced as a global leader. Leadership is not just about words at meetings of world leaders, or reserves held bank vaults, but about conduct in the world. It is not about what you do to build up your own country, but what you do to uplift others. President Xi and his colleagues disappeared this week when their neighbors across the water were crying in pain, and their inaction spoke volumes. Because, at the end of the day, leadership is not about ideology or rhetoric, it is about showing up."

HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — Zimbabwe's electoral body said Tuesday that 94.5 percent of voters cast a ballot in favor of a new constitution that calls for a strengthening of human rights and a curb on presidential powers after a decade of political and economic turmoil in the southern African nation.

But as the results were announced African and international law organizations expressed outrage at the jailing for a third night of prominent rights lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa on charges that she allegedly obstructed justice.

""Her arrest is not just an attack on her profession but on the people of Zimbabwe who have just voted yes to a new constitution that enshrines fundamental human rights,"" said her lawyer, Thabani Mpofu.

A new constitution was a key demand of regional mediators who forged a shaky and acrimonious coalition between Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe and the former opposition leader, Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, after the last violent and disputed national polls in 2008.

All main political parties had called for a ""Yes"" vote in the referendum.

Judge Rita Makarau, head of the state electoral commission, said Tuesday that just over 3 million Zimbabweans voted for the draft constitution and 170,489 voted against. Spoiled ballot papers were not factored in to the final results of votes cast by less than 50 percent of those eligible to vote in the referendum.

The 170-page draft constitution has now to be submitted to the Zimbabwe parliament for approval, a procedural formality, before President Mugabe is asked to sign it into law.

The draft limits the future presidential office to two five-year terms, a clause that is not retrospective. Mugabe, 89, who led the nation to independence in 1980, can rule for another two terms if his party wins upcoming five-yearly parliamentary and presidential polls.

The proposed constitution sets up the first Constitutional Court on citizens' grievances and a Peace and Reconciliation Commission to investigate political violence and human rights abuses blamed mainly on Mugabe's ZANU-PF party over the past decade of troubled polling and alleged vote-rigging.

Regional observers of Saturday's referendum said voting was free of violence except for minor scuffles between rival youth groups. The outcome of voting was seen as ""credible"" and reflecting the free will of electors.

But independent local monitoring groups reported that Mugabe party loyalists had taken down the names of voters emerging from some polling stations, a possible ploy used to threaten them in the crucial full scale elections.

Human rights groups say the new constitution does not immediately scrap sweeping media and security laws enforced by state institutions loyal to Mugabe, and that can only be done by a the next elected parliament.

The independent Research and Advocacy Unit said in its latest bulletin that reforms proposed in the new constitution ""will clearly take a much more energetic parliament than the one we have currently"" if they are to be implemented. The group said, ""Constitutions are not the panacea for all ills.""

The continued jailing of rights lawyer Mtetwa highlights how Mugabe's police and judicial system needs thorough reform, said lawyers.

Police brought her to court Tuesday after ignoring a judge's order to release her Monday.

Mtetwa, arrested Sunday while representing four officials of the prime minister's party who were being searched by police, arrived at the Harare magistrate's court in an open-back police truck. She greeted colleagues and activists with a spirited wave but was not allowed to speak to reporters.

Mtetwa's arrest was a ploy to stop her from defending officials of Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change party, her attorney argued in court Tuesday.

State prosecutors objected to bail for Mtetwa and the four MDC officials and court was adjourned to Wednesday.

Mtetwa was abused by the police in ""the high-handed manner in which they treated her by handcuffing her and throwing her into the back of an open truck as if she was a threat to police and national security,"" said her lawyer, Mpofu.

While in custody, police confiscated her mobile phone and went through it in breach of norms of attorney-client confidentiality, he said. He said when locked in a cell two male police officers at around midnight even tried to remove prison-issue blankets from her.

To the charge she shouted at police officers and attempted to prevent them from doing their duty, Mtetwa, in her written testimony, said she told the police she wanted to see their search warrants but was ignored.

""What you are doing is unlawful, unconstitutional and undemocratic,"" she told the officers, Mpofu said.

The police response was to arrest her, he said.

The refusal of police to obey a court order to release Mtetwa showed that Zimbabwe ""is a state that is prepared to act like an outlaw,"" Mpofu told the court.

Obstructing justice carries a maximum penalty of two years in prison.

Mtetwa has represented Tsvangirai and several of his top aides in past cases brought against them. She has also defended human rights defenders and journalists. She holds an array of international awards, including those from the American Bar Association and the main European Bar Human Rights body."

John Kerry is a far more effective salesman when his heart is in it.

When he did the “full Ginsburg” of Sunday show appearances to defend President Obama’s decision to delay action on Syria, Kerry seemed dutiful and workmanlike, repeating the same talking points without much enthusiasm and often averting his gaze from the camera.

People should be “celebrating” Obama’s decision to seek congressional approval, said Kerry, who hardly appeared in a celebratory mood.

What a contrast with his command performance less than 48 hours earlier, when the secretary of State urged action against Syria over chemical attacks that he said he shocked the conscience of the world.

In that speech, the 2004 presidential candidate was impassioned, filled with moral fervor about the need to punish the “thug” and “murderer” Bashar Assad for gassing his own people.

This matters, in public relations terms, because the White House has tapped Kerry as the man to make the case for military action, as Colin Powell did in 2002 and 2003.

But when Obama abruptly decided to hold off after discussions with his White House aides, Kerry was informed afterwards with a phone call—and sent out to defend the move on ""Meet the Press,"" ""Face the Nation,"" ""This Week,"" ""Fox News Sunday"" and ""State of the Union.""

While the Sunday shows draw a heavily insider audience, they fill a weekend news vacuum (which is why Kerry used them to announce new evidence that the Syrian regime used deadly sarin). They also lay down a marker, as Susan Rice found after being dispatched to the same five shows with Benghazi talking points that turned out to be false. Otherwise she’d probably be running Foggy Bottom now.

Kerry, not surprisingly, ran into a buzzsaw of skeptical questioning.

“Do you feel undermined? Do you feel the United States has undermined its leverage in the world?” David Gregory asked.

“This isn’t 'CSI.' This isn’t a civics lesson. People’s lives are at stake,” Chris Wallace said.

“They already declared victory in Syria this morning, the Assad regime,” said George Stephanopoulos, who also spoke of the chances of “getting sucked into a wider war.”

Kerry was in the awkward position of repeatedly insisting he didn’t have to address the possibility of a congressional rejection because that was not going to happen. But the truth is it remains an open question—and Obama has had little success in getting his way on most issues.

It’s no surprise the Sunday anchors were skeptical of a cabinet officer who by all appearances was having to squelch his disagreement with the commander-in-chief."

Today was a very eventful day for President Obama in Israel. He visited Gaza albeit with rockets being launched into Israel from Gaza. He then gave a major speech in Jerusalem to an auditorium filled with cheering university students where he provided encouragement and tough love to both the Israelis and Palestinians. After that speech, the President was awarded the Israeli’s Presidential Distinction Award, the highest civilian award in Israel and the first sitting President to receive one.

As he was getting this most distinguished award, both CNN and MSNBC covered the event live. This should have been a patriotic moment for the country. In accepting the award the President even said he accepted it on behalf of the American people. Fox News was not covering this event. I was compelled to tweet on this as follows in real time.

Prez Obama getting Israel's Presidential Medal of Distinction. CNN & MSNBC carries it live. Fox News NOT. How unpatriotic! — Egberto Willies (@EgbertoWillies) March 21, 2013

Tonight however Rachel Maddow coverage of this snub was epic.

After that big speech that was so well received by that huge Israeli audience in Jerusalem, President Obama was honored at a state dinner. He was awarded the Israeli Medal Of Distinction which is the highest honor a civilian can receive in Israel. He is the first sitting President to ever receive this award. Israeli President Simon Peres said to President Obama quote “The people of Israel are particularly move by your unforgettable contribution to their security”. He called President Obama, Dear Barack. So that was what was happening live in Israel. CNN and MSNBC are carrying it live showing the President of the United States receiving this medal at this big state dinner in a foreign country… Fox News channel however is pretending like it is not happening. They’re talking about repealing Obamacare…. We are all watching as the Israeli president is saying to President Obama, “I know that you would not stop striving for a better world. What was running on Fox News instead was a commercial for their new special on President Obama as an enemy of Israel… COMMERCIAL: Obama: The State Of Israel will have no greater friend than the United States. Narrator: But with a friend like Obama are Israel’s enemies gaining strength. Sean gets expert insight on a special Hannity. That is what Fox News was telling its audience of American Conservatives instead of showing this, happening in Israel. in real life, in the actual world at that very moment, They report, you decide.

Fox News is a clear and present danger to America. They are no different than the propaganda engine used by dictators and the Oligarchy in the third world. It is the same tactic used to demonize Hugo Chavez and other leaders that are attempting to bring real democracy and access to success for the masses and middle class.

Fox News is mostly responsible for much of the gridlock, bad policies, citizen misinformation, and the driver of citizens that vote against their own interest. While the remainder of the mainstream media is not as blatant in their servitude of the American Plutocracy, they also have blood on their hands.

http://news.yahoo.com/restored-rome-catacomb-frescoes-add-debate-women-priests-112948688--sector.html,,[],Restored Rome catacomb frescoes add to debate on women priests,"By Philip Pullella ROME (Reuters) - Proponents of a female priesthood say frescoes in the newly restored Catacombs of Priscilla prove there were women priests in early Christianity. The Vatican says such assertions are sensationalist ""fairy tales"". The catacombs, on Rome's Via Salaria, have been fully reopened after a five-year project that included laser technology to clean some of the ancient frescoes and a new museum to house restored marble fragments of sarcophagi. Art lovers and the curious around the world who cannot get to Rome can join the debate by using a virtual visit to the underground labyrinth by Google Maps, a first-time venture mixing antiquity and modern high technology. Built as Christian burial sites between the second and fifth centuries and meandering underground for 13 km (8 miles) over several levels, the Catacombs of Priscilla contain frescoes of women that have provoked academic debate for many years. One, in a room called the ""Cubiculum of the Veiled Woman,"" shows a woman whose arms are outstretched like those of a priest saying Mass. She wears what the catacombs' Italian website calls ""a rich liturgical garment"". The word ""liturgical"" does not appear in the English version. She also wears what appears to be a stole, a vestment worn by priests. Another fresco, in a room known as ""The Greek Chapel,"" shows a group of women sitting around a table, their arms outstretched like those of priests celebrating Mass. Organizations promoting a female priesthood, such as the Women's Ordination Conference and the Association of Roman Catholic Woman Priests, have pointed to these ancient scenes as evidence of a female priesthood in the early Church. But the Vatican contests these interpretations which have also appeared in books on women in Christianity, such as the ""The Word According to Eve"" published in 1998. ""FAIRY TALE"" ""This is an elaboration that has no foundation in reality,"" Barbara Mazzei of the Pontifical Commission on Sacred Archaeology told Reuters at the presentation of the restoration on Tuesday. ""This is a fairy tale, a legend,"" said Professor Fabrizio Bisconti, superintendent of religious heritage archaeological sites owned by the Vatican, including numerous catacombs scattered around Rome. He said such interpretations were ""sensationalist and absolutely not reliable"". Bisconti said the fresco of the woman in a gesture of priest-like prayer was ""a depiction of a deceased person now in paradise,"" and that the women sitting at the table were taking part in a ""funeral banquet"" and not a Eucharistic gathering. The Church teaches that women cannot become priests because Jesus willingly chose only men as his apostles. Giorgia Abeltino, head of public policy at Google Italy, said special instruments and smaller cameras were developed for the virtual tour project, which is similar to Google's street view except that it explores the bowels of ancient Rome. The Catacombs of Priscilla are also famous for a fresco which experts believe is the oldest known image of the Madonna and Child, dating to about 230 AD. Lost for centuries after its entrances were sealed in ancient time, the catacombs were re-discovered in the 16th century and plundered of many gravestones, sarcophagi and bodies. Excavations in modern times began in the 19th century. (Reporting By Philip Pullella; Editing by Michael Roddy and Angus MacSwan)"
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/06/opinion/keller-syria-is-not-iraq.html,2013-05-06 00:00:00,['Bill Keller'],Syria Is Not Iraq - The New York Times,"But in Syria, I fear prudence has become fatalism, and our caution has been the father of missed opportunities, diminished credibility and enlarged tragedy.

The United States has supplied humanitarian aid and diplomatic pressure. But our reluctance to arm the rebels or defend the civilians being slaughtered in their homes has convinced the Assad regime (and the world) that we are not serious. Our fear that arms supplied to the rebels would fall into the hands of jihadis has become a self-fulfilling prophecy, because instead of dealing directly with the rebels we left the arming to fundamentalist monarchies, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and they are predictably using lethal aid to appease the more radical Islamists.

It might have been easier to intervene a year ago, before the opposition was so fragmented. But back then the president was busy ending foreign engagements and in no mood to start a new one. Besides, everyone was preoccupied by the dramas of Iran’s nuclear program, Egypt’s revolution and Ohio’s electoral votes. Since then, Assad has been sly about escalating his savagery by degrees — artillery, then aerial bombardment, then Scud missiles and now, apparently, chemical weapons — while staying just below whatever threshold of horror might shame us into responding.

What you hear from the Obama team is that we know way too little about the internal dynamics of Syria, so we can’t predict how an intervention will play out, except that there is no happy ending; that while the deaths of 70,000 Syrians are tragic, that’s what happens in a civil war; that no one in the opposition can be trusted; and, most important, that we have no vital national interest there. Obama conceded that the use of poison gas would raise the stakes, because we cannot let the world think we tolerate spraying civilians with nerve gas. But even there, the president says he would feel obliged to respond to “systematic” use of chemical weapons, as if something less — incremental use? sporadic use? — would be O.K. This sounds like a president looking for excuses to stand pat.

In contemplating Syria, it is useful to consider the ways it is not Iraq.

First, we have a genuine, imperiled national interest, not just a fabricated one. A failed Syria creates another haven for terrorists, a danger to neighbors who are all American allies, and the threat of metastasizing Sunni-Shiite sectarian war across a volatile and vital region. “We cannot tolerate a Somalia next door to Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Turkey,” said Vali Nasr, who since leaving the Obama foreign-policy team in 2011 has become one of its most incisive critics. Nor, he adds, can we afford to let the Iranians, the North Koreans and the Chinese conclude from our attitude that we are turning inward, becoming, as the title of Nasr’s new book puts it, “The Dispensable Nation.”"

“I think this is obviously one of those moments where North Korea needs to figure out where it’s heading and recognize that the United States of America is not engaging in belligerent and threatening behavior,” Kerry told NBC News.

Last month, an 85-year-old tourist from Palo Alto was buckled in his seat on a plane preparing to depart Pyongyang, North Korea, when a flight attendant pointed him out to two men in uniform. They promptly escorted him off the plane.

The man, Merrill Newman, a retired financial executive and Korean War veteran, has not been heard from since.

Newman was detained Oct. 26 at Pyongyang’s Sunan International Airport, but the case was initially kept secret at the urging of his family. Word first began to leak out late Tuesday when the State Department issued a cryptically worded advisory against travel to North Korea. Without mentioning Newman’s name, the advisory warned that the department had received reports of “authorities arbitrarily detaining U.S. citizens and not allowing them to leave the country.”

This is the seventh time that a U.S. citizen has been detained in North Korea since 2009, but previous cases have involved Christian missionaries or people who illegally entered the country, as in the case of two journalists who wandered across the Tumen River from China while reporting on border crossings. A Korean American missionary, Kenneth Bae, has been held in North Korea for more than a year.

Kerry did not directly address Merrill’s detainment Wednesday and only said the country has “other people” besides Bae.

“This is a real weird one,” said Daniel Sneider, a Korea specialist at Stanford University. “He is not an ethnic Korean. He is not a missionary running around distributing Bibles. We wonder if he said something he shouldn’t have or took pictures of something he shouldn’t have, but that doesn’t explain it.”

Sneider said that Newman’s detention raised questions anew about the stability of the North Korean government under Kim Jong Un, 30, who took the helm after his father, Kim Jong Il, died in December 2011.

“The real story here is what is going on in North Korea. Who is making the decisions?” Sneider said.

North Korea has in recent years become an exotic destination for tourists, who sign up for highly escorted package tours from Beijing to marvel at the grandiose communist monuments, the mass acrobatics and socialist kitsch, fast disappearing elsewhere in the 21st century. In 2010, North Korea eased its travel rules, making it easier for American citizens to visit.

“He really wanted to see Korea today,” said William M. Mason, a friend of Newman’s.

Newman, who lives with his ailing wife, had arranged his trip with a friend, Bob Hamrdla, a retired Stanford official who now organizes tours for alumni, according to people familiar with the case. The trip went as scheduled until the last morning, when the two men boarded an Air Koryo flight bound for Beijing.

“They were sitting, waiting to take off. A stewardess escorted two guys in uniform on the plane, and he has been held incommunicado ever since,” said Mason, a professor emeritus of sociology at UCLA. “When he didn’t come back as scheduled, the family got extremely worried. They don’t know how he is or whether he is getting his medication.”

The United States does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea, and negotiations over Newman, as with other detainees, are being handled by the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.

The North Koreans have not commented about Newman or confirmed his detention, which is in itself unusual.

“The governments of America and of Qatar backtracked on the promise they made to us on the flag and the name,” the official said. “It was agreed we could use them.

Story highlights The party reportedly has three ministers and two secretaries of state The officials will ""continue to shoulder their responsibilities,"" a party leader says Tunisia faces political unrest after a rare political assassination

Members of the president’s party in Tunisia will quit the coalition government, the state-run news agency TAP reported Sunday.

The move threatens to worsen a political crisis, set off after an opposition leader was assassinated there last week.

The Congress for the Republic Party, which counts Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki among its ranks, has three ministers and two secretaries of state in the government, TAP reported.

The five officials will “continue to shoulder their responsibilities within their respective departments to avoid any administrative vacuum,” TAP said, citing Chokri Yacoub, a party leader.

The news comes one day after Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali said he would step down if a caretaker government he is forming fails to win approval from Tunisia’s National Constituent Assembly.

In response to the shooting death of Chokri Belaid, Jebali sacked his government and said he would appoint a new one to serve until the next election.

However, a top official of Jebali’s own Ennahda party labeled Jebali’s moves “non-binding,” raising questions about his leadership.

Belaid, a prominent secular politician who decried violence, was shot dead as he left his home Wednesday morning for work. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Belaid’s widow and others blamed the climate fostered by Jebali’s Ennahda party.

Jebali denied that Ennahda had anything do with Belaid’s killing and said he hoped to get approval for his new government from his party and others.

“The government, I feel, is backed by a lot of people, mainly among ordinary people. I hope that political parties will translate the view of our people,” Jebali said Friday.

As he spoke, thousands of Tunisians demonstrated in the streets of the capital in outrage over the assassination, calling on Jebali to resign.

The killing of Belaid was the country’s first high-profile political assassination since Tunisia’s “Jasmine Revolution” that toppled President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali two years ago and spawned the Arab Spring.

He says speech couldn't convince war-weary citizens that U.S. interests at stake

Miller: A strike would have to be broader than Obama describing, and Americans fear this

President Barack Obama's speech to the American public Monday night was eloquent and forceful. But given the odds arrayed against him -- some of his own making -- the persuader in chief likely won't make the sale.

Indeed, it's likely that none of the other great communicators and explainers -- Franklin Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton -- could have either. And here's why:

Chico Marx was right

Impersonating Groucho in ""Duck Soup,"" Chico makes a remark that sums up Obama's challenge: ""Who are you going to believe, me or your own eyes?""

The American people are their own experts this time around on what constitutes a vital national interest for the United States and what they want done about it.

After two of the longest and most profitless wars in American history, the public has a more discriminating assessment of what's worth fighting for and what's not. And, deeply dismayed by the standard for victory -- when can we leave, not how do we win -- most Americans rightly see a U.S. military strike on Syria as an imperfect option that is likely either to be ineffective or to draw the U.S. into another country's civil war.

Aaron David Miller

One speech could never overcome the skepticism and doubts left by a decade of two pointless wars. And this one didn't.

It's not that Americans are unmoved by the president's heartfelt descriptions of dead Syrian children gassed by, the administration says, President Bashar al-Assad's murderous forces; it's that their priorities lie elsewhere.

But it's America's broken house that's in need of repair, not someone else's. And no amount of false analogies to Munich and appeasement will sway them. They know what they see, and it's not compelling enough to justify the uncertainties of a military strike.

The president's words last night didn't allay those doubts.

Obama's Syria policy is a Marx Brothers movie

Over the past week, one got the feeling that every day another door opened on the Syria issue with yet another surprise. The twists and turns didn't help the administration's case for clarity and consistency, which is so critical to providing the background of a speech to the nation. Indeed, events of the past week made the president's task much harder.

JUST WATCHED How will U.N. find Syria's weapons? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How will U.N. find Syria's weapons? 03:02

JUST WATCHED Syria debate: week in review, week 1 Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Syria debate: week in review, week 1 02:25

First, after a buildup to one of the most widely telegraphed military actions in the history of warfare, the president surprised the nation by deferring military action while he sought an authorization to use force from Congress. That was followed by an off-the-cuff remark by Secretary of State John Kerry on how al-Assad could preempt a military attack by turning over all his chemicals weapons.

The next surprise was a Russian endorsement of Kerry's idea -- and then Syria jumping aboard the peace train. The result: On the eve of the president's speech -- presumably aimed at making the case for a military strike -- the momentum had shifted away from war as the United Nations, the French and the secretary-general all try to figure out how to make peace and take al-Assad's chemicals off line.

The American public -- already confused as to whether the strike would be ""unbelievably small"" (in John Kerry's words) or, in the president's words, more robust (""the U.S. military doesn't do pinpricks"") -- could be forgiven if it was a tad bewildered.

Overselling the risks of not acting

Much of the president's speech dealt with the consequences of not acting militarily in the face of the largest single deployment of chemical weapons against civilians since Saddam Hussein used them against the Kurds in 1988. There's no doubt that doing nothing would broaden al-Assad's margin to use these weapons again if he felt it necessary.

But we need to be clear: This regime is engaged in a fight to preserve itself and will do whatever is necessary to stay in power. A U.S. strike would have to be extremely punishing to deter al-Assad from using these weapons and extremely comprehensive in its scope to degrade al-Assad's capacity. The president can't make his case by playing down the severity of any U.S. response.

The other risks of inaction -- deterring Iran from nuclear weapons or suggesting that the U.S. is threatened by these weapons -- just don't add up and aren't compelling.

Indeed, should al-Assad be weakened or lose control, these chemical weapons might well fall into the hands of al Qaeda and other jihadist groups that could use them directly against the United States.

Our cardboard conception of leadership

Even under normal circumstances, a single presidential speech to persuade Americans to back a military strike would be a tough sell. Presidential speeches rarely move the needle much on an issue like this. We have this artificial conception of our president's capacity.

If only the president could make the case with powerful logic, he can indeed persuade. The only thing that's missing is leadership.

But that's really not the way it works. Presidents are more often prisoners of events. The great ones -- Abraham Lincoln, FDR -- are fortunate (if that's the right word) to have circumstances that allow them to do so. And they intuit and extract opportunities from those circumstances that allow them to lead.

Obama doesn't have these circumstances.

He faces a public that is deeply skeptical of attacking another Arab/Muslim country; a divided and skeptical Congress; and an international community that fears military action. And he confronts this environment with a military option that he himself doesn't really believe in either. There's no real sense of urgency or emergency, partly because the president has willfully downplayed that sense of crisis.

Obama is an ambivalent warrior. He fashions himself the extricator in chief charged with getting America out of profitless conflicts, not getting them into new ones. And it shows.

Monday night's speech reflected a man who on one hand would like to be rescued by a diplomatic solution to a problem he himself knows can't be resolved by military force and on the other, one who realizes he has a very bad military option if he must go forward.

And as a consequence, what was hyped as a major speech really couldn't be, in large part because there was nothing to decide and no urgency to do so.

Congress isn't going to vote this week; the U.S. isn't going to war soon; and Vladimir Putin's diplomacy from Russia has yet to play itself out. Indeed, right now the president can't be the decider in chief because there's nothing to decide.

For now, Obama -- along with the rest of the country -- is stuck in limbo between a war he clearly doesn't want and diplomatic approach he knows faces long odds. And no presidential speech could free him or the country from that predicament."

WASHINGTON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - A senior Democratic senator said on Sunday that the U.S.-Russia relationship had become ""poisonous"" and urged President Barack Obama to consider moving next month's Group of 20 summit away from the Russian city of St. Petersburg.

Charles Schumer, the U.S. Senate's third ranking Democrat and a close Obama ally, accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of trying to antagonize the United States by granting American fugitive Edward Snowden asylum for one year.

""President Putin is behaving like a schoolyard bully,"" Schumer said on the CBS television talk show ""Face the Nation."" ""In my experience, I've learned unless you stand up to that bully, they ask for more and more and more.""

He said Obama should cancel plans to meet Putin in Moscow for a bilateral summit next month that was expected take place during the U.S. president's trip to Russia for the G20 gathering.

Schumer said he also would call on Obama to ""urge our allies, if it were possible,"" to try to move the G20 summit from St. Petersburg to another country.

The White House has left unclear whether Obama would stop in Moscow after Russia granted asylum to Snowden, a former intelligence contractor wanted in the United States for leaking details of government surveillance programs.

Schumer said that because of the Snowden matter, ""the relationship between the United States and Russia ... is more poisonous than at any time since the Cold War.""

Also speaking on CBS, Republican Congressman Paul Ryan said he agreed with Schumer that there should be consequences for Russia's actions.

Ryan, a former vice presidential candidate and influential voice within his party, accused the Obama administration of appeasement with its policy, known as the ""reset,"" begun in 2009, of trying to improve U.S.-Russia relations.

General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the ABC program ""This Week"" that Russia's actions were disappointing. (Reporting by Caren Bohan; Editing by Bill Trott)"

L’Irlande du Nord fête ses 100 ans lundi, dans un climat de tensions jamais vu depuis la signature de l’accord de paix de 1998. En cause : le Brexit, qui a instauré un contrôle des marchandises circulant entre la province et l'île de Grande-Bretagne. À chaque fois que l'instabilité en Irlande du Nord fait l'actualité, les chroniqueurs politique britanniques se plaisent à citer un discours de Winston Churchill prononcé en 1922 : ""La carte entière de l'Europe a été remodelée (…) mais alors que le déluge reflue et que les eaux se retirent, on voit de nouveau poindre les mornes clochers des comtés de Fermanagh et de Tyrone"", deux comtés nord-irlandais.Alors que l'Irlande est devenue indépendante du Royaume-Uni le 6 décembre 1922, l'Irlande du Nord a été créée un an auparavant et rattachée à la Grande-Bretagne pour protéger l’identité britannique des protestants unionistes du nord-est de l’île.Et maintenant que la tempête provoquée par le Brexit se calme et alors que l'Irlande du Nord célèbre, lundi 3 mai, son centenaire, c'est la carte du Royaume-Uni qui a été modifiée. Depuis le 1er janvier, un contrôle des marchandises circulant entre l'Irlande du Nord et la Grande-Bretagne a été instauré, réveillant les craintes des unionistes de voir leur pays abandonné par la couronne britannique.>> À lire : Sous tension après le Brexit, l'Irlande du Nord fête son centenaireDe fait, le protocole nord-irlandais contenu dans l'accord du Brexit a remplacé la perspective d'un problème à la frontière entre le Royaume-Uni et la République d'Irlande par un problème bien réel d'une frontière entre l'Irlande du Nord et la Grande-Bretagne.Ce protocole maintient l'Irlande du Nord alignée sur un certain nombre de règles de l'Union européenne (UE) alors que la Grande-Bretagne peut s'en départir. Cela entraîne des vérifications et contrôles sur les marchandises circulant entre l'Irlande du Nord et la Grande-Bretagne et impose des droits de douane au cas où ces marchandises entreraient ensuite sur le marché unique européen via la République d'Irlande.Lorsque le Premier ministre, Boris Johnson, est finalement parvenu, en octobre 2019, à un accord avec l'UE sur les termes du divorce entre Londres et Bruxelles, les pro-Brexit ont alors célébré avec soulagement la fin de trois longues années d'interminables négociations, en particulier sur la question de la frontière nord-irlandaise. Mais le Parti unioniste démocrate (DUP) a rapidement exprimé son indignation au sujet de l'instauration d'une frontière douanière en mer d'Irlande. ""Le Brexit ne s'applique pas à l'ensemble du Royaume-Uni"", avait alors déploré le vice-président du DUP, Nigel Dodds.Démission de la Première ministre nord-irlandaiseAu sein de la classe politique britannique, rares sont ceux ayant anticipé que l'accord signé par Boris Johnson représenterait une menace aux yeux des unionistes nord-irlandais. L'ancien chef de cabinet du Premier ministre Tony Blair et artisan de l'accord du Vendredi saint de 1998, Jonathan Powell, fut l'un d'entre eux. ""La frontière en mer d'Irlande est un vrai problème pour eux"", écrit-il alors dans le Irish Times peu après l'accord obtenu par Boris Johnson. ""Et cette question prendra de l'ampleur à mesure que le Royaume-Uni s'éloignera des régulations européennes et instaurera de nouveaux droits de douane, poursuit Jonathan Powell. Cette frontière menacera leur identité britannique.""Les faits lui ont donné raison. L'entrée en vigueur des dispositions liées au Brexit, le 1er janvier 2021, provoqua de fortes perturbations dans la chaîne d'approvisionnement des supermarchés et la livraison des commandes en ligne. Puis des graffitis s'opposant aux contrôles douaniers furent peints, début février, dans des quartiers unionistes, tandis que les autorités décidaient la suspension temporaire des contrôles douaniers dans certains ports d'Irlande du Nord face au ""comportement menaçant"" de certains militants loyalistes.Craignant que ces contrôles douaniers ne représentent une séparation trop profonde entre l'Irlande du Nord et la Grande-Bretagne, le Loyalist Communities Council (LCC), qui regroupe des organisations paramilitaires loyalistes, s'est retiré de l'accord du Vendredi saint, tout en affirmant que toute opposition au protocole nord-irlandais devait être ""pacifique et démocratique"".>> À lire : Violences en Irlande du Nord : ""Le Brexit a déstabilisé une paix déjà fragile""Mais de violentes émeutes dans les quartiers unionistes ont pourtant éclaté début avril. Le LCC a affirmé ne pas en être responsable, appelant au calme, mais a tout de même souligné qu'il y avait eu ""un échec collectif spectaculaire pour bien prendre la mesure du niveau et de la nature de la colère des unionistes et des loyalistes"" vis-à-vis du protocole.Enfin, la Première ministre d'Irlande du Nord et leader du DUP, Arlene Foster, a été poussée à la démission, le 28 avril, par les membres de son parti qui lui reprochaient de ne pas avoir été assez ferme sur les droits de douane.La situation semble désormais dans l'impasse et risque de mettre le DUP face à son impuissance. ""Ça ne peut qu'engendrer des tensions sans fin, voir même un chaos imminent"", juge Tim Bale, professeur en sciences politiques à l'Université Queen Mary de Londres.Erreur d'appréciation du DUPLe DUP est pourtant en partie responsable du protocole nord-irlandais. Le Parti unioniste s'est en effet prononcé en faveur du Brexit au moment du référendum de 2016. ""Il n'a pas réfléchi aux conséquences d'une sortie du Royaume-Uni de l'UE, notamment concernant la frontière irlandaise"", rappelle Jon Tonge, spécialiste de la politique en Irlande du Nord et professeur à l'Université de Liverpool. ""Le DUP s'attendait à une courte victoire des pro-UE et n'avait pas la moindre idée de ce qu'il devait faire lorsque les pro-Brexit l'ont emporté"", ajoute-t-il.Les élections générales de 2017 ont toutefois donné au DUP davantage d'influence, puisque c'est le vote de ses dix députés qui a permis à Theresa May de se maintenir au pouvoir alors que le parti conservateur avait perdu la majorité à la Chambre des Communes. Mais le Parti unioniste a refusé de soutenir le plan de sortie de Theresa May sous prétexte que celui-ci aurait obligé le Royaume-Uni à continuer d'accepter les réglementations de l'UE pour une période indéfinie.""Le DUP a clairement mal évalué les tenants et les aboutissants du plan de Theresa May qui, avec son ‘backstop' irlandais, permettait à l'Irlande du Nord d'être traitée de la même façon que le reste du Royaume-Uni en matière de douanes, souligne le spécialiste Tim Bale. Qui sait quelle solution magique ils espéraient avec un plan alternatif ? Mais faire confiance à Boris Johnson pour tenir parole et en trouver une défie la raison.""Lors du congrès du DUP en 2018, Boris Johnson avait en effet affirmé qu'""aucun gouvernement conservateur britannique ne pourrait ou ne devrait signer un accord"" instaurant des contrôles douaniers en mer d'Irlande. C'est exactement ce qu'il fit un an plus tard.Vers un référendum sur l'avenir de l'Irlande du NordPire encore, le Brexit semble avoir entamé la popularité du DUP. Les sondages montrent que l'unionisme est toujours devant le nationalisme en Irlande du Nord, mais l'écart s'est resserré depuis le référendum de 2016.La démographie, également, favorise les nationalistes catholiques depuis deux décennies. Toutefois, la religion n'est plus aussi déterminante qu'autrefois sur le plan politique. Le recensement britannique de 2011 a ainsi montré que 45 % des Nord-Irlandais disaient être issus d'une famille catholique, mais seulement 25 % se disaient exclusivement Irlandais.Dans ce contexte, jusqu'au Brexit, l'unionisme semblait en capacité de résister face aux courbes démographiques. D'autant qu'après l'accord du Vendredi saint de 1998, une ""proportion grandissante"" de la population catholique se sentait ""bien"" au sein du Royaume-Uni, explique Katy Hayward, professeure de sociologie politique à la Queen's University de Belfast.Beaucoup de ces personnes ""apprécient certains aspects du Royaume-Uni comme le système de santé"", ajoute Jon Tonge. Bien qu'ils ""ne voteront jamais pour des partis unionistes"", beaucoup de ces Nord-Irlandais catholiques ont ""tout doucement commencé à se considérer comme des unionistes avec un petit u"" [le terme 'unioniste' en anglais s'écrit avec un u majuscule, NDLR], poursuit-il.Alors que 56 % des Nord-Irlandais avaient voté en faveur du maintien dans l'Union européenne, le Brexit a rebattu les cartes, au point que l'idée d'un référendum sur l'avenir de l'Irlande du Nord est désormais dans tous les esprits.L'accord du Vendredi saint prévoit en effet la tenue d'un référendum si, ""à quelque moment que ce soit, il apparaît vraisemblable qu'une majorité de votants exprime le souhait que l'Irlande du Nord cesse d' être partie intégrante du Royaume-Uni et soit rattachée à la République"". ""La question dorénavant n'est pas de savoir si ce référendum aura lieu, mais quand"", estime Jon Tonge.Cet article a été adapté de l'anglais par Romain Brunet.

Korea: Detained American will soon face trial,"North Korea said Saturday that a detained American allegedly tried to “topple” its government and will soon be put on trial, a potential complication as Washington tries to ramp down tensions stemming from Pyongyang’s recent weapons tests and threats of nuclear attack.

Kenneth Bae, a tour operator from Washington state, is the sixth American detained by the North since 2009, but he faces more serious charges than the others. The North used several previous cases as bargaining chips with the United States, drawing rescue-mission visits from former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter.

The North gave no specifics about its evidence against Bae, saying only that his crimes were “clearly substantiated.” In November, Bae traveled in a small group to the North Korean port city of Rajin, a special economic zone that caters to foreign investors. There, he was arrested by authorities.

Bill Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, tried to negotiate Bae’s release during a trip to Pyongyang in January. But North Korean officials would not let Richardson meet with Bae, Richardson said — although they did reassure him that Bae’s health was good. They also told Richardson that Bae had been allowed to meet with members of the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang, which occasionally acts on behalf of the United States because Washington does not have diplomatic ties with the North.

In an interview with CNN after his trip, Richardson said Bae was being held “very far away from Pyongyang, in the northern part of the country.”

Since Richardson’s visit, tensions between North Korea and the United States have spiked. In February, the North detonated an underground nuclear weapon and then responded with fury to a new round of U.N. sanctions. It also threatened preemptive nuclear strikes against the United States and its allies in the region, including South Korea and Japan.

Washington has proposed talks with the North — but only if its leaders show signs that they want to denuclearize, something they have repeatedly said they will never do."

That was, at least in part, a response to Russia’s decision to grant NSA leaker Edward Snowden temporary asylum, a move that left the White House “extremely disappointed.” So what will the fallout be? Are the media’s Cold War comparisons appropriate?

No. This episode will have limited impact on an already toxic bilateral relationship that matters increasingly less around the world.

Obama made the right decision — and more importantly, he did it at the right time. By snubbing Putin when he did, Obama will allow Secretaries of State and Defense John Kerry and Chuck Hagel and their Russian counterparts to work back up from this low-water mark when they meet this week. If he had waited to snub Putin, it would unwind any progress that might come out of the current meetings. Obama clearly understands there is more room for productivity among senior diplomats than between the heads of state, where the relationship has always been icy, and any shortcomings are higher profile.

So the relationship only seems to be getting worse. Despite a very strong first term as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton’s “reset” with Russia is the biggest policy misstep she made. (Benghazi was far more politicized, but it was not her doing.) I’m surprised this failed diplomacy hasn’t gotten more coverage.

But the problem isn’t U.S.-Russia: it’s Russia itself. (That’s in stark contrast with U.S.-China relations, where there are material issues in the bilateral dynamic itself that make the partnership much feebler than the sum of its parts). Today, the situation in Russia makes unpredictable foreign policy decisions increasingly inevitable. Institutions have been undermined by corruption and a centralization of power at the very top. We see massive brain drain and capital flight. On top of that, Russia’s vast energy wealth is now looking like it will be less useful long-term than had been presumed. That’s in part because of the North American energy revolution that looks set to keep expanding supply. Putin’s response to all of this? Rather than opting for reform, he has decided to double down, tightening his control and letting the budget balloon to levels where ever-higher oil prices are needed for it to be balanced. This shortsighted approach can provide greater stability now, but it just exacerbates the worsening prospects for Russia in terms of diplomacy and economic trajectory down the road.

Don’t read too far into Obama’s snub. It doesn’t change the structural dynamics in a bilateral relationship that is slowly worsening, and slowly fading in importance. The real danger? As the domestic situation in Russia worsens, expect the country to lash out. That’s what happens when decisions are made by one increasingly quixotic (and despotic) individual.

By sending issue to Congress, Obama seeks to make war harder to launch, Bergen says

Bergen: Obama lacked international support and legal standing to strike Syria

Obama's move is a risk, as was decision to launch Osama bin Laden raid, Bergen says

Barack Obama came to Washington to end wars. Not to start them.

That much was crystal clear only three months ago when Obama gave a keynote speech on May 23 at the National Defense University in Washington in which he called for an end to the ""boundless war on terror"" and ""perpetual wartime footing"" that has existed in the U.S. since 9/11.

Obama focused part of this speech on the Authorization for the Use of Military Force that Congress passed days after 9/11 and that gave President George W. Bush the authority to go to war in Afghanistan.

No one in Congress who voted for this resolution at the time realized that he or she was in effect authorizing in Afghanistan what would become America's longest war.

Nor did they realize that they were giving a virtual blank check to the president to wage covert U.S. wars in countries such as Pakistan and Yemen where, according to data compiled by the New America Foundation, thousands have been killed in CIA drone strikes with almost no input from Congress.

During his defense speech, Obama vowed to help end the Authorization for the Use of Military Force that set in motion the seemingly endless war the U.S. has been fighting since 2001.

This is some of the context of Obama's decision to go to Congress to seek authorization for a military strike on Syria. Obama has wanted to leave office in 2016 as the president who had made it harder, not easier, for future presidents to go to war unilaterally without the input of Congress.

Peter Bergen

In going to Congress for authorization of any military operation in Syria, we see Obama the former constitutional law professor at work, but we also see Obama the pragmatist.

The Obama administration could have always made the argument in the past few days that it could justify attacking the regime of Bashar al-Assad on humanitarian grounds to prevent further massacres of the Syrian people with chemical weapons despite the fact that there was no international authorization for attacking Syria and no congressional resolution sanctioning such an attack.

But that argument would be a novel one as a matter of international law, and it would not be particularly compelling as a matter of domestic politics when the American public seems, at best, split on whether the U.S. should deploy force in Syria.

Unilateral U.S. military actions are, of course, generally uncontroversial after an attack on American targets by a foreign power or group.

President Bill Clinton didn't seek congressional approval for the cruise missiles he launched at al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan in 1998 after the terrorist group's attacks on two U.S. embassies in Africa.

Nor did President George H.W. Bush go to Congress to sign off on his invasion of Panama in 1989, which he authorized because a U.S, Marine had recently been killed there and tens of thousands of other Americans living in the country were purportedly at risk.

Syria hasn't attacked any U.S. targets or citizens, so the argument that an attack on the Assad regime is designed to protect American interests or lives is moot.

That leaves the Obama administration with the option of extracting some kind of authorization for an attack from international bodies such as the United Nations, NATO or the Arab League.

As is now well-known, there isn't a snowball's chance in hell of getting a U.N. authorization since Russia and China have continuously made clear they would veto such a resolution.

There also seems little possibility, for the moment, that NATO will authorize a ""humanitarian"" mission as it did in Kosovo in 1999 to roll back Serbian aggression there. And even if there was such an authorization, right now a major NATO member, the United Kingdom, couldn't participate because the British Parliament voted against such a mission on Thursday.

Indeed, NATO said Monday it wants a ""firm international response"" in response to the use of chemical weapons in Syria, but that it won't take any military action itself.

The Arab League, which signed off on the operation to topple Moammar Gadhafi in 2011, has so far not signaled a readiness to authorize war against Syria. The League said the world community should take action against those responsible for the use of chemical weapons but did not specify if it would endorse military action by the U.S. or other parties. That said, the usually hypercautious Saudis publicly urged war on Sunday.

In going to Congress for the Syria authorization, we see not only the former constitutional law professor and pragmatist in Obama, but also the calculated risk taker.

On matters of considerable importance where the potential payoff is large, Obama has shown he is willing to take risks. Think no further than his decision two years ago to authorize a Navy SEAL raid to capture or kill Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, a raid he undertook against the advice of Vice President Joe Biden and then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. If that operation had gone poorly, as a number of Obama's top national security officials believed it could, Obama might now be splitting his time between Chicago and Hawaii.

For Obama, a congressional authorization on the use of force in Syria would help him if he needs to authorize additional military actions down the road in Syria. It would also help him if he feels compelled to go to war with Iran. Of course, if he doesn't get such an authorization, he will endure the same kind of humiliation that British Prime Minster David Cameron has just gone through in Parliament.

Obama has, however, no doubt tried to game out how this vote might play out.

He probably calculates that for Republican skeptics in Congress, they will have to explain to the American public why it is that they will not sanction military action on Syria after its large-scale use of chemical weapons while they continue to describe Syria's closest ally, Iran, and its nuclear weapons program -- which still has yet to produce any nuclear weapons-- as a grave threat to the world.

We can be sure that in the next days, the administration will make the argument that if you let Syria take a pass on its large-scale and repeated use of chemical weapons, you can forget any chance of slowing or ending Iran's nuclear program, something that is a matter of great importance for much of the Republican Party.

For those on the left of the Democratic Party in Congress who are generally skeptical of U.S. military actions, Obama can essentially ask, ""If not now, when?"" At what point will self-described liberals intervene to stop the use of weapons so vile that they have been banned by the civilized world for almost a century?"

As midlife sets in, maintaining a healthy weight often becomes harder. Tricks that worked in the past, like cutting down on wine or sugar, no longer seem to work, either. Even slender Samantha Cameron, now 50, has apparently been affected. In her 30s and early 40s, staying in shape was easy, she said this weekend, “but then I hit 43, I just put on three-quarters of a stone. Suddenly you don’t quite fit any of your things and I got really bloated.” At first she tried doing the 5:2 diet – eating normally five days a week, then having just 500 calories on the other two – but “I just couldn’t do it, I literally couldn’t speak in the evening, I had to go to bed at 7pm.” She has recently found a solution: the 5:2 principles, but with 800 calories on the “fast” days, and says she’s “loving it” and “the bloating’s gone”. Alongside three weekly workouts, she says it’s helping to keep her trim: her goal is “to hit my 50s in almost as good shape as I hit my 40s.” If you’re struggling to maintain your weight and fitness post-50, here’s why – and what to do about it: Muscle mass Every decade after the age of 30, we on average lose three to eight per cent of our muscle mass. At first, this might not be noticeable, but by 50 or 60, will make a considerable difference. This is bad news if you want to lose weight, because muscle burns on average three times more calories than fat per day, even at rest. What to do: Incorporate resistance training into your weekly routine to reduce muscle loss. The NHS recommends two sessions of strength training a week, which could include activities as varied as gardening or lifting weights. Don’t underestimate the good that exercise can do: a 2018 study shows that regular exercisers over the age of 55 kept up their muscle mass considerably more than inactive people. Staying active In England, half of 16 to 24-year-olds are doing the recommended amount of weekly exercise, but only one in 10 people aged 65 to 74 are doing so. If injuries have accrued, and your work and social life is less busy than it once was, you may be leading a more sedentary lifestyle than you realise. The role of exercise in weight loss is much-debated, but it can be crucial in maintaining your weight. A famous 2016 study followed participants in American weight loss competition The Biggest Loser during and after filming, and found that most regained a lot of weight after the cameras stopped rolling due to a higher appetite and slower metabolism. However, a follow-up study in 2017 found that the contestants who kept the most weight off were those who had remained committed to a fitness regimen. This was particularly interesting given that more exercise didn’t equal more weight loss during the show, when those who lost the most focused on diet over working out. What to do: Try to stick to the NHS guidelines on exercise, which recommend 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, or a mixture of both. Make sure you are doing something appropriate for your body, too. As we get older, high-impact workouts like running may place unwanted stress on your joints, so think about lower impact options like swimming or cycling. Hormones Menopause changes where fat is stored on the body. Higher oestrogen levels in the fertile years cause fat to be stored on your legs, hips and behind, but after oestrogen drops, fat can move to your middle, even if you remain exactly the same weight. This can be an issue, as fat around your trunk is more likely to contribute to Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and heart issues than fat on your hips and legs. Men are affected by hormone changes as they age, too: after the age of 40 they lose roughly one per cent of their testosterone a year. This matters for weight, as testosterone is linked to the amount of muscle you have and where you store fat. What to do: For women, several studies suggest that HRT can help to stop the shift of fat from your bottom half to around your middle as you go through menopause. An Italian study followed two groups of equal weight post-menopausal women for a year, putting half of them on HRT, with the rest going hormone-free. At the end of the year, the HRT group stayed almost the same weight, and hadn’t put on any extra fat around their middles or arms. In the untreated group, things were different: they had put on three and a half pounds, and had increased the amount of fat around their waists and arms. HRT isn’t suitable for everyone, so make sure you consider your options and discuss with your doctor first. In men, hormones are linked to a variety of lifestyle factors, including body fat and waist size, which can increase the amount of oestrogen in your body. Keeping active is also vital for men’s hormones: a 2018 study found that regular cyclists aged 55 to 74 kept their testosterone levels up compared with inactive men. Your sleep is also a partial predictor of your testosterone levels: most of the hormone is released while we doze, so if you’re not getting enough hours in bed, your body has less chance of boosting its stores. Getting enough sleep is key for maintaining your weight for other reasons, too: not getting enough is shown to make you gravitate towards sweet foods, and muscle growth occurs largely while we’re resting at night. More stress For many, juggling looking after children and caring for parents with work can mean life post-50 requires navigating a huge amount of stress. Even if you eat exactly as you did before, stress can cause weight gain. In 2015, American researchers found that after eating a large meal, women who reported more stress in the previous day burned 104 fewer calories than women who weren’t stressed. Stressed women also had higher levels of insulin, which is linked to gaining fat. This may not sound significant, but burning 100 fewer calories a day could lead to a loss of 10lbs of fat over a year. What to do: Reducing stress is often one of the hardest lifestyle changes to make, as you may have little control over the issues at work or home. However, you can change how you react, which can reduce your stress levels even without anything changing in your external environment. Exercise is an incredibly effective way of lowering cortisol levels, as well as burning calories, which could lead to a double effect on your weight. There is also robust evidence that simply slowing your breathing can dramatically reduce stress in both the short and long term, as well as giving a range of other benefits like better sleep. “Slow” counts as anything less than 10 breaths a minute, and six breaths is even better. The NHS recommends inhaling for up to a count of five, then exhaling for the same length of time."

Putin gets upper hand by giving Obama way out of military strike for now

White House tries to throw the ball back to Putin, saying he must deliver

Russians and Americans have been duking it out in the Twitter world over who's scoring more points in high-stakes diplomatic wrangling over Syria, U.S. President Barack Obama or Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, tweeted Thursday: ""Three days ago there seemed no diplomatic way to hold Assad accountable. Threat of U.S. action finally brought Russia to the table.""

In her tweet, Margarita Simonyan, head of Russia's English-language television network RT, quipped: ""If the Russian proposal on Syria works, Obama, as an honest man, has to give his Nobel Prize to Putin.""

Taking Syria's chemical weapons out of government control and preventing another horrendous attack on civilians is too serious an issue to reduce to political one-upmanship.

But after Putin's bombshell opinion piece in the New York Times in which, among other things, he takes America to task for an ""alarming"" pattern of intervening in the internal conflicts of foreign countries, it's obvious something has shifted.

""It absolutely is a diplomatic win by Putin right now,"" said Fiona Hill, expert on Putin and director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution.

""If we think about this as judo, which is of course Mr. Putin's favorite sport, this is just one set of moves,"" she said. ""And right now, he's managed to get Obama off the mat, at least, and get the terms set down that play to his advantage.""

Putin stopped Obama's drive for military action against Syria in its tracks this week as Russia's plan to put Syria's chemical weapons under international control pushes the action to the United Nations, just where Putin wants it.

Russia has veto power in the U.N. Security Council, and as Hill noted, it's an ""arena that they're really very skilled at, which is usually blocking other people from getting resolutions or moving forward.""

Putin's op-ed is not going down lightly in Washington. Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez said the piece made him almost want to throw up.

""Mr. Putin's personality has been widely demonized in the Western world, so anything that comes from Mr. Putin will be met not only with skepticism but a lot of people will reject just out of hand anything that Mr. Putin will say,"" said Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center.

""However, in this particular situation, when so many people are confused in the United States, in Europe, including in the political classes of Western countries, the arguments that Putin is making so clearly could be used in the domestic debate,"" he added.

Trenin thinks Putin ""is trying to insert himself and the Russian position into the debate that's now ongoing on Capitol Hill, within the U.S. more broadly, in the European countries. He does not want to leave the field to Westerners alone. He wants to have a voice in that discussion.""

Arguments Putin presents in his op-ed struck a chord with some in Washington, even if they dislike him.

One example: ""Syria is not witnessing a battle for democracy, but an armed conflict between government and opposition in a multi-religious country. There are few champions of democracy in Syria. But there are more than enough Qaeda fighters and extremists of all stripes battling the government.""

Other points, like his swipe at Obama's comment this week trumpeting American ""exceptionalism,"" are bound to irritate some of the Americans Putin is trying to sway.

Sen. James Inhofe, a Republican from Oklahoma, said Thursday that ""Putin was lecturing to the United States, and I could hear (Ronald) Reagan turning over in his grave as this was going on.""

Some Russians claim that Obama ""owes"" Putin for getting him out of a bind. Alexey Pushkov, chairman of the Russian State Duma Foreign Affairs Committee, tweeted tartly: ""Obama should be 'for' Russia's plan with two hands. It gives him a chance not to start a new war, not lose in the Congress, and not become another Bush,"" referring to his predecessor.

Hill said Putin did do Obama a favor.

""For Putin, being the old KGB guy, having someone owe him something is always to his advantage,"" she said.

""But this is more about a win for Russia here. Russia gets an imminent U.S. strike off the table for a while,"" Hill said.

The White House is trying to throw the ball back to Putin, cautioning that his chemical weapons proposal will boomerang if it doesn't work.

Putin ""now owns this. He has fully asserted ownership of it, and he needs to deliver,"" a senior White House official told CNN.

Strobe Talbott, president of the Brookings Institution and former deputy secretary of state in the Clinton administration, tweeted: ""If Kerry-Lavrov meeting exposes Russian proposal as sham, it will strengthen Obama's hand with Congress, assuring what Putin hopes to stop."""
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/17/Yesterday-Obama-Was-Not-My-President,2013-09-17 00:00:00,['Joel B. Pollak'],"Yesterday, Obama Was Not My President–or Yours","On Monday, while the death toll mounted at the Navy Yard, President Barack Obama delivered a strident partisan tirade against Republicans, using the fifth anniversary of the Lehman Brothers collapse to score political points ahead of the debt ceiling debate. It was an appalling act of division and insensitivity, and unlike George W. Bush’s My Pet Goat moment on 9/11, it was a calculated abdication of leadership.

It was also an act that places Obama’s passivity during the Benghazi attacks–and his decision to fly to Las Vegas the next day for a campaign fundraiser–in perspective. This is a president who, even as Navy Seals approached Osama bin Laden’s hideout, retired to play cards with his pals. The image is of a man with little regard for the lives of Americans in “his” military, or their families, beyond their use as campaign props.

In addition, President Obama–like it or not–leads the entire nation, not just the majority that voted him into office. In moments of terror and tragedy, his job is to bring the American people together, not to split us apart. Conservatives have been willing–eager, even–to embrace Obama on such occasions, as many did after his speech at the memorial for the Tuscon victims in 2011. Yesterday, he foreclosed any such reconciliation.

What we are seeing is partly the result of Obama’s political foundation as a community organizer–there is never a crisis to waste, so to speak, in stirring up your core supporters against their contrived opponents. But even Alinsky, who had enough sense to criticize those who called police “pigs,” would have counseled against Obama’s speech yesterday, which could not have brought more benefit than harm to his cause.

Yes, Obama did begin by acknowledging the Navy Yard attacks. That is, at least, an improvement from how he reacted to the Ford Hood shooting in 2009, which he only mentioned after several “shout-outs” to his supporters in the audience.

Yet the speech itself should have been canceled, or postponed. The fact that the White House never even considered that option shows how out of touch Obama is with his basic duties.

A story comes to mind, told by a friend in Chicago who met Obama during his obscure State Senate years. Obama was at a local function for medical professionals, and my friend, having just met the Senator from Hyde Park, tried to introduce him to a friend from the same neighborhood. In the nervous rush of the moment, he forgot that friend’s name. “Well, I guess he isn’t your friend, is he,” Obama deadpanned.

Obama then presented his business card, said, “You’ll be hearing about me,” turned, and left, leaving the two men in shock at his rudeness.

That’s the real Obama–the one slowly emerging in presidential biographies now that he is safely ensconced in a second term, the one who drops even the most loyal aides when he feels they are no longer of use to him, the man capable of relating to large crowds but not concrete human beings.

Speaker of the House John Boehner said that Obama’s speech was a “shame.” Charles Krauthammer said that it was in “extremely bad taste.” It was worse than that. It was an insult to the victims and their families, a slap in the face to the nation as a whole, a dereliction of the simplest duty of empathy and discretion. He may apologize–he ought to–but what Obama revealed about himself in that moment can never be undone."

The White House is urging North Korea to release Merrill Newman, an 85-year-old U.S. veteran of the Korean War who has been held in North Korea since October.

Given Newman's ""advanced age and health conditions, we urge the DPRK to release Mr. Newman so he may return home and reunite with his family,"" Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, said Saturday, according to multiple media outlets.

The White House also urged North Korean authorities to release Kenneth Bae, an American who has been held in Korea for more than a year, Reuters reported. ""We remain deeply concerned about the welfare of the U.S. citizens held in custody,"" Hayden said in the statement.

Earlier Saturday, North Korea's state media claimed Newman — a retired finance executive — apologized for alleged crimes during the Korean War and for ""hostile acts"" against the state during a recent trip.

North Korean authorities released video showing Newman reading his alleged apology. It was dated Nov. 9 and couldn't be independently confirmed, the Associated Press reported.

Newman was taken off a plane Oct. 26 by North Korean authorities while preparing to leave after a 10-day visit. Newman's son has said his father wanted to return to the country, where he spent three years during the war.

AP reported North Korea has been accused of previously coercing statements from detainees.

In addition, Newman's alleged statement was riddled with stilted English and grammatical errors, such as ""I want not punish me.""

""I have been guilty of a long list of indelible crimes against DPRK government and Korean people,"" Newman purportedly wrote in a four-page statement, adding: ""Please forgive me.""

A Republican congressman, I bet.

With the House dragging its feet on immigration, vexed by internal GOP infighting on how to proceed, supporters of reform want to force the House to act, and they've zeroed in on the discharge petition as the means to that end.

A discharge petition means that if a majority of the House demands a vote, the vote will take place. And since it's widely acknowledged that there are more than enough votes in the House to pass the Senate bill, all you'd have to do is get those pro-reform Republicans to join Democrats in signing the discharge petition to make it happen.

Some Democrats are afraid that pushing a discharge petition could upset delicate bipartisan negotiations currently underway in the House. Others note that it's the best way to publicly put recalcitrant members on the record on the issue of immigration. And it's true! Absent a vote clearly feared by the xenophobes, the discharge petition forces individual members to publicly state whether they are for or against reform. Let fast-growing immigrant communities know exactly where the obstruction is coming from.

But don't get your hopes up. Even if a full-throated discharge petition campaign were launched, few if any Republicans would likely sign on. In essence, any Republican signatories would be ceding control of the chamber to the minority party, and you better believe the Republican leadership would severely punish any member that signed on.

So as a tool to actually pass a bill, a discharge petition would be as effective as House Speaker John Boehner's leadership style. That is, not effective at all. But as a tool to further pressure and embarrass Republicans? It would certainly work, and it would provide yet another news hook for Spanish-language media to keep pounding on Republicans.

Because right now, that's the only tactic reform proponents have left—try and embarrass Republicans into taking an action they'd clearly rather avoid.

Sign our petition urging U.S. House members to bring comprehensive immigration reform to a floor vote, with or without Speaker Boehner.

The attack killed Afghan civilians and wounded four more State Department personnel. One of them was in critical condition in a hospital in Kandahar, Kerry told reporters Sunday.

""I wish everyone in our country could see first-hand the devotion, loyalty and amazingly hard and hazardous work our diplomats do on the front lines in the world's most dangerous places,"" Kerry said in a statement Saturday. ""Every day, we honor their courage and are grateful for their sacrifices, and today we do so with great sadness.""

Smedinghoff volunteered for an assignment at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul and had been working there since July, her parents said in a statement.

""She particularly enjoyed the opportunity to work directly with the Afghan people and was always looking for opportunities to reach out and help to make a difference in the lives of those living in a country ravaged by war,"" Tom and Mary Beth Smedinghoff said. ""We are consoled knowing that she was doing what she loved, and that she was serving her country by helping to make a positive difference in the world.""

Afghan children killed

At least 11 Afghan children were killed Saturday in a joint military operation by Afghan and NATO forces, local officials said.

Mohammed Zaher Sapai, governor of the Shigal district, said 11 children were among 18 people killed in the operation.

NATO's International Security Assistance Force is investigating, spokesman John Manley said.

""We take these reports of civilian injuries very seriously,"" he said.

U.S. military brass visits

The chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, is in Afghanistan for meetings with coalition and Afghan leaders.

Dempsey will be briefed on the ongoing military transition, where Afghan security forces are taking greater control of their country.

He will meet with Marine Corps Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, who took command of ISAF about two months ago.

""One of the things I'm going to ask (Dunford) is ... what have you learned,"" Dempsey told the American Forces Press Service.

""If he tells me 'Nothing,' I'm going to say, 'Maybe we got the wrong guy.'""

Dempsey spokesman Col. David Lapan later told CNN that the chairman was simply joking when he made the remark about Dunford. Dempsey has total confidence in Dunford, Lapan said."

Most trucks carrying both NATO supplies and commercial goods to neighboring Afghanistan stopped three days ago when supporters of Pakistani politician and cricket star Imran Khan began their protest in northwest Pakistan, said Himayat Shah, head of a transportation association.

Police intervened Monday to stop the protesters from halting trucks. But transportation companies did not yet feel comfortable enough to resume their shipments, said Shah, who is based in the southern port city of Karachi where the shipments originate.

""We are afraid of the protesters because in Peshawar and Dera Ghazi Khan protesters broke the seals on the cargo containers and manhandled drivers,"" Shah said.

There are around 1,500 loaded trucks waiting to resume their journey, said another transportation official based in Karachi, Naseer Khan.

The road blocked by Khan's supporters, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, leads to one of two routes used to ship NATO supplies to Afghanistan.

Companies have also mostly stopped sending trucks to the second crossing in southwest Baluchistan province, Shah said. Officials will review the situation on Wednesday and decide whether to let the trucks move, he said.

Imran Khan's Tehreek-e-Insaf party, which controls the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government, pledged on Saturday to block NATO shipments until the U.S. ends drone attacks targeting Islamic militants in northwest Pakistan. Protesters stopped trucks and roughed up drivers on Sunday on the outskirts of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, before the police stepped in.

Covert CIA drone strikes in Pakistan have long been a sensitive subject, with officials regularly criticizing them in public as a violation of the country's sovereignty. The issue is more complicated, however, since the government is known to have supported at least some of the attacks in the past.

The federal government has also criticized drone strikes but has indicated it has no interest in blocking the NATO supply route, which could spark a crisis with the U.S. and other NATO countries. The police actions Monday indicated that the federal government had intervened to stop the NATO blockade.

The land routes through Pakistan have been key to getting supplies to NATO troops in Afghanistan. They now increasingly are being used to ship equipment out of Afghanistan as the U.S. seeks to withdraw most of its combat troops from the country by the end of 2014.

The routes have been closed in the past. The Pakistani government blocked the routes for seven months following U.S. airstrikes that accidentally killed two dozen soldiers on the Afghan border in November 2011. Pakistan finally reopened the routes after the U.S. apologized.

Also Tuesday, militants freed seven teachers who were kidnapped last week in the northwest Khyber tribal area while working on a polio vaccination campaign, said local government official Shabir Ahmed Khan. The teachers were released after tribal elders held discussions with the militants, Khan said.

Militants have killed more than a dozen polio workers and police protecting them over the last year in Pakistan, one of only three countries where the virus is still endemic. They claim the workers are spies and the vaccination is meant to make Muslim children sterile."

Syria’s government on Sunday mocked Mr. Obama’s decision, saying it was a sign of weakness. A state-run newspaper, Al Thawra, called it “the start of the historic American retreat,” and said Mr. Obama had hesitated because of a “sense of implicit defeat and the disappearance of his allies,” along with fears that an intervention could become “an open war.”

Syria’s deputy foreign minister, Faisal Mekdad, told reporters in Damascus that “it is clear there was a sense of hesitation and disappointment in what was said by President Barack Obama yesterday. And it is also clear there was a sense of confusion, as well.”

Many Syrian opposition leaders expressed disappointment about the move, and called on Congress to approve a military strike. The leaders said any intervention should be accompanied by more arms for the rebels."

USA TODAY

Vulnerable Democrats in red states may fear siding with Obama

Rand Paul%27s leadership of anti-war effort may make tight spot for Sen. Mitch McConnell

If military action becomes prolonged%2C any %27yes%27 vote is a liability

The debate over military intervention in Syria has exposed rifts in both political parties that could seep into campaigns in 2014 and beyond.

President Obama's request that Congress authorize strikes against Syria because of its use of chemical weapons has divided Democrats supporting the president from those who oppose the United States undertaking another Mideast military action. Republicans are split between those favoring an aggressive response to the Bashar Assad regime and the bloody civil war and libertarian-leaning conservatives who oppose an overseas intervention.

On Wednesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to approve authorization, over the ""no"" votes of two possible GOP 2016 presidential candidates, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. Both the full Senate and House are likely to vote on the resolutions next week.

Whatever the outcome of the vote, Syria could be an issue in key Senate races next year, when Republicans hope to wrest six seats away from Democrats and take control of the chamber. ""If (a war in Syria) gets complicated, then it could become a problem for everybody,"" says Jennifer Duffy of the Cook Political Report.

Arkansas Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor, considered vulnerable by Republicans, could support a president unpopular in his state by voting for authorization — he has some cover because his opponent, GOP Rep. Tom Cotton, endorsed military action in a Washington Post op-ed Wednesday. One state over, Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., is considered a prime target for Republicans, and voting with Obama may be hazardous for her in a state that he lost badly in the 2012 presidential election.

In Kentucky, where Democrats would like to unseat Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader faces a Tea Party primary challenger who opposes military action. Neither Pryor nor McConnell have said how they would vote but have said they have questions about the president's plan.

McConnell may ultimately join with the rest of congressional leadership to support the authorization, but he must tread carefully because Paul — a hero of the Tea Party movement — is leading opposition from Republicans. ""He needs that symbolic link between them,"" said political scientist Steve Voss of the University of Kentucky. ""It's likely he just doesn't want to undermine his junior colleague's position by being too public in his support for the president. If he's going to break with an ally like that, he needs to make it clear he's done so carefully and thoughtfully.""

Democratic candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes hasn't said how she might vote on Syria, but there is less pressure on her, Voss says. Democrats want to beat McConnell ""so badly,"" she will be given party support no matter what her position on Syria. In addition, Voss said, swing voters in Kentucky ""hate Obama, but they also tend to like a more muscular foreign policy. Siding with him on this one is not going to cost her a lot of political capital.""

On all sides, the longer the United States remains engaged in Syria, the bigger a political liability a ""yes"" vote would become — as did the 2002 Iraq vote.

""These kinds of votes on war and peace and casualties, the proof is in the pudding and we won't know the pudding for three months, six months or longer,"" said political columnist Stuart Rothenberg.

Some political observers see the divide on Syria in terms of Washington insiders favoring Obama's position vs. outsiders who do not. ""This is the establishment circling the wagons, but there are more outsiders at the table and grass roots … have an ability to express a louder voice than in 2008,'' says Matt Kibbe, president of FreedomWorks, a Tea Party-aligned group that does not take positions on foreign policy matters. Opinion surveys show Americans oppose military intervention in Syria, he points out.

""The verdict on this is already pretty clear from voters: They do not want to see another conflict,"" Kibbe says. ""Politically, the bottom line is, I think anybody that's up in 2014 ignores that at their peril.''

Democratic voters who oppose military action may be less likely to punish candidates who side with Obama. ""I'm not sure the anti-war movement at this point in time has what it takes to give many members heartache over this,"" says Jim Manley, former Senate aide and now Democratic political consultant.

But no politician can ignore the fact that a vote on military action can be a powerful weapon for an opponent. The obvious example: In 2008, presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton was forced to defend her Senate vote in favor of war with Iraq by her top rival Barack Obama, who was the anti-war candidate in the Democratic primary.

Now, Republican criticism of the Obama administration's previous handling of Syria is implicit criticism both of the former secretary of State and Vice President Biden, both potential contenders in 2016.

""Votes you take on issues related to war will stay with you forever,"" Manley said.

Even if voters are more worried about pocketbook issues next year than foreign affairs, ""these members are going to think that the vote that they're going to cast on this resolution could have staying power into the next election. And that's all that matters,"" Rothenberg says."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/02/16/congresswoman-roby-other-washington-republicans-press-obama-to-take-lead-to/,2013-02-16 00:00:00,[],Rep. Roby leads Republicans in asking Obama to take lead to avert drastic cuts,"Republicans on Saturday stepped up their call for President Obama to take the lead in negotiations to avert roughly $85 billion in automatic cuts to the military and other government spending next month by replacing the cuts with less drastic reductions.

Alabama Republican Rep. Martha Roby said the president is responsible for the cuts because his administration proposed the plan, known as sequester, during the 2011 debt-limit negotiations.

“In his State of the Union address, President Obama himself admitted that these cuts are a really bad idea,” Roby said Saturday in the weekly Republican address. “What the president failed to mention was sequester was his idea.”

Roby, chairwoman of a House Armed Services subcommittee, is among several Republican lawmakers, including Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn, who after Obama's speech Tuesday, is saying how the across-the-board cuts to the military would impact bases, including those in their home districts.

Roby said her district’s Fort Rucker, the Army’s primary flight-training base, would lose 500 students training to be combat aviators.

“The numbers are astounding,” said Roby, who voted against the August 2011 Budget Control Act. “This is just one set of cuts at one base.”

The consequences of the sequester agreement were intended to be so drastic that the parties were expected to reach a deal before the cuts started.

Roby is urging the president to consider two proposals by the Republican-controlled House that call for replacing sequester with more targeted cuts.

However, the March 1 deadline is fast approaching with no deal, as the president is playing golf in Florida during the long President’s Day weekend and Congress is on a nine-day break.

“Sequestration is going to take place,” Blackburn told CNBC on Wednesday.

Leaders of the Democrat-controlled Senate announced a plan Thursday to avoid the cuts. However, the plan, a mix of spending cuts and tax increases on the country’s highest earners, is not expected to pass. It further highlights the continuing debate on whether to solve the country’s fiscal problems with less spending or more taxes.

“I disagree with Republicans who think we should do that by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job training; Medicare and Social Security benefits,” Obama said Saturday during his weekly address. “That would force our senior citizens and working families to bear the burden of deficit reduction while the wealthiest are asked to do nothing more.”

Sequester would result in roughly $85 billion in cuts this year from the federal budget, with $46 billion from the Pentagon. No so-called ""safety-net"" programs would be cut. But the economy could lose an estimate 750,000 jobs as a result of sequester, which cuts $1.2 trillion in spending over the next decade.

“President Obama and Senate Democrats see sequester as another opportunity to push through another tax hike,” Roby said. “The ink has barely dried on the tax hikes the president pushed through in January.”"

“I think this is all a work in progress,” the diplomat, Glyn T. Davies, said at a briefing for reporters in Beijing. “The Chinese have said to us that they will faithfully implement U.N. Security Council sanctions and are doing so. And, as I’ve said before, we take them at their word.""

Mr. Davies arrived in Beijing on Wednesday morning after holding talks with South Korean officials in Seoul. He will depart for Tokyo on Thursday for the final leg of his visit to the region.

His trip to China appeared to be part of an effort by the United States to work closely with Beijing to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula after North Korea’s third nuclear test in February."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

A total of 295,822 tests have been conducted, including 1,339 on Sunday. UNB residence elevator eyed as possible source Public Health is investigating whether an elevator could be the source of transmission in the University of New Brunswick's Fredericton campus residence COVID-19 outbreak that still stands at 12 positive cases, as of Monday. Last week, Public Health and UNB looked into the ventilation system at Magee House and determined ""the risk is minimal,"" said Department of Health spokesperson Bruce Macfarlane. ""Public Health officials are now focusing their efforts to determine surface contacts within the elevator as the potential source of transmission,"" he said in an email. UNB's Magee House residence has about 180 adults and children living in the 101 apartment-style units, according to resident Martin Kutnowski.(Ed Hunter/CBC) According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, COVID-19 spreads from an infected person to others through respiratory droplets and aerosols (smaller droplets) created when an infected person talks, sings, shouts, coughs or sneezes. COVID-19 can also spread by touching something that has the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes with unwashed hands, the agency's website states. The outbreak at Magee House involves the variant first reported in India, which has two mutations that make it ""more concerning than all the others,"" Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Jennifer Russell has said. It is ""very, very, very aggressive in terms of being contagious and causing more severe symptoms."" Magee House is a seven-storey apartment-style residence designed for mature students, some of whom have families. The residents remain in isolation as Public Health deals with the outbreak. Paul Mazerolle, president and vice-chancellor of the University of New Brunswick, says isolation needs to happen at Magee House to prevent the spread of COVID-19.(Ed Hunter/CBC) Meanwhile, the UNB campus reopened Monday, as did the adjacent St Thomas University campus and nearby New Brunswick Community College campus, more than a week after they moved to essential services only in response to the outbreak. Faculty, staff and students can now go on campus as long as they follow relevant operational guidelines. ""COVID is difficult,"" said Paul Mazerolle, president of the University of New Brunswick. ""The uncertainty creates concern and we're not through this."" Monday marks day nine of the Magee House lockdown, and a third round of mass testing was scheduled for residents and staff on Sunday. As of Monday afternoon, Public Health was still awaiting the results. Alex Hill-Stosky, who lives with his family in Magee House, said many people in the building are either anxious or angry because of the lockdown. ""A lot of people feel we are test subjects rather than people,"" said the engineering student. Residents of Magee House at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton are in quarantine after at least 12 people tested positive for COVID-19. (Maria Jose Burgos/CBC) Mazerolle said he understands people are concerned and worried about their personal freedoms, but it's important to limit the spread of the virus. ""To minimize the potential spread, unfortunately people's movements need to be restricted for a limited period of time. … If we didn't restrict movement, we could be in a much worse situation."" Students have also expressed concerns over the residence's ventilation system. Mazerolle said the ventilation system has been checked twice and deemed safe by engineers with Public Health and the Department of Environment. ""From what I've been told by the experts, there's no evidence to suggest that the ventilation system is putting people at risk for COVID-19. Mazerolle expects Magee House to reopen on Saturday. ""We're looking forward to this coming to an end,"" he said. Public Health said the isolation period for Magee House individuals who have tested negative throughout the process could end Saturday. Meanwhile, the isolation for residents and staff of UNB's Elizabeth Parr-Johnston residence could be lifted as early as Wednesday, depending on the results of retests taking place Monday, said Public Health. So far, all test results have been negative. George Street Middle School reopens George Street Middle School in Fredericton reopened Monday, six days after students, staff and their families were urged by Public Health to self-isolate last week following a confirmed case of COVID-19. In a letter to parents on Sunday, Public Health said students and staff can return to school, and their families can return to work, with the exception of those who have been told by Public Health to self-isolate for 14 days. New Brunswick Public Health confirmed a case of COVID-19 at George Street Middle School in Fredericton last week.(Elizabeth Fraser/CBC) ""Custodial services have been through the school disinfecting high touch areas,"" said Dr. Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health. ""Everyone who has not been identified as a close contact should feel confident to return to normal activities."" The George Street and UNB cases are linked, Public Health said earlier. Voting in self-isolation Elections New Brunswick is encouraging people who are under COVID-19 isolation and haven't voted in the May 10 municipal election yet but wish to do so to contact their local returning office to find out what options are available. With election day less than a week away, the options available are starting to decrease, said Kim Poffenroth, municipal election officer. Municipal election officer Kim Poffenroth asks everyone to be patient as election officials, who are all temporary workers hired for just a few days of work, do their best to deliver these elections during the 'unusual and challenging circumstances of this pandemic.'(Screenshot/ParlVu) ""Our municipal returning officers will gladly work with these individuals to determine the best way to arrange for them to vote, based on their current situation,"" she said in a statement. Options may include voting by mail, if time permits, curbside voting, and other forms of contactless voting. ""We will do our utmost to make sure every New Brunswicker is provided with the opportunity to vote, while at the same time respecting public health rules and protecting the thousands of people working for us during these elections,"" Poffenroth said.

Barack and Michelle Obama had a pint of Guinness when visiting Moneygall in the Republic of Ireland in 2011.

Eight of the world's most powerful leaders will meet next month in a Fermanagh hotel.

Away from prying eyes, the G8 will discuss the issues of the day.

But out of Cameron, Merkel, Putin, Obama, Hollande, Abe, Napolitano and Harper, it looks like Obama might be the most popular.

He's the only one invited to a pint and a GAA game, anyway.

Cavan man Dean Arrowsmith has invited the world leader to sample Gaelic football for himself.

Continue reading the main story “ Start Quote You may think this is a joke email...” End Quote Dean Arrowsmith Email to the White House

The Ulster quarter-final takes place on Sunday 16 June at the 18,000-seater Brewster Park in Enniskillen.

Perhaps a bit of Obama's 'Yes We Can' spirit will be all the Cavan players need to help them beat Fermanagh.

It was after Cavan's 1-15 to 1-11 win over Armagh at the weekend that Mr Arrowsmith wrote his email to the White House.

""If you have time in your hectic schedule,"" it reads, ""I would like to invite you to attend the game with myself and a few friends, I will even pay in to the game for you (it's only €15), and let you experience the national game of our country for the first time.""

The 24-year-old, who used to promote Dundalk FC in the Airtricity League, told Obama he would ""buy you a pint of Guinness and discuss the trials and tribulations of what occurred on the field.""

Cavan forward Martin Dunne was named man of the match at the weekend's game against Armagh.

He said: ""I know you probably won't want to offend your native Offaly folk but we will also give you a Cavan jersey as a memento for the occasion.""

On Obama's 2011 visit to Ireland, he had a pint of stout in his ancestral home town of Moneygall, Co. Offaly, where his great-great-great-grandfather once lived.

The pint was ""delicious"", the president said.

There has been no response from the White House just yet.

But Mr Arrowsmith says that if he knew his way around county stereotypes, he would hotfoot it to Brewster Park.

""Cavan people are known for being a little bit tight"", he said. ""So if a Cavan man offers to buy you a pint and a ticket, you take him up on it.""

His email to the White House finished with: ""You may think this is a joke email, but I assure you, we would love for you to come cheer on the Boys in Blue with us.""

President Obama is not due to get to the UK until the day after the big game.

But there are still three weeks left until the G8 - still time for Cavan to win a new, high-profile fan, Mr Arrowsmith hopes."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

The two unions represent a total of 20,000 employees in the Department of Homeland Security who would play a central role in carrying out the ambitious legislation, either by reviewing applications from millions of immigrants who could gain new legal status through the bill or by expelling illegal immigrants who did not qualify.

A letter to Congress that excoriates the Senate proposal, and that the immigration officers’ union signed for the first time, reveals simmering unrest among Homeland Security employees, who have been asked to carry out broad and fast-paced immigration policy shifts by the Obama administration. Deportation agents have been instructed to focus heavily on removing serious criminal offenders, while immigration officers have been urged to accelerate their decisions on granting legal papers and reprieves from deportation.

The criticism of the bill from inside the system gives new political fuel to its most staunch opponents — among them Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama — when they had been battling on the defensive."

(Jose Cendon/Bloomberg)

Colombia continues to upgrade its air capabilities. In 2013, the air force upgraded its fleet of Israeli-made Kfir fighter jets, fitting them with Israeli-made Griffin laser-guided bombs. It has also fitted smart bombs onto some of its Super Tucanos.

Having decimated the top FARC leadership and many of the front commanders, the military, with continued help from the CIA and other intelligence agencies, appears to be working its way through the mid-level ranks, including mobile company commanders, the most battle-hardened and experienced remaining cadre. One-third of them have been killed or captured, according to Colombian officials.

The Santos administration has also targeted the financial and weapons networks supporting the FARC. Some critics think the government has been too focused on killing leaders and not enough on using the army and police to occupy and control rebel territory.

Killing an individual has never been a measure of success in war, say counterinsurgency experts. It’s the chaos and dysfunction that killing the leadership causes to the organization that matters. The air operations against the FARC leadership “has turned the organization upside down,” said a senior Pentagon official who has studied the classified U.S. history of Colombia’s war.

Some have fled to Venezuela. One member of the secretariat hides out intermittently in Ecuador, according to senior Colombia officials, breaking the important psychological bond with ground troops and handicapping recruitment.

For fear of being located and targeted, units no longer sleep in the same place two days in a row, so camps must be sparser. “They know the government has so much information on them now, and real-time intelligence,” said German Espejo, security and defense counselor at the Colombian Embassy. Worried about spies in their midst, executions are common.

The FARC still mounts attacks — a car bombing of a rural police station Dec. 7 killed six police officers and two civilians — but it no longer travels in large groups, and it limits most units to less than 20. No longer able to mount large-scale assaults, the group has reverted to hit-and-run tactics using snipers and explosives.

The weariness of 50 years of transient jungle life has taken its toll on the FARC negotiating team, too. Those who have lived in exile seem more willing to continue the fight than those who have been doing the fighting, said Colombian officials. The negotiations, Santos said in the interview, are the result of the successful military campaign, “the cherry on the cake.”

On Dec. 15, the FARC said it would begin a 30-day unilateral cease-fire as a sign of good will during the holiday season. The Santos administration rebuffed the gesture and vowed to continue its military campaign. Later that day, security forces killed a FARC guerrilla implicated in a bomb attack on a former minister. Three days later, the army killed another five.

(CNN) —

A mission to evacuate Americans from South Sudan was aborted Saturday when an aircraft carrying U.S. military members was fired upon as it prepared to land in Bor, wounding four of them, the Pentagon said.

The most severely damaged aircraft was thought to have been hit in the fuel line, a military official speaking on condition of anonymity said.

All three aircraft – CV-22 Ospreys – were diverted to Entebbe, Uganda, which is not where their flights originated, the official said. Another aircraft then flew the wounded to Nairobi, Kenya, U.S. Africa Command said in a statement.

The four service members were in stable condition after treatment, the statement said.

Pentagon officials were trying to determine how to mount another effort to evacuate the roughly three dozen Americans in South Sudan, where they have been working for the United Nations, a senior U.S. official said on condition of anonymity.

Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel was “reviewing options,” Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said. “Whatever we do it will be in coordination with the State Department,” he added.

The White House said U.S. President Barack Obama was briefed before dawn Saturday while aboard Air Force One after landing in Hawaii, then met with his national security team on the matter.

The fighting has displaced as many as 100,000 people, many of whom have crossed the Nile River, he said, adding that he feared a humanitarian disaster was unfolding.

South Sudanese President Salva Kiir blamed soldiers loyal to his former vice president, Riek Machar, for starting this month’s violence.

Tensions have been high in South Sudan since July, when Kiir dismissed Machar and the rest of the Cabinet. The move inflamed tensions between Kiir’s Dinka community and Machar’s Nuer community.

Casualties include soldiers and number in the hundreds, the government said.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Kiir on Saturday and discussed ways to halt the violence. It was Kerry’s second call to Kiir since Thursday night.

“Secretary Kerry emphasized that only through leadership and political dialogue will the challenges facing South Sudan be resolved,” State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement.

The two men “discussed the need to prevent ethnic violence, their concern for the welfare of thousands of internally displaced persons fleeing the conflict, as well as for the safety of U.S. citizens in South Sudan, and they agreed to speak again soon,” she said.

Meanwhile, the State Department issued an emergency message for U.S. citizens, calling on them to avoid the area around the airport in Bor. Limited flights were continuing from Juba International Airport.

On Friday, Kerry said he was sending a special envoy – Ambassador Donald Booth – to the country.

“Now is the time for South Sudan’s leaders to rein in armed groups under their control, immediately cease attacks on civilians, and end the chain of retributive violence between different ethnic and political groups,” Kerry said in a statement.

Saturday’s violence wasn’t the first this week to harm foreign troops in South Sudan. On Thursday, attackers killed two Indian army peacekeepers, wounded a third, and killed 20 of 30 civilians who were seeking refuge at the United Nations’ Akobo base, the U.N. said.

In a news release, the African Union called for an immediate truce.

It said that the chairwoman of the AU Commission, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, was “profoundly dismayed at the recent turn of events” and condemned the killing of innocent civilians and U.N. peacekeepers in Bor as a war crime.

South Sudan became the world’s newest country when it split from Sudan in July 2011. The split happened after a 2005 peace agreement ended years of civil war between the largely Animist and Christian south and the Muslim-dominated north.

The deal led to a January 2011 referendum in which people of the south voted to secede from Sudan.

Yoho: Obama's Credibility, Not America's, at Risk in Syria","Rep. Ted Yoho (R-FL), a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview on Wednesday morning that it is President Barack Obama’s credibility that is at risk with regard the situation in Syria, not the credibility of America.

Yoho said America’s credibility does not lie solely with the president’s statements and actions. “You have the military’s credibility, and then you have the U.S. government’s credibility,” Yoho said. “I don’t think anybody in the world disputes our credibility of our military. When you go back to the Persian Gulf War, where for CNN it was the first time they broadcasted a war live, and Bernard Shaw was giving you play-by-play bombing descriptions and then you had the Iraq war, the shock and awe that we watched on TV. We hunted down Saddam Hussein, and then we hunted down Osama bin Laden. So I don’t think our credibility of our military is in question at all.”

Really, Yoho said, it is the credibility of the president that is in question. “It’s going back to the red line,” he said. “Not saying, first off, what was said shouldn’t have been said. You don’t make veiled threats, I’ve learned in life. I don’t make threats, I make promises. And you stand by your promises. Your word is your bond. Unfortunately, I think the president spoke out of turn here. Again, I think there’s a better [way] to handle this and it should be through diplomacy. I would wait until the U.N. report came out to verify 100 percent that it was Sarin gas because there is still controversy over that and there is still controversy over who launched it.”

Yoho points to the president’s comments on the world stage on Wednesday in Sweden where he says he did not draw a “red line” in Syria. “First of all, I didn’t set a red line,” Obama said on Wednesday. “The world set a red line. The world set a red line when governments representing 98 percent of the world’s population said the use of chemical weapons are [inaudble] and passed a treaty forbidding their use, even when countries are engaged in war. Congress set a red line when it ratified that treaty. Congress set a red line when it indicated that in a piece of legislation entitled the Syria Accountability Act that some of the horrendous things happening on the ground there need to be answered for. So, when I said in a press conference that my calculus about what’s happening in Syria would be altered by the use of chemical weapons, which the overwhelming consensus of humanity says is wrong, that wasn’t something I just kind of made up. I didn’t pluck it out of thin air. There’s a reason for it.”

That is a direct contradiction to what Obama said back over a year ago, in which he refers to a “red line” he was drawing in Syria. A backgrounder on the White House website includes several references to how President Obama did indeed “set a red line.”

Yoho said that President Obama’s foreign policies are in jeopardy because of his credibility issues on the world stage. “I think the lack of credibility you’re seeing in the U.S. foreign policy reflects right back to the unsuredness of the president’s word and the message coming out of our administration,” Yoho said. “He drew a red line. We all know he drew a red line. And now he’s saying he didn’t draw a red line.”

Yoho points to Egypt and to Benghazi as examples of where Obama’s foreign policy credibility is lacking.

“The military coup in Egypt, which I firmly believe it is–if you look at the definition of a coup, it’s relinquishing of your power without your approval by a military and then to be put under house arrest–and yet our president doesn’t call it a coup because of the ramifications of having cut off military aid?” Yoho said. “His message has been inconsistent. It usually comes out after the fact, what he meant to say. This hurts our credibility. This even goes back to Benghazi. When Ms. Clinton said what difference does it make, the difference is this: If we lie to the American people, about the cause of a terrorist act saying it was a video, when we know the facts and I think you’ll see in our hearings, how can you expect another country or ally to take you at your word?”

When asked if the only people in the country who really want to go to war with Syria are those in the political class in Washington, D.C., Yoho said “I think you’re probably about 100 percent right on that.”

“If we look at the phone calls and the letters we get and the personal contact, I’m going to say 90 to 95 percent are saying ‘stay out of Syria,'” he said. “I represent my constituents in North Central Florida, and I’m not going to support this.”

While he thinks that the Obama administration has taken its foreign policy too far into the realm of failure, Yoho thinks the problem has its roots in Washington as far back as a few decades ago. That said, though, Yoho thinks this is an opportunity for America to lead again.

“Our foreign policy has really been lost in this administration, but I’ll say this: our foreign policy in the Middle East over the last 30 to 35 years has really been off track,” Yoho said. “This is a perfect opportunity for us to lead and get people to the negotiation table. Of all the countries that signed the CWC [Chemical Weapons Convention] accord, there’s 189 of us, we need to have 189 at the table including all the Arab League countries and the U.N. on one side of the table, and Mr. Assad on the other side and we need to have a diplomatic solution to this. The thing I was encouraged with today was Russia’s president [Vladimir] Putin said that he would look at the evidence and if it was conclusive he would stand with us. I think that’s monumental because if he can do that, China can do it. And Iran also signed the CWC. With China and Russia putting pressure on them, it is possible that they could come to the table and tell Mr. Assad to stop. That would be diplomacy at its finest and I think it would reset our foreign policy and our way to handle it.”

Yoho said this situation reminds him somewhat of Iraq, where Colin Powell had sold everyone on how Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD’s) were definitely there. “We don’t want to make that mistake again,” he said. “If you go back to the CWC accords, it says any country that produces, stockpiles, transfers or sells or uses chemical weapons are in violation of that treaty. So does that mean now that if we know North Korea has it, we go in there? Or what about Iran that is supposedly developing a nuclear weapon? Where do you draw the line? Do you act in totality? Or do you just say we’re just going to go after Syria? I think it’s a very dangerous precedent to start because this could be a prelude to start saying ‘Well, North Korea has this and Iran has this, so we should attack them too.’ I know the American people won’t stand for that and I won’t stand for it and I think there’s a better way we can do this.”

Congress could step up and lead America out of this situation, Yoho added, but currently congressional leadership of both parties are jumping in to help the president. House Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor, as well Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, have all thrown their weight behind Obama. “Our country is starved for leadership and selling what’s best for America,” Yoho said. “If things are best for America, I think the world benefits from that. There’s no doubt in my mind. I know Americans will grow a stronger and bigger America. We’ll be more competitive. The middle class will grow. That’s the stuff we need to focus on, not focusing on another war. That is just absolutely crazy. Keep in mind, we’re broke. We don’t have the money to do this. If China gets involved because they said they don’t want us involved, and we’re running out of money, well, who are we going to borrow money from? China? I mean, we need to stay home and take care of our own. Let’s work through this diplomatically, which I don’t feel like we’ve done a strong enough job in that yet.”

Instead of getting involved in another country’s civil war where there has been no clear and present threat to America’s national security or the security of America’s allies presented thus far, Yoho thinks the U.S. government should focus more on solving domestic problems and taking care of Americans first. “I’ve only been here a little over seven or eight months,” he said. “What I saw was a broken system. I saw crisis management. They go from one frying pan into the next, instead of long-term planning. We’ve now taken the focus off immigration, we’ve taken the focus off our debt ceiling, we’ve taken the focus off Social Security and Medicare, and we have the Obama healthcare bill coming out that needs to be repealed 100 percent. That’s going to be a disaster. We’re at $17 trillion in debt and that bill will increase our spending $2 trillion to start with and that’s just the beginning. Social Security is going broke and Medicare is going broke and we’re talking about going to another war? I mean this is ludicrous.”"

Berlusconi also defended Mussolini for allying himself with Hitler, saying he likely reasoned that it would be better to be on the winning side.

The media mogul, whose conservative forces are polling second in voter surveys ahead of next month's election, spoke to reporters on the sidelines of a ceremony in Milan to commemorate the Holocaust.

In 1938, before the outbreak of World War II, Mussolini's regime passed the so-called ""racial laws,"" barring Jews from Italy's universities and many professions, among other bans. When Germany's Nazi regime occupied Italy during the war, thousands from the tiny Italian Jewish community were deported to death camps.

""It is difficult now to put oneself in the shoes of who was making decisions back then,"" Berlusconi said of Mussolini's support for Hitler. ""Certainly the (Italian) government then, fearing that German power would turn into a general victory, preferred to be allied with Hitler's Germany rather that oppose it.""

Berlusconi added that ""within this alliance came the imposition of the fight against, and extermination of, the Jews. Thus, the racial laws are the worst fault of Mussolini, who, in so many other aspects, did good.""

More than 7,000 Jews were deported under Mussolini's regime, and nearly 6,000 of them were killed.

Reactions of outrage, along with a demand that Berlusconi be prosecuted for promoting Fascism, quickly followed his words.

Berlusconi's praise of Mussolini constitutes ""an insult to the democratic conscience of Italy,"" said Rosy Bindi, a center-left leader. ""Only Berlusconi's political cynicism, combined with the worst historic revisionism, could separate the shame of the racist laws from the Fascist dictatorship.""

Italian laws enacted following the country's disastrous experience in the war forbid the encouragement of Fascism. A candidate for local elections, Gianfranco Mascia, pledged that he and his supporters will present a formal complaint on Monday to Italian prosecutors, seeking to have Berlusconi prosecuted.

Advocating aggressive nationalism, Mussolini used brutish force and populist appeal evoking ancient Rome's glories to achieve and keep his dictatorial grip on power, starting in the early '20s and lasting well into World War II. His Fascist ""blackshirt"" loyalists cracked down on dissidents, through beatings and jailings.

He encouraged big families to propagate the Italian population, established a sprawling state economy and erected monumental buildings and statues to evoke ancient Rome. Mussolini sought to impose order on a generally individualistic-minded people, and Italians sometimes note trains ran on time during Fascism.

With dreams of an empire, he sent Italian troops on missions to attack or occupy foreign lands, including Ethiopia and Albania. Eventually, Italian military failures in Africa and in Greece fostered rebellion among Fascist officials, and in 1943 he was placed under arrest by orders of the Italian king. His end came at the vengeful hands of partisan fighters, who shot him and his mistress, and left their bodies to hang in a Milan square in April 1945.

Berlusconi's former government allies have included political heirs to neo-fascist movements admiring Mussolini.

In 2010, he told world leaders at a Paris conference that he had been reading Mussolini's journals, and years earlier Berlusconi had claimed that Mussolini ""never killed anyone.""

Berlusconi is running in Feb. 24-25 Parliamentary elections and has repeatedly changed his mind on whether he is seeking a fourth term as premier. Monti is also running, but polls put him far behind front-runner Pier Luigi Bersani, a center-left leader who supported Monti's austerity measures to save Italy from the Eurozone debt crisis.

Polls show about one-third of eligible voters are undecided."

Gregory N. Hicks, the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Libya at the time of the Benghazi terrorist attacks; Mark I. Thompson, a former Marine and now the deputy coordinator for Operations in the agency’s Counterterrorism Bureau; and Eric Nordstrom, a diplomatic security officer who was the regional security officer in Libya, the top security officer in the country in the months leading up to the attacks.

During the months of December and January, Breitbart News specifically asked the State Department switchboard for Benghazi witness Hicks’ contact information; the State Department claimed his location was unknown and they therefore ccould not provide information as to Hicks’ whereabouts.

Meanwhile, another individual Breitbart News asked the State Department switch board about, who is not on the current witness list but may have had information about the deadly Benghazi attacks, was still correctly listed in with the State Department switchboard. Hicks is a veteran Foreign Service officer whose previous postings included Afghanistan, Syria, and Yemen.

Rep. Jason Chafetz (R-UT) told Fox News in November that Ambassador Christopher Stevens, one of the four Americans ultimately killed in the Benghazi attack, called Hicks for help during the embassy attack.

“He said shortly after 9:40 PM what happened is his phone rang and he didn’t recognize the number so he didn’t answer it. And then it rang again and again he didn’t answer it because he didn’t recognize the number,” Rep. Chaffetz said. “But then given the persistence he did answer it. It was Ambassador Stevens and Ambassador Stevens was saying ‘we’re under attack,'” he added."

He Has Previously Covered Sports', 'Education', 'City Government', 'Reported Afghanistan', 'Pakistan']",Immigration proposal could be delayed,"A bipartisan Senate group on immigration legislation is attempting to craft an agreement so secure that the eight members will oppose amendments to its core provisions, an arrangement that could delay the introduction of a bill, people familiar with the negotiations said.

The senators had said they hoped to present their proposals this week, but Republican members expressed skepticism about that timetable Sunday. The group continues to negotiate issues related to new visa programs for agricultural and high-tech workers and has not reached agreement on a guest-worker program for low-skilled foreign laborers, said the individuals, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.

Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that he hopes a deal can be reached “in the next couple of weeks.” A GOP Senate aide involved in the negotiations said a deal is unlikely this week because writing the bill, which is expected to be up to 1,500 pages, is going slowly.

The timetable is important because President Obama has called for a comprehensive immigration reform measure that could be approved by the Senate and House in time for him to sign it into law by the end of the year. Under the timetable eyed by the Senate group, whose proposal is expected to be the template for a potential deal, the legislation would be introduced in the Judiciary Committee this month for the amendment process.

The goal is to get the measure to the Senate floor after Memorial Day. Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), the lead Democrat in the bipartisan working group, remained optimistic about the time frame.

“Thus far, we are on track,” he said Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “All of us have said that there will be no agreement until the eight of us agree to a big, specific bill. But hopefully we can get that done by the end of the week.”

Obama has supported the Senate group’s effort, but the president has vowed to step forward with his own legislative proposal if the senators are unable to deliver a plan in the spring.

The senators are mindful of the pitfalls of previous immigration reform efforts, when amendments by supporters and opponents in 2007 helped doom a bill in the Senate. In an attempt to head off such threats, the Senate group is trying to strike a deal in which all the members agree to oppose any amendments to the core provisions.even if they might agree with the amendments, people familiar with the talks said.

The group is concerned that if one provision is amended, the entire bill will fall apart because the deal is predicated on a comprehensive plan composed of carefully negotiated pieces.

The core provisions are likely to include a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, new visa programs for low- and high-skilled workers and for agricultural workers, a reduction in some family visa categories, and increased border control and workplace security.

But ironing out the specific language at a time that the senators are still negotiating portions of it has made the drafting process laborious, said one member of the business community who has talked with the senators.

“My sense is this week is pretty unlikely,” this person said. “Just the mere writing is enough to delay past this week, but that’s not the problem. There are still substantial disagreements on almost all the major parts.”

Another labor community individual was more optimistic about the progress, but agreed that the bill would probably not be ready this week. This individual said that the senators are trying to determine which areas of the bill would be considered “core provisions” on which they will agree not to support amendments.

“No one wants there to be errors,” the individual said. “It’s a contentious process.”

Immigration advocates have begun to grow impatient, and thousands are expected to attend a rally Wednesday at the Capitol. Republicans, however, have cautioned against excessive haste.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a member of the group who has emphasized that a deal has not been reached, received permission from the group to brief the GOP Senate caucus on the progress of the negotiations, something he probably will do Tuesday, aides said.

“He’s talking to a lot of people,” the business community individual said. “Partially, it’s over how to resolve some of these issues, but it’s also to find out how toxic this thing could be.”

Nearly two years after the U.S. troop withdrawal, Iraq is in the midst of a deepening security crisis as an al-Qaeda affiliate wages a relentless campaign of attacks, sending the death toll soaring to its highest level since 2008.

In the latest violence, nine car bombs tore through markets and police checkpoints in Baghdad on Sunday, killing dozens of people.

The bloody campaign has virtually erased the security gains made in the past five years. More than 5,300 Iraqis have been killed this year.

Sunday’s attacks occurred just three days before Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki is scheduled to arrive in Washington, where he will take part in meetings at the White House and on Capitol Hill. At the top of his agenda is a request for more U.S. help in the fight against the al-Qaeda affiliate, whose scope has grown to encompass neighboring Syria as well.

“We need to increase the depth and width of our cooperation, to be more agile and reflect the seriousness of the situation in Iraq,” Iraq’s ambassador to Washington, Lukman Faily, said in a telephone interview. “In our discussions, we will highlight the urgent need for the approval and quick delivery of military sales.”

View Graphic A single month's death toll from violence in Iraq.

At least 40 people died Sunday in attacks on mostly Shiite neighborhoods in Baghdad, according to an Interior Ministry official, who was not authorized to be quoted by name. In addition, a suicide bomber plowed his car into a group of soldiers in the northern city of Mosul, killing 14, according to a local police official.

More than 600 people have been killed in Iraq this month, after extraordinary bloodshed left 880 dead in September.

The surge in violence is largely, though not exclusively, due to attacks by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, an outgrowth of al-Qaeda in Iraq. The group is trying to undermine the Iraqi state through a relentless campaign of car bombings, assaults on security forces and assassinations. ISIS has also carried out several jailbreaks, freeing militants whom American and Iraqi forces worked for years to capture.

Shattering of calm

Iraq once looked as though it could be stabilizing. After a horrific sectarian war engulfed the country in 2006 and 2007, the United States sent a surge of troops and began enlisting Sunni fighters to turn against al-Qaeda. When the U.S. military withdrew at the end of 2011, militant groups were on their heels and monthly civilian death tolls were in the dozens rather than the hundreds.

That period of relative safety lasted into 2012, but it began to unravel as Syria’s anti-government protest movement developed into a civil war fought along sectarian lines.

Many radical Sunni fighters in Iraq and Syria have now united under the banner of ISIS. The militants consider the two nations to be different fronts in a single war with an ambitious goal.

“They want a caliphate,” said Jessica Lewis, research director at the Institute for the Study of War, who has investigated the resurgence of al-Qaeda in Iraq. She was referring to the Islamic political system that ruled most Muslims after the death of the prophet Muhammad.

One of the group’s most important victories came in September 2012, when militants freed about 100 inmates from a prison in Tikrit. The infusion of manpower helped the organization intensify operations this past spring, Lewis said.

ISIS launched an even more devastating attack on the notorious Abu Ghraib prison on July 21, freeing more than 500 convicts who could bolster the group’s capabilities further in the coming months.

“My best estimate based on [the Tikrit] example is that we’re going to see another huge growth step in operational capability in the new year,” Lewis said.

Sectarian mistrust

The rise of ISIS has coincided with political dysfunction in Baghdad. During Iraq’s recent years of relative calm, Maliki has consolidated power in a way that has left many Sunnis feeling disenfranchised under the Shiite-­led government. Sunni leaders complain bitterly that he has used his control of Iraq’s security forces to sideline political opponents under the pretense of combating terrorism.

In the vast deserts of Anbar province in western Iraq, the government has deployed thousands of troops to patrol its nearly 400-mile-long boundary with Syria.

But the border has become largely theoretical, and militants have moved across it with ease. In the atmosphere of sectarian mistrust that pervades Iraq, the Shiite-­majority federal forces have not coordinated well with the province’s mainly Sunni tribes and local police, according to Anbar’s governor, Ahmed Khalaf al-Dulaimi.

Anbar has suffered at least seven major attacks in the past week, including assassinations of local political leaders, the siege of a government electricity office and assaults on checkpoints.

The largest operation was an Oct. 20 attempt to storm a police compound in the city of Fallujah that includes a prison. The assault by 25 men armed with guns and mortars was ultimately repulsed, according to a police official involved in the response, but the battle lasted five hours and left four police officers dead.

On the other side of the sectarian divide, Iraq’s various Shiite militias, some of which receive funding and strategic direction from Iran, appear to be stepping up operations. Public funerals throughout southern Iraq memorialize militia members who have died fighting for the regime in Syria, and there are growing signs that some militias are bringing the fight back to Iraq.

In the southern Shiite-

majority provinces of Basra and Dhi Qar, at least 12 members of the Sunni Sadoon tribe have been killed in recent weeks, according to a senior Basra police official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Dozens more members of the tribe in Dhi Qar have reported receiving death threats, and at least eight families have fled their homes, according to Haider Salman, a municipal council leader.

In Basra, the threats against Sunnis are so serious that Sheik Abdul Kareem al-Khazraji, who heads the government authority that administers Sunni religious sites, ordered mosques to close their doors because of the risk of attacks on large gatherings of worshipers.

“We are directing people to pray at home, to protect their lives,” Khazraji said.

To the north, militias have been active in Shiite-dominated pockets of Diyala province. Six Sunnis were killed in Muqdadiyah, according to a tribal leader in the area who identified himself as Sheik Abu Muhammad.

Such incidents are haunting for Iraqis who recall the violence of the last decade. The killing rose exponentially in 2006 when attacks on Shiite religious sites prompted militias to retaliate with campaigns of sectarian killing and intimidation.

The bloodshed this year has not reached those terrible peaks. But al-Qaeda’s leaders in Iraq again seem determined to use horrific violence to provoke retaliation by the government and Shiite militias. Sunday’s attacks targeted predominantly Shiite areas in Baghdad. In recent weeks, car bombs in Baghdad have targeted not only day laborers and markets, but also funerals and even a playground full of children.

As the death toll mounts, Iraq is approaching national elections in April. In past years, militants have typically stepped up attacks before elections in an attempt to intimidate voters and create an atmosphere of fear. The result has been beneficial for campaigns defined by sectarian and ethnic politics.

“Imagine Iraq as a ship in the middle of a storm,” Maliki said in a televised interview in early October, “and some of the cabin crew ask the captain to control the movement of the ship. How can he do this with all of the high waves?”"

Updated 12:38 p.m. ET, 12/15/2013

(CNN) - Sen. John McCain joined CNN's ""State of the Union"" from Kiev, Ukraine, on Sunday after the Arizona Republican addressed thousands of protesters who are angry over the Ukrainian government's decision to backpedal away from an agreement with the European Union.

McCain spoke about a range of issues happening around the globe, and suggested the Central Intelligence Agency was not truthful to Congress about former FBI agent Bob Levinson, who went missing in Iran seven years ago.

Here are five noteworthy points from the interview.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

1) McCain: More oversight needed of U.S. intelligence agencies

McCain said he was ""confident we are doing everything that we can"" to get former FBI agent Bob Levinson released from Iran, where he went missing seven years ago.

But the senator said he was disturbed at recent reports that Levinson was in fact working for the CIA in Iran, not conducting private business as officials have previously claimed.

""What disturbs me is apparently they did not tell the truth to the Congress. The CIA did not tell the truth to the American Congress about Mr. Levinson,"" he said. ""If that's true, then you put this on top of things that our intelligence committees didn't know about other activities, which have been revealed by (NSA leaker Edward) Snowden - maybe it means that we should be examining the oversight role of Congress over our different intelligence agencies.""

He added that any negotiations in Levinson's case should also include attempts to free other Americans who are believed to be in Iranian custody.

McCain also weighed in on the interim deal reached with international powers and Iran on the country's nuclear program. In exchange for easing of sanctions, Iran agreed to slow its nuclear development program as the world powers continue talks for another six months.

He said he thinks it's ""very likely"" the Senate will have a bill that restores some sanctions against Iran at the end of the six months if there's no result in further negotiations to dismantle Iran's program.

2) McCain says Putin is meddling

There's a political tug of war going on in the former Soviet republic of Ukraine, with the western part of the country at odds with the eastern part – which is more closely aligned with Russia - over a failed deal with the European Union.

Last month, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych did not sign a trade agreement with the European Union, choosing instead closer economic ties with Moscow. The move sparked mass protests, with thousands pouring into the capital city, furious over the government's sharp turnaround from previous efforts to better integrate with Europe.

McCain showed up this weekend, along with Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, to express support.

""This is a grass-roots revolution here,"" McCain told CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley. ""It's been peaceful, except for when the government tried to crack down on them, and the government hasn't done that since. But I am praising their ability and their desire to demonstrate peacefully for change that I think they deserve.""

Protesters say an EU agreement would open borders to trade and set the stage for modernization and inclusion. They accuse Yanukovych of preparing to take the country into a Moscow-led customs union.

Moscow has leverage that may have affected Yanukovych's decision last month to backpedal on the EU talks because Russia supplies Ukraine with natural gas.

McCain, a longtime critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said the recent pressure on Ukraine is one more example of Putin asserting his power in other countries.

there's no doubt that Ukraine is of vital importance to Vladimir Putin. One of - I think it was Kissinger, I'm not sure, said that Russian without Ukraine is an Eastern power; with Ukraine it's a Western power.

""This is the beginning of Russia. It was right here in Kiev,"" McCain said. ""So Putin views it as the most highly important, and he has put pressure on Ukrainians. The price of energy, different kinds of activities, and the word is very clear that he has made certain threats. Whether he would carry those through or not, I don't know.""

McCain also said Putin ""is now a player in the Middle East, which he has not been since 1973,"" adding Putin is ""realizing, thanks to our weakness, some of his ambitions.""

Given that the U.S. is trying to work on a deal with Russia to remove Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles, Crowley asked McCain whether it was a good time to be taking on Russia.

""I don't think that we would be taking on Russia,"" McCain replied. ""Look, these people (the protesters) love the United States of America, they love freedom, and I don't think you could view this as anything but our traditional support for people who want a free and democratic society.""

""We're not talking about military action,"" he continued. ""We're not talking about blockades. We're talking about the possibility of sanctions if they continue to brutally repress their people. That would require some action on our part, just because that's what the United States of America is all about.""

3) 'Plead guilty'

McCain admitted Sunday he exaggerated when he compared President Obama's handshake last week with Cuban President Raul Castro to a handshake between Neville Chamberlain and Adolf Hitler at the start of World War II.

""I'm sure it was an exaggeration, Candy,"" he said. ""If you want me to plead guilty here on CNN - guilty.""

Obama faced a wave of criticism following his warm, though brief, greeting with Castro at Nelson Mandela's memorial service in South Africa.

""I think it was gross exaggeration,"" McCain said of the comparison. ""But have no doubt that (the handshake) is of great propaganda value for the Cuban government, which is oppressive, repressive, continues to jail dissidents and continues to be one of the - probably easily the most repressive government in our hemisphere.""

""I don't think you should shake hands with someone who continues to violate his own country's human rights,"" he continued. ""It happened. But it is what it is. And I'm sure that Mr. Castro appreciated it.""

The White House said the handshake was not preplanned, and officials pointed to Obama's comments in his speech that urged freedom in dictatorial societies.

4) McCain will vote for the budget bill

McCain said Sunday he'll vote for a compromise budget bill that would prevent another government shutdown.

""I hope it will pass the Senate,"" he said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""We must not shut down the government again. We can't do that to the people of this country and my state.""

The House approved the measure last week, but many GOP senators, raising a variety of concerns, are expected to vote against the bill. Despite their opposition, a few Republicans, including McCain, may help push the bill through the Senate.

Senate expected to pass budget bill – narrowly

McCain said he has spoken with military leaders who approve the deal because it ""gives them relief from the harsh effects of sequestration.""

Crowley asked if McCain would vote for the budget package as long as it stays the same.

""Yes,"" McCain said.

Final congressional approval would mark a rare win for bipartisanship and a step up for a Congress infected with political dysfunction and held in low public esteem, with midterm elections less than a year off.

5) 'This must be a huge embarrassment for China'

The execution of Kim Jong Un's uncle shows that the young North Korea leader is ""dangerous,"" McCain said, noting the country's nuclear capabilities.

Because Jang Song Thaek, Kim's uncle by marriage, was believed to be a key figure in North Korea and a liaison between North Korea and China, McCain argued ""this must be a huge embarrassment for China.""

""It's very obvious this young man is capable of some very aberrational behavior, and given the toys that he has, I think it's very dangerous,"" McCain continued. ""And you would think that the Chinese would understand that as well. They've got to rein this young man in, and they can.""

Mandela%2C 94%2C has been hospitalized for three weeks with a recurring lung infection

Obama met with two of Mandela%27s children and eight grandchildren

As a senator%2C Obama met Mandela%2C a %22personal hero%22 of his

PRETORIA, South Africa – President Obama met privately Saturday with relatives of former South African president Nelson Mandela, the 94-year-old anti-apartheid icon who has been hospitalized more than three weeks with a lung infection.

In a statement released by the White House, Obama referred to Mandela as ""Madiba,"" which is Mandela's tribal name.

""I expressed my hope that Madiba draws peace and comfort from the time that he is spending with loved ones, and also expressed my heartfelt support for the entire family as they work through this difficult time,"" Obama said. ""I also reaffirmed the profound impact that his legacy has had in building a free South Africa, and in inspiring people around the world — including me.

Obama met with Mandela's daughters Makaziwe (Maki) Mandela and Zindzi Mandela Hlongwane and eight of his grandchildren at the Nelson Mandela Foundation in Johannesburg on Obama's first day in South Africa after arriving from Senegal.

Obama did not meet with Mandela, but told reporters on the flight to South Africa that he was grateful that he, his wife and daughters had a chance to meet Mandela previously, the Associated Press reported. Obama has a photo of the introduction he had to Mandela in 2005 in his office at the White House; it was their only meeting, when Obama was a senator. He calls Mandela a ""personal hero.""

""If and when he passes from this place, one thing I think we'll all know is that his legacy is one that will linger on throughout the ages,"" Obama said Thursday.

Some were disappointed Obama and Mandela wouldn't be meeting again.

""I think (Mandela) wants to see the black (American president),"" said Alac Mojela, 45, a chauffeur in Pretoria. ""Before he can leave this world, he must say something to Obama.""

Meanwhile, outside the hospital, South Africans held prayer vigils, left gifts and waited for news of Mandela condition, which his former wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela had showed ""great improvement"" compared with a few days ago.

Obama on Saturday called on the continent's leaders, including in neighboring Zimbabwe, to take stock of Mandela's willingness to step down after one term despite his immense popularity.

""We as leaders occupy these spaces temporarily and we don't get so deluded that we think the fate of our country doesn't depend on how long we stay in office,"" Obama said during a news conference.

South African President Jacob Zuma said Obama and Mandela ""both carry the dreams of millions of people in Africa and in the diaspora who were previously oppressed.""

Obama, Zuma and other dignitaries held a moment of silence for Mandela during a dinner Saturday night.

http://news.yahoo.com/kerry-says-us-releasing-millions-aid-egypt-161105370.html,,[],Kerry says US releasing millions in aid to Egypt,"CAIRO (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Sunday rewarded Egypt for President Mohammed Morsi's pledges of political and economic reforms by releasing $250 million in American aid to support the country's ""future as a democracy.""

Yet Kerry also served notice that the Obama administration will keep close watch on how Morsi, who came to power in June as Egypt's first freely elected president, honors his commitment and that additional U.S. assistance would depend on it.

""The path to that future has clearly been difficult and much work remains,"" Kerry said in a statement after wrapping up two days of meetings in Egypt, a deeply divided country in the wake of the revolution that ousted longtime President Hosni Mubarak.

Egypt is trying to meet conditions to close on a $4.8 billion loan package from the International Monetary Fund. An agreement would unlock more of the $1 billion in U.S. assistance promised by President Barack Obama last year and set to begin flowing with Kerry's announcement.

""The United States can and wants to do more,"" Kerry said. ""Reaching an agreement with the IMF will require further effort on the part of the Egyptian government and broad support for reform by all Egyptians. When Egypt takes the difficult steps to strengthen its economy and build political unity and justice, we will work with our Congress at home on additional support.""

Kerry cited Egypt's ""extreme needs"" and Morsi's ""assurances that he plans to complete the IMF process"" when he told the president that the U.S. would provide $190 million of a long-term $450 million pledge ""in a good-faith effort to spur reform and help the Egyptian people at this difficult time."" The release of the rest of the $450 million and the other $550 million tranche of the $1 billion that Obama announced will be tied to successful reforms, officials said.

Separately, the top U.S. diplomat announced $60 million for a new fund for ""direct support of key engines of democratic change,"" including Egypt's entrepreneurs and its young people. Kerry held out the prospect of U.S. assistance to this fund climbing to $300 million over time.

Story continues

Recapping his meetings with political figures, business leaders and representatives of outside groups, Kerry said he heard of their ""deep concern about the political course of their country, the need to strengthen human rights protections, justice and the rule of law, and their fundamental anxiety about the economic future of Egypt.""

Those issues came up in ""a very candid and constructive manner"" during Kerry's talks with Morsi.

""It is clear that more hard work and compromise will be required to restore unity, political stability and economic health to Egypt,"" Kerry said.

Syria and Iran were topics of discussion, according to officials.

With parliamentary elections in April approaching and liberal and secular opponents of Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood saying they will boycott, Kerry called the vote ""a particularly critical step"" in Egypt's democratic transition.

Violent clashes between protesters and security forces have created an environment of insecurity, complicating Egyptian efforts to secure vital international aid.

Officials in the Egyptian presidency said Kerry stressed the need for consensus with the opposition in order to restore confidence in Egypt that it can ride out the crisis. Morsi was reported to have expressed the importance of Egypt's relationship with United States, which is based on ""mutual respect,"" and focused on the importance of the democratic process in building a strong and stable nation.

Kerry made clear that in all his meetings, he conveyed the message that Egyptians who rose up and overthrew Mubarak ""did not risk their lives to see that opportunity for a brighter future squandered.""

On Saturday, he told the country's bickering politicians that they must overcome differences to get Egypt's faltering economy back on track and maintain its leadership role in the volatile Middle East.

The U.S. is deeply concerned that continued instability in Egypt will have broader consequences in a region already rocked by unrest.

U.S. officials said Kerry planned to stress the importance of upholding Egypt's peace agreement with Israel, cracking down on weapons smuggling to extremists in the Gaza Strip and policing the increasingly lawless Sinai Peninsula while continuing to play a positive role in Syria's civil war.

The impact of Kerry's message of unity to the opposition coalition seemingly was blunted when only six of the 11 guests invited by the U.S. Embassy turned up for a Saturday session with him and three of those six said they still intended to boycott the April parliamentary election, according to participants.

Kerry said that the U.S. would not pick sides in Egypt, and he appealed to all sides to come together around human rights, freedom and speech and religious tolerance.

In an apparent nod to the current stalemate in Washington over the U.S. federal budget, Kerry acknowledged after meeting Foreign Minister Kamel Amr that compromise is difficult yet imperative.

""I say with both humility and with a great deal of respect that getting there requires a genuine give-and-take among Egypt's political leaders and civil society groups just as we are continuing to struggle with that in our own country,"" he said. 'There must be a willingness on all sides to make meaningful compromises on the issues that matter most to all of the Egyptian people.""

The opposition accuses Morsi and the Brotherhood of following in the footsteps of Mubarak, failing to carry out reforms and trying to install a more religiously conservative system.

Morsi's administration and the Brotherhood say their foes, who have trailed significantly behind Islamists in all elections since the uprising against Mubarak, are running away from the challenge of the ballot box and are trying to overturn democratic gains.

After meeting Morsi and his defense and intelligence chiefs on Sunday, Kerry flew to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and planned later stops in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, where his focus is expected to be the crisis in Syria and Iran.

Kerry is set to return to Washington on Wednesday.

But unofficially, it is only too happy to dump on the United States.

After days of silence, state media have let loose with a barrage of criticism concerning Snowden’s allegations of a massive electronic surveillance program by the United States. The English-language China Daily ran a large cartoon of a shadowed Statue of Liberty, holding a tape recorder and microphone instead of a tablet and torch.

In an editorial dripping with indignation, the Communist Party-run Global Times demanded an explanation on behalf of the Chinese government.

“Before Snowden is silenced, Washington owes China an explanation of whether the U.S. as an Internet superpower abused its power over our vital interests,’’ Global Times opined.

In Hong Kong, the pro-Communist Party Takungpao newspaper added: “If the U.S. is the true defender of democracy, human rights and freedom like it always described itself ... President Obama should sincerely apologize to the people from other countries whose privacy was violated.’’

Of course, the criticism is irresistible, the opportunity too rich to pass up. For months now, the U.S. government has demanded that the Chinese government rein in an extensive military-sponsored hacking operation. During last weekend’s summit between Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping, cybersecurity was the main item on the U.S. agenda.

Snowden, the 29-year-old former U.S. government contractor who says he leaked National Security Agency secrets and is now in hiding in Hong Kong, alleged in an interview published early Thursday in the South China Morning Post that there had been more than 61,000 NSA hacking operations internationally, hundreds of them directed against China and Hong Kong.

“We hack network backbones -- like huge Internet routers, basically -- that give us access to the communications of hundreds of thousands of computers without having to hack every single one,” Snowden told the Hong Kong-based newspaper.

He said he wanted to demonstrate “the hypocrisy of the U.S. government when it claims that it does not target civilian infrastructure, unlike its adversaries.”

Snowden’s presence in Hong Kong presents the Chinese Communist Party with an opportunity and a headache. He entered Hong Kong on May 20 on a 90-day tourist visa and will need to be dealt with once the visa expires.

Although the former British colony is self-ruled, Beijing has the final say in matters of national security and foreign affairs. Hong Kong has an extradition treaty with the United States, but any decision on Snowden’s case must be approved by the Chinese central government.

For days now, the Chinese government has maintained a stony silence. The allegations of the U.S. surveillance program have been splashed across front pages around the world since last week, but only surfaced in the Chinese media Thursday, at the end of a three-day Chinese holiday.

“I have no information to offer,’’ a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, responded repeatedly with a thin-lipped smile in response to a barrage of questions by reporters at a briefing in Beijing on Thursday.

Advertisement

Pressed by reporters, she repeated what has been the stock phrase by the Chinese government for months now, saying that “China is one of the most affected victims of hacking and wishes to have an international dialogue on the subject based on maintaining peace, security, openness and cooperation.’’

Many foreign-policy commentators believe that Beijing will have a hard time exploiting the Snowden revelations to its own benefit, given its vulnerability to charges of human rights abuse and invasion of privacy.

“The fact cannot be changed that China is abusing the Internet to violate human rights and serve its one-party system,’’ editorialized another Hong Kong-based newspaper, Apple Daily.

Chinese dissidents say they fear that the scandal will weaken the United States’ ability to take the high ground in pushing for more freedoms from Beijing. They say the Chinese government is merely using the Snowden case to cover its own culpability in hacking, eavesdropping and electronic surveillance.

“It is unfair to compare what the U.S. does to China,’’ said Chen Ziming, a veteran of the 1989 pro-democracy movement centered around Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. “The U.S. program is trying to prevent certain terrorist activities, while China is listening in to monitor what dissidents are saying and writing. People get thrown into jail here just for an email.’’

However, one of China’s most prominent dissidents, artist Ai Weiwei, wrote of his disappointment in an editorial titled “The U.S. Is Behaving Like China.”

“This abuse of state power goes totally against my understanding of what it means to be a civilized society, and it will be shocking for me if American citizens allow this to continue,’’ he wrote in the Guardian earlier this week.

Thamsanqa Jantjie says he suffered schizophrenic episode

South Africa is investigating the allegations

Jantjie was paid %2485 to interpret at the ceremony

JOHANNESBURG — The South African sign language interpreter accused of using fake signs at Nelson Mandela's memorial service this week said he suffered a schizophrenic episode at the event, but another interpreter says it was not the first time Thamsanqa Jantjie has done bogus interpretations.

Jantjie, who has been called an imposter by sign experts, told Johannesburg's Star newspaper Thursday that he hallucinated and heard voices during the memorial service.

""There was nothing I could do. I was alone in a very dangerous situation,"" Jantjie said. ""I tried to control myself and not show the world what was going on. I am very sorry, it's the situation I found myself in.""

An interpreter with the Deaf Federation of South Africa says Mandela's service wasn't the first time Jantjie was criticized for his work interpreting at an event. Francois Deysel, a sign language interpreter with DFSA, said he watched a video of Jantjie signing at the 100th anniversary celebration of the African National Conference, South Africa's ruling party, in January 2012.

After watching the video, Deysel and his colleagues concluded, ""There was no sign language used. It was only slapping of hands and movement of arms.""

Deysel said the federation notified the ANC and recommended that Jantjie needed to get basic sign language training.

When Deysel saw that it was Jantjie interpreting at the Mandela memorial, ""my reaction was embarrassment for this country that we're going to go through by having this person on stage,"" he said.

The ANC says on its website that the government — not the ANC — hired Jantjie for the Mandela memorial. It said it ""had not been aware of any of (the) complaints regarding the quality of services, qualification or reported illnesses of Mr. Jantjie.""

In South Africa, sign language interpreters are not legally required to get certified, said Marion Boers, executive director of the South African Translators' Institute, the only organization in South Africa with a formal sign language certification program. In the entire country, only seven or eight interpreters are certified through SATI, and Jantjie is not one of them, Boers said.

The Mandela memorial incident prompted an apology Thursday by a South African Cabinet minister who said a mistake was made in hiring Jantjie. Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu apologized to South Africa's deaf community during a news conference but denied that the country felt embarrassed by the controversy.

""I don't think he was just picked up on the street. He went to a school for the deaf,"" she said.

In a separate interview with the Associated Press, Jantjie said that while he was on stage at the FNB Stadium he saw visions of angels. He told the AP he has been violent and was hospitalized in a mental health facility for more than a year.

Jantjie stood approximately 3 feet from President Obama and other world leaders during Tuesday's ceremony to honor Mandela, and the state of Jantjie's mental health that day will raise serious security questions for South African authorities.

Jantjie told the Star newspaper he was paid R850, or about $85, to interpret at the ceremony.

""Life is unfair. This illness is unfair. Anyone who doesn't understand this illness will think that I'm just making this up,"" he said.

He said that as a result of the episode, his ability to hear and interpret was impaired, but he felt that given the gravity of the occasion, he couldn't leave.

On the day of the memorial service, Jantjie was due to get a regular six-month mental health checkup to determine whether the medication he takes was working, whether it needed to be changed or whether he needed to be kept at a mental health facility for treatment, the AP reported.

Sign language experts claim that Jantjie's interpretations for numerous dignitaries, heads of state and even members of the extended Mandela family amounted to ""gibberish.""

""He wasn't even doing anything, There was not one sign there. Nothing. He was literally flapping his arms around,"" Cara Loening, director of Sign Language Education and Development in Cape Town, told the Agence France-Presse news service.

Asked if he was happy with his performance by radio station Talk Radio 702 on Thursday, Jantjie said, ""Absolutely! What I have been doing, I think I have been a champion of sign language. I have interpreted many big events. Not only the event that's in question now.""

He said these events included political news conferences and the funeral of Albertina Sisulu, the widow of anti-apartheid activist and Robben Islander Walter Sisulu.

He refused to explain details of his qualifications and referred such questions to the company that booked him for the event, a company he called SA Interpreters. Not a lot is known about that company.

AP journalists who visited the address that Jantjie provided for SA Interpreters found a different company there where managers said they knew nothing about the firm.

Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu said Thursday that government officials have tried to track down the company that contracted Jantjie for the memorial service but that the owners ""have vanished into thin air.""

Washington (CNN) – Washingtonians are paying close attention the quadrennial contest for a major job on the global stage.

But this time it's not the race for the White House - the nation's capital is in the early stages of an effort to host the 2024 Summer Olympics.



The non-profit group DC2024 launched a campaign Tuesday on behalf of the greater Washington-Baltimore area in an attempt to seek a bid for those games.

Asked about the potential concerns associated with holding an event of that magnitude, DC2024 organizer Bob Sweeney told CNN the capital city is in a strong position.

""In terms of security, Washington, D.C., has a huge asset in that we live in a very secure environment,"" Sweeney said, adding that DC is also a city that visitors and athletes will want to explore.

He says response to the initiative has been ""incredibly positive.""

An official bid would have to come from the United States Olympic Committee (USOC), which is currently in talks with about 10 American cities interested in hosting the games, including Washington.

The USOC would decide whether to submit a bid to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in partnership with a U.S. city. The latter organization would then make the final choice of host city in 2017, seven years before the games kick off.

The IOC is now in the final stages of the selection process for the 2020 Olympic Games, having narrowed down the candidates to Istanbul, Tokyo and Madrid. The USOC chose not to submit a bid for those games.

The last time the U.S. hosted the summer Olympics was in 1996 when the games were held in Atlanta. The U.S. also hosted the winter Games in Salt Lake City, Utah, in 2002.

A similar effort for Washington to host the 2012 summer games failed, but DC2024's organizers are optimistic.

Sweeney points out the city's landscape has undergone a significant change since the 2012 initiative, with the addition of a new convention center, a new professional baseball stadium, and plans to extend the city's Metrorail system out to Washington-Dulles International Airport.

Washington ""meets or exceeds every one of the technical requirements"" to host the games, Sweeney told CNN, and the area is already ""venue rich"" because of the large number of professional and college sports arenas in the area.

Pedro Ribeiro, a spokesman for Washington Mayor Vincent Gray, said Gray is ""a huge sports fan and a huge fan of the Olympics, and thinks this is an exciting idea and one worth exploring. His main priority would be to ensure that any such effort would be in the best interest of District residents and taxpayers."

USA TODAY

White House says it is %22a complex and difficult issue%22

Obama spokesman says the U.S. is not taking any sides in Egypt%27s dispute

U.S. law forbids aid to countries where an elected official is deposed by a military coup

WASHINGTON -- The White House is reviewing whether last week's removal of Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi constituted ""a coup"" -- a decision that will affect billions in U.S. aid to the embattled nation.

""This is a complex and difficult issue, with significant consequences,"" said White House spokesman Jay Carney on Monday.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and other lawmakers said what happened in Egypt last week was clearly a coup, as the military removed and detained a democratically elected Morsi, established an interim government and called for new elections.

They have called for suspension of aid, if only to pressure the Egyptian military to follow through on its promise to hold new elections as quickly as possible. ""If millions of Egyptians come to believe that democracy offers them no opportunity to advance their goals peacefully, it will only fuel violence and extremism,"" McCain said.

U.S. law forbids aid to countries where an elected official is deposed by a military coup. The United States supplies about $1.5 billion in annual aid to Egypt, much of it to the military.

Carney said that cutting off aid to Egypt right away wouldn't be in anybody's best interest. He also said the administration ""will review our obligations and requirements under the law, and we will consult with Congress"" as it reviews the incidents last week in Cairo.

The White House spokesman noted that many Egyptian citizens do not believe that the actions constituted a coup. Many protesters said they back the military and that it intervened against an increasingly authoritarian government.

The issue is ""highly charged for tens of millions of Egyptians who have differing views about what happened,"" Carney said, calling it ""an extremely polarized situation.""

Protesters in Egypt have also taken up the coup question. Said one sign: ""Dear Mr. Obama, Not A Coup But A Rise 4 Freedom."" Other signs have accused the administration of backing ""terrorists,"" in some cases an apparent reference to the military.

The U.S. decision on whether to declare a coup will be ""based on the time-line that is in the best interests of a democratic transition in Egypt, that is consistent with our legal requirements and our national security interest,"" Carney said.

Speaking just hours after more than 50 people reportedly died in clashes between the military and pro-Morsi demonstrators, Carney said ""we strongly condemn any violence, as well as any incitement to violence.""

As White House officials have done throughout the past week, Carney sought to walk a fine line between critics and supporters of Morsi and the military, saying the U.S. is not taking any sides in their dispute. He said decisions about the government in Egypt should be made by the Egyptians themselves.

The Egyptian military should exhibit ""maximum restraint responding to protesters,"" Carney said, but he also condemned ""the explicit calls to violence made by the Muslim Brotherhood.""

Said Carney: ""We call on all parties to exercise restraint.""

The United States' goal is to restore a democratically elected government, Carney said.

When asked if that specifically means the restoration of the Morsi government, he replied: ""We are calling for a return to democratic governance."""

The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

(CNN) —

The United States hasn’t abandoned Robert Levinson, the retired FBI agent described by his wife as the “longest-held American hostage,” Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday.

“There hasn’t been progress in the sense that we don’t have him back. But to suggest that we’ve abandoned him or anybody … is simply incorrect and not helpful,” Kerry told ABC’s “This Week.” “The fact is that I have personally raised the issue, not only at the highest level that I have been involved with, but also through other intermediaries.”

Levinson disappeared in Iran in March 2007 during a business trip, purportedly undertaken as a private investigator looking into cigarette smuggling. However, The Associated Press and the Washington Post reported Thursday that contrary to what the State Department and Levinson’s family have said for years, Levinson actually was working for the CIA in Iran. And a source involved in the matter told CNN there’s proof that Levinson worked for the CIA undercover, and under contract, while also working as a private investigator.

White House: Levinson not a government employee when he made Iran trip

That allegation doesn’t sit well with Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, who is on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

“What disturbs me is apparently they did not tell the truth to the Congress. The CIA did not tell the truth to the American Congress about Mr. Levinson,” McCain said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “If that’s true, then you put this on top of things that our intelligence committees didn’t know about other activities, which have been revealed by (NSA leaker Edward) Snowden – maybe it means that we should be examining the oversight role of Congress over our different intelligence agencies.”

Iran’s government repeatedly has said it is not holding Levinson and does not know his whereabouts. During a September interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was asked what he could tell Levinson’s family.

“We don’t know where he is, who he is,” Rouhani said. “He is an American who has disappeared. We have no news of him.”

McCain: CIA did not tell Congress the truth about Levinson

Kerry said the United States is still looking for proof that Levinson is alive. A “number of different channels” are “being worked aggressively,” he said.

Iran’s previous president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said he was willing to help find Levinson, and the family received what then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described in 2010 as “proof of life.”

In 2011, the State Department said new evidence suggested that Levinson, who has diabetes and high blood pressure, was alive and being held somewhere in southwest Asia.

This year, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN, “We have every reason to believe that he’s alive and that the Iranians control his fate.”

Asked whether he believes the Iranian government is responsible for Levinson’s disappearance, Kerry said he thinks the government “has the ability to help us here, and we hope they will.”

McCain said he was “confident we are doing everything that we can” to get Levinson released from Iran,

He added that any negotiations in Levinson’s case should also include attempts to free other Americans who are believed to be in Iranian custody.

Nasr'],Forcing Obama’s Hand in Syria - The New York Times,"For the past two years the Obama administration has resisted entanglement in Syria, but now this grisly civil war has become an unavoidable international problem and a defining moment for American foreign policy.

Having concluded “with high confidence” that the Syrian government carried out a deadly chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on Aug. 21, the Obama administration has no choice but to enforce the “red line” the president laid out a year ago. To maintain American credibility — and his own — President Obama has to do so quickly and decisively. He also has to explain to the American people and to the world what is at stake in Syria and how the United States will lead in ending this crisis.

Mr. Obama has understandably viewed any involvement in Syria as a slippery slope to an expensive war that Americans do not want and will not support. Even after President Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons, his administration has been slow to react, and after much back-and-forth it has decided to punish Mr. Assad — but only in a discrete operation that would not have a direct bearing on the outcome of the civil war, and only, as Mr. Obama suggested on Saturday, if Congress gives its blessing.

The world will not see this as prudence but rather as dithering — reinforcing the perception that the United States is hiding behind its economic woes and, hounded by the ghosts of Iraq, is no longer keen on leading the world. That will embolden America’s adversaries and deject its friends. America could soon find itself alone in standing up to Iran or North Korea, or in pushing back against China and Russia, which have used their veto power on the Security Council to block United Nations authorization for intervention in Syria."

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea on Thursday warned of an unspecified ""grave measure"" if North Korea rejects a call for talks on a jointly run factory park that has been closed for nearly a month.

In a televised briefing with reporters, Unification Ministry spokesman Kim Hyung-suk refused to describe what Seoul would do if Pyongyang doesn't respond by a deadline Friday to a demand for formal working-level talks on the industrial complex just over the heavily armed border in the North Korean town of Kaesong.

But Seoul may be signaling it will pull out its remaining workers from the factory across the border in Kaesong. That could lead to the end of a complex considered the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean cooperation.

As animosity rose between the Koreas early this month, North Korea barred South Koreans from crossing the border and entering the factory. It later suspended operations and withdrew the 53,000 North Korean workers who manned assembly lines there. Pyongyang hasn't forced South Koreans to leave and about 175 are still there.

The factory has operated with South Korean know-how and technology and cheap labor from North Korea since 2004. It is a hold-over from an era that saw the Koreas try to cooperate through various projects.

For several weeks, until recently, North Korea issued a steady stream of criticism and threats aimed at Seoul and Washington, expressing anger over ongoing U.S.-South Korean military drills that the North calls invasion preparations and U.N. sanctions over its February nuclear test. Pyongyang has recently eased its rhetoric, but tensions between the rivals are still high.

As Some South Korean businesses have been quietly mulling giving up on Kaesong altogether.

""Our people are suffering serious difficulties due to the shortage of food and medicines and our companies are suffering big damages and pains,"" Kim said.

To resolve deadlocked operations at Kaesong, Kim said North Korea should first allow some South Koreans to cross the border to hand over food and medicine to the remaining managers at Kaesong.

South Korea on Wednesday proposed talks between the head of a South Korean management office at Kaesong and the North's General Bureau for Central Guidance to the Development of the Special Zone, but the North rebuffed the offer, Kim said.

""It's very regrettable for North Korea to reject (taking) the minimum humanitarian measures for our workers at the Kaesong industrial complex,"" he said."

Really? An entire segment on a handshake? Good grief; pandering to an audience — Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) December 10, 2013

—

The irony of an MSNBC anchor accusing another network of pandering to their audience requires no explanation.

Todd joins CNN, Politico’s Dylan Byers, and a number of other elite members of the media in revealing his frustration over negative coverage of a historic handshake between a Cuban dictator and an American president. It should also be noted that until today, meetings of any kind between an American president and another world leader were considered legitimate news.

Because of this sudden change in policy, the pushback from the mainstream media on the handshake has been fierce. Few would question the media’s devotion to Obama and their support for his left-wing agenda. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the media fears the handshake will overshadow the positive coverage the media is already giving to Obama’s Memorial speech.

When challenged on this pandering charge, Todd responded that he does not pander to his audience:

@jpodhoretz I don’t pander to an audience. — Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) December 10, 2013

While Todd is certainly very good at his job and much more professional than his MSNBC colleagues, anyone who watched The Daily Rundown’s obsession over gun control in the wake of Sandy Hook or the show’s relentless tearing down of Mitt Romney over rape comments made by an Indiana Senate candidate, could argue that while better, Todd has been far from perfect in this regard.

But back to my question: When exactly did a historic handshake between an American president and a world leader stop being news? When did dissecting the handshake, eye contact, and body language of such a meeting stop being a media sport?

Apparently, the moment such a meeting might distract from giving Obama a positive news cycle.

Editor’s note: David Andrew Weinberg is a Senior Fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. The views expressed are the writer’s own.

Saudi Arabia and Qatar have been working overtime arming rebel groups in Syria. But events of the last month suggest these American allies have been throwing their lots in with radical, hardline Islamists.

Some observers are bullishly optimistic about the foreign policies of America’s Gulf allies, suggesting Saudi Arabia backs “the least Islamist component of the rebellion” and Qatar’s young new emir is displaying a more “mature” foreign policy that seeks to avoid controversy in places like Syria. However, there is worrying news coming from Syria’s Raqqa Province, now controlled by the al Qaeda affiliate Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Hateful books described by several different sources as the area’s new academic curriculum, reportedly originate from Saudi Arabia.

Ali al-Ahmed, who directs the Institute for Gulf Affairs in Washington, has conducted previous reviews of official Saudi textbooks. He told me that although the seal from Saudi Arabia’s education ministry has been removed from the books, they otherwise appear identical to the ones he has reviewed. Al-Ahmed said that the two collections being brandished in Raqqa are “toxic,” promoting extremism and the dehumanization of non-Muslims.

But this isn’t the only development that appears to shed light on Saudi and Qatari objectives in Syria.

ISIL has gone on the offensive against certain Syrian rebel groups that are frequently linked to Qatar’s largesse, including Ahfad al-Rasoul and the Farouq Brigades. However, another recipient of Qatar’s support – arguably the strongest militia around Syria’s largest city, Aleppo – appears to prefer to negotiate with ISIL instead of helping other rebels fight it

Perhaps more worrying is what this Qatari-backed group did next. On September 24, one of its leaders in Aleppo issued a declaration with a handful of other militias that called for an Islamic state and rejected the Western-backed Syrian opposition coalition. Its number one signatory was the Nusra Front, al Qaeda’s other main affiliate in Syria. Roughly half the groups that joined in this announcement were Islamist brigades that have reportedly received backing from either Saudi Arabia or Qatar.

A week later, the head of another Islamist group announced the merger of dozens of rebel organizations around Damascus into a massive “Army of Islam.” Both diplomats and rebel fighters indicated that this merger occurred at the conscious direction of Riyadh. The organization’s leader, Zahran Alloush, studied in Saudi Arabia, where his father is a Salafist cleric.

The merger in Damascus contradicts claims that the Kingdom supports only “quietist” Salafis who reject political Islam, since Alloush’s brigade calls for an Islamic state and flies the black jihadist flag instead of a Syrian one. He has insisted this Damascus merger will not push back against ISIL and has openly advocated ethnic cleansing.

Saudi Arabia has suffered blowback for supporting jihadist groups before, most notably when al Qaeda went on a rampage in the Kingdom a decade ago. However, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have other incentives that push them toward promoting Syrian jihadists or at least turning a blind eye.

Riyadh has long promoted the strident, Salafist ideology of Wahhabi Islam at home and abroad (indeed, the textbooks in question are tagged “distributed free of charge”). Since the Arab Spring, Saudi Arabia has aggressively fanned sectarian hatreds to keep its own disaffected Sunnis and Shiites from joining forces to demand greater rights.

Qatar, noted for its “hyperactive” foreign policy, is so eager to acquire clients in the region that it has shown little concern for these groups’ intensely Islamist principles. Qatar reportedly tried to give the Muslim Brotherhood a stranglehold over Syria’s political opposition and was chastised by the U.S. for letting advanced weapons reach the Nusra Front.

Under pressure this past May, Qatar let Saudi Arabia take charge of the opposition cause in Syria. However, now that Saudi Arabia finds itself in a position of leadership over the rebellion, it also has incentives to encourage a broad military coalition against the al-Assad regime. Evidently, the Saudis have been giving in to that temptation, building a very large but also very jihadist tent among the rebels.

But at what cost? Before the war, Salafists in Syria were not indigenously grounded. Since then, they have opportunistically used this conflict to expand their influence, tapping into material support and sectarian rhetoric from the Gulf.

Some outside observers believe hardliners like Alloush are now the only game in town amongst Syria’s armed opposition. However, the continued expansion of such hardline rebel groups means that enticing Western support for the opposition is going to get much tougher as time goes on.

Yet these developments may be a sign that Saudi Arabia and the rebels are writing off the chances of U.S. military intervention altogether. Washington’s recent decision not to launch missile strikes on Syria infuriated the Saudis, and our exclusive focus on chemical weapons has given the Assad regime a new lease on life.

America’s Gulf allies want al-Assad out, and they want it now. Combined with Qatar and Saudi Arabia’s natural ideological predispositions, this intense desire to win Syria’s civil war seems to be overpowering any possible instincts for caution from the Gulf. Riyadh and Doha are feeding an unruly jihadist problem in Syria that will no doubt create all kinds of headaches for America and the region down the line."

USA TODAY

Chinese leader coming to U.S. next month

Stories in %27The People%27s Daily%27 blast U.S. culture

Latest story even rips United Airlines

BEIJING – Chinese leader Xi Jinping better watch out for ""immoral and dishonest Americans"" when he travels to California for a summit June 7-8 with President Obama. Best he avoids United Airlines, too.

The advice, published for all Chinese citizens, comes from The People's Daily, the flagship newspaper and faithful mouthpiece of China's ruling Communist Party, which Xi, 59, has led since last fall. Yet the overwhelming response within China has been ridicule at the paper's ham-fisted efforts to attack the USA.

""Immoral and Dishonest Americans,"" as the paper's bilingual, online column was titled until Saturday, aims to correct Chinese people's overly positive view of Americans. ""Most Chinese people think that Americans are honest, reliable and righteous,"" the introduction to the column explains. These descriptions ""are a bit misleading,"" it says before offering incidents and individuals ""to provide a more objective picture of what the U.S. and Americans are really like.""

The series started in March but went viral domestically this weekend when many other Chinese media outlets ran its latest piece that criticized customer service at United Airlines. The article featured a Chinese passenger who felt aggrieved and insulted when bumped off an over-booked flight from New York.

Long-suffering American fliers may sympathize with his treatment. The People's Daily chose to turn the episode into further evidence of American dishonesty, following tales of a grasping locksmith and a thieving payroll company. The latest column Friday concluded, ""Of course, Chinese passengers may choose not to consider UA. This probably is the best solution.""

Having his own plane, Xi Jinping is spared this problem. Through countless online outlets in China and especially the Twitter-like Sina Weibo micro-blogging service, The People's Daily has not been spared a barrage of ridicule and contempt for its attempts to criticize the USA.

America, called the ""beautiful country"" in Chinese, remains an object of fascination for Chinese people, as it does for many countries worldwide, and a top target for emigration. Though the state-run media often run critical stories about U.S. political, economic and social issues, most Chinese maintain a broadly positive view of the USA.

Chinese consumers snap up U.S.-designed products such as the iPhone and often prefer Hollywood movies and TV series to China's sometimes turgid and always state-censored entertainment. To counter this ""soft power"" of the USA, Beijing invests heavily to expand the size and reach of its state-run media in the USA and other markets.

The People's Daily's column is penned by its New York staff. The response – ""overwhelmingly negative,"" according to the Global Times, a sister paper with a strongly nationalist bent — shows the difficulty of convincing the Chinese online public, who have grown highly skeptical of their own government and quick to redirect state criticism of other nations.

Many responses on Sina Weibo are rich in irony. Some suggest the column was written as revenge for U.S. TV host Jimmy Kimmel's recent mocking of the shape of The People's Daily new headquarters in Beijing. Chinese Internet users have also laughed at its resemblance to the male reproductive organ.

Zhan Jiang, a journalism professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University, asked whether the column aims to warn Xi against being tricked on his U.S. travels or to ease pressure on the U.S. Embassy's visa section. ""Thirty years ago, we were educated that Americans all lived in hell on earth, but American people were good, they were waiting for us to liberate them,"" historian Lei Yi wrote. ""Thirty years on, we are educated that Americans are 'immoral and dishonest.'""

Despite Xi's crackdown on official corruption, the Chinese public is scornful of party and government officials long seen as enriching themselves to afford elite lifestyles far beyond their modest salaries, including overseas study for their offspring. Many posts mocked officials for sending family members to such a dishonest nation. Xi's daughter studied at Harvard.

In the face of public scorn, the paper changed the column's Chinese title Saturday to the blander ""The Americans You Don't Know."" The English title remains, as before, ""The Dishonest Americans Series."" Calling for more ""objective observation"" by both China and the USA, the Global Times said the incident provides ""an embarrassing lesson that People's Daily has to draw from this misguided effort to diversify Chinese voices regarding the U.S."" But the USA, too, must cease its ""old trick"" of choosing ""part of China's image, usually unfavorable, to magnify and hype up its negative influence,"" the paper said Monday.

One visiting American tried to make progress Monday in handling the often rocky U.S.-Chinese relationship, beset by problems such as cyber-attacks and how to handle North Korea. Tom Donilon, national security adviser to President Obama, met Chinese officials to prepare for next month's summit between the two leaders. China hopes to enhance dialogue, exchanges and cooperation with the U.S. side, as well as properly handle sensitive issues, in a bid to promote the sound and steady development of bilateral ties, said Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi, the Xinhua state news agency reported.

Herszenhorn'],"Saying He’s Pro-Russia, McCain Criticizes Putin","MOSCOW — In a combative essay published Thursday in the online newspaper Pravda.ru, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, declared himself to be “pro-Russian” but delivered a blistering attack on President Vladimir V. Putin, describing him as presiding over a failed petro-state and as a quasi dictator who rules “by corruption, repression and violence.”

Mr. McCain’s article was intended to answer an Op-Ed column by Mr. Putin in The New York Times on Sept. 12 that made the case against President Obama’s threatened military strike on Syria. Mr. Putin’s column, in which he presented Russia’s position as defending international law and respect for state sovereignty, generated fierce debate, including praise and accusations of hypocrisy.

While Mr. Putin’s article focused more generally on American foreign policy, Mr. McCain, who has long been a sharp critic of the Kremlin, focused squarely on the Russian president himself. In his introduction, though, Mr. McCain made an effort to dispel the idea that he is anti-Russian, a perception that is widespread here.

“I am not anti-Russian,” Mr. McCain wrote. “I am pro-Russian, more pro-Russian than the regime that misrules you today.”"

The Russian president's opinion piece arguing against military intervention in Syria, published on The New York Times' website late Wednesday, set off a flurry of reactions -- some outraged, some impressed, and some just plain bemused.

Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez said the piece made him almost want to throw up, and House Speaker John Boehner said he was ""insulted.""

Putin said he wrote the article ""to speak directly to the American people and their political leaders.""

But he appeared to have raised some hackles with the last paragraph in which he disputed the idea of American exceptionalism.

It was a reference to President Barack Obama's address on Tuesday night, in which he said that while America can't be a global cop, it ought to act when in certain situations.

""That's what makes us exceptional,"" Obama said. ""With humility, but with resolve, let us never lose sight of that essential truth.""

Putin's answer to that?

""It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation,"" he wrote.

World reaction

He concluded with the line, ""We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord's blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal.""

The White House shrugged off the fuss around Putin's jabs at Obama, describing them as ""irrelevant.""

Obama himself ignored a question about the op-ed on Thursday. His chief spokesman, Jay Carney, said that Putin has a right to his opinion, noting that America is an exceptional nation.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi questioned Putin's views on equality.

""What I found interesting was the closing -- when he says when we pray to God he judges us all - I don't know exactly what his words are but he says `we are all God's children.' I think that's great. I hope it applies to gays and lesbians in Russia as well,"" Pelosi said.

Putin signed a law earlier this year that bans public discussion of gay rights and relationships where children might hear it. Violators can be fined and, if they are foreigners, deported.

'Hey Putin'

There are others who took issue with Putin's view.

""Hey Putin, next time you wanna write a letter to convince America about something, how about you skip saying we're not exceptional? #rude,"" tweeted Sarah Rumpf, a political consultant in Texas.

Is the U.S. really No. 1?

Russia's wars

The Russian president also annoyed some people by warning against military action without U.N. Security Council approval.

""Man who launched military action in Georgia and Chechnya without UN say-so says wars without it are illegal?"" tweeted the journalist John Podhoretz.

A report commissioned by the European Union said that Georgia illegally started the war with Russia in 2008 but that the Russian response, which involved occupying large parts of Georgian territory, also violated international law.

The two wars between Russian forces and separatists in Chechnya are widely considered to be internal conflicts.

Some Twitter users unearthed a previous op-ed that Putin wrote for the Times about the Chechen war in 1999.

Putin, then the prime minister of Russia, struck a different tone in which he sought to explain Russia's military action.

""No government can stand idly by when terrorism strikes,"" he wrote. ""It is the solemn duty of all governments to protect their citizens from danger.""

""Not a word on UN or Pope or Int'l law,"" Philip Gourevitch, a staff writer at The New Yorker, commented about the 1999 article. (Putin mentions the pope in his op-ed this week as being among those opposed to a U.S. strike against Syria.)

Senator's stomach turns

The overall tone of Putin's latest broadside was too much for Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who said he read the article at dinner on Wednesday.

""I almost wanted to vomit,"" he said. ""I worry when someone who came up through the KGB tells us what is in our national interests and what is not. It really raises the question of how serious the Russian proposal is.""

But plenty of people seemed to think Putin had scored points against Obama.

""I think it's sad to see him acting with more common sense and humanity than Obama,"" said Ashton Blazer.

""Putin made a compelling, though disingenuous, case against military strikes. Its effectiveness shows how badly Pres Obama was outmaneuvered,"" tweeted Marc Lamont Hill.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

A New Jersey Native']","Obama: Diplomatic talks on Syria ‘encouraging,’ but threat remains","WASHINGTON – Vividly describing the deaths of more than a thousand people in an alleged nerve gas attack outside Damascus, President Obama spoke to the nation from the East Room of the White House to argue his case for why the United States must hold Syrian President Bashar Assad accountable.

Obama called the Aug. 21 attack a “crime against humanity” that violated international law.

“When dictators commit atrocities, they depend upon the world to look the other way until those horrifying pictures fade from memory,” Obama said. “But these things happened. The facts cannot be denied. The question now is what the United States of America and the international community is prepared to do about it.”

TRANSCRIPT: Obama makes his case to the nation

Advertisement

In his first prime-time address from the White House in more than two years, Obama found himself unexpectedly tasked with a dual challenge: bolstering public support for his decision to launch military strikes against the Assad government while explaining his decision to pursue a diplomatic alternative.

Obama called a new Russian proposal to have Syria turn over its chemical weapons stockpile “encouraging,” but cautioned, “It’s too early to tell whether this offer will succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments.”

The almost contradictory messages reflected the unsettled state of affairs in the standoff with Syria over the alleged chemical attack. The White House and U.S. allies worked quickly Tuesday to explore the viability of the proposal made by Russian on Monday.

The Obama administration said it was skeptical that Assad’s government would follow through with the plan. Still, in a meeting with senators on Capitol Hill, Obama asked lawmakers to give him time to sort through the options, and Senate leaders, in a sign of the deep reluctance to endorse the president’s push for another military intervention, readily complied.

But the president’s speech from the East Room was announced before Russia’s plan emerged. While diplomats in Paris, Damascus, Moscow and Washington worked through the details – running into early signs of the difficulty of crafting a workable plan – Obama continued his public relations campaign.

FULL COVERAGE: The debate over Syria

The speech, which aides rewrote on the fly Tuesday, was designed as the keynote of a week of meetings, briefings, speeches and phone calls aimed at lawmakers whose support Obama needs in his pursuit of congressional authorization for a punitive strike against Syria.

With polls showing Americans opposed to a strike by roughly a 2-1 margin, the White House sought to convince lawmakers to buck public opinion and back Obama on a vote some say could determine the future of his presidency and U.S. credibility abroad.

In his speech Tuesday, Obama stressed a strike would be limited – unlike the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – but he answered some skeptical lawmakers who have wondered if a “pinprick” strike would be worth it.

“Let me make something clear: The United States military doesn’t do pinpricks,” Obama said. “Even a limited strike will send a message to Assad that no other nation can deliver.”

But on Capitol Hill, resistance to military intervention seemed to firm up with the sudden appearance of the Russian alternative.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) indefinitely postponed an initial vote on an authorization resolution approved by the Foreign Relations Committee last week. He said he would be satisfied with a diplomatic solution. “I’m not a blood-and-thunder guy. I’m not for shock and awe,” he said.

Meanwhile, key senators began to draft language that would incorporate the Russian plan, perhaps authorizing force only if Syria refused to allow an outside entity, most likely the United Nations, to secure its chemical weapons stockpile. It could also require a U.N. resolution condemning Syria for using chemical weapons on its own people.

Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of the Armed Services Committee, emphasized that the resolution was still being crafted. But he said the goal was to eliminate the threat of Syria using chemical weapons by keeping open the possibility of force, “like the Sword of Damocles over Assad.”

“It’s because of the threat of a strike by the president, because of the possibility that Congress would authorize it, that there’s movement at the U.N. So you’ve got to find a way to keep that pressure on. That’s the key to success at the U.N.,” Levin said.

The president told Democrats he needed a number of days to pursue the diplomatic channels. But he “was not overly optimistic,” said Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), the assistant majority leader.

“What he’s basically asked is for some time to work this out,” Durbin said, a time frame that would delay any action until next week. “I think that’s reasonable. We want this to end well; we want the end of chemical weapons in Syria. And if we can achieve that through the president’s threatened use of military force, that’s a good thing for safety in the world.”

The European Union, wary of military action, warmed to the Russian proposal, as its top diplomat urged quick work on the nettlesome details involving the verification and destruction of the arsenal. Support from the EU, with its 28 member nations, added to the diplomatic momentum behind the idea.

Obama, along with his French and British counterparts, agreed Tuesday to explore the proposal with Russia and China, Syria’s allies. The latter have used their veto power on the U.N. Security Council to block previous moves to punish Assad’s government.

But Obama and his allies almost immediately ran into conflict with Russia, which demanded that the U.S. should forswear any threat to use force as part of a deal. Moscow also insisted that the Security Council should not be asked to implement the program under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, which authorizes the use of force, and proposed instead use of a much weaker tool, a “presidential statement.”

Russian officials have been deeply resistant to even weak Security Council resolutions concerning the Syrian civil war, fearing that they could open the way to an international military force.

Skeptical of the plan already, administration officials warned Tuesday that the Russian proposal could disintegrate under such demands before the end of the week.

The plan “has to have consequences if games are played, or if somebody tries to undermine this,” Secretary of State John F. Kerry said during a Google+ Hangout conversation on the subject.

British Prime Minister David Cameron told lawmakers the proposal needed to come before the Security Council as a resolution that includes a timetable, process and consequences if Syria reneges.

“What’s important is to make sure this isn’t some delay tactic, that this isn’t some ruse,” he said.

Kerry said U.S. officials have stressed to the Russians that “this must be done quickly.”

Still, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he was working with Syria to draft a proposal and planned to deliver it soon to U.N. Secretary-General Ban-ki Moon. And the Syrian government said it was serious about the Russian plan precisely because it could prevent a U.S. military strike.

“We agreed with the Russian initiative, proceeding from the understanding that it must cut the ground from under the feet of the U.S. aggression against our country,” Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem said during a meeting with the speaker of Russia’s lower house of parliament, Sergei Naryshkin.

If Obama ends up rejecting the Russian proposal, he could be forced to resume his effort to win congressional authorization for a strike.

On Capitol Hill, the president’s threat to strike Syria continued to draw new opposition, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), whose decision conflicts with the support offered by House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), who reaffirmed his support for military action.

“I believe it’s important to try to help the president provide a unified front,” Boehner said, even as he made a nod to his own problems rounding up votes. “It’s a very difficult issue for Congress.”

The split between the two top GOP leaders in Congress comes as McConnell, who is running for reelection next year, aligned himself with the tea party wing of the GOP, which has gained influence at the expense of traditional defense hawks. McConnell said he did not believe limited strikes would deter Assad from using chemical weapons.

The two Republicans both raised concerns about the Russian proposal. Boehner said he was skeptical because of the “actors that are involved,” but McConnell said it was “worth exploring.”

A compliance notice report sent to the Triumph one month before it departed Galveston on Feb. 7 for what was planned as a four-day cruise recommended spray shields be installed on engines' flexible fuel hoses, according to the documents filed Tuesday by Carnival Cruise Lines in federal court in Miami.

A leak from a hose on engine No. 6 led to a fire early on Feb. 10 as the ship returned from a stop in Cozumel, Mexico. No one was injured, but the fire disabled the ship. More than 4,000 people aboard endured a nightmarish tow to Mobile, Ala., that the plaintiffs' attorney called a ""floating hell.""

The documents, first reported by CNN, are part of a lawsuit that was filed in February against Carnival Cruise Lines and its parent Carnival Corporation on behalf of dozens of the Triumph's passengers.

Frank Spagnoletti, a Houston attorney who represents some of the passengers, said Tuesday that Carnival was negligent in maintaining the ship and allowed it to sail knowing there was a fire risk.

Neither Carnival nor its legal team returned calls after business hours Tuesday. But in a response filed that day in Miami, Carnival said the ship's engines passed inspection before departure and its own recommendation to install spray shields on flexible fuel lines was beyond any required safety measures.

It was the recognition of the problem — with a two month repair deadline — along with the decision to let the Triumph sail before it was corrected that galled Spagnoletti.

""You've got 4,000 souls on that ship. You know that there's a propensity for fire if these fuel hoses break and yet you give them two months to fix it?"" he said.

In a Nov. 22 deposition, ship captain Angelo Los said he was first notified by Carnival about problems with fuel leaks from flexible hoses in January. During the deposition, Spagnoletti showed Los the compliance notice report dated Jan. 2 that cited nine fuel leaks on Carnival Corporation's ships during a two-year period.

The compliance notice report said Carnival together with the engine manufacturer was investigating the problem and that installing spray shields would be an effective safety barrier. It described an incident on another ship outfitted with the spray shields that avoided a similar fire.

The company gave the ship until Feb. 28 to come into compliance.

Los said in November that he believed Carnival had known about the problem since March 2012. The spray guards were partially installed on Triumph, but not on engine No. 6, Los said. The hose that leaked was less than six months old.

""The spray shields for the flexible fuel hoses were an additional Carnival Corporation recommended best practice to avoid fuel fires,"" the company said in its response Tuesday, and not otherwise required by any regulation or statute.

Carnival Cruise Lines also argued the notice sent to the Triumph was only for fuel lines above the engine room floor plates. The leak occurred on a fuel hose beneath the engine room floor. However, the January notice to Triumph does not specify that or differentiate between hoses above or below the floor.

""The leak in the flexible fuel hose was a completely unexpected accident that took place,"" the company said. What ignited the fuel is unknown, it said.

Passengers described unsanitary conditions after the fire, as toilets stopped functioning and an unbearable stench drove many to camp out on the decks. The weary travelers finally disembarked in Alabama on Feb. 15.

Spagnoletti echoed many of the passengers in crediting the crew with putting out the fire and making the best of a horrible situation.

""It was unbelievable to me that you would take 4,000 people and put them in a situation of basically Russian roulette,"" Spagnoletti said. ""Basically every time that vessel went out they never knew whether they were going to have a fire or not."""

As midlife sets in, maintaining a healthy weight often becomes harder. Tricks that worked in the past, like cutting down on wine or sugar, no longer seem to work, either. Even slender Samantha Cameron, now 50, has apparently been affected. In her 30s and early 40s, staying in shape was easy, she said this weekend, “but then I hit 43, I just put on three-quarters of a stone. Suddenly you don’t quite fit any of your things and I got really bloated.” At first she tried doing the 5:2 diet – eating normally five days a week, then having just 500 calories on the other two – but “I just couldn’t do it, I literally couldn’t speak in the evening, I had to go to bed at 7pm.” She has recently found a solution: the 5:2 principles, but with 800 calories on the “fast” days, and says she’s “loving it” and “the bloating’s gone”. Alongside three weekly workouts, she says it’s helping to keep her trim: her goal is “to hit my 50s in almost as good shape as I hit my 40s.” If you’re struggling to maintain your weight and fitness post-50, here’s why – and what to do about it: Muscle mass Every decade after the age of 30, we on average lose three to eight per cent of our muscle mass. At first, this might not be noticeable, but by 50 or 60, will make a considerable difference. This is bad news if you want to lose weight, because muscle burns on average three times more calories than fat per day, even at rest. What to do: Incorporate resistance training into your weekly routine to reduce muscle loss. The NHS recommends two sessions of strength training a week, which could include activities as varied as gardening or lifting weights. Don’t underestimate the good that exercise can do: a 2018 study shows that regular exercisers over the age of 55 kept up their muscle mass considerably more than inactive people. Staying active In England, half of 16 to 24-year-olds are doing the recommended amount of weekly exercise, but only one in 10 people aged 65 to 74 are doing so. If injuries have accrued, and your work and social life is less busy than it once was, you may be leading a more sedentary lifestyle than you realise. The role of exercise in weight loss is much-debated, but it can be crucial in maintaining your weight. A famous 2016 study followed participants in American weight loss competition The Biggest Loser during and after filming, and found that most regained a lot of weight after the cameras stopped rolling due to a higher appetite and slower metabolism. However, a follow-up study in 2017 found that the contestants who kept the most weight off were those who had remained committed to a fitness regimen. This was particularly interesting given that more exercise didn’t equal more weight loss during the show, when those who lost the most focused on diet over working out. What to do: Try to stick to the NHS guidelines on exercise, which recommend 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, or a mixture of both. Make sure you are doing something appropriate for your body, too. As we get older, high-impact workouts like running may place unwanted stress on your joints, so think about lower impact options like swimming or cycling. Hormones Menopause changes where fat is stored on the body. Higher oestrogen levels in the fertile years cause fat to be stored on your legs, hips and behind, but after oestrogen drops, fat can move to your middle, even if you remain exactly the same weight. This can be an issue, as fat around your trunk is more likely to contribute to Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and heart issues than fat on your hips and legs. Men are affected by hormone changes as they age, too: after the age of 40 they lose roughly one per cent of their testosterone a year. This matters for weight, as testosterone is linked to the amount of muscle you have and where you store fat. What to do: For women, several studies suggest that HRT can help to stop the shift of fat from your bottom half to around your middle as you go through menopause. An Italian study followed two groups of equal weight post-menopausal women for a year, putting half of them on HRT, with the rest going hormone-free. At the end of the year, the HRT group stayed almost the same weight, and hadn’t put on any extra fat around their middles or arms. In the untreated group, things were different: they had put on three and a half pounds, and had increased the amount of fat around their waists and arms. HRT isn’t suitable for everyone, so make sure you consider your options and discuss with your doctor first. In men, hormones are linked to a variety of lifestyle factors, including body fat and waist size, which can increase the amount of oestrogen in your body. Keeping active is also vital for men’s hormones: a 2018 study found that regular cyclists aged 55 to 74 kept their testosterone levels up compared with inactive men. Your sleep is also a partial predictor of your testosterone levels: most of the hormone is released while we doze, so if you’re not getting enough hours in bed, your body has less chance of boosting its stores. Getting enough sleep is key for maintaining your weight for other reasons, too: not getting enough is shown to make you gravitate towards sweet foods, and muscle growth occurs largely while we’re resting at night. More stress For many, juggling looking after children and caring for parents with work can mean life post-50 requires navigating a huge amount of stress. Even if you eat exactly as you did before, stress can cause weight gain. In 2015, American researchers found that after eating a large meal, women who reported more stress in the previous day burned 104 fewer calories than women who weren’t stressed. Stressed women also had higher levels of insulin, which is linked to gaining fat. This may not sound significant, but burning 100 fewer calories a day could lead to a loss of 10lbs of fat over a year. What to do: Reducing stress is often one of the hardest lifestyle changes to make, as you may have little control over the issues at work or home. However, you can change how you react, which can reduce your stress levels even without anything changing in your external environment. Exercise is an incredibly effective way of lowering cortisol levels, as well as burning calories, which could lead to a double effect on your weight. There is also robust evidence that simply slowing your breathing can dramatically reduce stress in both the short and long term, as well as giving a range of other benefits like better sleep. “Slow” counts as anything less than 10 breaths a minute, and six breaths is even better. The NHS recommends inhaling for up to a count of five, then exhaling for the same length of time."

USA TODAY

From White House spokesman Jay Carney:

""President Obama and the First Lady will go to South Africa next week to pay their respects to the memory of Nelson Mandela and to participate in memorial events. We'll have further updates on timing and logistics as they become available.""

Officials have held off on a detailed announcement as travel plans, logistics, and security are worked out; services for Mandela will be part of a mourning period in South Africa that will last about 10 days.

The South African government has scheduled the state funeral for Dec. 15, a week from Sunday. There is also a memorial service scheduled for Dec. 10, which is Tuesday.

Carney did not say whether Obama would attend the memorial, the burial, or both.

In the meantime, Obama has directed that American flags be lowered to half-staff through Monday in honor of the freedom fighter who died Thursday at age 95.

In a proclamation honoring Mandela, Obama wrote that ""the United States has lost a close friend, South Africa has lost an incomparable liberator, and the world has lost an inspiration for freedom, justice, and human dignity -- Nelson Mandela is no longer with us, he belongs to the ages.""

Mandela ""transformed South Africa -- and moved the entire world,"" Obama wrote. ""His journey from a prisoner to a president embodied the promise that human beings -- and countries -- can change for the better.""

The resolution said: ""While we mourn his loss, we will forever honor Nelson Mandela's memory. He left behind a South Africa that is free.""

The White House also announced that Obama phoned current South African President Jacob Zuma to express the nation's condolences.

Said a White House statement:

""The president conveyed how profoundly Mandela's extraordinary example of moral courage, kindness, and humility influenced his own life, as well as those of millions around the world.

""President Obama reaffirmed that the strong and historic partnership between the United States and South Africa will continue to draw strength from Mandela's legacy as we work together to promote equality, reconciliation and human dignity, and to build a more just and prosperous world."""

From the Arizona Republic:

Obama foes at one point sang, ""Bye Bye Black Sheep,"" a derogatory reference to the president's skin color, while protesters like Deanne Bartram raised a sign saying, ""Impeach the Half-White Muslim!""

The Republic reported that hundreds of people gathered outside Desert Vista High School as Obama unveiled a plan to overhaul the nation's mortgage finance system. Some protesters came from Obama's left, urging him to reject the Keystone XL oil pipeline and take other actions on climate change. But a prevailing theme among many in the protest appeared to be issues of race. Some even suggested that Obama himself was to blame for racial tensions.

“We have gone back so many years,” Judy Burris told the Republic, arguing Obama had taken the nation back to pre-Civil Rights era levels of racism. “He’s divided all the races. I hate him for that.”

Others carried signs calling for Obama to be impeached, Tucson News Now reported, though despite the negativity, the majority of those in attendance were Obama fans.

Inside, Obama's speech focused primarily on the housing market, though he did at one point attempt to link his proposal to immigration reform, arguing that Congress -- which is now in recess -- could help housing prices rebound by finalizing legislation that has already been passed by the Senate."

Each side accuses the United States of backing the other and alleges conspiracies in which the Obama administration is secretly fostering dissent in an attempt to weaken Egypt.

It’s a damned if you do, damned if you don’t quagmire in which the U.S. appears to have alienated both sides, underscoring waning American influence and credibility as it attempts to navigate the turmoil.

Islamists at a large pro-Morsi rally Friday afternoon questioned how the U.S. — which claims to stand for the rule of law and free elections — could so quickly abandon Egypt’s first democratically elected president and fail to condemn, or even acknowledge, Wednesday’s military coup.

“The morals of America are not being reflected in their politics toward Egypt,” said Sharif Hegazy, 37, who manages the Cairo office of a U.S. company he preferred not to name. “Because of its past support for [deposed President Hosni] Mubarak, America has always been seen as a veiled enemy. Now they are just waiting to see which side will win. That’s not ethical. The U.S. should support the election.”

Though U.S. officials and analysts say American influence in Egypt is increasingly limited, many Morsi supporters are convinced that a U.S. hand is at work behind the scenes in the country’s recent troubles. A common viewpoint expressed on the streets is that the Obama administration worked with the Egyptian army to cause power outages, fuel shortages and other problems that soured public support for Morsi.

The deposed president’s supporters complain that the U.S. never supported Morsi because of his roots in the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood.

“The U.S. silence [to Morsi’s ouster] proves that the U.S. has always been against political Islam, even when political Islam arises through democratic means,” said Mohamed El Sayad, 40, a Cairo father of three.

Sheik Abdel Khalea Fahmi, 33, struggling to be heard over buzzing military helicopters that protesters say were sent to intimidate pro-Morsi crowds, saw an even more devious U.S. conspiracy. Mindful of the rising anti-American sentiment, he said the United States pretended to embrace Morsi’s government as a way of discrediting him.

“It was part of the U.S. plot to support Morsi so that the people would turn against him,” Fahmi said.

Just a few miles away in Tahrir Square, anti-Morsi protesters insist the U.S. is on the ousted president’s side, just as Washington supported Mubarak. They have been holding up signs reading “Obama supports terrorism” and pictures of U.S. Ambassador Anne Patterson with an “X” mark.

Now many of the young Egyptians whom Obama tried to reach out to in his landmark 2009 speech here view the U.S. president as a hypocrite.

“America is using the Muslim Brotherhood to impose the kind of order they want to create a new Middle East, which would guarantee Israel’s security and U.S. interests,” said Ahmed Salam, 20, a law student and member of the Rebel movement, which organized the massive protest Sunday that helped bring down Morsi.

“The U.S. isn’t listening to the people,” he said, speaking from a tent in the middle of Tahrir Square.

Much of their anger has been focused on Patterson, ambassador since 2011. She infuriated anti-Morsi activists last month by saying she was “deeply skeptical” about calls to use street protests to unseat Morsi, adding that elections are a better route. She also explained U.S. support of Morsi by noting that he was the nation’s democratically elected leader.

After that, activists used a variety of foul language to describe Patterson and called for her to be kicked out of the country. Anti-Morsi protesters say such criticism is justified because the U.S. failed to speak out more aggressively when Morsi was accused of cracking down on political opponents, journalists and judges.

“It’s not only about elections,” said Mohammed Farahat, 27, an advertising account manager. “Hitler was elected too. It bothers me that the U.S. presents itself as a peacemaker, but then they supports a fascist regime like Morsi’s.”

Asked whether he was worried that the United States might cut off $1.3 billion in annual aid to Egypt, Farahat said his country could do fine without it, a statement that seemed to ignore Egypt’s deep economic troubles. A 2011 Gallup poll found that 70% of Egyptians were opposed to their country accepting further American assistance.

“I’m tired of being threatened with losing our aid,” he said. “How many times can they play that card?”

In A Three-Decade Career At The Washington Post', 'Robinson Has Been City Hall Reporter', 'City Editor', 'Foreign Correspondent In Buenos Aires', 'London']",Eugene Robinson: The new al-Qaeda menace,"If the new, decentralized al-Qaeda is such a threat that 19 U.S. embassies, consulates and other diplomatic posts have to be shuttered for a week, we have a decade of wrongheaded U.S. policy to blame.

The Arab Spring contributed by creating power vacuums for militant anti-Western jihadists to exploit. But myopic decision-making in Washington clearly played a huge role — and while I hope we’re getting smarter, I have my doubts.

President Obama’s decision to order the closure of U.S. outposts in much of the Muslim world drew rare bipartisan support on Capitol Hill, with lawmakers on the House and Senate intelligence committees underscoring the perceived gravity of the threat. Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) called it “the most serious threat that I’ve seen in the last several years.” Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.) said that “the administration’s call to close these embassies . . . was actually a very smart call.”

It’s hard to argue with prudent caution. At the same time, though, it’s hard to understand just how worried we should be. Osama bin Laden lies in a watery grave. His organization, once based in Afghanistan, is decimated. Regularly we hear news of someone described as an al-Qaeda lieutenant being blasted to his reward by a drone-fired missile. There is a disconnect between these successes and the need to close so many U.S. facilities — while issuing a general warning to travelers — in fear of another attack.

The truth is that U.S. foreign policy helped to create the decentralized al-Qaeda, a branch of which is believed to be trying to launch some kind of strike.

The most fateful choice, and the biggest strategic error, was the decision to invade Iraq. George W. Bush’s epic misadventure diverted resources and attention from the war in Afghanistan, giving a reprieve to the Taliban. The Iraq war also provided new focal points for jihadist grievance — Abu Ghraib, for example — and gave new oxygen to the simmering intra-Muslim conflict between Sunni and Shiite.

Al-Qaeda put down roots in chaotic Iraq. It did the same in lawless Yemen — home to the al-Qaeda “branch” or “affiliate” responsible for the current alert. While the original al-Qaeda may be moribund, its surviving leaders hiding in Afghanistan or Pakistan, terrorist groups bearing the name are trying their best to continue the fight.

First Bush and then Obama discovered the expediency of remotely piloted drone aircraft as instruments of war. Obama has waged what amounts to a campaign of targeted assassination, decimating the ranks of the various al-Qaeda branches. This strategy has the obvious merit of not putting American lives at risk. But the inevitable collateral damage — deaths of civilians, destruction of infrastructure — helps recruit new al-Qaeda conscripts.

The Arab Spring created opportunity for jihadists throughout the region. There is now an active al-Qaeda branch in Libya, where militants attacked the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi in 2012. There is a branch that briefly occupied northern Mali before being pushed out by a French intervention. There is a branch fighting against the regime of Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian civil war.

And if Egypt’s military rulers follow through with their crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood, it would not be surprising to see something like an al-Qaeda affiliate begin to emerge in the Arab world’s most populous nation, perhaps establishing a refuge in the largely ungoverned tribal lands of the Sinai Peninsula.

With a few exceptions — Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia — the Obama administration has tried to support popular movements and push hard for democracy. For his trouble, Obama is learning that no good deed goes unpunished. In Egypt, for example, the two sides agree on hardly anything except that they both feel betrayed by the United States.

My argument with Obama’s policies is not that the president has tried too hard to end the “war on terror,” as hawks allege. It’s that he hasn’t tried hard enough to leave behind the “war” metaphor as ill-suited to a struggle that is fundamentally ideological.

Maj. Gen. Michael T. Harrison was suspended by the Army chief of staff, Gen. Ray Odierno, and Army Secretary John McHugh, according to a statement. The Army provided no details about the alleged assault.

The move is the latest in a string of incidents and reports that have focused attention in Congress and at the White House on whether the military is aggressive enough in prosecuting sexual assaults, which have increased steadily in the armed forces in recent years.

The Pentagon estimated last month that as many as 26,000 military members may have received “unwanted sexual contact” in 2011, up from an estimated 19,000 assaults in 2011, an estimate based on an annual survey of military personnel.

Until the investigation of Harrison’s role is finished, Maj. Gen. James C. Boozer will take his place in Japan, the Army said.

Harrison, a 33-year Army veteran, has been commander of the small U.S. army contingent in Japan since 2010 and was due to leave the job to take over as deputy commander of the Army component of U.S. Central Command, based in Kuwait.

A decision on his next assignment or whether he will face punishment or forced retirement will await the completion of the investigation, said George B. Wright, an Army spokesman.

Separately, the Air Force announced Friday that Maj. Gen. Margaret H. Woodward would take over its office of sexual assault prevention. The last head of the office, Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski, was relieved after he was arrested last month near the Pentagon and charged with groping a woman.

Woodward is the former commander of 17th Air Force, based in Germany, and she commanded the U.S. portion of the allied air campaign over Libya in 2011.

In a letter to Congress on Friday, President Obama said the deployment would “provide support for intelligence collection and will also facilitate intelligence sharing with French forces conducting operations in Mali, and with other partners in the region.”

Advertisement

The last 40 American troops in the deployment arrived in Niger on Feb. 20 with the consent of the government, Obama said.

A senior U.S. officer described the troops as a security unit that will protect crews flying and maintaining U.S. Air Force drones now operating from an airfield near the capital, Niamey. The force includes drone pilots, intelligence liaison officers and aircraft maintenance personnel, the officer said.

“We’re basing drones there to help the French, and this deployment is the security element,” the officer said.

He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss details of the operation publicly.

French forces have been battling to push Islamic militants out of northern Mali in recent weeks in an effort to oust insurgents who seized local control after the civilian government collapsed last year.

Predator drones are already flying over Mali to assist French troops, who intervened in January and have driven back militants and Tuareg rebels, who had taken over three major cities and were threatening Mali’s capital, Bamako.

Advertisement

The drones flying from Niger will be unarmed surveillance aircraft tracking suspected militants operating in the remote parts of northern Mali. The aircraft could also be used over other countries in the region, the officer said.

The Obama administration has not yet decided to establish a permanent drone base in Niger, the senior officer said. For the moment, the operation is considered a temporary mission to assist the French.

Advertisement

But some senior officers in the Pentagon’s Africa Command, which oversees military operations on the continent, favor a permanent base to develop a better picture of the militant threat in West Africa, the officer said.

Among the groups the U.S. is worried about is Boko Haram, an Islamist extremist group in neighboring Nigeria.

Currently, the only permanent base in Africa from which drones operate is in Djibouti, thousands of miles to the east.

In addition to the militants in Mali — some with loose ties to Al Qaeda groups — extremists have taken refuge in the largely ungoverned desert areas of southern Libya and Algeria.

Advertisement

If the Obama administration decides to authorize a permanent base in Niger, it would probably be in Agadez, near northern Mali, the officer said, confirming a report in the New York Times.

Some senior military commanders, in arguing for a permanent base, say the militant threat in the region is growing and could eventually threaten the U.S. and its allies unless more aggressive action is taken.

Advertisement

But some Obama administration officials are skeptical about getting more deeply involved in the region, saying there is no strong evidence that militants there want to target the United States.

Some officials also argue against getting involved in a low-level military operation just as direct U.S. involvement in the war in Afghanistan is nearing an end.

Advertisement

The Obama administration has helped the French operation in Mali with intelligence, transportation for French troops and air refueling of French fighters. But the White House has kept the U.S. role limited.

The U.S. buildup in Niger, though still small in numbers, has unfolded quickly. Last month, the U.S. and Niger signed an agreement outlining legal protections for American troops operating there.

The U.S. also has been operating surveillance drones across the region, including over a natural gas complex last month in eastern Algeria, where militants took hundreds of people prisoner during a four-day siege that killed 37 hostages.

By Ellen Tordesillas

Many, including high-ranking Philippine officials, like to think that increased presence of American military in the Philippines, which is a subject of talks between the two countries starting today, is a commitment by the Americans to defend the Philippines in case of an armed conflict in the West Philippine Sea, where a number of islands are being claimed wholly or partly by the Philippines, Brunei, China,Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam.

Those who have taken these view will be disappointed because the U.S has taken a neutral position in the conflicting claims in the South China Sea (part of it is referred to as West Philippine Sea) and has always been consistent in urging for a peaceful resolution of the conflicting claims.

The Obama administration has decided to rebalance its military forces from Middle East to Asia, in what is seen by analysts as a move to contain China’s hegemony in the region.

But as former UN Representative Lauro Baja, Jr. observed, the Americans do not want to ‘vulgarize’ this objective.

In increasing its presence in Asia, the United States does not want to play referee to countries fighting over islands, rocks and shoals. “They want a stable region. They don’t want to prejudice their strategic relations with China, which is more important than claims over rocks and shoals,” Baja said.

Primarily, the U.S. wants to ensure that the sealanes are open and unhampered for international navigation.

In preparation for the implementation of their Pivot to Asia policy, senior American officials have been coming here the past months and assessing the situation. One thing that they were concerned about is the tension between the Philippines and China over the disputed islands especially Bajo de Masinloc otherwise known as Scarborough Shoal or Panatag shoal and lately the Ayungin shoal.

The Philippines has filed a suit with the UN Arbitral Court questioning China’s nine dash-line, which encompasses the whole South China Sea including several countries’ territories.

Story continues

A source said some of the analysts interviewed by American officials said that the “Shame China” strategy of the Department of Foreign Affairs under Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario has contributed largely to the deteriorating relations between the Philippines and China.

Del Rosario has, several times accused China of “duplicity and intimidation.” Malacañang spokesperson Edwin Lacierda has also made sure that he is not behind in China-bashing.

In the 2010 and 2011 State-of-the Nation address by President Aquino, he had strong words against China.

In his 2011 SONA, Aquino, declared: “ There was a time when we couldn’t appropriately respond to threats in our own backyard. Now, our message to the world is clear: What is ours is ours; setting foot on Recto Bank is no different from setting foot on Recto Avenue.”

He was referring to the disputed Recto or Reed Bank near Palawan.

In his 2012 SONA, he talked lengthily about the situation in Bajo de Masinloc. He said, “We demonstrated utmost forbearance in dealing with this issue. As a sign of our goodwill, we replaced our navy cutter with a civilian boat as soon as we could. We chose not to respond to their media’s harangues. I do not think it excessive to ask that our rights be respected, just as we respect their rights as a fellow nation in a world we need to share.

“There are those who say that we should let Bajo de Masinloc go; we should avoid the trouble. But if someone entered your yard and told you he owned it, would you agree? Would it be right to give away that which is rightfully ours?”

Aquino can be stubborn. But he listens to America. Last year, a month after he withdrew all the ships from Bajo de Masinloc, he, supported by the majority of the members of his cabinet, decided to send back the ships to the area which was by then already controlled by the Chinese. Upon learning of Malacañang's decision, the U.S. relayed the advice through defense officials that it would not be wise to send back the ships to Bajo de Masinloc . The ships were not sent back.

Our source said, two weeks before the President's State of the Nation address, U.S. officials advised the DFA and Malacanang to tone down their anti-China rhetorics to reduce tension in the region. That explains why in last month’s SONA there was no mention, not a word, about conflict with China.

Last Aug. 2, Del Rosario, who never let any media opportunity to censure China pass, told members of the foreign correspondents association in the country, that he was not keen on guesting in their forum on the South China Sea because he was “looking for a modus vivendi with China.”

China should thank Uncle Sam."

""In the case of Syria, the chemical attack is a pretext... The Americans try to play with words and pretend that they've become involved in this case for humanitarian aims,"" Khamenei told a meeting of the Assembly of Experts, a state body.

""I believe the Americans are making mistakes in Syria and they have felt the impact and will certainly suffer loss,"" he said in the speech, whose text was published on his official website.

Khamenei's words indicate no let-up in Iran's considerable support for Syrian President Bashar al Assad, its closest ally who stands accused by Western powers of launching poison gas into an embattled suburb of Damascus on Aug. 21. Around 1,400 people were killed, according to U.S. officials.

On Wednesday, the head of Iran's elite Quds force, Qassem Soleimani, told the Assembly of Experts that the Islamic Republic would ""support Syria to the end"", according to the Fars news agency.

But Iran's response to the chemical attack in recent days hints at disagreement within the corridors of power.

In contrast to military commanders, the government of President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate, has condemned the use of chemical weapons and warned against military strikes in Syria, but not apportioned blame for the attack.

Assad's government has denied responsibility, blaming what it calls a provocation by Syrian rebel forces aimed at provoking foreign military intervention on their side in the two-and-a-half-year-old conflict.

The North gave no specifics about its evidence against Bae, saying only that his crimes were “clearly substantiated.” In November, Bae traveled in a small group to the North Korean port city of Rajin, a special economic zone that caters to foreign investors. There, he was arrested by authorities.

Bill Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, tried to negotiate Bae’s release during a trip to Pyongyang in January. But North Korean officials would not let Richardson meet with Bae, Richardson said — although they did reassure him that Bae’s health was good. They also told Richardson that Bae had been allowed to meet with members of the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang, which occasionally acts on behalf of the United States because Washington does not have diplomatic ties with the North.

In an interview with CNN after his trip, Richardson said Bae was being held “very far away from Pyongyang, in the northern part of the country.”

Since Richardson’s visit, tensions between North Korea and the United States have spiked. In February, the North detonated an underground nuclear weapon and then responded with fury to a new round of U.N. sanctions. It also threatened preemptive nuclear strikes against the United States and its allies in the region, including South Korea and Japan.

Washington has proposed talks with the North — but only if its leaders show signs that they want to denuclearize, something they have repeatedly said they will never do."

http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/05/09/political-science-hawking-rapped-for-israel-boycott/,2013-05-09 00:00:00,[],Political Science: Hawking rapped for Israel boycott,"Great minds don’t have to think alike, but they ought to be open to discussion, say critics of physicist Stephen Hawking, who is boycotting a major academic conference in Israel out of solidarity for Palestinians.

Hawking wrote a May 3 letter to Israeli President Shimon Peres saying he planned to respect a boycott of the June event because he considers the Israeli government’s policy toward the Palestinian territory a “disaster.” But Israel Maimon, chairman of the President’s Conference, called boycotting an academic event “outrageous and unwarranted.""



""Israel is a democracy in which everyone can voice their opinions, whatever they may be,” Maimon told the Jerusalem Post. “Boycotting is not compatible with open democratic dialogue.""

The decision by Hawking -- who uses a wheelchair due to motor neurone disease -- to skip the event, which Peres personally sponsors, was initially blamed on health reasons by Cambridge University, where the 71-year-old “A Brief History of Time” author has taught and studied.

But in his letter to Peres and event organizers, Hawking made clear he was boycotting over what he considers Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory.

“I accepted the invitation to the Presidential Conference with the intention that this would not only allow me to express my opinion on the prospects for a peace settlement, but also because it would allow me to lecture on the West Bank,” Hawking wrote. “However, I have received a number of emails from Palestinian academics. They are unanimous that I should respect the boycott. In view of this, I must withdraw from the conference. Had I attended, I would have stated my opinion that the policy of the present Israeli government is likely to lead to disaster.”

The Wolf Foundation, which gave Hawking its Wolf prize in physics in 1988, said it was “sad to learn that someone of Professor Hawking’s standing chose to capitulate to irrelevant pressures and will refrain from visiting Israel.”

However, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which seeks to pressure Israel on behalf of Palestinians, said in a statement it “deeply appreciated” Hawking’s decision."
http://news.yahoo.com/deal-struck-wider-un-inspections-iran-sites-101515310.html,,[],Deal struck on wider UN inspections of Iran sites,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran agreed Monday to offer more information and expanded access to U.N. nuclear inspectors — including more openings at a planned reactor and uranium site — even as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Iranian envoys had backed away from a wider deal seeking to ease Western concerns that Tehran could one day develop atomic weapons.

But Iran's foreign minister criticized Kerry's remarks, saying the American's ""conflicting statements"" damaged confidence in the process, adding that ""considerable progress was made"" in Geneva.

The flurry of announcements and comments showed both the complexities and urgency in trying to move ahead on an accord between Iran and world powers after overtime talks in Geneva failed to produce a deal that could curb Iran's uranium enrichment in exchange for a rollback in some U.S.-led economic sanctions.

With negotiators set to resume next week, Iranian officials promoted the pact reached with the U.N. nuclear chief Yukiya Amano as a ""roadmap"" for greater cooperation and transparency, which could move the talks ahead. But the plans do not mention some of the sites most sought by U.N. teams to probe suspicions of nuclear-related work, notably the Parchin military facility outside Tehran.

""It's an important step forward, but by no means the end of the process,"" Amano told The Associated Press in Tehran. ""There is still much work to be done.""

Western leaders, meanwhile, were keen to display a unified front after suggestions that France had broken ranks in Geneva and demanded more concessions from Iran on enrichment levels and an under-construction heavy water reactor that produced a greater amount of plutonium byproduct, which could be used in eventual weapons production. Kerry said it was Iran that put the brakes on reaching a first-phase agreement, but gave no details on the Iranian concerns and suggested it was only a matter of time before a formula is found.

""There was unity but Iran couldn't take it,"" Kerry said during a stop in Abu Dhabi. He added: ""The French signed off on it, we signed off on it.""

Story continues

Kerry told the BBC on Monday that negotiators had been ""very, very close ... extremely close"" to reaching a deal with Iran.

""I think we were separated by four or five different formulations of a particular concept,"" he said.

In the BBC interview, Kerry acknowledged ""the French have been more vocal about one thing or another."" But he said, ""the fact is that we had a unity on Saturday in a proposal put in front of the Iranians. But because of some the changes they felt they had to go back and change it.""

Later Monday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif criticized Kerry's remarks that blamed Iran for lack of a deal when asked about them on an Iranian TV talk show.

""Conflicting statements harm the credibility of the one who keeps changing positions and damages confidence. The goal of dialogue is to reduce the lack of trust. Conflicting talk doesn't give credit to the person saying it,"" Zarif said.

He said ""considerable progress"" was made during three days of talks in Geneva but claimed that most of the hours were spent with the U.S., Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany trying ""to resolve differences among themselves."" He said he's still hopeful a deal will be reached, but insisted any agreement must include the lifting of all Western sanctions against Iran.

British Foreign Secretary William Hague said the world powers presented a united front to Iran at the weekend talks that failed to reach an accord, and although ""some gaps"" remained between parties at the talks, ""most of those gaps are narrow.""

In Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has acknowledged that an overall deal is likely between Iran and world powers, which would undercut Israeli threats to launch military action against Iranian nuclear sites. Yet he hailed the delay as a chance to ""achieve a much better deal.""

""The target date for this deal is the date on which a good deal will be achieved that will deny Iran a military nuclear capability,"" he told Israel's parliament Monday.

For Netanyahu and his backers, however, hopes have all but evaporated that Iran can be forced by negotiators to completely end its ability to make nuclear fuel. It's now unclear what type of deal would satisfy Israel, which sees a nuclear-armed Iran as a threat to its existence.

Iran has categorically denied it seeks nuclear arms and insists its only seeks reactors for energy and medical applications. Iranian officials portrayed the expanded U.N. access as further sign it seeks to work with the West.

Under the plans, announced at a joint news conference, Iran would allow inspectors a first-time visit of its key Gachin uranium mine on the Gulf coast and give broader access to the heavy water facility being built in the central city of Arak. Heavy water reactors use a different type of coolant to produce a greater amount of plutonium byproduct than conventional reactors. Inspectors from the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, have already visited the reactor site but seek more extensive examinations.

Plutonium can be used in nuclear weapons production, but separating it from the reactor byproducts requires a special technology that Iran does not currently possess.

The new accord also calls on Iran to provide more details on its nuclear program including proposed new reactor sites and all planned research reactors. This is important because such facilities use 20 percent enriched uranium, which is the highest level acknowledged by Iran and a key aspect of the ongoing nuclear talks. Halting the 20 percent enrichment — which is several steps away from weapons-grade — is a key goal of Western envoys, for which they may offer Iran a possible easing of U.S.-led sanctions.

IAEA teams have combed Iran for years and have around-the-clock monitoring systems at main sites such as the Russian-built reactor at Bushehr on the Gulf coast and the biggest enrichment facility at Natanz in central Iran. Inspectors also have visited a once-secret enrichment lab, known as Fordo, built into a mountainside south of Tehran after it was disclosed in 2009.

But some areas remain off-limits despite repeated demands from the IAEA.

Chief among them is the Parchin military base outside Tehran, which has been visited by IAEA inspectors in the past. They have been blocked, however, from returning to investigate suspicions that explosive tests were carried out related to possible nuclear triggers. Iran denies the allegations, but has resisted opening the base.

It was unclear whether the openings made Monday would eventually extend to sites such as Parchin. Amano said it would be ""raised in subsequent"" meetings.

Iran's nuclear chief, Ali Akbar Salehi, said the pact is intended as ""a roadmap that clarifies the mutual steps required for resolving the outstanding issues"" — points repeatedly raised by President Hassan Rouhani since taking office in August.

A joint statement by Salehi and Amano said both sides seek to ""cooperate further ... to resolve all present and past issues."" The IAEA, in a nod to Iran's concerns, also agreed to protect confidential information regarding its nuclear program.

Officials opened door to direct talks if conditions are met

Gaining China%27s commitment%2C Kerry said%2C was no small matter

Concerns raised that North may deliver another provocation soon

TOKYO (AP) — The United States and Japan on Sunday offered new talks with North Korea to resolve the increasingly dangerous standoff over its nuclear and missile programs, but said the reclusive communist government first must lower tensions and honor previous agreements.

North Korea has a clear course of action available to it, and will find ""ready partners"" in the United States if it follows through, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters.

Japan's foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, who appeared with Kerry at a news conference, was more explicit, saying that North Korea must honor its commitment to earlier deals regarding its nuclear and missile programs and on returning kidnapped foreigners.

The officials agreed on the need to work toward a nuclear-free North Korea and opened the door to direct talks if certain conditions are met.

Their comments highlight the difficulty in resolving the North Korean nuclear situation in a peaceful manner, as pledged by Kerry and Chinese leaders in Beijing on Saturday.

Gaining China's commitment, Kerry insisted, was no small matter given Beijing's historically strong military and economic ties to North Korea.

The issue has taken on fresh urgency in recent months, given North Korea's tests of a nuclear device and intercontinental ballistic missile technology, and its increasingly brazen threats of nuclear strikes against the United States.

U.S. and South Korean officials believe the North may deliver another provocation in the coming days with a mid-range missile test.

""The question,"" Kerry said, ""is what steps do you take now so we are not simply repeating the cycle of the past years."" That was a clear reference to the various negotiated agreements and U.N. Security Council ultimatums that North Korea has violated since the 1990s.

""We have to be careful and thoughtful and frankly not lay out publicly all the options,"" Kerry said.

Given their proximity and decades of hostility and distrust, Japan and South Korea have the most to fear from the North's unpredictable actions.

Kerry said the U.S. would defend both its allies at all cost.

He also clarified a statement he made Saturday in Beijing, when he told reporters the U.S. could scale back its missile-defense posture in the region if North Korea goes nuclear-free.

It appeared to be a sweetener to coax tougher action from China, which has done little over the years to snuff out funding and support for North Korea's weapons of mass destruction program.

China fears the increased U.S. military presence in the region may be directed at it as well.

Kerry said America's basic force posture wasn't up to debate. ""There is no discussion that I know of to change that,"" he said.

But he said it was logical that additional missile-defense elements, including a land-based system for the Pacific territory of Guam, deployed because of the Korean threat could be reversed if that threat no longer existed.

""There's nothing actually on the table with respect to that. I was simply making an observation about the rationale for that particular deployment, which is to protect the United States' interests that are directly threatened by North Korea,"" Kerry said.

Kerry's visit to Japan followed two days of meetings in South Korea and China."

He Has Also Reported Iraq', 'The District']",U.S. needs millions more to complete Afghanistan’s ‘Pentagon’,"The Afghan “Pentagon” being built here is a sprawling symbol of U.S. generosity.

The American government has already spent about $107 million — double the initial estimate — on the five-story Defense Ministry headquarters, which will include state-of-the-art bunkers and the second-largest auditorium in Kabul.

But now, four years after the groundbreaking, construction crews have had to effectively halt their work. The reason: The U.S. government has run out of money for the project.

For years, audits and inspector general’s reports have documented waste and mismanagement in American aid projects in Afghanistan. But the Defense Ministry building is a dramatic example of how poor oversight continues to plague the massive U.S. investment here.

“Nobody was watching it like they should, and it’s just been an open checkbook,” said an American official involved in the management of the project, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the news media. “We failed, big time.”

The Afghan National Army sustained heavy casualties in the recent fighting season. But Post Kabul bureau chief Kevin Sieff says there's cautious optimism about the ANA's performance as the U.S. accelerates its troop reduction. (The Washington Post)

The 516,000-square-foot building is part of a multi-year, $9.3 billion construction spree aimed at providing hundreds of bases, outposts and hospitals for the Afghan military. Nearly all of it is financed by the U.S. government.

But even though most American troops are scheduled to withdraw from the country by late next year, 291 projects remain in the planning stages or under construction; 835 are complete.

The American-led military coalition is appealing to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to authorize an additional $24 million for the Afghan defense headquarters, already one of the costliest U.S-financed buildings in the country.

While awaiting the extra funding, officials have dispatched a skeleton crew to install windows to protect the building from the harsh Kabul winter.

“We have gotten ourselves into a position that we need to get out of, and we definitely need to fix it,” said Brig. Gen. Michael E. Wehr, the deputy chief of staff engineers for the U.S.-led coalition. “It’s an important building. It’s a Ministry of Defense headquarters. It’s in Kabul. We’ve got to get this done right.”

A pattern of setbacks

Since 2005, Congress has allocated about $53 billion to help equip, train, house and feed the 348,000 members of Afghanistan’s army and police force. But as that money has poured into Afghanistan, American military leaders have struggled to contain cost overruns and construction delays and to deal with ill-trained or corrupt contractors.

U.S. military officials say they have no evidence that the Afghan Defense Ministry project has been set back by missing or stolen funds. But military commanders have requested a U.S. Defense Department audit of the project.

They say the project was hampered by unrealistic cost projections, a poorly trained Afghan workforce, heavy snow in Kabul during the 2011-2012 winter and delays in getting materials into Afghanistan.

The project hit a snag before it even broke ground, said U.S. Col. Butch Graham, command engineer for Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan, the lead agency for distributing and overseeing coalition funds to the Afghan military.

Contractors had to clear the site by tearing down a dining hall for Afghan troops and rebuilding it elsewhere. But the contractor defaulted and had to be terminated, Graham said.

When construction finally began, security officials decided that work crews could not be housed on the site and had to stay at a camp miles away. That meant they had to spend time daily traveling to and from the construction site, located inside Kabul’s heavily fortified “green zone.”

A larger obstacle, however, was the delay in importing steel and other materials for the building, which is being constructed to withstand an 8.0-magnitude earthquake and will include space for 2,200 Afghan military officials and commanders.

Wehr said convoys were frequently idled at Afghanistan’s border with Pakistan. Truckers have to pay hefty customs fees, and border crossings are frequently closed because of security concerns, officials said.

Last year, The Washington Post reported that Afghan commanders were requesting features for the building that Pentagon officials viewed as too costly or unrealistic. Graham says U.S. officials have fended off most such requests but did agree to a 1,000-seat auditorium for large gatherings of military officials.

John F. Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, said the project’s woes fit a pattern of “poor planning, poor recordkeeping, poor oversight and poor security” amid a “rush to spend” U.S. tax dollars on the Afghan military.

Of particular concern, Sopko said, is that U.S. military commanders frequently rotate in and out of Afghanistan. U.S. officials familiar with the project say such turnover is partially to blame for the problems. Contractors repeatedly requested additional funds but did not receive a thorough vetting of their bills or performance, the officials said.

“That is a recipe for disaster,” Sopko said.

Projections and predictions

U.S. officials hope that the Defense Ministry headquarters will be completed late next year with the additional funds requested.

But Sopko’s office estimates that 47 planned Afghan military projects worth about $1.1 billion won’t be finished until at least 2015, leaving them vulnerable to rising tensions between the Obama administration and Afghan President Hamid Karzai.

Karzai recently stunned U.S. officials by announcing that he would delay signing a long-term bilateral security accord. If the agreement is not signed quickly, the administration has warned, President Obama may not keep up to 10,000 troops in Afghanistan after the formal U.S. combat mission ends late next year.

The pullout could mean that the Air Force Civil Engineer Center, which is overseeing the Defense Ministry headquarters, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers won’t be around to manage uncompleted projects.

If the accord isn’t completed, the Afghan military could lose $4.1 billion in annual direct assistance that the United States and its coalition partners have pledged through 2018.

During a meeting between Karzai and his national security council on Sunday, military leaders questioned whether the Defense Ministry headquarters and other U.S.-funded projects were being deliberately slowed to exert pressure on the Afghan president to sign the agreement, according to a senior Afghan official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Coalition officials strongly deny that assertion, and government documents show that the Defense Ministry project has been troubled for years.

When work began in 2009, the headquarters was scheduled to be completed in October 2010. That deadline was quickly extended, and the cost of the project had risen to $67 million by spring 2012. By earlier this year, it had ballooned to $108 million, with a Dec. 31 completion date.

In September, however, the project hit “funds exhaustion,” Graham said.

A spokesman for the prime contractor, Rhode Island-based Innovative Technical Solutions/Gilbane, declined to comment. But Mohammad Rafi, owner of a Kabul-based construction company, said he and other subcontractors were abruptly sent home in September and are still not clear why.

“We were just told, ‘They have to stop it,’ ” Rafi said, adding that he is still awaiting payment for a few invoices."
