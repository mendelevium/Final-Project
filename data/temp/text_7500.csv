The New York Times reported that a letter is going out to ""hundreds"" of top donors in New York, asking them to cut off contributions to the four Democrats who voted against the bill, which failed in the Senate earlier this year. The letters target Sens. Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), Mark Pryor (Ark.), Mark Begich (Alaska) and Max Baucus (Mont.). Pryor and Begich are up for reelection in 2014.

What effect the letter by the Republican-turned-independent mayor may have on Democratic donors is not yet clear. But it is another effort by Bloomberg to attach a political cost to voting against gun legislation -- something that the National Rifle Association has long done on the opposite side of the issue. It also marks an escalation between Bloomberg and national Democrats, who have worried that targeting vulnerable members of the party could backfire and lead to Republicans winning.

That worry has not deterred Bloomberg, whose group, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, spent $350,000 on an ad asking Pryor to reconsider his ""no"" vote on background checks. The Arkansas senator called the spot ""disgusting.""

The mayor brushed off the notion that his attack would lead to electing Republicans less in favor of his plan. ""The NRA has defined how you go about getting something done,"" he said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" Wednesday. ""You say ... I know your opponent may be worse. This is the issue. We're judging you, not judging your opponent. We'll deal with your opponent at a different time. We want you to vote this way. This is what's right for the country."""

He served as President Bill Clinton’s chief of staff from 1998 to 2001.

From Attorney General Eric Holder’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, we learned that the Obama administration is “struggling” with how to provide more information on its so-called targeted killing program; that senior officials have “talked about a greater need for transparency” about the program; and that we “will hear the president speak about this” in the future. After a limited document review by the Senate intelligence committee; a spirited 13-hour filibuster led by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.); and a last-minute admission by Holder that the president does not have the authority to use drones to kill a U.S. citizen on American soil who is not engaged in combat, the White House is still bobbing and weaving on whether to share with Congress the legal opinions and memorandums governing targeted killing, which include the legal justification for killing U.S. citizens without trial.

The Obama administration is wrong to withhold these documents from Congress and the American people. I say this as a former White House chief of staff who understands the instinct to keep sensitive information secret and out of public view. It is beyond dispute that some information must be closely held to protect national security and to engage in effective diplomacy, and that unauthorized disclosure can be extraordinarily harmful. But protecting technical means, human sources, operational details and intelligence methods cannot be an excuse for creating secret law to guide our institutions.

In refusing to release to Congress the rules and justifications governing a program that has conducted nearly 400 unmanned drone strikes and killed at least three Americans in the past four years, President Obama is ignoring the system of checks and balances that has governed our country from its earliest days. And in keeping this information from the American people, he is undermining the nation’s ability to be a leader on the world stage and is acting in opposition to the democratic principles we hold most important.

This is why I say, respectfully: Give them up, Mr. President.

Begin by fully sharing with the congressional committees that have jurisdiction all of the documents used by your administration to legally substantiate and govern the targeted killing program, including the justification for targeting U.S. citizens. The law that directs our government’s activities should not be kept secret.

All branches of the people’s government have the right to know the rules and standards under which the other branches act. Congress has the power to oversee the conduct of the executive branch, and lawmakers must be permitted to use it. As Woodrow Wilson wrote: “The informing function of Congress should be preferred even to its legislative function.” Appropriate congressional oversight is critical in building long-term credibility with the public across the political spectrum for the actions the administration undertakes in the people’s name.

This isn’t to say that the executive branch is obligated to disclose information on operational details or case-specific profiles that are, deservedly, highly classified. But that information can be redacted without undermining the public’s understanding of the legal justification on which the government’s actions are based.

The American people have the right to know the laws they live under. In addition to allowing Congress to properly fulfill its oversight duties, the administration should make available to the public the criteria justifying the targeted killing of Americans and the safeguards put in place to protect against wrongful death.

This level of transparency is important for our democracy and for governments around the globe. The United States is not the only country with drone technology. We are not the only country with the ability to deploy cyberweapons. We are not the only country grappling with how to apply the rule of law — and the laws of war — when the nature of conflict has changed dramatically, and in a short time.

But we cannot lead if the American people are kept in the dark. We cannot lead if the world does not know the principles and laws that guide us, or if others can credibly say that our commitment to a government of the people, by the people and for the people is simply window-dressing, or that we sacrifice our constitutional principles when it is expedient.

James Madison said that “a popular government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or tragedy; or, perhaps, both.”

He Previously Wrote About The Russia Investigation.']",Calderon says investigation is payback,"SACRAMENTO — State Sen. Ronald S. Calderon, who is being investigated by the FBI on suspicion that he accepted bribes, accused federal authorities Wednesday of trying to smear him for refusing to wear a wire in a sting operation against two other senators.

In a motion filed in federal court in Sacramento, Calderon (D-Montebello) says authorities from the FBI and the U.S attorney’s office repeatedly asked him to participate in an investigation of Senate leader Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento) and Sen. Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles).

He was asked to wear a wire to secretly record conversations with them, the filing says.

Calderon declined and “refused to continue participating in the FBI’s sting operation,” the motion says. It is not clear what, if any, assistance Calderon had provided.

Federal agents raided the senator’s office in June. Last month, a 124-page, sealed FBI affidavit detailing bribery allegations against Calderon was posted on a media website. Calderon’s court filing accuses the authorities of leaking the document.

Calderon has not been charged with any crime and has denied the allegations, which include accepting $60,000 from an undercover FBI agent posing as a film studio executive and $28,000 from a Long Beach hospital executive in exchange for efforts to influence legislation.

Leaking the affidavit broke the law, Calderon’s motion asserts, and federal authorities should be held in contempt of court. The document was illegally released to the media “in an effort to defame and retaliate against Senator Calderon for not cooperating in its ‘sting’ operation,” the filing says.

Mark Geragos, Calderon’s attorney, said federal authorities have been “targeting the entire state Senate. When they realized they didn’t have anything, that’s why they engaged in payback.”

Included in the court filing is a copy of a receipt that Geragos said was signed by a federal official the week after the office raid, when Calderon returned wire equipment that investigators had given him.

Lauren Horwood, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Sacramento, declined to comment Wednesday. The Department of Justice is reviewing the source of the leak, according to a previous statement from Laura Eimiller, a spokeswoman for the FBI in Los Angeles.

Eimiller declined to comment Wednesday.

Calderon’s court filing is the latest development in a corruption investigation that has rocked the Capitol, and its assertions were quickly disputed by Steinberg, the Senate leader, who issued a statement calling it “pure fantasy.”

His spokesman, Mark Hedlund, said the Senate leader has been informed by federal authorities that he is not a target of the investigation.

Dan Reeves, chief of staff for De Leon, declined to comment Wednesday. De Leon recently released a letter from a federal prosecutor in Los Angeles saying “he is a witness, as opposed to a subject or a target” in the investigation involving Calderon.

Calderon’s motion came a day after Steinberg and other senators stripped him of his committee posts. He lost six assignments, including his position as chairman of the Senate Insurance Committee.

Steinberg said the allegations against Calderon “are serious enough to potentially cloud any interaction the senator might have with colleagues, advocates and the public on issues within a committee’s jurisdiction.”

In addition, Calderon is being pressured to resign by Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia (D-Bell Gardens) and local leaders in his district. At a news conference Wednesday, they said the investigation of Calderon has hurt their efforts to regain voters’ trust after a series of corruption scandals in the area.

“The public must be able to trust their elected officials,” Garcia said. “Everyday I’m hearing from them: ‘We don’t trust you.’ This is sucking the air out of everything we do.”

Gil Hurtado, mayor of South Gate, complained that the investigation particularly hurts Latino officials.

“We are getting judged based on this,” he said.

In a statement Wednesday, Calderon suggested that the call for his resignation was politically motivated. He took aim at Garcia, who organized the news conference and who some believe may be interested in running for Calderon’s Senate seat.

“Without knowing the full story and waiting to hear all the facts in this case, she has assumed the role of judge and jury by calling for my resignation,” Calderon said. “What has happened to me could happen to anyone in public office.”

""This just smells and I hope this committee gets to the bottom of it,"" John Eastman, chairman of the National Organization for Marriage, said at a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee.

Eastman testified Tuesday alongside several Tea Party activists who all claim they were targeted by the IRS. The Tea Party groups offered a first-hand account of how the IRS singled them out when they applied for tax-exempt status, asking them onerous questions and dragging out their application process.

But Eastman shed light on another potential controversy involving the IRS -- the unauthorized disclosure of tax document information. He recalled how information on their donors was leaked last year and published on the website of the Human Rights Campaign, which Eastman described as their ""principal political opponent"" on the marriage issue. The documents showed Mitt Romney's political committee as a donor.

Asked by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., if he had ""proof"" that the IRS leaked that material, Eastman said that he did.

More On This...

Eastman explained that while some information was redacted in the posted version, his group's ""forensic"" specialists were able to strip layers from the document and found ""the original document that was posted there had originated from within the IRS.""

He said the version had ""internal IRS stamps,"" which ""only exist within the IRS.""

Eastman added: ""You can imagine our shock and disgust over this. ... We jealously guard our donors.""

He later alleged the information was ""deliberately"" provided to their opponents.

""If that's inadvertent, the word no longer means anything,"" he said, claiming his group has been ""stonewalled"" in its request for an investigation.

After a series of hearings on Capitol Hill where current and former IRS officials testified on the agency's actions, this is the first to feature alleged victims.

Karen Kinney, with the San Fernando Valley Patriots, described how she got a form from the IRS with 35 items divided into 80 ""sub-points of inquiry,"" and was given just 20 days to comply.

The leader of a small South Carolina Tea Party group said her organization first applied for tax-exempt status in 2010 -- and is still waiting for the application to be processed.

Dianne Belsom, president of the Laurens County Tea Party, said her group in rural South Carolina has about 60 members.

For more than 18 months during the 2010 and 2012 election campaigns, IRS agents in a Cincinnati office singled out Tea Party and other conservative groups for additional scrutiny when they sought tax-exempt status, according to a report by J. Russell George, the Treasury Department inspector general for tax administration.

The report said Tea Party groups were asked inappropriate questions about their donors, their political affiliations and their positions on political issues. The additional scrutiny delayed applications for an average of nearly two years, making it difficult for many of the groups to raise money.

During a joint press conference with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, President Obama called for an investigation into the IRS, saying, “We’ve got to make sure that it is doing its job scrupulously.” (Sandi Moynihan/The Washington Post)

Senior lawmakers investigating what went wrong at the Internal Revenue Service are planning to focus on whether IRS officials misled Congress about a policy that targeted conservative groups for extra screening when seeking a tax exemption, congressional aides say.

With the first high-profile hearing on the topic set to begin Friday morning, congressional aides say lawmakers in both chambers will seek answers about why they weren’t told that the IRS had singled out conservative groups for scrutiny despite multiple inquiries in recent years.

“I’m not an unreasonable guy, but hiding what happened to Congress is inexcusable and how this was allowed to happen must be answered,” Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (Utah), the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said through a spokeswoman Thursday.

The questions from lawmakers come amid a rising furor over the IRS’s unfair treatment of conservative groups during an 18-month period that ended in early 2012, spawning FBI and Justice Department criminal investigations in addition to at least four congressional probes.

This week, President Obama demanded the resignation of acting IRS commissioner Steven T. Miller, replacing him Thursday with budget official Daniel Werfel, a veteran of Republican and Democratic administrations. Also on Thursday, Joseph Grant, commissioner of the agency’s tax exempt/government entities divisions, announced that he would soon retire.

The Friday hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees the IRS, will be the first of several sessions in coming weeks where lawmakers will grill current and former officials about the IRS’s screening practices.

Tea party organizations and other conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status increasingly complained in recent years that they were receiving overly detailed questionnaires from the IRS and facing long delays.

Republican officials wrote letters and held public and private briefings with top IRS officials demanding to know whether the IRS was giving extra scrutiny to conservative groups. Each time, agency officials said no.

But a report by the Treasury inspector general for tax administration said senior agency officials became aware of what was happening more than a year ago, raising questions about whether IRS officials had been forthcoming with Congress.

For example, in May 2012, according to congressional aides briefed by the IRS and inspector general, Miller learned that targeting had been occurring. But in September, he sent a response to GOP senators asking questions that did not acknowledge the screening.

Lawmakers now say those statements and others from IRS officials will be a core focus of the inquiry, with multiple congressional committees investigating the matter. Miller is scheduled to testify Friday along with Inspector General J. Russell George, who conducted the audit on screening practices released this week.

What the IRS told Congress could also be part of criminal inquiries. In testimony on Wednesday, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said one possibility that investigators will explore is whether “false statements” were made in the IRS case.

The House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee and Senate Finance Committee also plan their own hearings next week. The House oversight panel is focusing on disclosures by Lois Lerner, the direct supervisor of the tax-exempt unit.

In a letter to Lerner this week, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), the committee’s chairman, wrote: “We are concerned that information you have provided to the committee related to this matter on prior occasions was false or misleading.”

IRS officials did not respond to a request for comment late Thursday.

Lew’s financial disclosure forms, filed in 2009 and 2011, showed that Lew had invested between $50,000 and $100,000 in a fund called Citigroup Venture Capital International Growth Partnership (Employee) II, L.P. -- the very type of fund President Obama has repeatedly criticized.

The fund is an international venture capital fund for employees of Citigroup. According to his official White House biography, Lew served as managing director and chief operating officer of Citi Global Wealth Management and then Citi Alternative Investments (CAI) from 2006 to 2008.

Lew himself isn't commenting, but a person familiar with Lew’s investment told NBC News that Lew invested a total of $56,000 and sold it at a loss for $54,418 in November 2010 after being confirmed as director of the federal Office of Management and Budget.

The source also told NBC News that Lew had no role in creating, managing or operating the fund, and that Citigroup had organized the fund in the Cayman Islands and made it available to other employees. The source said that many other Citigroup employees had investments in the fund.

According to a Securities and Exchange Commission document, the fund was registered at what has been called a notorious address in the Cayman Islands, located in the Caribbean in the British West Indies. Specifically, the fund’s address was a post office box in a building called Ugland House, in the capital city of George Town on Grand Cayman, the largest of the three Cayman islands.

In 2007 as a presidential candidate and in 2009 as president, Obama identified Ugland House as part of an outrageous tax scam, because according to filings, it housed 12,000 businesses that all claimed the building as their headquarters.

“For years, we've talked about shutting down overseas tax havens that let companies set up operations to avoid paying taxes in America,” Obama said in remarks about tax reform in 2009. “Either this is the largest building in the world, or the largest tax scam in the world. And I think the American people know which it is. That's the kind of tax scam that we need to end.”

A political ad targeting Republican candidate Mitt Romney during the 2012 presidential campaign asked, “Why would Mitt Romney invest millions in the Cayman Islands?”

Tonight, after NBC News asked for comment, White House spokesman Eric Schultz issued a lengthy statement:

“Jack Lew paid all of his taxes and reported all of the income, gains and losses from the investment on his tax returns. The existence of Mr. Lew’s investment is not news to the Senate.

“Mr. Lew disclosed the investment in his prior confirmations, before three separate committees, for Deputy Secretary of State in 2009 and Director of the Office of Management and Budget in 2010, and he was confirmed by the Senate unanimously on both occasions.

“Twelve Members of the Finance Committee, including five Republicans, were members of the three committees that previously reviewed Mr. Lew’s nominations. All three committees reported Mr. Lew’s nomination to the Senate unanimously.

“Mr. Lew disclosed the investment to the Office of Government Ethics and to ethics officials at the State Department and OMB, including on his public financial disclosure forms, in connection with both of his previous confirmations. He played no role in creating, managing or operating the fund and he sold his investment in 2010 at a net loss.

“There are no new facts that provide a basis for Senators to reach a different conclusion about Mr. Lew’s nomination than they reached twice before in this Administration.”

A Democratic spokesman for the Senate Finance Committee, which will hold a confirmation hearing on Lew’s nomination on Wednesday, said that Lew’s investment had come up again through its current vetting process, raised by both Republican and Democrat members. The spokesman said once the committee had looked into the matter, it had determined the investment was not an issue. The spokesman said Lew had been completely transparent and forthcoming through any and all questions that have been posed.

But Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, a Republican member of the Senate Finance Committee, disputed the Obama administration’s and the Democratic committee spokesman’s statements.

“It was disclosed only if you knew where to look and then were able to put the pieces together,” Grassley said in a statement late Friday. “To say this information was fully disclosed to the public is misleading, at best.”

Grassley noted Obama’s criticism of Ugland House-based investment funds came while Lew, now his Treasury Secretary nominee, had investments in one of those funds. Lew didn’t divest his Cayman Island investment until almost the end of 2010, when he was already working for the administration, and a year after the president publicly railed against such offshore accounts as tax havens.

“The irony is thick,” Grassley said.

The Pentagon sent out an email suggesting the Apr. 23 meeting with Weinstein in the Pentagon was a one-time event, saying only, “Weinstein requested, and was granted, a meeting at the Pentagon [on] April 23, with the Air Force Judge Advocate General and others, to include the Deputy Chief of Chaplains, to express his concerns of religious issues in the military.”

However, this was not a single meeting. Instead it was part of a relationship that began one month after Barack Obama was sworn in as president. And it goes much higher up the military food chain than was reported last week: Weinstein met with a four-star general who was the highest-ranking officer in the United States Air Force.

The New York Times reported on Mar. 1, 2009, in a story entitled, “Questions Raised Anew About Religion in Military,” that Weinstein met with the Air Force Chief of Staff, Gen. Norton Schwarz, on Feb. 24, 2009. The story noted this was the first time Weinstein and his Military Religious Freedom Foundation (MRFF) had “gotten an audience with a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.”

Weinstein had sued the Defense Department during the Bush administration as part of his anti-Christian crusade, so Pentagon top brass knew exactly who he was and what he was about when the new Obama administration met with him in 2009. This means he had been fully-vetted when the Obama-Hagel Defense Department decided to meet with him again on Apr. 23, 2013, to discuss how to stop evangelizing (that is, Christian proselytizing) within the military.

The Bush administration had fought Weinstein, saying that any instances of senior officers pressuring subordinates on religious matters were “not systematic problems, but isolated instances.” And biblical Christians fully object to any coercion, since evangelism is about people embracing the Christian faith wholeheartedly and sincerely, which no person could ever force upon another. It’s a matter of the heart, between every human being and their creator.

By contrast, while the Bush administration fought Weinstein, the Obama administration has embraced this anti-Christian activist.

The NYT story gives a laundry list of Weinstein and MRFF’s grievances against the Defense Department during the Bush administration, including a, “ceremony that began and ended with a Christian prayer…the appearance of uniformed officers at religious events, [and] displays of crucifixes at military chapels…”.

The story indicates that “Christian prayers” are prayers offered “in Jesus’ name.” It goes without saying that whenever anyone prays, they pray according to their own religious faith. (For example, you’re not likely to find a Muslim imam offering a Jewish prayer.) It’s just as common to hear a Christian mention Jesus in a prayer as it is to find a Muslim invoking the name of Mohammed.

It’s also no surprise that troops might be wearing their uniforms when they attend church services. Again, the Constitution does not forbid such things, since those troops have the right to peacefully practice and express their personal faith just like any other American.

But the fact that Weinstein has become an unpaid advisor to the Obama-Hagel Pentagon is evidence of how hostile an environment parts of the Defense Department are becoming to Christian service members under this administration, and possibly devout adherents of other peaceful faiths as well.

Article I of the Constitution empowers Congress to set the rules of conduct and discipline within the military, and Congress must do so now to protect the rights of our troops to live and share their faith.

Weiner campaign manager Danny Kedem, 31, called it quits after days of punishing press for his boss.

“You know, we have an amazing staff, but this isn’t about the people working on the campaign,” Weiner told reporters Sunday after news broke of Kedem’s resignation.

Staff turnover is common for many high-profile political campaigns that hit the rocks, but Weiner’s struggles have stood apart.

Weiner had entered the mayoral race warning that more instances of his past sexual behavior might go public, but he struggled mightily Tuesday when a young woman told a website that she’d received sexual texts from Weiner long after he quit Congress over the same issue in June 2011.

Despite the public support of his wife, Huma Abedin, who addressed reporters alongside her husband when the allegations broke, questions about the extent of Weiner’s extramarital proclivities continued to dog him over the week.

On Thursday, after the young woman came forward, Weiner, 48, was unable to definitively answer exactly how many women he’d digitally flirted with after resigning from Congress. “I don’t believe I had any more than three,” he told reporters.

Sydney Leathers, 23, told “Inside Edition” that she and Weiner began corresponding in July 2012 -- about 13 months after he resigned from Congress.

Weiner has lost not just his campaign manager, but the polling lead that he had held. In the most recent NBC 4 New York/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll, Weiner’s unfavorability rating among New York Democrats rocketed to 55% after registering just 36% in June.

Weiner now trails Democratic rival and City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, 25% to 16%, for the party’s nomination. On Sunday, Quinn didn’t mind a dig at Weiner over the issue, which local media has dubbed “Weinergate.”

“That’s an answer he has to give New Yorkers, but I think clearly we’ve seen a pattern of reckless behavior and an inability to tell the truth,” Quinn told CBS2 in New York.

Also piling on was Republican candidate John Catsimatidis, who was far more blunt when addressing local media Sunday: “It’s over. I think he should just resign or just go away, take care of his family, and move on.”

Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., was among the Democrats who sharply questioned Holder Wednesday on the controversy. She questioned why and how Holder was able to recuse himself from that case, and said it appears the department's actions ""have, in fact, impaired the First Amendment.""

""Reporters who might have previously believed that a confidential source would speak to them would no longer have that level of confidence, because those confidential sources are now going to be chilled in their relationship with the press,"" she said.

The toughest criticism of Holder is still coming from Republicans. To date, Holder has fended off a succession of Republican-led efforts to oust him. At the hearing Wednesday, he dismissed a recent call from the GOP chairman for his resignation as ill-informed.

And on Thursday, President Obama backed up his long-time ally.

""I have complete confidence in Eric Holder as attorney general,"" he said at a press conference, defending the importance of leak investigations as well as press freedom. Obama added that he would make ""no apologies"" on the issue of pursuing leaks.

But the volume of Democratic complaints may be rising.

Liberal radio host Bill Press took the left's criticism to a new level Thursday when he publicly called for Holder to be forced out.

On his Twitter account, Press wrote: ""What 'breach of national security' are we talking about re the AP story? It's BS and Holder should be fired.""

Making clear the tweet wasn't just a slip of the keyboard, he then wrote: ""I'll repeat what I said earlier. POTUS should fire Eric Holder.""

""POTUS"" is shorthand for the president.

Democratic lawmakers have stopped short of calling for Holder's resignation, but have pressed him for answers on why the department found it necessary to go around the back of AP bosses and obtain their phone records -- which was done as part of an investigation into sensitive intelligence leaks.

Holder, in defending the records grab, has called the leak one of the most serious he's ever seen, while noting that he recused himself from the case and his deputy is actually the one leading the investigation.

Other Democrats have been more defensive of Holder, and suggested the latest controversy would be used for partisan purposes. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said it was Republicans who demanded the leak investigation in the first place.

""Now, of course, it is convenient to attack the attorney general for being too aggressive or the Justice Department for being too aggressive,"" he said.

Holder similarly went after Republicans for their scrutiny on Wednesday. He lashed out at Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., after he accused Holder of purposely and repeatedly keeping information from Congress.

""No, that's what you typically do,"" Holder responded. Following crosstalk, Holder added, ""That is inappropriate and is too consistent with the way in which you conduct yourself as a member of Congress. It's unacceptable and it's shameful.""

Issa led the charge in Congress against Holder and his department over the botched Operation Fast and Furious anti-gun-trafficking program. Republicans eventually voted to hold him in contempt of Congress over resistance to providing certain documents pertaining to that case.

But Holder had since been able to keep his head down -- until the Associated Press revealed this week that Justice had secretly sought its phone records.

Prominent Democrats swiftly joined Republicans in questioning whether that step was necessary.

""The burden is always on the government when they go after private information -- especially information regarding the press or its confidential sources. I want to know more about this case, but on the face of it, I am concerned that the government may not have met that burden,"" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said Monday."

In 2009, Mr. Obama proudly declared that his Cash for Clunkers program, officially known as the Car Allowance Rebate System (CARS), was a stunning success. “There were skeptics who weren’t sure that this ‘Cash for Clunkers’ program would work,” said Mr. Obama. “But I’m happy to report that it has succeeded well beyond our expectations and all expectations, and we’re already seeing a dramatic increase in showroom traffic at local car dealers…So I’m very pleased with the progress that’s been made in the House today on the “Cash for Clunkers” program.”

But as Yahoo News notes, the program’s decision to shred, not recycle, many of the trade-in vehicles unleashed an “environmental nightmare”:

Shredding vehicles results in its own environmental nightmare. For each ton of metal produced by a shredding facility, roughly 500 pounds of “shredding residue” is also produced, which includes polyurethane foams, metal oxides, glass and dirt. All totaled, about 4.5 million tons of that residue is already produced on average every year. Where does it go? Right into a landfill. E Magazine states recycling just the plastic and metal alone from the CARS scraps would have saved 24 million barrels of oil. While some of the “Clunkers” were truly old, many of the almost 700,000 cars were still in perfectly good condition. In fact, many that qualified for the program were relatively “young,” with fuel efficiencies that rivaled newer cars.

A study conducted by Resources for the Future further underscored the program’s failure economically and environmentally:

Approximately 45 percent of the spending went to consumers who would have purchased a new vehicle anyway. Our results suggest no gain in sales beyond 2009 and hence no meaningful stimulus to the economy. In addition, the program will reduce CO2 emissions by only 9 to 28.4 million tons, implying a cost per ton ranging from $91 to $288 even after accounting for reduced criteria pollutants.

And E–The Environmental Magazine says the Department of Transportation’s declaration that Cash for Clunkers was a success is simply a case of smoke and mirrors:

The Department of Transportation reported that Cash for Clunkers was an environmental success…In general, drivers traded in inefficient SUVs and trucks for more efficient passenger cars. However, it’s quite easy to negate this small difference in gas mileage purely by the fact that people will be more likely to drive a vehicle that takes less money to fill up with gas. It’s an efficiency paradox: as we get more efficient at using energy, the overall cost of energy goes down, but we respond by using more of it. Auto emissions of carbon dioxide are directly proportional to gasoline consumed. With only 690,000 fuel-efficient vehicles purchased and over 250 million cars registered in the U.S., that is a negligible difference in overall greenhouse gas emissions.

As the Washington Post even conceded, Mr. Obama’s Cash for Clunkers scheme was an economic and environmental failure: “So were the naysayers right?” asked the Post. “It seems so.”"

Updated at 2:35 p.m. ET on Friday 5/31



(CNN) – In the early days of President Barack Obama's sweeping new health care law, Douglas Shulman, then the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, was cleared to visit the White House 157 times over three years, official visitor logs show.

More than 50 of Douglas Shulman's scheduled visits are described as ""health care meetings"" or ""health care reform meetings,"" according to the visitor logs. Arrival times are only listed for 11 of his visits, and it's not unusual for a person to appear on the visitor logs - which are derived from Secret Service clearance lists - without actually having visited the White House. The majority of the visits were set to be held in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which houses office suites for administration aides.



The IRS, which has come under fire for its admitted targeting of conservative groups applying to become tax exempt, is responsible for enforcing many of the new rules associated with Obamacare, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010.

Official White House visitor logs show Shulman's scheduled White House visits came between October 2009 and December 2012. Shulman was appointed by President Bush in 2008 and left the post in November 2012. On Fox News Thursday, Shulman's predecessor Mark Everson stated he'd only visited the White House once during his tenure as IRS commissioner, though visitor logs for the Bush administration aren't available publically online.

According to an inspector general report from earlier this May, March 2010 was the month IRS agents began filtering applications for tax-exempt status using the words ""tea party"" and ""patriot."" The agency experienced a flood of new applications after the Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United case that opened the door to increased corporate and private political spending.

Of Shulman's meetings recorded in the visitor logs, 40 listed his ""visitee"" as Nancy Ann DeParle, who acted as the director of the White House Office of Health Reform until 2011, when she moved into the role of deputy chief of staff for policy. Fifty-four visit records list Sarah Fenn as Shulman's ""visitee."" Fenn is listed as a staff assistant in 2010 White House salary records. In 2011 she's described as ""assistant counsel of ethics.""

Five visits listed Obama as the ""visitee.""

The president's health care law created a massive new workload for the IRS, which is charged with issuing and enforcing rules related to Obamacare. The agency's tasks include collecting information for employers and insurers; figuring out who qualified for subsidies or Medicaid, determining who must pay a penalty for not obtaining insurance, and penalizing employers that don't provide affordable coverage to their employees.

""Tax provisions included in the Affordable Care Act represent the largest set of tax law changes the IRS has had to implement in more than 20 years,"" the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration noted in a recent report.

The ACA has some 500 provisions, and more than 40 amend or add provisions to the tax code, according to the report.

In congressional testimony earlier this month, Shulman was quizzed on his visits to the White House. He attributed one visit to taking his children to the annual Easter egg roll hosted by the president and first lady, but said at no point did he talk to anyone at the White House about the agency's tax exempt rules. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney backed up that claim last week, saying ""An IRS commissioner appropriately has - or his designees have - meetings on matters of policy all the time, but not discussions about enforcement or applications for tax exempt status.""

Speaking in separate testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, Shulman said that he was aware of some aspects of his agency's targeting of conservative groups in the spring of 2012, and took what he called the correct action of ensuring the situation would be independently reviewed.

But he denied full awareness of what was happening at the time, saying subordinates failed to inform him of the details.

Top White House officials say they knew nothing of the targeting when it occurred. General Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler learned of the pending inspector general's report on April 24, 2013, according to Carney. She later informed other top Obama aides, including chief of staff Denis McDonough.

Carney insisted no one - including Ruemmler and McDonough - told Obama anything about the inspector general's pending report before media reports about it began appearing on May 10.

Raul Labrador (R-ID) suggested during a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday.

Holder said he was not involved in the secret collection of AP phone records because he had recused himself from the investigation which led to the seizure. The Department of Justice hoped to find the source of leaked confidential information, and Holder claims he recused himself because he had access to that information and therefore was a suspect.

“[I] have heard you several times talk about ‘best practices and proprieties.'” Labrador said during his questioning of Holder. “When you decided to recuse yourself, did you look at best practices? I think you admitted already it would have been a better practice for you to put it in writing.”

Labrador then cited federal law, specifically 28 USC § 591, and noted that it requires the Attorney General to put a recusal in writing in “certain circumstances.”

“Frankly, I’ve read it a couple times, I don’t know if it applies to your situation right now, but don’t you think it would have been the best practice for you to just put it in writing especially on an issue of such significance?” Labrador asked.

Holder answered that he would consider putting recusals in writing in the future.

Federal law requires that the U.S. Attorney General sign off on the type of subpoena used in situations such as the AP investigation, but Holder claimed that when he recused himself, that responsibility fell to Deputy Attorney General James Cole. Asked directly if he put his recusal in writing, Holder said no. He claimed he only informed Cole of the decision.

The law that Labrador cited notes that when the Attorney General decides his recusal is necessary, he must put such a determination in writing. The exact text of that section of law is as follows:

“Recusal of Attorney General.– (1) When recusal is required.– (A) If information received under this chapter involves the Attorney General, the next most senior official in the Department of Justice who is not also recused shall perform the duties assigned under this chapter to the Attorney General. (B) If information received under this chapter involves a person with whom the Attorney General has a personal or financial relationship, the Attorney General shall recuse himself or herself by designating the next most senior official in the Department of Justice who is not also recused to perform the duties assigned under this chapter to the Attorney General. (2) Requirements for recusal determination.– Before personally making any other determination under this chapter with respect to information received under this chapter, the Attorney General shall determine under paragraph (1)(B) whether recusal is necessary. The Attorney General shall set forth this determination in writing, identify the facts considered by the Attorney General, and set forth the reasons for the recusal. The Attorney General shall file this determination with any notification or application submitted to the division of the court under this chapter with respect to such information. “

A Department of Justice spokeswoman has not immediately responded to Breitbart News in response to Labrador’s line of questioning."

Appearing before the House Judiciary Committee on May 15, Holder insisted that ""the potential prosecution of the press for the disclosure of material"" is not something he was involved in or knew about.

But days later, it emerged that the Justice Department obtained access to the emails of Fox News reporter James Rosen -- after filing an affidavit that accused him of being a likely criminal ""co-conspirator"" in the leak of sensitive material regarding North Korea.

Rosen was never charged, and never prosecuted. But he was effectively accused of violating the federal Espionage Act.

Asked about potential problems with Holder's testimony, a House Judiciary Committee aide told FoxNews.com that the committee is ""further investigating this matter."" The committee later clarified they are ""looking into"" Holder's testimony.

J. Christian Adams, a former Justice Department attorney who in recent years has emerged as a prominent conservative critic of his former employer, said Tuesday that Holder seems to have misled Congress.

""Holder said it's not something I'm involved with, don't know anything about it -- he lied on both counts,"" Adams told Fox News.

The top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, Michigan Rep. John Conyers, said Tuesday, though, he thinks Holder ""was forthright and did not mislead the Committee.""

""Certainly, there are policy disagreements as to how the First Amendment should apply to these series of leak investigations being conducted by the Justice Department, and that is and should be an area for the Committee to consider. However, there is no need to turn a policy disagreement into allegations of misconduct,"" he said.

For his part, Holder is planning to open a review of the department's policies on investigations involving journalists. This includes a discussion with representatives from the media. Holder said Tuesday he hopes to have the meeting this week.

""I'm not satisfied,"" he said, when asked whether he had regrets about the course of the investigations so far.

Holder addressed the leak probes during a House hearing two weeks ago, under questioning by Democratic Georgia Rep. Hank Johnson. Johnson voiced concern that the Espionage Act of 1917 allows the prosecution of anyone who discloses classified information.

He said: ""But we certainly need to protect the privacy of individuals, and we need to protect the ability ... of the press to engage in its First Amendment responsibilities to be free and to give us information about our government so as to keep the people informed.""

Holder answered: ""Well, I would say this. With regard to the potential prosecution of the press for the disclosure of material, that is not something that I've ever been involved in, heard of or would think would be a wise policy. In fact, my view is quite the opposite.""

At the time, Johnson was referencing reports that the Justice Department secretly obtained the phone records of Associated Press journalists.

A few days later, it would emerge that the Justice Department in 2010 also sought the private emails from Rosen's account, as part of a case against accused leaker Stephen Jin-Woo Kim. An FBI agent cited the Espionage Act in seeking those documents.

And on Friday, the Justice Department acknowledged that Holder was looped in on the decision-making in that case.

""The Department takes seriously the First Amendment right to freedom of the press. In recognition of this, the department took great care in deciding that a search warrant was necessary in the Kim matter, vetting the decision at the highest levels of the department, including discussions with the attorney general,"" the department said.

Jesselyn Radack, an attorney who works with the Government Accountability Project and has represented accused leakers, told FoxNews.com that Holder's statement to the House committee was ""at best hypocritical and at worst perjury.""

Holder, though, could argue that, in fact, Rosen was never prosecuted -- and so his testimony was not misleading.

A federal law enforcement official said last week that the department had to establish probable cause in the affidavit in order to obtain the search warrant, per the terms of the Privacy Protection Act.

""Saying that there is probable cause to believe that someone has committed a crime and actually charging the person with that crime are two very different things,"" the official said. ""No reporter has been charged in this case. And, at this time, we do not anticipate bringing additional charges against anyone in this matter.""

Karl Rove, former adviser to George W. Bush and a Fox News analyst, argued in a FoxNews.com opinion piece last week that, at the least, Holder has ""a lot of explaining to do to Congress.""

Meanwhile, there are conflicting accounts involving a Justice Department claim that it notified Fox News' parent company, News Corp., of the investigation. Lawrence ""Lon"" Jacobs, News Corp.'s general counsel at the time, said they never got the apparent fax from the Justice Department that contained the information about Rosen.

""If the Justice Department wanted Fox to be advised, I think they would have sent the notification to Fox News, not News Corp.,"" he said. ""I don't know what fax number it went to, but if it was faxed to my office it would have been received by my assistant and she would have notified me.""

He said he would have notified Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes had he received it.

USA TODAY

After a bruising week in Washington%2C President Obama headed to Baltimore on Friday

Obama delivered a speech on the economy at a dredging manufacturer and visited a school

Obama says he is trying to keep his focus on the middle class

BALTIMORE—After a week of playing defense on a trio of scandals, President Obama escaped Washington on Friday in an attempt to turn attention back to his economic agenda.

While the House Ways and Means Committee spent the morning grilling ousted IRS acting commissioner Steven Miller about the agency's targeting of Tea Party and conservative non-profit groups, Obama spent his day in Charm City.

He started the day in Baltimore with a visit to an early education program to highlight his call for Congress to fund pre-kindergarten for low- and moderate-income families. He then visited a dredging manufacturer on the outskirts of this city to highlight his economic agenda and later planned to visit a local community center.

""I don't want to interrupt the studying,"" Obama said on Monday after walking in on the pre-kindergarten class at Moravia Park Elementary. ""So I'm going to grab this chair right here. Come on. Let's focus.""

He spent his time in classroom quizzing the children on their addition and subtraction skills and drawing pictures of animals with the class.

""I got to say my tiger was not very good,"" Obama said later. ""The kids were unimpressed.""

The light moment for the president comes at the end of a bruising week for him and his administration.

In addition to the IRS controversy, Obama has come under fire from Republicans in recent days after the release of internal e-mails showed that his senior aides and State Department officials edited out references to terrorism in early ""talking points"" put out by the administration following last year's terrorist attack on a U.S. facility in Benghazi, Libya.

The Obama administration has also been battling with the fallout of the revelation from earlier this week that the Justice Department secretly subpoenaed phone records of Associated Press journalists as part a probe into the leak of classified information.

Despite the wave of bad news for the White House, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, who traveled to Baltimore with Obama on Friday, said the president was ""at ease.""

""He's doing exactly the right thing, focusing on the substance,"" Hoyer said.

On Thursday evening, White House chief of staff Denis McDonough met with a dozen Democratic strategists to talk about moving beyond the controversies and get back to pushing the president's economic agenda.

On Friday afternoon, Obama visited Ellicot Dredges, a Baltimore company that manufactures dredges and dredging equipment that are exported around the globe. Obama announced during a speech at the company that he's signed a presidential memorandum that will cut in half the permitting process on federal infrastructure projects.

But the office of House Speaker John Boehner noted the president's visit to the dredging manufacturer highlights another sensitive topic for the Obama administration — the pending decision on permitting the Keystone XL pipeline.

Peter Bowe, the president of Ellicot Dredges, testified before a House subcommittee on Thursday that the proposed pipeline that would bring tar sands oil from northwest Canada to the Gulf of Mexico would be a boon for companies like his.

""For us, it's all about jobs, not construction jobs for the pipeline itself, but ongoing jobs every year for decades to come, all related to the production of oil from the Alberta oil sands deposits,"" Bowe said in his prepared remarks.

Obama rejected rapid approval of the pipeline last year as he faced pressure from environmental groups who say the pipeline and the carbon-heavy oil are risky for the environment. Republican lawmakers have pushed for the administration to approve the pipeline, which they contend will create jobs and help reduce American dependence on Middle East oil.

The State Department — which has approval authority over the project — is to make a decision on a new permit application on Keystone, perhaps as early as later this year.

Obama didn't address Keystone or make any mention of Benghazi or the IRS controversies directly, but he made clear that he's trying to move beyond the scandals.

""Others may get distracted chasing every fleeting issue that passes by, but the middle class will always be my No. 1 focus, period,"" Obama said. ""Your jobs. Your families. Your communities. That's why I ran for president."""

On Wednesday afternoon, Loretta Fuddy, the director of Hawaii's Department of Health, died in a small, commercial plane crash off the coast of the Hawaiian island Molokai. Fuddy, who had been director of Hawaii's health department since March 2011, was the official who verified and approved the release of President Obama's birth certificate. Fuddy said then that the records ""further prove the fact that he was born in Hawaii.""

Early reports indicate that the plane, a 2002 Cessna Grand Caravan, suffered catastrophic engine failure. The other eight passengers on board were rescued. According to Rev. Patrick Killilea who met with the survivors, Fuddy was wearing her life jacket in the water and was holding hands with deputy director Keith Yamamoto when she let go.

Tweets, comments, and web posts from the birther movement quickly insinuated that the tragedy was no accident. Some implied that the White House was ""tying up loose ends,"" while others commented ""that anyone with any connection to Obama or his background has a tendency to have a 'shortened' life span.""

And, of course, Donald Trump weighed in:

How amazing, the State Health Director who verified copies of Obama’s “birth certificate” died in plane crash today. All others lived — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2013

Despite the media whirlwind around the birther conspiracies, Fuddy's life and numerous successes are being celebrated.

Just yesterday, a report published by the United Health Foundation, American Public Health Association and the Partnership for Prevention, confirmed that Hawaii is the country's healthiest state.

According to Hawaii House Speaker Joe Souki, Fuddy, 65, “was especially passionate about the most vulnerable in our communities, a champion for mothers, newborns, and early childhood care. Her warm, caring spirit for the people of Hawaii will truly be missed.”

“Our hearts are broken,” Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie said in a statement. “Loretta was deeply loved and respected. She was selfless, utterly dedicated, and committed to her colleagues in the Department of Health and to the people of Hawaii. Her knowledge was vast; her counsel and advice always given from her heart as much as from her storehouse of experience.”

In August, Fuddy told Honolulu's Midweek magazine, ""I'm a child of the '60s, the Kennedy era of 'ask what you can do for your country' public service and Catholic values."""

Bob Menendez has denied soliciting prostitutes in the Dominican Republic but admitted he traveled at least three times on a donor’s private plane to and from the country.

The statement comes on the heels of an FBI raid on wealthy ophthalmologist Dr. Salomon Melgen’s Miami office late Tuesday evening and internal FBI emails showing the bureau is investigating the Senator’s alleged solicitation of allegedly underage prostitutes in the Dominican.

“Dr. Melgen has been a friend and political supporter of Senator Menendez for many years,” Menendez’s office said in a Wednesday statement, according to the Washington Post. “Senator Menendez has traveled on Dr. Melgen’s plane on three occasions, all of which have been paid for and reported appropriately. Any allegations of engaging with prostitutes are manufactured by a politically-motivated right-wing blog and are false.”

When the story first broke, National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) executive director Rob Jesmer called on Menendez to release all his travel records. He has not done that, and his spokeswoman Tricia Enright did not immediately respond to a Breitbart News request for the travel records.

Jesmer said the allegations against Menendez are “very serious and deserve examination.”

“Fortunately, there is a simple way for Senator Menendez to begin addressing these questions, and that is by releasing his schedule and travel records related to Easter Week of this year, as well as the other dates in question,” Jesmer said.

This reporter broke the story while writing for The Daily Caller last year and interviewed two Dominican Republic women in November who claimed Menendez paid them for sex around Easter-time last year. The encounter apparently took place at Casa de Campo, a posh 7,000-acre resort in the Dominican Republic. Each woman told this reporter that Menendez had agreed to pay them $500 for sex but only paid them $100."

Why the stark turnaround? “Nobody spoke to the president” when the question first arose in 2011, press secretary Jay Carney told reporters at his daily briefing.

Instead, staff appear to have relied on one of the president’s autobiographical books.

“Back when this arose, folks looked at the record, including the president's book, and there was no evidence that they had met, there was — and that was what was conveyed,” Carney explained.

That appeared to be a reference to “Dreams From My Father,” which famously includes the warning that some people in the book are composites.

Carney also denied any improper White House meddling in the deportation procedures against the elder Obama, whom he described as “his father’s half brother.” The uncle, who has lived in the United States for 50 years, won his fight against deportation this week.

""Absolutely zero interference,"" the spokesman said.

Here’s some background from the Boston Globe:

""Onyango Obama’s immigration case raised numerous concerns about a potential conflict of interest after his arrest in August 2011 for drunken driving in Framingham. The arrest revealed his outstanding deportation orders and his relationship to the president. ""Shortly after his arrest, he told an officer, “I think I will call the White House.”

The question of the relationship between the two men arose at a recent deportation hearing focused on the uncle. Onyango ""Omar"" Obama testified that the future president had lived with him in Cambridge for three weeks.

There were reports that he had said the other day that President Obama, back when he was a law school student, had stayed with him in Cambridge. I thought it was the right thing to do to go ask him,"" Carney explained.

“The president said that he, in fact, had met Omar Obama when he moved to Cambridge for law school, and that he stayed with him for a brief period of time until his — the president's — apartment was ready,” the spokesman added.

“After that, they saw each other once every few months while the president was in Cambridge, and then, after law school, they gradually fell out of touch. The president has not seen Omar Obama in 20 years and has not spoken with him in roughly 10 years.”"

Editor’s Note: Ken Boehm is chairman of the National Legal and Policy Center, based in Falls Church, Virginia. Watch CNN’s “The Truth about the IRS Scandal” this week on “Erin Burnett OutFront,” at 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET.

(CNN) —

America can handle the truth. Even if that truth could include a coverup at the powerful IRS.

The IRS mission statement pledges to “enforce the law with integrity and fairness to all.”

But public scrutiny has revealed details indicating a level of politicization totally at odds with that.

Look at the two eye-opening developments that have happened at the IRS since May: An acting IRS commissioner resigned, and another powerful IRS official refused to answer questions before Congress, pleading the Fifth Amendment.

Whatever is going on, there is only one way to proceed, and that is a professional and thorough investigation.

National Legal and Policy Center Ken Boehm

For people who haven’t been following a lot of this, let me quickly get you up to speed:

The IRS inspector general released a report on May 14 describing how the agency had inappropriately targeted tea party and conservative groups that had applied for tax-exempt status.

Then the IRS put these groups through extra reviews, substantial delays and burdensome requests for information.

The reaction was immediate. The next day, President Barack Obama announced that the acting IRS commissioner was resigning.

That doesn’t exactly happen every day.

Obama went on to say, “I will not tolerate this kind of behavior in any agency, but especially in the IRS, given the power that it has and the reach that it has into all of our lives.”

After that shocking disclosure, several things happened:

• Senate and House committees launched investigations into the scandal.

• The FBI began a criminal investigation.

• The IRS inspector general expanded its ongoing investigation.

• IRS official Lois Lerner exercised her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination by refusing to answer questions before Congress.

Some interesting developments emerged from all that.

For one, the original claim during IRS testimony – that the scandal was the result of a couple of “rogue IRS agents” in the agency’s Cincinnati field office – didn’t hold water.

It turned out that, according to frontline IRS agents in Cincinnati interviewed by House Oversight committee investigators, the Washington IRS office had played a key role in the handling of the tea party applications.

Retired IRS lawyer Carter Hull disclosed in testimony that IRS Counsel William Wilkins was one of his supervisors in the targeting of conservative groups. (The IRS has denied Wilkins’ involvement in the targeting of specific groups.)

The inspector general’s report found that Wilkins’ office had sent the exempt organizations determination unit on April 24, 2012, “additional comments on the draft guidance” for considering applications of tea party groups for tax-exempt status (PDF).

Read the inspector general’s report

The connections between Wilkins’ office and the inappropriate profiling of conservative groups are especially noteworthy because there are only two appointees of the president at the IRS: the commissioner and the chief counsel.

Cynics may view this controversy as typical when the House is in the hands of a different party than the president, but guess what?

The Democrat-controlled Senate’s Finance Committee has also weighed in.

That committee has called for three things: a hearing, an investigation and a request to the IRS for documents.

Montana Democrat Sen. Max Baucus, the committee chairman, stated bluntly, “Targeting groups based on their political views is not only inappropriate, it is intolerable, unacceptable and cannot be allowed.”

Baucus promised a bipartisan investigation and has been true to his word. When the first week of August arrived, Baucus and his GOP counterpart, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, said the IRS failed to provide “most of the information requested by the Committee.”

New details reshape IRS targeting scandal

As chairman of the ethics watchdog group National Legal and Policy Center, I had filed a complaint with the IRS in May 2011 showing that a purported charity called the Barack H. Obama Foundation – named for the father of President Obama and run by his half-brother, Malik Obama – had been raising funds in the U.S. by falsely claiming to be an IRS-approved charitable group.

I submitted proof that the foundation was not tax-deductible and had never even applied for that status despite the fact that it had been fundraising for about three years.

In fact, one of the foundation’s directors admitted that an IRS application had never been submitted.

There was compelling evidence suggesting that the foundation was raising money on the Internet by misrepresenting itself as being IRS-approved when it really wasn’t.

Suddenly, the foundation rushed an application to the IRS in late May 2011.

In the short span of about a month, Lerner – the same person who took the Fifth Amendment rather than testify before Congress – gave the Obama Foundation its tax-deductible status.

And, the IRS made that status retroactive for three years.

Even more curious, several of the forms submitted by Malik Obama were stamped as being received by the IRS in July 2011. That’s one month after Lerner approved the group’s new tax status.

The administration says there’s no political basis for the IRS actions. If that’s true, then it has nothing to lose. Ken Boehm, chairman, National Legal and Policy Center

Generally, the approval process for charitable groups seeking tax-deductible status takes longer than it does for groups that merely want to be tax-exempt, such as most of the tea party groups.

In any case, there’s a good chance this scandal could last a while.

Anyone who follows Washington scandals knows that investigations can take months, sometimes years.

Consider Watergate.

That story broke during the presidential campaign of 1972. The president’s press secretary dismissed it as a third-rate burglary. The investigation was slow because there was an active pushback from the Nixon administration and the people being investigated. The end finally came in August 1974, when President Nixon resigned.

’Enemies list’ won’t be tolerated, says GOP lawmaker

Was there a coverup here, like there was in the Watergate scandal? I have no idea.

But it could easily be argued that there are a lot of signs pointing in that direction: Multiple investigations were cut off; document processing was delayed; a key official took the Fifth Amendment.

McConnell says Obama administration marked by ‘culture of intimidation’

When the issue involves the integrity of an institution as powerful as the IRS, the media and the public are entitled to a thorough, professional investigation.

Anything less leads an already cynical public to become even more cynical. If it comes to the appointment of a special prosecutor, that, I believe, should be reserved as a last resort.

The administration says there’s no political basis for the IRS actions. If that’s true, then it has nothing to lose. Sometimes, though, the truth hurts. But don’t worry. Whatever happens, America can handle it.

USA TODAY

John Podesta was just named as a new senior-level adviser to President Obama last week, but he's already ruffling Republican feathers.

In a profile published late Tuesday by Politico Magazine, Podesta is quoted comparing Republicans to the infamous cult led by Jim Jones, who was responsible for the 1978 cyanide poisoning of more than 900 of his followers in Guyana.

""They need to focus on executive action given that they are facing a second term against a cult worthy of Jonestown in charge of one of the houses of Congress,"" said Podesta of what Obama's White House team faces. Jonestown was the informal name of the settlement founded by Jones and his American followers.

On Wednesday, Podesta apologized for his impolitic comment.

""In an old interview, my snark got in front of my judgment. I apologize to Speaker Boehner, whom I have always respected,"" Podesta posted on his Twitter account.

The Jonestown incident marked one of the most horrific mass killings in American history.

Rep. Leo Ryan, D-Calif., who had traveled to the settlement after receiving alarming reports of conditions there from constituents, was shot dead by cult members as the congressman's delegation readied to fly out of Guyana with some members of the cult who wanted to leave. Current Rep. Jackie Speier, who was then an aide to Ryan, was wounded in the incident.

The author of the profile, Glenn Thrush, writes Podesta made the comment in an interview in the fall before Obama recruited the former Clinton administration chief of staff to join his team.

Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Republican House Speaker John Boehner, took offense with the Podesta comment.

""If this is the attitude of the new White House, it's hard to see how the president gets anything done again,"" Buck said.

Jenny Martin, co-founder of Tea Party Patriots, called Podesta's comments ""despicable.""

""Any man who is so historically ignorant as to compare millions of Americans who cherish freedom with the macabre and mass suicide at Jonestown is unqualified to hold any position of authority,"" she said. ""We recommend Mr. Podesta read a book on basic American history."""
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/29/us/politics/momentum-builds-against-nsa-surveillance.html,2013-07-29 00:00:00,['Jonathan Weisman'],Momentum Builds Against N.S.A. Surveillance,"WASHINGTON — The movement to crack down on government surveillance started with an odd couple from Michigan, Representatives Justin Amash, a young libertarian Republican known even to his friends as “chief wing nut,” and John Conyers Jr., an elder of the liberal left in his 25th House term.

But what began on the political fringes only a week ago has built a momentum that even critics say may be unstoppable, drawing support from Republican and Democratic leaders, attracting moderates in both parties and pulling in some of the most respected voices on national security in the House.

The rapidly shifting politics were reflected clearly in the House on Wednesday, when a plan to defund the National Security Agency’s telephone data collection program fell just seven votes short of passage. Now, after initially signaling that they were comfortable with the scope of the N.S.A.’s collection of Americans’ phone and Internet activities, but not their content, revealed last month by Edward J. Snowden, lawmakers are showing an increasing willingness to use legislation to curb those actions.

Representatives Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, and Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, have begun work on legislation in the House Judiciary Committee to significantly rein in N.S.A. telephone surveillance. Mr. Sensenbrenner said on Friday that he would have a bill ready when Congress returned from its August recess that would restrict phone surveillance to only those named as targets of a federal terrorism investigation, make significant changes to the secret court that oversees such programs and give businesses like Microsoft and Google permission to reveal their dealings before that court."

Alejandro Mayorkas, director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, was named by Homeland Security's Inspector General's Office as a target in an investigation involving the foreign investor program run by USCIS, according to an email sent to lawmakers late Monday.

The investigation was opened in September 2012 following a referral from an FBI counterintelligence analyst. The probe was first reported by The Associated Press.

The investigation into Mayorkas is based on allegations he helped secure U.S. visas for Chinese businessmen after they had been denied by his own agency’s officials. The visas had been sought by Gulf Coast Funds Management, a financing company headed by then-Secretary of State Clinton’s brother Anthony Rodham, according to an aide to GOP Sen. Charles Grassley, who had received internal USCIS emails about the matter from a department whistle-blower.

According to an email sent to lawmakers Monday, the IG's office said, ""At this point in our investigation, we do not have any findings of criminal misconduct."" The email did not specify any criminal allegations it might be investigating.

White House press secretary Jay Carney referred questions to the inspector general's office, which said that the probe is in its preliminary stage and that it doesn't comment on the specifics of investigations.

The program, known as EB-5, allows foreigners to get visas if they invest $500,000 to $1 million in projects or businesses that create jobs for U.S. citizens. The amount of the investment required depends on the type of project. Investors who are approved for the program can become legal permanent residents after two years and can later be eligible to become citizens.

If Mayorkas were confirmed as Homeland Security's deputy secretary, he probably would run the department until a permanent replacement was approved to take over for departing Secretary Janet Napolitano.

The email to lawmakers said the primary complaint against Mayorkas was that he helped a financing company run by Rodham to win approval for an investor visa, even after the application was denied and an appeal was rejected.

Mayorkas, a former U.S. attorney in California, previously came under criticism for his involvement in the commutation by President Bill Clinton of the prison sentence of the son of a Democratic Party donor.

Another of Hillary Clinton's brothers, Hugh Rodham, had been hired by the donor to lobby for the commutation. Mayorkas told lawmakers during his 2009 confirmation hearing that ""it was a mistake"" to talk to the White House about the request.

Hillary Clinton, who stepped down as secretary of state on Feb. 1, is considered a possible contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016.

According to the Inspector General's email, the investigation of the investor visa program also includes allegations that other USCIS Office of General Counsel officials obstructed an audit of the visa program by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The email did not name any specific official from the general counsel's office.

The email says investigators did not know whether Mayorkas was aware of the investigation.

The FBI's Washington field office was told about the investigation in June after it inquired about Mayorkas as part of the White House background investigation for his nomination as deputy DHS secretary.

The FBI in Washington has been concerned about the investor visa program and the projects funded by foreign sources since at least March, according to emails obtained by The AP.

The bureau wanted details of all of the limited liability companies that had invested in the EB-5 visa program. Of particular concern, the FBI official wrote, was Chinese investment in projects, including the building of an FBI facility.

""Let's just say that we have a significant issue that my higher-ups are really concerned about and this may be addressed way above my pay grade,"" an official wrote in one email. The FBI official's name was redacted in that email.

Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, sent the FBI a lengthy letter Tuesday asking for details of its review of the foreign investor visa program and Chinese investment in U.S. infrastructure projects.

Chinese investment in infrastructure projects has long been a concern of the U.S. government. In September, the Obama administration blocked a Chinese company from owning four wind farm projects in northern Oregon that were near a Navy base used to fly unmanned drones and electronic-warfare planes on training missions. In October, the House Intelligence Committee warned that two leading Chinese technology firms, Huawei Technologies Ltd. and ZTE Corp., posed a major security threat to the U.S. Both firms have denied being influenced by the Chinese government.

The most routine users of the EB-5 program are Chinese investors.

According to an undated, unclassified State Department report about the program obtained by the AP, the U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou, China, processed more investor visas in the 2011 fiscal year than any other consulate or embassy.

The document says ""applicants are usually coached and prepped for their interviews, making it difficult to take at face value applicants' claims"" about where their money comes from and whether they hold membership in the Chinese Communist Party. Party membership would make an applicant ineligible for the investor visa.

Anthony Rodham is president and CEO of Gulf Coast Funds Management LLC in McLean, Va. The firm is one of hundreds of ""Regional Centers"" that pool investments from foreign nationals looking to invest in U.S. businesses or industries as part of the foreign investor visa program.

There was no immediate response to an email sent to Gulf Coast requesting comment.

It is unclear from the IG's email why the investor visa application was denied. Visa requests can be denied for a number of reasons, including a circumstance where an applicant has a criminal background or is considered a threat to national security or public safety.

He Also Reported The White House']",From the Archives: How the 2003 gubernatorial recall changed California,"SACRAMENTO — Ten years ago, California erupted in an anti-government, anti-establishment convulsion unlike any ever seen.

Disgruntled voters seized the chance for a rare do-over, recalling their staid and serious governor, Gray Davis, and replacing him less than a year after his reelection with one of the most famous and exuberant personalities on the planet. It was only the second time in U.S. history a sitting governor was booted from office.

The spectacle — a snap election featuring a color wheel of 135 candidates, including a former child actor, a porn star and a handful of professional politicians — shook California from its usual political slumber and captivated an audience that watched from around the world.

A decade on, the effects are still being felt, albeit subtly, and not the way proponents imagined, or the way actor-turned-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, the chief beneficiary, so grandly promised.

Fundamental changes in the way California elects its leaders — a top-two primary system aimed at pushing candidates to the ideological center and an impartial redrawing of the state’s political boundaries — will almost certainly change how Sacramento operates for years to come. Neither would likely have passed without Schwarzenegger sitting in the governor’s office.

The upheaval helped deliver the state its current governor, Jerry Brown, a decades-long officeholder and scion of California’s great political dynasty, whose worn-shoe familiarity appealed to voters in part because he was so unlike the upstart Schwarzenegger.

Less tangible, but also important, many say the historic election heightened awareness of state government and gave Californians a greater sense of empowerment, even if it failed to extinguish the flickering animosity toward Sacramento. For good or ill, the recall served notice on California’s political class, and still looms as a threat over all those holding elective office.

“There’s been a lot of momentum around fiscal and governance reform, particularly in the past five years,” said Mark Baldassare, head of the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan think tank. “The desire to make changes started with the recall but didn’t end with the recall.”

Still, in many ways the special election proved a failure, especially measured against supporters’ exceedingly high hopes.

The October 2003 ouster of Davis, a Democrat, was a primal response to the gridlock, partisan warfare, overweening special interests and mushrooming budget deficits that made the state capital a slough of dysfunction. “It was about changing the entire political climate of our state,” as Schwarzenegger, a Republican, said in his first inaugural address.

When he left office more than seven years later — after sinking to the same abysmal poll ratings as Davis — the special interests were just as firmly entrenched in Sacramento, the partisan rancor was unabated and the budget deficit had more than doubled.

Among the most bitterly disappointed were those who had the greatest hand in forcing Davis from office and paving the path for Schwarzenegger’s election, which was sealed in a separate vote on the same ballot.

“There was no substantive nuts-and-bolts change to California government, which was one of the main goals,” said Ted Costa, the anti-tax crusader who launched the main petition drive that qualified the recall, sparking the brief, intense and sometimes zany campaign. Costa has largely retired from politics, owing partly to his frustration over the outcome of the recall.

That view overlooks Schwarzenegger’s significant achievements, including an overhaul of the worker’s compensation system, savings in welfare and healthcare programs, and meaningful pension and retirement concessions wrung from public employee unions.

He signed landmark legislation to fight global warming. Working with Democrats, Schwarzenegger also ushered the state into its most ambitious rebuilding program since the era of Brown’s father, who oversaw the infrastructure development that still serves California half a century later.

Those accomplishments pale, however, when laid against the extravagant promises made during the recall. Schwarzenegger vowed to slash the size of government, stop deficit spending and end the pay-to-play culture of Sacramento, which he captured with stark simplicity in a TV spot: “Money goes in. Favors go out. The people lose.”

None of those changes occurred, as Democratic, Republican and nonpartisan observers point out.

“In the larger sense of dramatically changing the direction of the state, we didn’t accomplish what we’d hoped and expected,” said Rob Stutzman, a GOP strategist who served as a Schwarzenegger spokesman during the recall.

Even the former governor has said he could and should have done more to address the structural problems — a boom-and-bust tax system, a crazy-quilt budgeting process — that continue to plague the state.

“It was a mistake,” Schwarzenegger said in an interview before leaving office in January 2011. Instead of borrowing to paper over the deficit and add to the state’s mountain of debt, he said, “I should’ve gone the other direction to early on solve the budget problem and use the political muscle I had that first year in office.”

Advertisement

Still, even some let down by Schwarzenegger consider the recall a good and healthy thing.

“Once they’re elected, politicians become so isolated,” said Dave Gilliard, whose political group, Rescue California, helped orchestrate the signature-gathering with a $2-million contribution from Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Vista), who hoped to replace Davis but quit the race after Schwarzenegger got in. “Being mindful of their accountability to voters — that they can make changes — there’s nothing more American than that.”

It is highly unlikely anyone voted in October 2003 believing the result would be a top-two primary system aimed at weeding out extremists from the two major parties, or thinking Davis’ exit would mean an end to the self-interested drawing of political lines by sitting lawmakers. But those important structural reforms were enacted in good measure because Schwarzenegger, alone in the Capitol, was beholden to neither the Democratic nor Republican establishments (both of which opposed the ballot measures).

“He blew up the most important boxes of all,” suggested Susan Kennedy, a former Davis aide who served as chief of staff in Schwarzenegger’s second term, borrowing a line he used in the swaggering days after the recall. “That is changing the election system.”

Those changes, which have yet to be fully felt, may be the most important legacy of Schwarzenegger and the recall: If they work as proponents hope, Sacramento and Washington will eventually be populated with a breed of lawmaker less yoked to partisan interests and more amenable to compromise. That could be a big step toward solving the problems that sent angry Californians storming to the polls a decade ago.

Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., who orchestrated the change, called the 52-48 vote a blow against gridlock. Republicans warned Democrats will eventually regret their actions once political fortunes are reversed and they can no longer block appointments made by a GOP president.

At the White House, Obama welcomed the shift. ""The gears of government have got to work,"" he said, and he declared that Republicans had increasingly used existing rules ""as a reckless and relentless tool to grind all business to a halt.""

But Republicans warned of a power grab by Democrats, some predicting that worse was yet to come. ""This drastic move sets a dangerous precedent that could later be expanded to speed passage of expansive and controversial legislation,"" said Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama.

The day's change involved presidential appointees, not legislation — and not Supreme Court nominees.

The immediate impact was to ensure post-Thanksgiving confirmation for Patricia Millett, one of Obama's three stalled nominees for the District of Columbia Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals, and for others whom Republicans have blocked. Rep. Mel Watt, D-N.C., tapped to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency, is among them.

The longer-term result of the unilateral move by Democrats was harder to gauge in a Senate that has grown deeply constrained by the major political differences emblematic of an era of divided government.

At issue was a rule that has required a 60-vote majority to end debate in the 100-member Senate and assure a yes-or-no vote on presidential nominees to federal courts or to Cabinet departments or other agencies.

Under a parliamentary maneuver scripted in advance, Democrats changed the proceedings so that only a simple majority was required to clear the way for a final vote. In Senate-speak, this was accomplished by establishing a new precedent under the rules, rather than a formal rules change.

Story continues

Supreme Court nominations still will be subject to a traditional filibuster, the term used to describe the 60-vote requirement to limit debate.

The day's events capped more than a decade of struggle over judicial nominations, in which first President George W. Bush found his appointees stalled by Senate Democrats, and more recently Obama has complained that Republicans have been delaying or preventing confirmation for his picks.

The vote adds to the list of issues likely to figure in next year's congressional elections. In a fundraising appeal emailed a few hours after the vote, the Senate Republicans' campaign organization asked for donations. It warned that ""Democrats are going to pack Obama's liberal judges on the federal courts,"" and sought donations to ""throw these hacks out of office.""

On Thursday, in a certain sign that a showdown was imminent, senators filed into the Senate chamber at midmorning in unusual numbers. They listened from their desks as Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky swapped accusations that preceded a series of votes on arcane parliamentary points. Yet there was no suspense about the final outcome.

McConnell said Republicans had grown tired of threats of action. ""We're not interested in having a gun put to our head any longer,"" he said, noting that Democrats have periodically talked of changing the rules in recent months.

Still, the events marked a reversal for Reid, who had threatened earlier in the year to change the application of filibuster rules for nominees to Cabinet departments and other agencies, but not for appointments to the courts.

Back then, he and McConnell clashed in highly personal, accusatory terms. This time, they recited their grievances in an exchange that was courteous if sharply worded.

""In the history of the Republic, there have been 168 filibusters of executive and judicial nominees. Half of them have occurred during the Obama administration — during the last four and a half years,"" Reid said.

The Nevada Democrat accused the GOP of ""unbreakable, unprecedented obstruction."" He said Republicans had blocked qualified appointees ""to force wholesale changes to laws ... to restructure entire executive branch departments"" and because they don't want Obama ""to appoint any judges to certain courts.""

McConnell retorted that Democrats had ""pioneered the practice of filibustering circuit court nominees,"" beginning with Miguel Estrada, a 2001 Bush appointee to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals blocked by Democrats under pressure from outside liberal groups. A Hispanic immigrant viewed at the time as a potential future Supreme Court pick, he withdrew his nomination after more than two years in limbo.

McConnell said Republicans had allowed confirmation of 99 percent of Obama's appointments to the courts. And he likened Reid's dropping of his pledge to leave rules for judicial appointees unaffected to the promise the president made that Americans who liked their health coverage could keep it under ""Obamacare.""

McConnell, the GOP leader said, ""may as well just have said, 'If you like the rules of the Senate, you can keep them.'""

The change is the most far-reaching since 1975, when a two-thirds requirement for cutting off filibusters against legislation and all nominations was lowered to 60 votes.

The original impetus for the change came from relatively junior Democrats, including Sens. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Tom Udall of New Mexico, who are among the 31 members of their party who have never served in the Senate minority.

More senior Democrats came around gradually, some noting the Senate's traditions while others fretted about the possibility that they were giving up the right to block nominees of the future whom they might oppose strenuously.

Asked about that concern after the vote, Reid said, ""This is the way it has to be. The Senate has changed.""

Modern-day rules covering filibusters have evolved slowly in the Senate, where change rarely comes easily. Since 1917, the minority has enjoyed the right to unlimited debate on legislation and nominations until the majority can amass a super-majority. In recent years, that has meant 60 votes.

In the end, Democratic Sens. Carl Levin of Michigan, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Mark Pryor of Arkansas parted company with Reid on the switch.

Pryor, who faces a difficult re-election fight next year, said in a statement the Senate was ""designed to protect — not stamp out — the voices of the minority.""

Pryor also noted he had been among a bipartisan group of senators, the so-called Gang of 14, that produced a last-minute compromise nearly a decade ago when Republicans threatened a change in procedures to assure confirmation of several of Bush's stalled judicial nominees.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., another veteran of the Gang of 14, said he had met with Reid on Wednesday urging him to reconsider. ""I reached out until my arms ached,"" he said.

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-heads-florida-weekend-boys-171053691--politics.html,,[],Obama heads to Florida for weekend with the boys,"PALM CITY, Fla. (AP) — Faced with a long weekend in an empty White House, President Barack Obama figured he needed a getaway, too, so he put together a golf outing with some buddies.

Not at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland or at Fort Belvoir in Virginia, two Washington-area military posts where he's a regular on their courses.

Instead, he went south, to Florida, to spend the long President's Day weekend staying and playing at the Floridian, an exclusive and secluded yacht and golf club on the state's Treasure Coast. He arrived Friday night after a speech in Chicago and wasn't expected to be seen again in public — including by the members of the news media traveling with him — until he returns to Washington on Monday.

""At this time, there are no public events scheduled or plans for the president to leave the grounds of the golf club,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Saturday.

Call it a weekend with the boys, presidential style.

Eyebrows might have been raised at the thought of the president, any president, high-tailing it out of Washington, without his family, for some ""me time"" hundreds of miles away from the Oval Office. First lady Michelle Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha are on an annual ski vacation out West.

As it turns out, it isn't at all uncommon for a president to go on vacation on his own.

And, Obama has gone off alone in the past.

During the weekend, the president, a sports enthusiast and avid golfer, planned to practice his putting technique on the club's private, 18-hole course, which opened in 1996, according to golfnow.com, and is owned by Jim Crane, a Houston businessman who also owns Major League Baseball's Astros.

Crane has made political contributions to Republican and Democratic candidates, including $35,800 last year to a joint fundraising committee for Obama and the Democratic Party, and $2,300 to Obama in 2007, according to Federal Election Commission records.

Members of the club and their guests have access to one of eight cottages, a 68-slip deep water marina, the club's 61-foot Viking yacht, a 24-foot Hurricane Deck Boat and the club's private helicopter service with two on-site helipads along the St. Lucie River.

Story continues

The White House arranged for reporters traveling with the president to stay at a hotel in Port St. Lucie, about a 25-minute drive away.

Obama's longtime friend from Chicago, Eric Whitaker, joined him on the flight from Chicago to Florida. The two have played golf together in the past. Another regular member of Obama's golf foursomes is White House trip director Marvin Nicholson, who also traveled with the president on Friday.

Besides Whitaker and Crane, Obama played golf Saturday with Ron Kirk, the outgoing U.S. trade representative; Tony Chase, a Houston businessman and lawyer who threw a fundraiser for Obama last March; and Milton Carroll, chairman of Houston-based CenterPoint Energy. Carroll donated $2,300 to Obama's first presidential campaign, according to campaignmoney.com, which gathers information about financial contributions to federal political campaigns.

Earnest, the White House spokesman, said Obama also got some instruction and played a few holes with Butch Harmon, Tiger Woods' former swing coach. Harmon had told The Associated Press by text message earlier Saturday that he would be at the Floridian to play nine holes and practice with Obama.

Crane said earlier Saturday that he was scheduled to play a round of golf with Obama on Sunday, according to a report on the website for Major League Baseball. Crane said he was at the club to welcome Obama when he arrived Friday night.

""Looks like I might get to play with him a little bit tomorrow, and we're looking forward to that,"" Crane said Saturday as he addressed the Astros before a team workout, according to mlb.com. ""He came in late last night and was very cordial. His staff is great and it's very exciting. I mean, when do you get the president staying in your place?""

Crane said he received a call about a week ago asking if the president could use the course. He said Obama then contacted him personally to thank him.

America's presidents have been taking solo vacations for decades, according to Larry Knutson, a former White House reporter for The Associated Press who wrote a book about presidents and their vacations.

Although Bess and Margaret Truman visited him there just a couple of times, President Harry Truman vacationed most often by himself in tropical Key West, Fla. Many aides, all men, accompanied him.

Truman enjoyed the male companionship and his wife may have stayed away out of a desire to not interrupt his cherished late afternoon and evening games of poker. Truman vacationed in Key West 11 times between November 1946 and March 1952; his wife and daughter joined him for the first time in November 1948, after his surprise victory in that year's election campaign.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt often visited his cottage at Warm Springs, Ga., alone; wife, Eleanor, didn't much care for the place or the Southern atmosphere. Roosevelt was at Warm Springs, on his own, when he died in April 1945.

He also often traveled solo to his home in Hyde Park, N.Y., during World War II. The first lady often did not accompany Roosevelt on his wartime visits to Shangri-La, which is now the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland, or when he traveled on the presidential yacht or on Navy warships.

In 1997, President Bill Clinton was in Florida for fundraising and to play in a golf tournament when he stumbled on steps at the home of golf pro Greg Norman and needed surgery to repair a torn tendon in his right knee. He was treated at a hospital in West Palm Beach before being flown to Washington for the operation.

Obama's stay at the Floridian isn't his first get-away without his wife and daughters.

In 2010, as his 49th birthday approached, Obama was left home alone after the first lady took Sasha with her on a trip to Spain, and Malia was away at camp.

Rather than stay in the sprawling White House by himself, Obama fled, taking family dog Bo, home to Chicago for a birthday dinner with friends there that included Oprah Winfrey, her pal Gayle King, Whitaker and White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, a fellow Chicagoan.

Tom Coburn muses that Obama is 'perilously close' to impeachment,"That was the original theory, anyway. In practice you can also go the Ken Starr route; that had been discredited for a while due to that whole being-a-stain-on-the-nation-and-an-embarassment-to-all-concerned bit, but enough of it seems to have finally been forcibly clubbed down the memory hole, now, and the newcomers seem to have a fondness for the thing.

This isn't some Rep. NoName Bumblefuck, though, this is Sen. Tom Coburn, who we all recognize as a very important person because other important people will not stop rattling on about it, and also because Tom Coburn has considerably more than his fair share when it comes to making sure world's greatest deliberative body cannot so much as sneeze without three hearings, two secret holds and five sniffling letters to other government officials about how this or that is the greatest outrage everz, probably, maybe, if you squint just right and look at it sideways. All right, Mr. Coburn, knock us out. Tell us what the intended violation of the law might be. Tell us what level of ""incompetence"" compares to the military fiascos, anti-terrorism ball-dropping and economic catastrophe visited upon us by the last president, the one who will not be named.

No? Nothing much? Throw us a bone here, give us something to work with. Surely you didn't plan on piping up on how very close to impeachable the president's actions have been only to shrug your shoulders and say that you can't be bothered to think about it too hard or to explain why.



“My little wiggle out of that when I get that written to me is I believe that needs to be evaluated and determined but thank goodness it doesn’t have to happen in the Senate until they’ve brought charges in the House. Those are serious things but we’re in a serious time. I don’t have the legal background to know if that rises to high crimes and misdemeanor but I think they’re getting perilously close.”

Oh, you poor dumb jackass. Yes, thank goodness you don't have to worry your gargantuan head over whether or not any of what you are saying is utter bullshit, since other people will have to come up with the precise wording of the bullshit first. Thank goodness we can all just agree among our Republican selves that, shit, son, there's got to be something in there worth impeaching a sitting president for, but we don't really have to worry about it until Darrell Issa finally comes up with a crayon drawing that the rest of us can put on the Senate fridge with a straight face.

And for the record, I see absolutely nothing to indicate that we are in a serious time. All evidence suggests we are in a decidedly un-serious time. We bleat on about fake scandals, not even having the decency anymore to drop them after they have been roundly disproven. We have a Congress that ties itself in knots even over its most basic, primitive tasks, primarily because it is too preoccupied with drawing up various Obamacair is bad dumhead scribbles and launching them, giggling, over to the other branches of government. There are a very large number of very serious things happening in the world, to be sure, but to say we are in serious times implies that we might be doing jack-all about any of them, and that is the singular most prominent thing we are not doing. No matter what economic or legislative building might be on fire, we still get the same clown-driven firetruck circus act; lots of selzer, a few painful looking gimmicks with the ladder, and bucket after bucket of confetti hurled hither and tither and yon. If you are going to mutter about serious times, you need to at least take the brightly colored rubber nose off. If you are going to furrow your brow and look troubled about serious times, you ought to at least stop squeezing your rubber nose and yelling ""Honk honk, impeachment!"" at the audience.

Or not, whatever.



“Barack Obama is personal friend of mine. He became my friend in the Senate but that does not mean I agree in anyway with what he’s doing or how he’s doing it. And I quite frankly think he’s in a difficult position he’s put himself in and if it continues, I think we’re going to have another constitutional crisis in our country in terms of the presidency,” Coburn concluded.

If he continues what, precisely? Be specific. Hell, be unspecific. Is it the pursuing policies that the Republican Party does not like, is that the impeachable thing? Is it the wanting to put judges on benches, even if the other party has decided that they no longer want any judges, thank you? Is it Benghazi? Please tell me it is Benghazi. Please tell me that you are contemplating impeaching a president for allowing a terrorist attack on a foreign-based embassy, because by God, I have a list of people who need to have their names scrubbed from various buildings and freeways and aircraft carriers post haste, if that is the standard now. It can't be the IRS ""scandal,"" because even I give Tom Coburn more credit than that, and I am generally someone who suspects Tom Coburn would get his head stuck in a mailbox if he didn't have two staff members at all times keeping him from doing it. Crap, man, just write ACORN on your forehead and go with that, don't make your constituents strain their noggins on these things.

We might just write this up to pandering. Perhaps Sen. Tom Coburn is not, in fact, as addled as he comes across, and knows full well he doesn't have a shred of anything he can point to as the unforgivable crime of the current presidency, but he is just humoring a group of clearly touched-in-the-head constituents in order to make them feel good about themselves. That is, though, just as bad. We are in the position we are in precisely because Mr. Coburn's party has yet to find a constituent yet whose ideas are so ridiculous or so offensive that some thrice-elected boil will not eagerly agree with them. The president is not really an American? Run with it! The president is secretly Muslim, is secretly against America, is secretly possibly in league with Muslim terrorists? Hell, anything's possible! The president is ""packing the courts"" by nominating judges to open positions on courts? The fiend. The president used his partisan mind-waves to task the IRS with track down conservative and liberal political groups illegally masquerading as nonpartisan outlets and slightly annoy them? That is the most Nixonian thing ever, and not at all the ravings of the single most boring and least creative insane person ever born anywhere, at any time.

We have now reached the point where even conservative senators muttering about impeachment has become old hat. The level of ridiculousness has gotten so high that by God, it's actually gotten boring. It's to the point where you can look at any given video of any given speech by any given leader of the Republican tribe and just presume that it is going to be nothing more than a stream of drivel about one or 20 different conspiracy theories, a tired propping up of death panels or birth certificates or ammo hoarding or some new level of tyranny from the Bush administration that was only discovered to be tyranny now. What happens now? What happens when the clowns have been performing so long that nobody else thinks they're funny, or even interesting? Do the clowns just keep on going, keep on putting on that same show? Is there a bigger, better rubber nose in development, something that will really wow the crowds this time and save the whole bit?

http://news.yahoo.com/crack-smoking-mayor-rob-ford-has-higher-approval-rating-than-obama-200319235.html,,[],Crack smoking mayor Rob Ford has higher approval rating than Obama,"What could be worse for President Obama than having a lower approval rating than his predecessor George W. Bush ? It sounds too crazy to be true, but recent polling suggests that embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford actually has a slightly higher job approval rating than Obama.

The New York Daily News makes the comparison between the two political figures, noting that in a new Forum Research Poll , Ford has a 42 percent approval rating from Toronto voters. That gives him a one-point edge over Obama’s 41 percent approval rating in the most recent Gallup poll.

Of course, it’s a bit of a stretch to say that Rob Ford is more popular that President Obama. First of all, the polls were conducting by different agencies, so it’s far from precise to say a head-to-head comparison is by any means scientific.

Secondly, we’re talking two men in different countries, with different jobs. And while Toronto is Canada’s largest city, it’s still only a population of around 2.6 million, compared to more than 300 million people living in the U.S.

Also, Ford is facing calls to step down from his position, with 60 percent of Toronto voters in the Forum Research Poll saying he should resign, even as less than half of the same voters favor a recall.

Nonetheless, the polling comparison is just another example of how much recent events including the troubled rollout of the Affordable Care Act website has hurt Obama’s standing with the public , as his approval has fallen by an average of six points in the month and a half since the site first went live.

Although at least one polling expert says troubles with implementing the health care law aren’t actually the biggest factor in Obama’s recent stumbles .

""The real damage came in June, when reports about NSA spying and IRS treatment of conservative groups caused an eight-point drop in his approval rating - a far more significant change than what the numbers from October suggest,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said."
http://news.yahoo.com/verdict-ex-detroit-mayor-corruption-trial-132417332.html,,[],Verdict in ex-Detroit mayor corruption trial,"DETROIT (AP) — Jurors reached a verdict Monday in the federal corruption trial of ex-Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick after 14 days of deliberations.

Lawyers for Kilpatrick, his father Bernard and city contractor Bobby Ferguson were summoned to Detroit federal court. The verdict was to be read Monday morning, court spokesman Rod Hansen said in an email.

Kilpatrick is charged with turning the mayor's office into a cash machine by collecting kickbacks and bribes from people who wanted city business. He's also charged with looting a nonprofit fund that he created to help distressed Detroiters.

Kwame Kilpatrick arrived at court roughly 20 minutes before the verdict was to be read and didn't comment to reporters. Bernard Kilpatrick, who arrived separately, said his family was doing ""better than expected.""

Prosecutors say Kwame Kilpatrick rigged contracts that benefited Ferguson's construction company. In turn, the government says Kilpatrick got a cut of the spoils Kilpatrick's lawyer says the former mayor simply got cash gifts from political supporters and city employees while in office.

Kilpatrick is charged with 30 crimes, including racketeering conspiracy, bribery, extortion and tax evasion. His father, Bernard, is a co-defendant along with Ferguson. The conspiracy charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. To convict on that count, the jury must find that at least one of them agreed to commit two crimes, such as extortion, bribery or fraud.

The main theme of the government's case is that Kwame Kilpatrick ensured that Ferguson got city excavation work and then enjoyed the cash spoils. But he also is accused of strong-arming other contractors to give public jobs to Ferguson and shaking down businesses.

Kilpatrick, a Democrat, resigned as mayor in 2008 in another scandal. He pleaded guilty to obstructing justice by lying in a civil case about whether he had had sex with a top aide. He subsequently served 14 months in prison for violating his probation in that case."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/05/21/WaPo-ABC-Poll-Obama-Lying-About-Benghazi-IRS-Targeting-Inappropriate-Media-Still-Distrusted,2013-05-21 00:00:00,['Warner Todd Huston'],"WaPo/ABC Poll: Majority Distrust Obama, Media in Various Scandals","A new poll conducted jointly by The Washington Post and ABC News revealed some interesting trends. Among other findings, more Americans feel that Obama and his administration are lying about Benghazi. A majority feel that the IRS acted inappropriately by targeting conservative groups. The media are still distrusted, with a majority feeling that the Justice Department’s seizure of the AP’s phone records was justified. Despite all this disapproval, Obama’s approval rating is still just over 50 percent positive.

An important metric in the ABC/WashPost poll was the question of whether or not government is doing more to protect or threaten our rights. 54% felt that the government had become a threat to our rights while only 34% said that the government was acting properly to protect our rights. The American people’s faith in government is at a low ebb.

This distrust is echoed when the poll turned to the specific cases of Benghazi and the IRS.

55% said that they feel that Obama is trying to cover up what happened during the terror attacks on our facilities in Benghazi, Libya on Sept. 11, 2012. Only 33% felt he was honestly disclosing what he knew.

This doesn’t seem to have helped the GOP too much though. 45% still felt the GOP was just engaging in political posturing by criticizing Obama’s actions on that fateful day. 44% felt the GOP was raising legitimate concerns.

Granted this close 50/50 split tends to shadow how the nation feels about Obama, Congress and the two parties.

As to the IRS scandal, a large majority felt that the tax agency was inappropriate in its targeting of conservative groups. 74% said it was inappropriate while only 20% said that it was appropriate. Further, 37% felt the IRS acted illegally with another 32% said they felt it was inappropriate but maybe not illegal.

Also, 56% felt that the IRS was acting in a partisan manner, deliberately trying to harass conservative groups, and 45% feel that Obama is trying to cover up the facts about that targeting.

The other most recent scandal in the news was Obama’s Justice Department seizing the personal and business phone records of some 100 reporters from the Associated Press. It appears that the media are still not well liked by these respondents.

52% said that the DOJ’s spying on the phone calls of the AP reporters was justified. Only 33% said it isn’t justified. Worse for the media, most respondents weren’t concerned at all that the DOJ might be improperly intruding on the freedom of the press. 32% said they were very concerned that freedom of the press was being trampled upon, but 37% said they were only somewhat concerned, and an additional 29% said they weren’t concerned about it. In a blow to the media, here, more are not very concerned about the AP phone records scandal than are.

Finally, despite that a majority of 57% feel the country is on the wrong track, Obama is still hovering around the break even line in approval. More respondents approved of his work as president (51% to 44%), he split even on his handling of the economy (48% to 48%), and in the matchup between Obama and the Republicans, 46% felt he was handling the economy well compared to only 37% who thought that the GOP was handling it better.

The GOP is not succeeding in getting their message across, clearly.

As to Hillary Clinton, she is still enjoying a relatively high approval rating. 62% of respondents felt she handled her job as Secretary of State well, while only 28% disapproved of her actions.

The poll, conducted in the middle of May, was taken among respondents that self-identified as 33% Democrat, 22% Republican, with 38% self-identifying as independents."
http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2011/07/obama-white-house-salaries-soar.html,,[],,"In his numerous fund-raising and policy speeches around the country these days, President Obama often bemoans the difficult economic times and uncertainties afflicting millions of Americans, including the nearly 14 million still seeking work unsuccessfully.

The Democrat argues that his administration needs more time to straighten out the economic mess left by somebody else, who's been gone almost 900 days now.

But good news this morning: The challenging Obama era and 9.1% national unemployment rate do not include the 454 people now helping President Obama do presidential things.

This crowd is being paid a total of $37,121,463 this year. That's up seven staff members and nearly $4 million from 2008, the last year of George W. Bush's presidency.

Fully 141 Obama aides -- or nearly one-in-three -- earn more than $100,000 a year. That's also up from the 130 with that scale salary in Bush's last year.

Twenty-one Obama aides earn the top-dollar $172,200.

The staff names and salaries report, required annually by Congress, was released on Friday by the White House. The timing, however, was probably an accident because last Friday most Americans were not watching the news closely and were thinking of not working for a three-day holiday weekend.

Because Americans would no doubt be pleased to know of the Obama staff's economic success amid the bleak national scene for so many others, we saved the information for today, when most Americans who are still employed are back at their own jobs and can share the joy.

The 2011 White House salary report does not include mention of the 41 unidentified Obama staff members who owe the Internal Revenue Service $831,000 in back taxes. That report came out last fall (Scroll down for the link.)

The report comes as Republicans and Democrats, led from behind by Obama, appear stalemated in closed-door negotiations over a package deal to raise the national debt limit by Aug. 2 and begin spending cuts to tame the $14.2-trillion national debt, up 35% since Obama's inauguration. Obama maintains a deal must include new revenues to cover the rising costs of government.

Having Chicago connections appears to be useful for obtaining the maximum $172,200 salary from the Illinois ex-state senator Obama, who is paid $400,000 a year, almost twice the amount paid to Joe Biden for doing whatever he does. But he's only from Delaware.

The top paychecks include:

Chief of Staff William Daley, who is the brother of Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, who just retired and left the top Democratic-machine job there to Rahm Emanuel, who was Obama's chief of staff and before that held the Chicago House seat of Rod Blagojevich, who had given it up to become governor of Illinois, which he no longer is due to impeachment and, now, conviction on 17 counts of fraud.

The Daleys' father, Richard J. Daley, was also a longtime Chicago mayor whose operatives provided Illinois' crucial electoral votes to elect John F. Kennedy president back in 1960 before Obama was born.

Valerie Jarrett has a White House title as long as Chicago's winters (senior advisor and assistant to the president for intergovernmental affairs and public engagement). Before this, she was a chief of staff for the most recent Mayor Daley and hired an assistant named Michelle Robinson, who went on, of course, to become Mrs. Barack Obama, whose chief of staff also earns the top $172G paycheck.

This year, the one before Obama's attempted reelection, he reduced his staff by 15 people and $1.7 million.

Some White House aides have already returned to Chicago as campaign employees, including political strategist David Axelrod, who helped elect the most recent Mayor Daley, as well as, briefly, Sen. Obama and then President Obama. Axelrod also made the top salary when he had to live in Washington.

All 45 Republican senators filed a brief with the Supreme Court on Tuesday which argued Obama went too far in appointing members to the National Labor Relations Board in January 2012. That board has been behind a host of union-friendly decisions, and the dispute over Obama's appointees threatens to upend those rulings -- as well as stall the board itself.

Republicans, in their brief, urged the high court to rule on the validity of the 2012 appointments, while arguing that Obama overstepped his bounds.

""The president's decision to circumvent the American people by installing his appointees at a powerful federal agency while the Senate was continuing to hold sessions, and without obtaining the advice and consent of the Senate, is an unprecedented power grab,"" Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said in a written statement. ""We will demonstrate to the Court how the president's unconstitutional actions fundamentally endanger the Congress' role in providing a check on the excesses of the executive branch.""

The brief itself was submitted by attorney Miguel Estrada, whom the Republicans retained for work on this case.

Estrada wrote that Obama's actions ""would radically reshape the constitutional structure"" if allowed to stand.

""If he can override Senate procedures and second-guess its account of its actions, there is no telling what mischief he can achieve,"" he wrote.

At issue are so-called recess appointments, a tactic used by presidents of both parties in the past. Obama has made 32 of them to date, while his predecessor, George W. Bush, made 171 over his two terms. Bill Clinton logged 139 recess appointments.

But a federal appeals court ruled earlier this year that the president made appointments to the NLRB when the Senate was not technically in recess, and therefore the appointments were invalid.

A second appeals court ruled in May that another NLRB appointment from 2010 was also made when the Senate was merely adjourned. The court again ruled that the appointment was invalid.

The administration argues that invalidating these appointments would invalidate recess appointments going back 100 years.

But Republicans, and the business battling the NLRB in the prior case, argue that Obama has stretched his authority.

The Obama administration had earlier appealed the January decision to the Supreme Court."

But after Election Day in November, huge political success met financial opportunity. The people in their 20s and 30s from the Obama tech team had seen others just like them get incredibly rich on innovations (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) that were as transformational as anything they could hope to achieve in government. Now they started to think about what innovations they could bring to the market.

A.M.G. may be the most baldly commercial of the new crop of companies coming out of the cave, but they are all trying to translate what they learned there into future success. A few weeks ago, Wagner announced he was starting a new firm called Civis Analytics with an investment from Eric Schmidt, the Google executive chairman, who was a technology adviser during the campaign. As Wagner described it to me, he would use analytics to help nonprofit and for-profit companies reach out to segments of the population they were struggling to connect with. One of his first clients is the College Board, which runs the national SAT test. Civis will identify “kids who are low-income, high-achieving but not meeting their college potential.” The “commercial applicability is wide,” he said, so the company will not be averse to working with big, for-profit companies of all kinds.

Carol Davidsen was also recruited by A.M.G., but she decided to take the lessons of the Obama campaign in a different direction. If anything, her approach is almost anticorporate, even though she said she was not against getting rich if she could. Her company, called Cir.cl, which she founded with a campaign programmer, Joshua Thayer, endeavors to find people with complementary interests who may have reason to do business with each other, like parents with baby equipment to dispose of and parents-to-be in the market for that equipment. She calls it “recommerce.”

“I have a lot of friends with kids,” she said one recent Friday at her new office, a bouncy-ball and Mac-strewn onetime closet space in an industrial building in Downtown Brooklyn. “There’s this little plastic play house. Does every single one of those need to go into a garbage dump? Why did we give up on doing business with each other? Why is it always to big corporations? It doesn’t have to be.” Explaining her choice to me, she said, “I don’t want to spend my time optimizing for Coke.”

When I talked to Chauncey McLean in Brooklyn in April, he walked me through how the campaign’s technological achievements could translate into services provided to private businesses, like Caesars. The casino had gobs of data on its customers. “We have a giant list of people, and we need to make a model of likely customers,” he said. A.M.G. would break them down along a range of Caesars Scores, à la Wagner’s persuadable scores. Then A.M.G. could work through it and direct advertising toward those whose visits had fallen off: find what they watch via Rentrak in the greatest concentrations and then ply them with TV advertising.

Over several meetings with McLean and his young A.M.G. staff members, I asked them to talk about the switch in mission from getting Obama elected to helping Fortune 500 companies sell stuff. Will St. Clair, who helped write the campaign’s Facebook program, said he saw himself as a programmer first and foremost and only joined A.M.G. after deciding that he didn’t want “to play the Internet start-up billionaire game, which is a lot less fun than it looks on paper.” Gaurav Shirole said he was considering a job in the Treasury Department when McLean approached him. “I’m a Silicon Valley kid, so the start-up bug has been there forever.”

Frommann acknowledged having ventured into politics with a certain idealism. “We’ve all watched ‘The West Wing,’ like, four times, and we want to do our small part to change the world,” he said. Politics, he said, was emotionally satisfying. Corporate clients meant new data sets, “stuff I haven’t worked with before, intellectually that’s interesting to me.”"

USA TODAY

Sen. Graham says Hillary Clinton should testify about Benghazi%2C under subpoena if necessary

He played a role in arranging the dramatic testimony of Gregory Hicks%2C the No. 2 U.S. official in Libya

He denies partisan politics in growing criticism of Clinton%2C a possible 2016 presidential nominee

WASHINGTON – South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said Thursday that former secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton should return to Capitol Hill -- under subpoena if necessary -- to answer new questions about the attacks on a U.S. consulate in Libya that left four Americans dead.

In an interview on Capital Download, USA TODAY's weekly video newsmaker series, Graham said the account of the Benghazi assaults last Sept. 11 offered by Clinton and other Obama administration officials had been undercut in congressional testimony Wednesday by three State Department officials, including Gregory Hicks, the No. 2 U.S. official in Libya at the time.

Hicks described a closer involvement by Clinton than previously known, including a phone call he received from her at 2 a.m. that deadly night. While the crisis unfolded, his pleas for a military response to the assaults were rejected. Afterward, he said he was castigated by Clinton's chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, for talking about the attack with a member of Congress who was visiting Libya.

Graham, a leading critic of the administration on Benghazi, said he had played a role in arranging Hicks' testimony.

""I got a call from a friend of his who said this Greg Hicks is really torn about what to do"" about an official account of events he saw as inaccurate, Graham said. ""So I got a phone number; I gave him a call. In March, we met here in the office. And I said, 'I don't know whether I can get the Senate to take this up, but the House is interested in finding out what happened in Benghazi.'""

He described Hicks as a reluctant witness. ""He's probably the typical State Department person -- very diplomatic, very reserved -- but this was gnawing at him,"" Graham said. ""It was really eating him up.""

Hicks testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., a fierce Obama critic.

In January, before she left the administration, Clinton answered questions about Benghazi at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, angrily rebuffing suggestions that the administration had misled Americans about the attacks for political reasons, seven weeks before Election Day. At the time, United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice said in a string of Sunday morning TV appearances that the attacks might have been a spontaneous uprising sparked by an anti-Muslim video that had been posted on YouTube.

In fact, Hicks testified, he and other U.S. officials in Libya immediately realized it was a planned attack by terrorists.

Graham, interviewed in his Senate office, said Clinton should return to Congress to address the issues raised. Should she be subpoenaed?

""I hope she would come back without that, but yes,"" he replied. ""I think she needs to come back and answer questions. Did she know that Cheryl Mills called the DCM (deputy chief of mission) to tell him, watch the member of Congress and don't talk to him? And there's now evidence that she was made aware of the security concerns and basically ignored security requests.""

He said Mills and Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and others also should be called to testify about the attacks. Those killed included Christopher Stephens, the first U.S. ambassador to die in the line of duty in a generation.

Republicans began this week to more openly hold Clinton responsible both for inadequate security at the consulate before the attack and for misleading characterizations about it afterward. Graham denied the criticism was partisan or an effort to dent the reputation of the leading prospect for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016.

He noted Democrats had praised him during the Bush administration when he faulted then-Defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld and then-vice president Dick Cheney on national security issues.

""When ... we were pushing back against Rumsfeld and Cheney about Iraq in the early years, as not going well -- it's not a few 'dead-enders' -- we were great patriots,"" he said. ""When you question Secretary Clinton and President Obama, it's a little bit different from our Democratic friends.""

Bob Menendez has denied soliciting prostitutes in the Dominican Republic but admitted he traveled at least three times on a donor’s private plane to and from the country.

The statement comes on the heels of an FBI raid on wealthy ophthalmologist Dr. Salomon Melgen’s Miami office late Tuesday evening and internal FBI emails showing the bureau is investigating the Senator’s alleged solicitation of allegedly underage prostitutes in the Dominican.

“Dr. Melgen has been a friend and political supporter of Senator Menendez for many years,” Menendez’s office said in a Wednesday statement, according to the Washington Post. “Senator Menendez has traveled on Dr. Melgen’s plane on three occasions, all of which have been paid for and reported appropriately. Any allegations of engaging with prostitutes are manufactured by a politically-motivated right-wing blog and are false.”

When the story first broke, National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) executive director Rob Jesmer called on Menendez to release all his travel records. He has not done that, and his spokeswoman Tricia Enright did not immediately respond to a Breitbart News request for the travel records.

Jesmer said the allegations against Menendez are “very serious and deserve examination.”

“Fortunately, there is a simple way for Senator Menendez to begin addressing these questions, and that is by releasing his schedule and travel records related to Easter Week of this year, as well as the other dates in question,” Jesmer said.

This reporter broke the story while writing for The Daily Caller last year and interviewed two Dominican Republic women in November who claimed Menendez paid them for sex around Easter-time last year. The encounter apparently took place at Casa de Campo, a posh 7,000-acre resort in the Dominican Republic. Each woman told this reporter that Menendez had agreed to pay them $500 for sex but only paid them $100."

Robert Menendez says the confession shows the accusations are ""false smears"" A Dominican woman says she was paid to say she had sex with the New Jersey Democrat A video of the woman first appeared on conservative website the Daily Caller The Daily Caller says the woman was not in the video

Sen. Robert Menendez slammed accusations that he had paid a Dominican woman for sex and expressed hope Tuesday that those behind the claims would be exposed in the wake of the woman’s notarized confession that she’d never even met the New Jersey Democrat.

“I hope that you will all vigorously go after who was the source and purpose as you did go after the story at the time,” he told reporters.

In a notarized statement filed in court, Nexis de los Santos Santana said she was filmed without her knowledge when she claimed that Menendez had paid her to have sex.

“I am the person in the video, that is me, and those are my words, but this statement is not true,” Santana said in the statement. “I never agreed to be recorded.”

In addition to criticism over accepting unreported plane flights and allegedly advocating on behalf of a business, Menendez was accused of partying with prostitutes in the Dominican Republic – accusations he said were “unsubstantiated.”

As he did when the claims first emerged, Menendez said Tuesday the claims are “false smears” lifted from right-wing blogs ahead of the election.

Menendez faces scrutiny over ties to Florida doctor

“Look, I don’t know more than what I have read. But I do know from the very beginning I have said that nameless, faceless, anonymous sources … from the right wing blogs took this story which was just false smears right before an election cycle, attempted to do it then, and ultimately drove it into the mainstream press,” he said. “But they were never anything other than false smears.”

The confession document was presented at a press conference Monday by lawyer Vinicio Castillo, who said Santana was recruited to make the claims against Menendez by another lawyer, Dr. Miguel Galvan.

Galvan, in a notarized confession, pins the blame on a third lawyer, who Galvan said asked him to assist in a divorce case by finding “witnesses” to claim they had sex for money with Menendez.

CNN has attempted to reach both the lawyers who allegedly recorded the escort making the claims against Menendez, but has not yet received a response.

Questions revolve around his relationship with Salomon Melgen, the Florida man who owned a plane Menendez admits having flown three times – once on official Senate business, and twice for personal reasons – to the Dominican Republic in 2010.

Melgen, his wife, Flor, and his daughter, Melissa, have been generous donors to Menendez, his fellow Democrats and related causes in recent years. Castillo is Melgen’s cousin and spokesman.

In January, Menendez paid approximately $58,500 to Melgen for the flights he took in 2010, chalking up the lapse in payment to his busy schedule.

On Tuesday, Menendez answered questions about intervening on issues on Melgen’s behalf by saying, “we raise questions all the time for a wide range of universe on public policy issues and we think that those are all legitimate.”

A law enforcement official said last week the FBI was continuing to “pursue all leads” surrounding the Menendez allegations, including the prostitution charges.

The same law enforcement source said federal agents had gone to the Dominican Republic in hopes of finding the women who claimed to have had sex with Menendez, but that the women had not yet been located.

The Daily Caller, a conservative website, originally published the video with two women claiming they had sex with Menendez for money. In an article published Tuesday, the Daily Caller said Santana was not one of the two women who were featured in the video, though Santana asserted in the notarized court document she was one of the women.

In her statement Monday, Santana said she was told she would be paid well for reading the script. Both she and Galvan requested legal protection in making their confessions.

Steve Scalise (R-LA) has called on President Barack Obama to fire John Podesta as his senior adviser in the wake of startling revelations about comments he has made.

In an interview with Politico for a Politico Magazine profile, Podesta compared the Republican Party to the Jonestown cult that Jim Jones led in the 1970s, of which 900 members committed mass suicide via cyanide poisoning in 1978.

“They [the Obama administration] need to focus on executive action given that they are facing a second term against a cult worthy of Jonestown in charge of one of the houses of Congress,” Podesta said of what the administration must do in dealing with the Republican controlled House.

Scalise thinks such comments should be a fireable offense. He called on Obama to take action and terminate Podesta’s employment right away.

“It’s disgraceful and telling that President Obama’s new Counselor is not only comparing the Republican Party to a cult that murdered those who disagreed with them, but is also using that comparison as an argument in support of shredding the Constitution and governing like a third-world dictator,” Scalise said in a statement provided to Breitbart News. “The American people will not stand by and allow the Obama White House to destroy the checks-and-balances defined in the Constitution that are critical to a working democracy, and neither will Congress!”

“The American people elected a divided government in Washington, and the Obama Administration would do well to respect that fact instead of undermining the will of the American people at every turn,” he continued. “President Obama ran to change the tone in Washington, and it’s time for him to live up to that promise by relieving Mr. Podesta of his official duties immediately.”

Scalise is not the only Republican upset about Podesta’s rhetoric. Rory Cooper, the spokesman for House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA), said in a statement provided to Breitbart News that such comments make it difficult for House Republicans to work with the administration.

“This type of appalling and inflammatory rhetoric is a very troubling sign of how this White House plans to govern over the next three years,” Cooper said.

Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), a freshman conservative member, said in a statement provided to Breitbart News that the American people should not accept Podesta’s or the White House’s arguments for executive orders and exceeding new authority on the administration’s behalf.

“Faced with an imploding health care law built on a façade of deception, ruling class leftists like John Podesta resort to vitriolic attacks against, and demonization of, their political opponents,” DeSantis said. “This seems like an entirely baseless excuse for the President to act unilaterally in ways that exceed his constitutional authority.”"

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that Republicans are waiting for Holder's response to a letter about the apparent discrepancy between his sworn testimony and reports about his involvement in the near prosecution of Fox News reporter James Rosen.

""It is fair to say we're investigating the conflict in his remarks, those remarks were made under oath, but we also think it’s very important that the attorney general be afforded the opportunity to respond, so we will wait to pass judgment on that until we receive his response,"" Goodlatte said.

The Justice Department accused Rosen of being a criminal co-conspirator in the prosecution of a former administration official who had provided Rosen information about North Korea. Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said on ""Fox News Sunday"" there was no contradiction between Holder's testimony and his involvement in the case because Holder said he was not involved in the ""near prosecution"" of journalists and Rosen had not been prosecuted.

""It is often the practice in cases where you have investigations that you target somebody for the purpose of gathering information with never having any intention of prosecuting them,"" Van Hollen said.

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) suggested on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that Holder should consider resigning. ""The attorney general has to ask himself the question, is he really able to serve the president of the United States and the American people under the present circumstances?""

""The attorney general has definitely lost the trust of the American people,"" Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""I think it will take a generation to rebuild trust in the federal government at this point.""

But Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), also appearing on ""Meet the Press,"" said there's been no perjury and that Holder should stay, despite the mounting calls for his resignation.

“There have been all kinds of accusations, but I haven’t seen anything that would prevent him from continuing to do his job,” Schumer said. ""Let’s not forget for two years, many of our hard right colleagues spent a lot of their time on Fast and Furious and I’m sure there were calls for Holder to step down. He continued to do his job well and then the IG exonerated him on Fast and Furious."""

Car salesman dipping into retirement savings for chance to talk to Obama

Paul Scott says he has been assured he will get to talk to the president briefly

He is one of 25 contributors at Democratic fundraiser in Santa Monica%2C Calif.

A Los Angeles car salesman and electric car advocate is shelling $32,400 out of his retirement savings so he can make a pitch directly to President Obama at a ""private, off-the-record"" Democratic fundraiser next week.

Paul Scott, 60, says he isn't a rich guy. He's a $50,000-a-year Nissan salesman who plans to rub elbows with 24 bigwigs in a private luncheon that he says will put a crimp in his retirement plans.

But he says the goal is worthwhile. He wants to make a few points to Obama about on how to better support electric cars -- a cause that Obama already embraces -- and thought the private audience would be a fine way to do it.

So when a solicitation came for the fundraiser, Scott says he was told that he'd get a chance sometime over the luncheon to offer his advice directly to the president. ""That was something I had to confirm before I wrote the check,"" Scott says. At least two minutes, probably no more than four, he says he was told.

The fundraiser who sent the email could not be immediately be reached for comment. A copy was provided to USA TODAY, and it includes a menu of choices with prices when it comes to seeing the Obama in person at the June 7 fundraiser in Santa Monica, Calif.

For $10,000, you can be a luncheon guest. For $16,200, you can be a VIP luncheon guest and have your picture taken with Obama. For $32,400, the package ""includes an official photograph with President Obama, as well as a very special one-hour roundtable discussion with the President after the luncheon. President Obama will take your questions in a private, off-the-record conversation where you can discuss with him what you'd like. Please note this is limited to 25 people to keep it an intimate discussion, and so will sell out very fast.""

Having signed up, Scott is already mapping strategy.

""I am not going to sit quietly,"" Scott, co-founder of advocacy group Plug In America, says in an interview. ""I am not going to hope that I get to talk. If it's a free for all, I'll do what I can.""

He wants to tell Obama that as an electric car expert he believes the administration needs to push for a so-called ""carbon tax"" that would raise prices on oil-based fuels, making electric car prices more competitive.

He wants to ask Obama to increase his efforts to convince Congress to make electric-car rebates at the point of sale, not months later as part of a $7,500 tax incentive. He says he wants it even if Obama were to back down on increasing the incentive to $10,000.

And he says he wants to tell Obama to be more vigorous in standing up to opponents of electric cars and to support groups like Plug In America. ""I can sell more cars,"" says Scott, who specializes in electric vehicles, or EVs. ""I am getting hammered in the press with all the anti-EV stuff.""

He acknowledges that spending more than half a year's pay on a single hour at a group lunch with Obama will set him back. He won't be able to afford trips like the one he'd planned to Costa Rica, ""but I'm not going to starve to death.""

He considered other less expensive ways to try to make his point to Obama. But when the fundraising solicitation came, ""I figured what the hell, I'll go tell him to his face."""
http://www.breitbart.com/InstaBlog/2013/09/16/Benghazi-Oversight-Report-Asks-Why-Patrick-Kennedy-Was-Not-Held-Accountable,2013-09-16 00:00:00,['John Sexton'],Benghazi Oversight Report Asks Why Patrick Kennedy Was Not Held Accountable,"A staff report prepared for Rep. Darrell Issa and released today finds numerous failings in the ARB report on Benghazi released last year. The new report overturns some of the conclusions of the official ARB report. It finds that Under Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy, who was not criticized in the ARB report, should have been held accountable.

The new report is based on public statements but also on transcripts of numerous interviews undertaken since the release of the ARB report. It concurs with some portions of the earlier ARB report and disputes others. For instance, the new report finds that Charlene Lamb was at fault for decisions she made with regard to security in Libya. However the new report also provides a partial basis for exonerating Lamb since evidence suggests that every personnel decisions related to Libya was directly approved (or disapproved) by Under Secretary Kennedy.

A key exchange appears on page 63 of the report when Committee staff interview Deputy Assistant Secretary for Maghreb Affairs Maxwell about the involvement of Under Secretary Kennedy in events taking place in Libya prior to the 9/11 attack [Emphasis in original]:

Q.The DCM, Mr. Hicks, testified that Ambassador Kennedy was very engaged on a minute level about the incidents that were occurring in Benghazi in the months leading up to the attacks. A.Yep. Q. Does that surprise you? A. It does not. We–one of the things that I found interesting was that the Under Secretary approved every person that went in or came out of Tripoli… * * * A. The DAS Assistant Secretary reports to the Under Secretary for Management. The way the Under Secretary for Management runs things, there is no decision that DS makes that doesn’t have his input and his imprimatur, his approval. There is no decision that DS doesn’t make that doesn’t have his disapproval. DS–the Under Secretary for Management speaks for DS for all practical purposes, and there is no decision that DS makes that the Under Secretary for Management is not involved in. Q.So, the important decisions about the security posture in Libya leading up to the attacks, if Mr. Boswell was held accountable for those decisions, is it fair to say that the Under Secretary for Management would have had a role in those decisions? A. Absolutely.

Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security Eric Boswell, one of the four individuals named in the ARB report, also told Oversight staff that Kennedy was the “ultimate decisionmaker” when it came to the removal of the SST team from Libya. This was the team of soldiers which Ambassador Stevens and others hoped to keep in Libya but which was removed weeks before the attack. Boswell also told Oversight staffers that “any decision about travel in and out, staffing levels was made by” Kennedy. This included both the assignment of diplomatic staff and security personnel.

Executive Director of the Near Eastern Affairs Bureau Lee Lohman told Oversight that he attended a meeting at which Kennedy personally examined schematics for the villa in Benghazi. Lohman said Kennedy was “heavily” involved in choosing the facility.

The report also points out that Kennedy was the single individual who, based on a staff recommendation, approved keeping the Benghazi post open as a temporary facility for an additional year. It was because the compound was temporary and not a permanent site that its security was staffed on a temporary basis by DS agents on leave from other positions. The temporary staffing system was intended to fill single openings or gaps in staffing on a short term basis, not provide and entire staff indefinitely. As a result, DS never had a full security compliment in place in Benghazi.

The new report also criticizes Kennedy’s role in presenting a false image of accountability to the public. Under Secretary Kennedy informed Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security Eric Boswell that he had been singled out in the ARB report. Boswell offered his resignation and Kennedy accepted it. However Kennedy simultaneously encouraged Boswell to hang on to another position he held. A few days later, Kennedy told Boswell he was being placed on administrative leave. However, quoting Boswell from the Oversight interview, Kennedy told Boswell “he didn’t think it would last long.”

The Oversight report strongly suggests that the ARB report should have assigned blame to Under Secretary Kennedy for his involvement in numerous decisions which created the lax security situation in Benghazi.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/04/26/New-York-Times-Reveals-Obama-s-Maneuvers-And-Motives-On-Pigford,2013-04-26 00:00:00,['Lee Stranahan'],Pigford: NYT Pegs Obama for Vote-Buying Scheme,"The New York Times has vindicated the news sense of Andrew Breitbart and years of Breitbart News coverage of the Pigford scandal with a front page, above the fold blockbuster of investigative journalism that adds new details about the fraud in the USDA farmer settlements and the key role that Barack Obama has played in Pigford dating back to his days as a Senator.

Andrew Breitbart worked tirelessly to expose the Pigford fraud scheme only to have the clear evidence of manipulation by politicians and plaintiff lawyers ignored by the mainstream media. The story involved politicians and lawyers hijacking a lawsuit by black farmers against the USDA designed to make up for years of discrimination and turning it into a multi-billion dollar fraud where people claiming to have ‘attempted to farm’ were able to collect $50,000 checks with no proof. The Obama administration expanded the program for Native Americans, Hispanics, and women, using the same low “attempted to farm” standard that invited massive, undetectable fraud.

The Times piece was written by a team led by Sharon LaFraniere, who worked on the story for months and according to the article “was based on thousands of pages of court and confidential government documents, as well as interviews with dozens of claimants, lawyers, former and current government officials and others involved in the cases over the past 14 years.”

Here are some highlights from the article, including a number of details not previously reported:

Questionable Legal Moves

The Times story gives a great deal of detail about how the Obama administration certified its own settlement in the cases of the Native American, women, and Hispanic farmer settlements, sidestepping both the legal system ad Congress. Breitbart News has reported on the Obama administration’s expansion of Pigford previously, but the Times brought shocking new information to light.

For one thing, there were only a total of 91 plaintiffs actually filing suit; 10 women and 81 Latinos. This is a very small number and it certainly would have been possible to handle any actual discrimination claims on a case-by-case basis. However, the Times points out that the government was very skeptical even about those cases.

“Some of these folks have never made a loan payment in their entire history with U.S.D.A.,” Lisa A. Olson, the lead government litigator against the 81 Hispanic plaintiffs, told Judge Robertson in August 2009. “There may even be folks who are under criminal investigation.”

The Obama Administration made a choice to create a settlement mechanism on their own. The Times says “the Obama administration’s political appointees at the Justice and Agriculture Departments engineered a stunning turnabout: they committed $1.33 billion to compensate not just the 91 plaintiffs but thousands of Hispanic and female farmers who had never claimed bias in court.”

With pressure mounting from some in Congress, “The Obama administration made the ‘legally questionable’ decision to sidestep Congress and pay the woman and Hispanic farmer claims out of a special Treasury Department fund known as The Judgment Fund. “

The small number of actual cases is also significant because of the disparity in the number of actual suits and the number of claims filed so far in the cases; only ten women were actually filing suit but an incredible 24,000 have filed to get $50,000 under the settlement still active at the FarmerClaims.gov website.

Pigford Was About Buying Votes

Even the New York Times has trouble getting Department of Justice officials to speak on record on the story. The Times says, “Acting Associate Attorney General Tony West, who supervised the civil division and oversaw the handling of the cases, canceled an interview. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. also declined to comment.”

This 2008 article from the San Francisco Chronicle profiles Tony West, who was then the California finance co-chair for the Obama campaign and is described as an “Obama power broker.” West, a deep Obama campaign insider, oversaw the settlements for the Obama administration.

This is another indication that the Pigford scandal was about vote buying and elections for the politicians involved. Much of the original Pigford corruption traces to Arkansas. That was no accident but was at the behest of the man who was President when the first Pigford settlement was designed, Bill Clinton. From the Times:

Mr. Clinton asked Carol Willis, then a senior adviser to the Democratic National Committee who was known for his expertise in black voter turnout, to get involved. Mr. Willis said the president wanted to make sure his home state, Arkansas, benefited.

During the 2008 elections, the Times details how the Obama administration used Pigford for election purposes. From the Times:

..legislators from both parties, including Mr. Obama as a senator in 2007, sponsored bills to grant the late filers relief. Mr. Boyd said Mr. Obama’s support led him to throw the backing of his 109,000-member black farmers’ association behind the Obama presidential primary campaign. Hilary Shelton, the N.A.A.C.P.’s chief lobbyist, said Mr. Obama’s stance helped establish him as a defender of the concerns of rural African-American communities.

And the Times makes it clear that others felt the settlements were buying off special interests. A professor from U.C. Berkley testified for the government that there was no pattern of discrimination by the USDA against Native American farmers."

The 70-year-old Democrat vowed to change his behavior, admitting “I need help.”

“I have reached into my heart and soul and realize I must and will change my behavior,” Filner said, indicating he will not resign. He said he and his staff will take the sexual harassment training offered by the city.

“If my behavior doesn’t change, I cannot succeed in leading this city,” Filner said.

On a DVD given to the media, Filner said: “As someone who has spent a lifetime fighting for equality for all people, I am embarrassed to admit that I have failed to fully respect the women who work for me and with me, and that at times I have intimidated them.”

Filner, elected in November, said he knows that San Diego residents “have every right to be disappointed” in him but asked that “you give me an opportunity to prove I am capable of change, so that the vision I have for our city’s future can be realized.”

Filner was not available to answer questions about the allegations.

Earlier Thursday, three longtime Filner friends and supporters — former City Councilwoman Donna Frye and lawyers Marco Gonzalez and Cory Briggs — called on him to resign for what one called “truly reprehensible” behavior toward several women on his staff.

Frye, her voice breaking, said the women “are too scared to speak.” Briggs said his message to the women is, “When you’re ready to file lawsuits, I’ll be standing in court.”

“The mayor is in control of the script,” Gonzalez said. “The next chapter will largely be defined by his response.”

Gonzalez said late Thursday that he, Frye, and Briggs would not comment on Filner’s statement until Friday.

The mayor was particularly stung by Frye’s call for his resignation. “When a friend like Donna Frye is compelled to call for my resignation, I’m clearly doing something wrong,” Filner said.

Even as he issued his apology, Filner sought to indicate his support for anti-sex harassment measures.

“It’s a good thing that behavior that would have been tolerated in the past is being called out in this generation for what it is: inappropriate and wrong,” Filner said.

Members of the press, who consistently hide behind their own objectivity, have been forced to come out in Fox News’ favor in the Department of Justice targeting of Fox News journalist James Rosen. Democrats have been forced to come out of the woodwork to declare that the Obama administration’s treatment of journalists has indeed been abysmal.

But this is a political set-up that cannot hold. The journalistic establishment is generally all too happy to watch their conservative colleagues burned at the stake. Only the fact that the Associated Press was targeted before James Rosen forces the press to embrace the united front approach against the administration.

So what comes next?

The Obama administration surely will not stop targeting its opponents in the press. Whether they are monitoring James Rosen’s communications, screaming at CBS News reporter Sharyl Attkisson for daring to cover the Fast and Furious scandal, or giving “advice” to Bob Woodward about covering President Obama, the White House operates through intimidation. For years, the White House has made Fox News its primary target in the anti-media war, recognizing that the rest of the media would play along.

Now Obama and company must win back their traditional media allies. That will start with a coordinated play – likely led by White House ally Media Matters – directed at Fox News. An opinion host will be targeted for destruction, and the White House will jump in with both feet. Other reporters, recognizing the cover provided by the White House targeting an opinion journalist at Fox News rather than a straight reporter, will join in. Soon the alliance between Fox News and their erstwhile friends will be broken completely, even as the mainstream press pretends to back journalistic integrity.

This game is not over. Not by a long shot. The Democrats and their press allies know that turning on Fox News is the only way to prevent the burgeoning Obama scandals from turning their man into an early lame duck. The united front will undoubtedly cave soon.

The question, then, is simple: will the American people hold the members of the Democrat-Media Complex accountable for abandoning their journalistic mission in favor of Obama administration shilling?

Website says contacts allegedly took place in Dominican Republic

FBI raided campaign donor%27s office in Florida

Allegations surfaced in e-mails described as suspect

WASHINGTON — Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey denied Wednesday that he accepted free plane trips and contact with prostitutes from a Florida eye doctor whose offices were raided by federal agents Tuesday night.

The raid, reported by The Miami Herald, targeted Salomon Melgen, a physician described by the newspaper as a prominent campaign donor to Menendez and other Democrats. The Herald said Melgen owes $11.1 million in back taxes.

The conservative Daily Caller news website quotes anonymous sources who allege Melgen provided Menendez with prostitutes — some of them underage — at his luxury home at the Casa de Campo resort in the Dominican Republic.

Menendez' office issued a statement Wednesday denying the allegations.

""Dr. Melgen has been a friend and political supporter of Sen. Menendez for many years,"" the statement read. ""Sen. Menendez has traveled on Dr. Melgen's plane on three occasions, all of which have been paid for and reported appropriately. Any allegations of engaging with prostitutes are manufactured by a politically motivated right-wing blog and are false.""

Menendez's office did not say whether the three trips were to the Dominican Republic or elsewhere. The statement also did not say how the trips were reported or how Menendez paid for them — with his own money or through his senatorial or campaign accounts.

The Associated Press reported it found no records reporting payments to Melgen or trips aboard Melgen's plane in six years' worth of office and travel-related expenses for Menendez's Senate office, or in six years' worth of campaign expenses on file with the Federal Election Commission.

FBI Special Agent James Marshall confirmed Wednesday that ""we are conducting law enforcement activity in the general vicinity"" of Metrocentre Boulevard, the location of one of Melgen's offices in West Palm Beach, Fla.

Marshall declined to comment further.

According to the Herald story, the FBI investigation is believed to focus on Melgen's finances and allegations that he provided Menendez with free trips and prostitutes. Prostitution is legal in the Dominican Republic. Menendez is divorced and has two children.

A reporter for The Daily Caller asked Menendez about the allegations on Monday as a Gannett Washington Bureau reporter was interviewing the senator about an unrelated topic.

""I'm not going to respond to the fallacious allegations of your story,"" Menendez said.

On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada defended Menendez during a news conference, saying, ""I always consider the source,"" referring to The Daily Caller.

""All anyone here has to look at is the source where this comes from,"" he said. ""It's a source that has brought up a lot of non-issues.""

The Daily Caller first published a story about the allegations last fall, prompting Samuel Thompson, chairman of the Middlesex County, N.J., Republican Organization and a New Jersey state senator, to ask the state Senate ethics committee to investigate whether Menendez had failed to report the trips on expense reports.

It's unclear whether the ethics committee, which does not comment on current investigations, is looking into the allegations.

Thompson said Wednesday that he had not heard back from the committee.

The allegations appear to have first surfaced in April, when a tipster calling himself ""Peter Williams"" approached the Washington-based watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW).

CREW executive director Melanie Sloan said the group exchanged e-mails with Williams for several months in an attempt to confirm the allegations, but gave up when Williams refused to speak with the group by phone.

""We just had no way to know whether these things were true or not, but he had a lot of detail,"" Sloan said.

CREW forwarded the e-mails in July to the FBI, other Justice Department officials and ABC News.

On Wednesday, CREW released 56 pages of email exchanges between Williams and the group as well as a memo it sent the FBI summarizing the emails and detailing its own investigation based on them.

""While CREW has been unable to either prove or disprove that Sen. Menendez engaged in sexual conduct with underage girls in the Dominican Republic, we have been able to confirm some information provided,"" the group said, asking for ""an immediate, thorough, and fair investigation of these allegations.""

""If a top government official like Sen. Menendez – who has sworn to uphold the laws of the United States – has, in fact, engaged in the conduct alleged, he should be exposed and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" the group said.

Last week, e-mails that appear to have been sent between an FBI special agent, Regino Chavez, and Williams were forwarded to several media outlets. Those e-mails indicate the FBI followed up on CREW's contact with Williams, but Williams also refused to meet with FBI officials.

Chavez did not respond to a message left on his voice mail seeking comment for this story.

""I feel like we did the right thing by sending this to the FBI, but I am worried that someone may have been using us to smear a politician,"" Sloan said.

Sloan said she finds the timing of the allegations, which Williams told her date to 2008, suspect.

The allegations come as Menendez is about to become chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He replaces Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who was confirmed Tuesday as secretary of State. Menendez was re-elected last fall with 58.5% of the vote.

""There's reason to doubt the credibility of this stuff,"" Sloan said. ""There's reason to withhold judgment until we know more.""

Melgen, a registered Democrat, has made $193,350 in political contributions since 1998, including $14,200 to Menendez, according to FEC records. Menendez was chairman of the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee, which raises money for Democratic Senate candidates, from 2009 to 2011.

Jane Orie was imprisoned on corruption charges

Orie family blames prosecution on county attorney

A letter to nuns revealed Orie employees were doing illegal campaign work

PITTSBURGH (AP) — The story has more irony than a Greek tragedy. Three sisters from a devout Catholic family have seen their personal and political careers ruined by a scandal that began with, of all things, a letter to some nuns.

Thursday's conviction of suspended Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice Joan Orie Melvin along with her aide and sister, Janine Orie, on campaign corruption charges mean they might join a third sister — former state senator Jane Orie — in state prison. No sentencing date has been set.

The former senator was sentenced last year to 2½ to 10 years for using her state-paid staff to run her campaigns, though she was acquitted of having them campaign for Melvin, then a lower appellate court judge, who was running for the Supreme Court in 2003 and 2009. Joan Orie Melvin and Janine Orie were convicted in a spinoff investigation and found guilty of similarly misusing Melvin's former staff and the senator's.

Even before the convictions, their careers — and the family from which they sprang — were extraordinary.

Dr. John Orie, now 90, and his late wife, Jean, raised nine children including five attorneys, Joan and Jane among them; two cardiologists; a teacher; and a human resources manager, Janine, who worked for her sister Joan Orie Melvin in the lower Superior Court before moving up with her to the Supreme Court.

""It's all pretty unbelievable,"" said John Burkoff, a university of Pittsburgh law professor who has closely followed the cases. ""Whatever you thought about the Orie sisters, whether you liked or didn't like them, you have to look at all of this as tragic.""

Jim Roddey is a prominent businessman who heads the Republican Party in Allegheny County, where Republicans are outnumbered more than 2 to 1 by Democrats and where Pittsburgh, the county seat, hasn't elected a GOP mayor since the Great Depression.

Before 2010, when Republican Tom Corbett was elected governor, Jane Orie was the state Senate majority whip — the highest-ranking elected Republican politician not just in Pennsylvania, but also of several states in the Northeast, Roddey said. And Melvin, elected in November 2009, was one of seven members of the state's highest court.

And now? Jane Orie resigned her Senate seat in May, and Melvin's status on the state's highest court figures to change, one way or another.

State lawmakers have already asked her to resign or face articles of impeachment. If those are approved by the state House, Melvin would be tried by the Senate, which could remove her from office if she hasn't already been removed by the state's Court of Judicial Discipline.

Now that she has been convicted, Melvin has 30 days to respond to charges of misconduct filed with that court by the state's Judicial Conduct Board. If it is determined Melvin has violated professional conduct rules or the state Constitution, or brought disrepute to the judiciary, the court can remove her from office.

Melvin's criminal defense attorneys and her disciplinary court attorney didn't return calls Friday.

The Ories have argued the prosecution is the result of a political vendetta by Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala, a Democrat, who has repeatedly denied ulterior motives.

When the investigation first became public in late 2009, the sisters claimed they were being targeted because Zappala's family has interests in legalized gambling, which the Ories opposed expanding in Pennsylvania.

The allegations grew uglier, when Melvin — after it was known Sen. Orie was being investigated but before the justice was charged — called for an audit of two child care centers that paid kickbacks to two judges in northeastern Pennsylvania's Luzerne County who sent troubled youths to the facilities. The facilities were co-owned by Gregory Zappala, the prosecutor's brother, who was never charged in the scheme and has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.

To this day, some Orie supporters still believe those politics — not justice — drove the prosecution.

Roddey acknowledges the sisters' success in a politically hostile environment has something to do with that chatter.

""That's part of it,"" Roddey said. ""But the other half of the equation is that her prosecutor was Stephen Zappala, and Joan's biggest public battle was she chastised the Supreme Court for what happened in Luzerne County.""

Whatever the motivations, two juries have now found enough evidence to bring the overachieving siblings from triumph to tragedy despite a raft of supporters — Sen. Orie spent $420 on a chartered bus to bring 50 character witnesses to her trial — and, even, efforts to seek divine intervention.

During the investigation, which centered on the sisters' emails, prosecutors stumbled onto messages Sen. Orie and Melvin sent to the ""angel lady,"" a Philadelphia psychic who read her client's written questions aloud before claiming to receive a whispered answer from an angel.

The senator and justice sought assurances from the $85-an-hour medium that Zappala's investigation wouldn't result in criminal charges.

But rather than being touched by an angel, the sisters were undone by some nuns.

That happened in late October 2009 — days before Melvin won her Supreme Court seat — when a Senate intern complained to Zappala that Sen. Orie's staff was doing campaign work for Melvin.

The complaint centered on a letter Sen. Orie wrote on Melvin's campaign stationery asking Pittsburgh-area nuns to vote for Melvin.

When Orie and Melvin learned of the whistle-blowing intern, the senator had a staffer prepare another letter — a ""coverup"" letter, according to prosecutors. This time, Sen. Orie — on her own stationery — spoke about civic events of interest to nuns but didn't mention Melvin.

Prosecutors contend the letter was created to make it appear the intern was simply mistaken about what she saw and was never mailed. Eventually, Sen. Orie's and Melvin's staffs told a grand jury about other illegal campaign work done in Orie's Senate offices and Melvin's chambers.

""Frankly, it's a smart group of people. How could they put themselves in this kind of situation?"" Burkoff said. ""This is the kind of thing we'll be puzzling about for years."

Menendez-sponsored bill could have aided donor's investment, report says","Sen. Robert Menendez sponsored legislation with incentives for natural gas vehicle conversions that would benefit the biggest political donor to his re-election, the same eye doctor whose private jet Menendez used for two personal trips to the Dominican Republic, an Associated Press investigation found.

The disclosure reflects the latest intersection between the New Jersey Democrat who is the subject of an ethics inquiry on Capitol Hill and the Florida doctor involved in a federal criminal investigation.

Dr. Salomon Melgen invested in Gaseous Fuel Systems Corp. of Weston, Fla., and joined its board of directors in early 2010, according to the company's chief executive and a former company consultant. GFS, as the company is known, designs, manufactures and sells products to convert diesel-fuel fleets to natural gas. The amount of Melgen's investment is confidential under rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, but a 2009 document filed with the SEC showed the company required a minimum individual investment at that time of $51,500.

At the same time, Menendez emerged as a principal supporter of a natural gas bill that would boost tax credits and grants to truck and heavy vehicle fleets that converted to alternative fuels. The bill stalled in the Senate Finance Committee, and after it was revived in 2012, the NAT GAS Act failed to win the needed 60 votes to pass.

While the bill was under consideration between 2009 and 2011, the former consultant for GFS spent $220,000 lobbying Menendez's staff and other congressional and federal officials on the act's provisions as well as other regulatory issues, according to interviews and Senate records.

There is no evidence that Menendez offered direct help or intervened on behalf of the company or Melgen. Instead, the connection between the two men's interests in natural gas is the latest example of the close symmetry between the senator — who recently rose to become chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee — and his millionaire backer. It illustrates the way Menendez's political clout has at times overlapped with Melgen's financial investments.

In recent weeks, Menendez has acknowledged other dealings with Melgen. Menendez was compelled to reimburse $58,000 for two flights aboard Melgen's private jet that he had previously failed to report, prompting scrutiny by the Senate Ethics Committee. Menendez also acknowledged that his office had contacted U.S. health agencies in 2009 and 2012 to question their billing practices and policies amid a dispute between Melgen, an eye specialist, and federal health authorities. FBI agents in January searched Melgen's offices in Florida and seized files as part of a criminal investigation.

Menendez also raised concerns last year with State and Commerce Department officials about the Dominican Republic's reluctance to enforce a port security contract with a company that Melgen partly owns.

A spokeswoman for Menendez, Patricia Enright, told the AP that the senator supported the natural gas bill to help improve the environment. She said Menendez personally had no known discussions with either Melgen or others associated with GFS concerning the legislation or its impact on the company. She said it was unclear whether the senator will continue to support the bill he had sponsored.

Melgen's attorney in Miami, Kirk Ogrosky, told the AP in a statement that ""Dr. Melgen has never discussed his involvement with Gaseous Fuel Systems Corp. with either Sen. Menendez or his staff.""

An SEC document filed last week by GFS showed that Melgen remains on the company's board of directors. An earlier document filed by the firm in May 2011 was the first to show Melgen as a director. That SEC record showed a $6 million investment in the firm from two unnamed individuals.

The company's top executive, Ken Green, said Melgen is a key investor but has had no influence on the company's decision-making and has not attended any director's meetings since he joined the firm.

""Dr. Melgen hasn't ever been to our offices, not once,"" Green told the AP. ""He's a passive investor.""

Green said the Senate bill that Menendez supported would provide only limited help to his company because most of its provisions are aimed at heavy on-road vehicles like truck rigs and bus fleets. GFS has pioneered an engine conversion system that can be installed on diesel-fueled vehicles, but Green said it is marketed exclusively for off-road equipment, such as massive mining trucks. The tax credits proposed by the bill would do little to offset the cost to buyers of the off-road trucks, which can cost as much as $8 million, Green said.

""This bill won't do much of anything for us,"" he said.

But in 2010, when Melgen first invested in GFS, the firm was actively considering marketing its natural gas engine devices for on-road vehicles. The bill, both in its 2009 and 2012 versions, authorized changes to IRS rules allowing larger tax credits for on-road, natural gas-supplied trucks and vehicles as well as grants for research. The proposal also urged the Environmental Protection Agency to streamline rules covering the conversion of diesel and gas engines to natural gas and alternative fuels.

GFS said in October 2010 in a press release that its strategy ""integrates four related areas of business development,"" including ""on-road coal truck conversions."" The release, written by the company's consultant and then-director of strategic projects, Elio Muller, also said that ""a vast number of on-road 18-wheeler tractor-trailer trucks hauling coal"" in the Appalachian region of Kentucky and West Virginia could be converted to combination diesel-natural gas engines with the GFS system.

Muller, a former Commerce Department official in the Clinton administration involved in several Tampa businesses, said last week that he introduced Melgen to Green and other GFS officials in early 2010. Green also said Muller was instrumental in bringing the company to Melgen's attention. Muller said he has known Melgen from Florida's Democratic political circles dating back to the late 1990s. At one point, Muller drew up plans to start a business, Melgen & Muller Inc., but the men never followed through.

Melgen has made investments in health-related companies since the 1990s, according to SEC reports, but his GFS stake is his only evident natural gas-related investment. Green said he met several times with Melgen and found him to be an ""intelligent investor"" but could not explain his sudden interest in natural gas.

""I don't know how he found out about natural gas, but he liked what we were doing and thought it was innovative,"" Green said.

By early 2010, when Melgen formally joined GFS, Menendez had already taken on a key role in backing the natural gas bill, joining Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada and Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah as out-front sponsors.

The NAT GAS Act quickly drew energy and environmental battle lines. Oil and alternative energy magnate T. Boone Pickens led corporate natural gas industry backers of the bill, aided by the Obama administration and influential environmental groups. Arrayed against the bill were top oil and coal firms and even some green activists, joined by industrialists David and Charles Koch, whose political action group, Americans for Prosperity, harnessed opposition from conservative groups.

Green said he did not authorize or hire any lobbyists on behalf of GFS because he was skeptical about broadening into the markets for on-road trucks. But he did not block the activities of Muller, who in addition to his consulting role with GFS, had also started his own firm, Diesel 2 Gas. It aimed to license GFS technology and use the firm's parts to outfit on-road trucks.

In June 2010, representing both GFS and Diesel 2 Gas, Muller testified before an EPA panel in Ann Arbor, Mich., about what he called ""cumbersome and unnecessary"" rules that hurt GFS and other natural gas firms. The EPA agreed to alter its regulations in April 2011.

Between 2009 and 2011, Muller also ran an independent consulting firm, Muller Group Inc., which paid $220,000 to lobbyists from Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck LLP to lobby for the NAT GAS Act and related issues.

Muller said he accompanied the lobbyists in at least one meeting with Menendez' staff about the bill but could not recall details. Melgen and Muller joined Menendez at a signing ceremony in Miami in January 2010 for the senator's book, ""Growing American Roots."" And last June, they joined Menendez at the annual U.S.-Spain Council Annual Forum in Jersey City.

Muller said he did not discuss his lobbying activities with Melgen, even though they were both involved with GFS.

Both Muller and Melgen also have fundraising ties to Menendez. Muller gave $5,000 to Menendez' New Jersey Senate re-election campaign in 2011.

While she technically served a stint as a White House advisor to the President, her role has always been that of an aggressive political operator. That their meetings coincided with the IRS targeting of conservative and Tea Party organizations raises many questions.

Cutter may have had an official White House title, but she has always been a campaign operative. In 2010, she was named an Assistant to the President, charged with communications and outreach for ObamaCare. Presumably, it is in this role that she was in meetings with Shulman. This itself is odd, because as the IRS is tasked with implementing large swathes of ObamaCare, HHS is responsible for the public outreach and oversight of the public exchanges at the heart of the law.

Cutter has not revealed the details of the meetings she attended with Shulman. We don’t know the exact dates they met, except that they must have coincided with the IRS targeting of conservative groups. We do know that the targeting began around the time that ObamaCare was enacted.

It is hard to imagine a meeting agenda that would include both the supposedly non-partisan IRS Commissioner Shulman and the hyper-partisan Cutter. The IRS is supposed to develop technocratic rules to implement ObamaCare. Communications and outreach ought not be part of their mission. Could it be that part of the White House’s outreach plan on ObamaCare was to silence opponents?

Cutter should be called to testify under oath before the House Oversight Committee to explain the details of these meetings. Her portfolio at the time, communications and outreach, imply a political component that would not ordinarily be tasked to the IRS Commissioner. What, exactly, were the nature of these meetings?"

USA TODAY

The former Edwards campaign videographer is out with a new book

Hunter gave birth to a daughter in 2008

John Edwards was acquitted last year of one charge of misusing campaign funds to hide the affair

Rielle Hunter is apologizing for her affair with former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards.

In a column for The Huffington Post, the former campaign videographer and mother of Edwards' youngest daughter says she ""behaved badly.""

""That may seem obvious to you but it's taken me a long time to admit that, even to myself,"" Hunter said. ""For years, I was so viciously attacked by the media and the world that I felt like a victim. I now realize that the attacks are actually beside the point. The point is: I behaved badly.""

Edwards' extramarital affair, chronicled in tabloids and a book by a former aide, led to his downfall. He had initially denied the affair and paternity of Frances Quinn, the daughter Hunter gave birth to in 2008.

Hunter's new book, In Hindsight, What Really Happened: The Revised Edition: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me , hit bookshelves Tuesday. Her publisher suggested she go through her first book, which came out last year, ""annotating all of my regrets and mistakes,"" she wrote.

In her Huffington Post column, Hunter does not explain the current state of her relationship with Edwards but says she hurt Elizabeth Edwards, the candidate's wife who died in 2010, and the couple's children. Hunter told ABC News last year that they were no longer a couple but said she was still in love with John Edwards.

""I hurt her family. I hurt John's family,"" Hunter wrote. ""I hurt people who didn't know Elizabeth but loved her from afar. I hurt people who gave their hard-earned dollars to a campaign -- a cause they believed in.""

Edwards, a former senator and the 2004 Democratic vice presidential nominee, was indicted on six felony charges of misusing campaign money to cover up his affair. After a lengthy trial last year, Edwards was found not guilty on one count and a mistrial was declared on five others when the jury was deadlocked.

At the time, Edwards said he took responsibility for his ""sins.""

It’s sad.’,"SAN DIEGO--As the City Council prepares Friday to approve a mediation plan that includes Mayor Bob Filner’s resignation, his ex-fiancee has expressed not anger but sadness.

Just days before three ex-supporters went public last month with accusations of sexual harassment against Filner, Bronwyn Ingram broke off their engagement.

In an email to friends, she explained that Filner had become volatile with her and she had caught him making dates with other women.

Since then, Ingram, 48, a disability analyst with the Social Security Administration who says she shares Filner’s political agenda, has not been seen in public.

But Thursday, she appeared in Los Angeles at a news conference with attorney Gloria Allred, not to announce a lawsuit but to express her hopes that Filner’s resignation will “begin to bring closure to this painful chapter for all those involved.”

Ingram had campaigned with Filner and after his election had begun leading efforts to help the homeless. Filner referred to her as “San Diego’s first lady.” Ingram and the twice-divorced Filner were planning an October wedding.

“The platform that Bob and I campaigned on with the emphasis on empowering neighborhoods can and should move forward if that is still the will of the voters,” Ingram said.

Friday morning, Ingram appeared on “CBS This Morning” for an interview with Bill Whitaker.

“To have a Democratic mayor in a city that’s constantly run by Republicans,” she said, “was very exciting to a lot of us and we had big plans.”

She said she had not witnessed the 70-year-old Filner engaging in the abusive, harassing behavior that was alleged by 18 women in recent weeks. But she added, “I would find it hard to believe that they were all fabricating those stories.”

She was at a loss to explain Filner’s alleged misconduct. “I don’t know if it has anything to do with sex or love. I think it has to do with power and control, so of course, it feels awful, it feels horrible.”

Whitaker asked what she would tell Filner if she could speak to him.

“Why? Why did you do this?” she said. “This was not the plan. This was way off the plan. We could have done a lot. It’s sad.”

The City Council meets at 1 p.m. to consider the mediation plan sparked by a lawsuit filed by Allred on behalf of a former Filner aide.

But before they got too far into that, Obama had something else to say.

“With the prime minister’s permission, I want to make one other point,” Obama said, launching into an appeal for Congress to support more money for embassy security — a not-so-subtle reply to Republicans who’ve pounced on the president’s handling of last year’s attack on the diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya.

The remark signaled how Obama and his aides have decided to respond to the pounding they have taken in recent days as three controversies have threatened to interfere with his second-term agenda. The White House has tried to showcase Obama as a pragmatic leader taking decisive action, contrasting him with what the president’s aides see as a Washington establishment obsessed with scandal.

“My concern is making sure that, if there’s a problem in the government, that we fix it,” Obama said, one of five times he used the word “fix” in his comments.

Signs of the strategy have been large and small, touching each of the controversies that have dominated the news cycles of the last week.

On Wednesday, administration officials announced support for a law to shield the news media from at least some subpoenas in criminal investigations, a move to deflect criticism from liberals over a federal prosecutor’s decision to seize telephone records of Associated Press reporters.

Then the White House released 99 pages of emails related to the Benghazi attack, aimed at proving wrong those who claimed the administration had politicized the event.

Little more than an hour later, Obama appeared in the East Room to announce on live television that he had pushed out the acting IRS commissioner, seeking to show he would move quickly to straighten out the tax agency after an inspector general’s report released Tuesday concluded that it had inappropriately targeted conservative groups.

On Thursday, in addition to his remarks on embassy security, Obama appointed a new acting commissioner to take over at the Internal Revenue Service and made his first comments on the AP subpoenas. Obama said he respected press freedom, but defended aggressive investigations of leaks as necessary to protect American personnel overseas, saying, “I make no apologies.”

The president also sought to demonstrate he was handling other crises that were nearly overlooked, gathering top military brass at the White House after a report estimated that 26,000 military members were sexually assaulted in unreported incidents last year.

The moves came after pressure from Democrats outside the White House. Many feared that the president’s Mr. Cool approach would not overcome the familiar churn of the Washington scandal machine.

One Democratic strategist, who asked not to be identified to preserve relations with the administration, said early in the week that he called a senior administration official to find out when the West Wing was going to come out fighting. “They didn’t want to get out ahead of the facts,” he said, was the answer he got.

Tommy Vietor, a former National Security Council spokesman, defended the White House response. “They took their time,” he said. “They reviewed the IG’s report, they declassified the emails, they got their facts together. They didn’t care about one 24-hour news cycle.”

The game of scandal response is relatively new to a White House that prides itself on its low blood pressure and control of the news cycle. White House aides privately vented about the frustration of feeling unable to push their message, set the record straight or change the subject.

The White House has since tried to thaw the chill with the press. On Wednesday, Press Secretary Jay Carney tried to lighten the tone at his briefing with a self-effacing joke and reference to a viral video mocking his frequent use of the phrase “I appreciate the question” for questions he doesn’t especially appreciate. Senior advisor Dan Pfeiffer, who rarely does television interviews, also appeared on CNN on Thursday to urge Democrats and Republicans to come together to “fix the problem.”

Other surrogates will be pushing the message soon. As the president spoke to the media in the Rose Garden on Thursday, a who’s who of Democratic spin-masters and veterans of scandals past met inside with Chief of Staff Denis McDonough and Pfeiffer. Former Clinton Press Secretary Mike McCurry, Clinton speechwriter Don Baer and Tad Devine, who was an advisor to Vice President Al Gore, huddled with others for what participants said was an occasional get-together.

“This is what passes for a scandal these days?” quipped one longtime Democratic strategist.

Advertisement

The president’s attempt to change the subject included his meeting at the White House with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to discuss sexual harassment in the military. The subject gained credence not only because of the report on undisclosed assaults but also because of the sexual abuse investigations of two servicemen who coordinated sexual assault prevention programs.

The media were allowed in for photos and his comments.

Obama said sexual assault in the military was “not a sideshow,” a label his advisors use to describe the controversy over the Benghazi talking points, and he assured military leaders he would be working on the issue.

“There’s no silver bullet to solving this problem,” Obama said. “This is going to require a sustained effort over a long period of time.”

Advertisement

It’s not yet clear whether the newfound strategy will turn the tide for the White House. Republicans on Capitol Hill did not let up after the release of the Benghazi emails, saying the documents did not back up the White House version of events. “If the White House wants to get out of hot water they should just start being candid,” said Brendan Buck, spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio).

Some Obama partisans, however, are relieved, said Neera Tanden, president of the progressive think tank Center for American Progress. “Most people, most Democrats, think they turned the corner,” she said.

Text of the Settlement Full Coverage: Clinton Accused

By Peter Baker

Washington Post Staff Writer

Saturday, November 14, 1998; Page A1 President Clinton reached an out-of-court settlement with Paula Jones yesterday, agreeing to pay her $850,000 to drop the sexual harassment lawsuit that led to the worst political crisis of his career and only the third presidential impeachment inquiry in American history. After more than 4 1/2 years of scorched-earth legal warfare, Clinton and Jones brought a sudden end to the case with a four-page deal in which he acknowledged no wrongdoing and offered no apology. The agreement, which will be filed with a federal appeals court considering whether the lawsuit should go forward, requires the president to pay within 60 days. Robert S. Bennett, Clinton's chief attorney in the case, said the president still insists Jones's allegations of a crude proposition in a Little Rock hotel suite seven years ago ""are baseless"" but agreed to make the payment in the interest of finally putting the matter behind him. ""The president has decided he is not prepared to spend one more hour on this matter,"" Bennett said. ""It is clear that the American people want their president and Congress to focus on the problems that they were elected to solve. This is a step in that direction."" The settlement foreclosed the possibility that Clinton's personal life would be reopened for public inspection at a sensational trial had the lawsuit dismissed in April been reinstated, as many lawyers involved believed it would be. It also may help the president's allies defend him against independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's allegations that he lied and obstructed justice during the case, while providing a new opportunity for the White House to cut a separate deal with Congress to drop impeachment proceedings. Just hours before the settlement was inked yesterday, Starr sent new evidence to the House Judiciary Committee stemming from a witness in the Jones case, Kathleen E. Willey, who also accused Clinton of an unwelcome sexual advance. Jones made no public comment, but her husband, Steve, told reporters outside their California condominium that the payment amounts to an apology on its own. ""Let the impeachment hearings begin. We want out of it,"" he said. ""Paying a substantial amount of money makes a statement on its own. This is Paula's reputation that we were fighting for. This has nothing to do with an ax to grind with Bill Clinton."" John W. Whitehead, president of the Rutherford Institute, which financed her lawsuit, called the deal ""justice for Paula"" and said it would draw attention to ""the importance of protecting powerless women from workplace harassment and the role of the rule of law in our highest offices."" The extraordinary case came to an extraordinary finale, with the defendant agreeing to pay $850,000 even though the plaintiff originally only asked for $700,000 when she filed suit -- and even though the case was dismissed without a trial. The document signed late yesterday afternoon made no mention of how Clinton would pay for the settlement, but sources said it likely would come from both his legal defense fund and a separate deal with one of his insurance companies. Sources said the president's lawyers have reached a tentative agreement with Chubb Group Insurance to buy out the personal liability policy that had covered some of his legal expenses for close to half of the settlement. ""When all is said and done, not a penny will come out of his pocket,"" said one person close to the situation. The Jones camp, which has struggled with bitter internal divisions in recent weeks, has yet to determine how it will divide the money among the many lawyers who have staked a claim on it. Although lawyers involved believe Jones will get a decent share of the settlement, it remains to be determined how much. Even as both sides celebrated yesterday, they were cognizant of the enormous toll the lawsuit has taken on everyone involved. For Clinton, even though the case was dismissed by a federal judge, the Jones suit will forever mar his chapter in the history books, cementing an image as a leader whose reckless personal life endangered an otherwise remarkable political career. The case opened a Pandora's box of allegations about his past sex life and made him the first president ever interrogated under oath as a defendant in a civil lawsuit or before a grand jury as a possible criminal target. Jones v. Clinton also yielded a historic decision by the Supreme Court, which ruled 9 to 0 last year that even the chief executive can be sued. And it was the resulting search for evidence that led Jones's lawyers to Monica S. Lewinsky and the chain of events that prompted Starr's report to Congress alleging that Clinton committed 11 impeachable offenses. Jones filed her suit in May 1994, accusing Clinton of luring her to a suite at the Excelsior Hotel during a May 8, 1991, conference when he was governor of Arkansas and she was a state clerk. During that brief encounter, she said he touched her, tried to kiss her and dropped his pants and asked for oral sex. Clinton has denied that steadfastly, maintaining he does not even remember meeting her. U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright dismissed the case last spring, ruling that even if Jones's allegations were true, such ""boorish and offensive"" behavior would not be severe enough to constitute sexual harassment under the law. Jones then asked the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn the decision and, after Starr's report came out, argued that Clinton's alleged misconduct during the case justified a reversal. Two members of the three-judge panel appeared sympathetic during oral arguments last month and on Tuesday the court asked for the full transcript of Clinton's Jan. 17 deposition in the case, which some lawyers close to the Jones camp interpreted as a sign that they were concerned about possible perjury by the president. To short-circuit the appeal, the two sides came together yesterday after two months of fitful negotiations that often appeared on the verge of collapse and nearly unraveled because of the unsolicited intrusion of a New York tycoon who offered $1 million of his own money to persuade Jones to drop the case in the national interest. While previous attempts to settle had repeatedly failed, Jones's lawyers approached Bennett in September with a $1 million proposal that abandoned her long-standing demand for an apology from the president, a condition that had been a deal-killer for Clinton. Bennett countered with a $500,000 offer, then upped it to $700,000, but Jones held out for the full $1 million and insisted on taking the other $1 million from businessman Abe Hirschfeld as well. Hirschfeld's involvement spooked the White House, if for no other reason than the mercurial real estate mogul has been indicted on state tax evasion charges in New York. Frustrated by their client's unyielding stance and convinced that Hirschfeld was too erratic to deal with, Jones's lawyers informed her they planned to quit, which appeared to shake her into agreeing to break ties with her would-be benefactor. William N. McMillan III, a California attorney and husband of Jones's friend, Susan Carpenter-McMillan, took over negotiating this week and assured Bennett that Hirschfeld was out of the picture, according to sources close to the case. Bennett insisted on a written commitment and McMillan faxed a letter that said, ""I further represent to you that the money from Mr. Abraham Hirschfeld is no longer on the table and that there will be no payment from Mr. Hirschfeld as part of the settlement with your client."" Bennett spoke with the president three times Thursday even as he was consulting with advisers about whether to attack Iraq and finally Clinton authorized his legal team to settle, one source said. Yesterday afternoon the agreement was signed by Bennett, McMillan, Jones lawyer Donovan Campbell Jr. and Bill W. Bristow, the lawyer for co-defendant Danny Ferguson, the state trooper who escorted Jones to meet with Clinton. ""Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to be an admission of liability or wrongdoing by any party,"" the document said. At the White House, aides were relieved to finally have the matter behind them. ""The feeling here was unanimous and universal -- it's over!"" said one official who asked not to be named. ""Those two words have so much power, because nothing is ever over here. It's over."" With the case settled, the president has a chance to end the distractions of scandal for the final two years of his presidency, this official added. ""What this means is that not a single one of those 750 days [left] will be taken up by Paula Jones,"" he said. Said another White House adviser, ""It's just another piece of the puzzle put in so he can move forward on his own agenda for the next two years."" Still, there are tricky details to be resolved. Clinton's lawyers must finalize a plan to pay the settlement. Richard M. Lucas, counsel to the Clinton Legal Expense Trust, said it has not been contacted about financing a deal and would have to confront legal questions before deciding whether it could participate. The legal document founding the trust authorizes it to pay ""legal fees and expenses,"" but ""it's silent on settlements,"" said Lucas. ""It's something the trustees have never had to deal with as a board."" The trustees might also have to deal with Larry Klayman, an attorney and longtime Clinton foe who has repeatedly tried to block insurance coverage of Clinton's expenses in the Jones case and has threatened to challenge use of defense fund money for any settlement. Jones, too, must figure out money matters. Her Dallas-based lawyers have a contingency agreement for at least a third of any proceeds from the case. The Rutherford Institute is legally entitled to reimbursement of its $400,000 in expenses. And her former lawyers have placed an $800,000 lien on the case and while they have said they would come down some, they have been tough negotiators so far. ""For all she's been through, she should get some money,"" said one of those lawyers, Joseph Cammarata. But he offered no estimate, adding, ""In Clinton-speak, it depends on your definition of 'some.' ""

THE TAKE

Hillary’s Ties to Obama Could Cost Her

Some Republicans believe revelations about Benghazi could raise questions about Hillary Clinton’s stewardship at the State Department. But for Clinton, the general tenor of scandal that has suffused the administration could cost her more.

If the media focus shifts from Obama’s second-term legacy to second-term scandals, it could cast a pall over those looking to capitalize on his coattails.

Clinton knows all too well about the public’s desire for change, both from her own presidential race and the conclusion of her husband’s second term. Public dissatisfaction with George W. Bush sent Democratic voters looking for someone with less time in Washington and disconnected from the war in Iraq. Nearly a decade earlier, then-Vice President Al Gore awkwardly tried to distance himself from his former boss after Bill Clinton’s sex scandal, despite voters’ widespread approval of Clinton’s policies.

By connecting herself to Obama so closely—most recently with a joint sitdown on 60 Minutes—Clinton hoped to benefit from Obama’s strong popularity among Democrats. Now there’s a very real chance that the rewards of that loyalty could dissipate.

BEDTIME READING

‘ONE IS THE LONELIEST NUMBER?’ MAYBE NOT. Loneliness can increase your likelihood of sickness and even death, The New Republic reports. Loneliness is not being frequently alone nor does it mean someone who has few friends is lonely. Loneliness is a “want of intimacy” and an “interior” experience. The cause of loneliness is combination of genes and environment. “Although genes may predispose children toward loneliness, they do not account for everything that makes them grow up lonely. Fifty-two percent of that comes from the world.”Some have pushed back against the idea that the feeling of loneliness can cause health problems, arguing rather that it’s the symptoms of loneliness. For example, lonely people lack a support network, or someone who will look out for them, and therefore get sick more often. Read more

President Obama’s first term in office was a busy time for the first lady.

Nearly three-quarters of black women say it’s a good time to be a black woman in America, saying Michelle Obama’s role in the White House has raised their profile, according to a Washington Post/Kaiser Family Foundation survey.

Nearly three-quarters of black women say it’s a good time to be a black woman in America, saying Michelle Obama’s role in the White House has raised their profile, according to a Washington Post/Kaiser Family Foundation survey.

They’re at it again.

The latest public rant against Michelle Obama’s effort to promote low-calorie school lunches was recently caught on tape in Alabama — the usual protest against the federal government meddling in local business. And then it quickly found its way around to the first lady’s posterior.

“Fat butt Michelle Obama,” said Bob Grisham, a high school football coach who was surreptitiously recorded by one of his students. “Look at her. She looks like she weighs 185 or 190. She’s overweight.”

Grisham, who was suspended Monday, is neither the first nor the most high-profile person to feel moved to comment on the first lady’s physique. Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh has repeatedly called her Michelle “My Butt” Obama. And Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner, the Wisconsin Republican, issued an apology after he was caught commenting on her “large posterior.” (Grisham has also said he misspoke.)

Michelle Obama obviously is not the first first lady to be subjected to criticism for the way she looks. Hillary Clinton was accused of having “cankles” — slang for chubby ankles. One of her predecessors was immortalized in song by the group Mission of Burma: “I’m haunted by the freakish size of Nancy Reagan’s head /No way that thing came with that body.”

The first lady stuck with one of her favorite designers, Jason Wu, for her second inaugural gown — but what’s the big fuss? Style reporter Katherine Boyle stops by to explain the significance of first lady fashion decisions throughout the years. (The Fold/The Washington Post)

But what is it with Michelle Obama’s critics and the fixation with her derriere?

“We have a history in this country of white people not showing adequate respect for and devaluing the bodies of black women, and this most definitely falls in line with that,” says Ayana Byrd, the co-editor of the anthology “Naked: Black Women Bare All About Their Skin, Hair, Hips, Lips and Other Parts.” (Grisham, Limbaugh and Sensenbrenner are white men.)

The focus on this first lady’s posterior has historical antecedents. It reaches back to the imagery of Hottentot Venus, a woman from what is now South Africa whose naked body and pronounced posterior were paraded in shows throughout 19th-century Europe. On to the selling and trading of black women’s bodies through slavery. In modern times, black women’s figures continue to be up for public discussion in ways that are celebratory (see: “Brick House” by The Commodores) and insulting (see above).

Michelle Obama — who is 5-foot-11 and praised for her fashion sense, her bangs and her toned biceps — regularly emerges in polls as one of the most popular public figures in the country. (The White House does not discuss her weight.) She has graced magazine covers from Vogue to Better Homes & Gardens. Women’s health magazines have created workouts to help other women get “Michelle Obama arms.”

Her presence as first lady challenges the historic view of a black woman’s place and notions of beauty, says Michaela Angela Davis, a fashion expert who has campaigned for more positive images of black women in the media. “Michelle is black from a distance. She’s a real black girl,” Davis says. “A lot of people have tried to make diversity into this weird beige thing. Her presence is just really powerful to interject into the global consciousness.”

The first lady’s critics “are reacting to the culture in which they’ve grown up or they are using it as a code to racialize Michelle Obama and remind people that she’s black,” says Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University. “It is unreasonable to expect a nearly 50-year-old woman to have the body of a 25-year-old. She looks great for her age.”

Although the White House declined to comment, Michelle Obama was asked a few years ago during an interview whether the focus on her has affected her body image.

“No, not really — but I thank God I’m 45 in this and not 35. I feel bad for young women going through the same thing, because [at that age] you don’t know who you are. I know what makes me happy,” she said. “My message to women: Do what makes you feel good, because there’ll always be someone who thinks you should do it differently.”

USA TODAY

The former Edwards campaign videographer is out with a new book

Hunter gave birth to a daughter in 2008

John Edwards was acquitted last year of one charge of misusing campaign funds to hide the affair

Rielle Hunter is apologizing for her affair with former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards.

In a column for The Huffington Post, the former campaign videographer and mother of Edwards' youngest daughter says she ""behaved badly.""

""That may seem obvious to you but it's taken me a long time to admit that, even to myself,"" Hunter said. ""For years, I was so viciously attacked by the media and the world that I felt like a victim. I now realize that the attacks are actually beside the point. The point is: I behaved badly.""

Edwards' extramarital affair, chronicled in tabloids and a book by a former aide, led to his downfall. He had initially denied the affair and paternity of Frances Quinn, the daughter Hunter gave birth to in 2008.

Hunter's new book, In Hindsight, What Really Happened: The Revised Edition: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me , hit bookshelves Tuesday. Her publisher suggested she go through her first book, which came out last year, ""annotating all of my regrets and mistakes,"" she wrote.

In her Huffington Post column, Hunter does not explain the current state of her relationship with Edwards but says she hurt Elizabeth Edwards, the candidate's wife who died in 2010, and the couple's children. Hunter told ABC News last year that they were no longer a couple but said she was still in love with John Edwards.

""I hurt her family. I hurt John's family,"" Hunter wrote. ""I hurt people who didn't know Elizabeth but loved her from afar. I hurt people who gave their hard-earned dollars to a campaign -- a cause they believed in.""

Edwards, a former senator and the 2004 Democratic vice presidential nominee, was indicted on six felony charges of misusing campaign money to cover up his affair. After a lengthy trial last year, Edwards was found not guilty on one count and a mistrial was declared on five others when the jury was deadlocked.

At the time, Edwards said he took responsibility for his ""sins.""

Obama’s unconstitutional steps worse than Nixon’s

President Obama’s increasingly grandiose claims for presidential power are inversely proportional to his shriveling presidency. Desperation fuels arrogance as, barely 200 days into the 1,462 days of his second term, his pantry of excuses for failure is bare, his domestic agenda is nonexistent and his foreign policy of empty rhetorical deadlines and red lines is floundering. And at last week’s news conference he offered inconvenience as a justification for illegality.

Explaining his decision to unilaterally rewrite the Affordable Care Act (ACA), he said: “I didn’t simply choose to” ignore the statutory requirement for beginning in 2014 the employer mandate to provide employees with health care. No, “this was in consultation with businesses.”

He continued: “In a normal political environment, it would have been easier for me to simply call up the speaker and say, you know what, this is a tweak that doesn’t go to the essence of the law. . . . It looks like there may be some better ways to do this, let’s make a technical change to the law. That would be the normal thing that I would prefer to do. But we’re not in a normal atmosphere around here when it comes to Obamacare. We did have the executive authority to do so, and we did so.”

Serving as props in the scripted charade of White House news conferences, journalists did not ask the pertinent question: “Where does the Constitution confer upon presidents the ‘executive authority’ to ignore the separation of powers by revising laws?” The question could have elicited an Obama rarity: brevity. Because there is no such authority.

Obama’s explanation began with an irrelevancy. He consulted with businesses before disregarding his constitutional duty to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” That duty does not lapse when a president decides Washington’s “political environment” is not “normal.”

When was it “normal”? The 1850s? The 1950s? Washington has been the nation’s capital for 213 years; Obama has been here less than nine. Even if he understood “normal” political environments here, the Constitution is not suspended when a president decides the “environment” is abnormal.

Neither does the Constitution confer on presidents the power to rewrite laws if they decide the change is a “tweak” not involving the law’s “essence.” Anyway, the employer mandate is essential to the ACA.

Twenty-three days before his news conference, the House voted 264 to 161, with 35 Democrats in the majority, for the rule of law — for, that is, the Authority for Mandate Delay Act. It would have done lawfully what Obama did by ukase. He threatened to veto this use of legislation to alter a law. The White House called it “unnecessary,” presumably because he has an uncircumscribed “executive authority” to alter laws.

In a 1977 interview with Richard Nixon, David Frost asked: “Would you say that there are certain situations . . . where the president can decide that it’s in the best interests of the nation . . . and do something illegal?”

Nixon: “Well, when the president does it, that means it is not illegal.”

Frost: “By definition.”

Nixon: “Exactly, exactly.”

Nixon’s claim, although constitutionally grotesque, was less so than the claim implicit in Obama’s actions regarding the ACA. Nixon’s claim was confined to matters of national security or (he said to Frost) “a threat to internal peace and order of significant magnitude.” Obama’s audacity is more spacious; it encompasses a right to disregard any portion of any law pertaining to any subject at any time when the political “environment” is difficult.

Obama should be embarrassed that, by ignoring the legal requirement concerning the employer mandate, he has validated critics who say the ACA cannot be implemented as written. What does not embarrass him is his complicity in effectively rewriting the ACA for the financial advantage of self-dealing members of Congress and their staffs.

The ACA says members of Congress (annual salaries: $174,000) and their staffs (thousands making more than $100,000) must participate in the law’s insurance exchanges. It does not say that when this change goes into effect, the current federal subsidy for this affluent cohort — up to 75 percent of the premium’s cost, perhaps $10,000 for families — should be unchanged.

When Congress awakened to what it enacted, it panicked: This could cause a flight of talent, making Congress less wonderful. So Obama directed the Office of Personnel Management, which has no power to do this, to authorize for the political class special subsidies unavailable for less privileged and less affluent citizens.

If the president does it, it’s legal? “Exactly, exactly.”

Wendy Davis has been asked mostly softball questions by the national media. When David Gregory did give her one tough question on Meet the Press she gave an answer which could be used to undercut her own position.

John McCormack at the Weekly Standard pointed out that the media fawning over State Sen. Wendy Davis has produced more questions about her shoes than challenging her stance on abortion. That’s not an exaggeration. This Week reporter Jeff Zelezny asked 6 questions, two of which were about Davis’ footwear. To his credit, David Gregory did ask Davis one question that no other reporter has:

David Gregory: Senator, do you think a 20-week ban on abortion is acceptable? Do you think it’s reasonable? Sen. Davis: Right now that ban of course is being talked about because of the idea of fetal pain and at the constitutional level what we of course have assured is that women have the ability to make these reproductive decisions up to the point of viability. That has to remain the key question here. And of course when we’re talking about that particular issue there are very, very few. It’s used more as an emotional trigger point as part of the argument but remember it’s a huge omnibus bill that involves many other aspects to it that are setting Texas back in time.

The first part of Davis’ answer is coherent but invites an obvious follow up question. Should we consider fetal pain if there is evidence it begins earlier than viability? But then Davis undercuts her own argument when she says “there are very, very few.” If that’s so then the portion of SB5 which bans abortions after 20 weeks won’t have much impact.

As for it being an “emotional trigger point” keep in mind that the pro-abortion lobby routinely refers to the equally rare instances of rape and incest as reasons we need to keep abortion legal. NARAL and Planned Parenthood are no strangers to using emotional trigger arguments. A neutral observer might point this out.

As for the remainder of the “huge omnibus bill” one of the main features requires abortion clinics to meet the standards of ambulatory surgical facilities. This is the same determination that was reached in Pennsylvania, Virginia and other states in the wake of the Gosnell trial. As I pointed out here, the grand jury in the Gosnell case explicitly recommended that abortion facilities be regulated as ASFs, noting that failure to do so likely contributed to Karnamaya Mongar’s death.

As we’ve seen recently, leading pro-choice politicians struggle to answer even simple questions about their views. David Gregory got the ball rolling but it’s only one question after a week of mostly fawning coverage. What is needed now is some follow up."

Message: What IRS scandal? Not that the failure of Republicans, particularly Rep. Darrell Issa of California and the puppets in the right-wing media noise machine, will ever shut up about this no matter what is learned about the reality.

We've had months of ""investigations"" and allegations that there was a partisan effort by the IRS, coordinated by the White House, to target tea party organizations over their tax-exempt status. What have we learned? Democratic and independent groups were looked at in the IRS examination of tax status, not just tea party groups. None of the tea party groups were denied tax-exempt status. While bellyaching about the supposed partisan nature of the IRS's evaluation of these groups, Issa asked IRS Inspector General J. Russell George to confine himself to looking solely at conservative and tea party groups in his internal investigation into what happened.

As for Issa's claims that he would tie the ""scandal"" to the White House? Bupkis.

At a breakfast organized by the Christian Science Monitor on Wednesday, senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer had sharp words for the ""investigation"":



""The allegation was, by many Republicans, that the White House was directing the IRS to target Tea Party groups,"" he said. ""That was the allegation. And that has turned out to be completely false. There is no evidence to suggest that. And now it has turned out that the IRS was not just targeting conservative groups but also looking at a large number of progressive groups as well. So that changes the dynamic of what it was.""

Issa warned us in November 2010, gloated actually, just before he became head of the House Oversight committee, that he would be overseeing seven investigatory hearings a week, 40 weeks a year. Many of those since then have been overblown, partisan affairs at best and cheap-shot smear jobs of President Obama at worst. All of it designed to capture the limelight.

Government should be held accountable. Scandals should be exposed. Reforms should be instituted where problems are uncovered. But using government authority and wasting taxpayer resources to launch baseless attacks for partisan gain and public attention are themselves deserving of some official probing. Perhaps Congressman Issa could focus that Klieg light he loves to wield in another direction—on himself."

http://news.yahoo.com/dem-congressman-compares-tea-party-to-ku-klux-klan-190728183.html,,[],Dem congressman compares tea party to Ku Klux Klan,"Controversial Democrat Alan Grayson has set off a flurry of criticism from conservatives after the Florida congressman sent out a fundraising email to supporters in which he compared the tea party to the Ku Klux Klan.



Grayson’s original comments came during a recent appearance on MSNBC’s “Politics Nation with Al Sharpton.” Grayson was discussing the tea party’s influence on the Republican Party when he said, “At this point, the tea party is no more popular than the Klan.”

And rather than shy away from that comment, Grayson included them in bold letters on his website with the quote taking readers directly to a fundraising page for Grayson’s re-election campaign.

Grayson’s fundraising page includes the image of a burning cross; it uses the cross as the letter “T” and spells out “tea party” in flaming letters:

""As a black Tea Party activist, I could say that there's nothing more offensive than equating the Tea Party with the Ku Klux Klan,” Jennifer Burke, National Outreach Director for TheTeaParty.net said in a statement emailed to Yahoo News. “The hate speech uttered by sitting congressman Alan Grayson is deplorable, even by the low levels reached in recent years when Democrats routinely call us racists and suicide bombers.""

Grayson’s comments were also criticized by the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).

There’s no excuse for the hateful words and imagery used by Congressman Grayson,” NRCC spokesman Matt Gorman said in a statement. “House Democrats should swiftly and strongly condemn him and return the money he has raised for them. This hate-filled rhetoric has Americans fed up with Washington.”

Grayson is no stranger to controversy. First elected to Congress in 2008, he regularly was an outspoken critic of Republicans and conservatives in general. He was voted out of office after his first term, and many observers expected him to take a role as an activist outside of government. However, Grayson was re-elected in 2012 and is considered a strong favorite for re-election in 2014.

Despite the criticism over his KKK comparison, Grayson has stood by his comments and subsequent fundraising effort. He pointed to offensive comments and signage that appeared at past tea party rallies to justify his own comments.

“Tea Party members have circulated countless altered pictures depicting President Obama and the First Lady as monkeys. Tea Party members also called my fellow Member of Congress, civil rights hero John Lewis, a ‘n***ger,’ and Rep. Barney Frank a ‘faggot,’” Grayson said in a statement. “One could go on and on, because there is overwhelming evidence that the Tea Party is the home of bigotry and discrimination in America today, just as the KKK was for an earlier generation. If the shoe fits, wear it.”"

(CNN) – The official in charge of an embattled Internal Revenue Service division will invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination during a Wednesday appearance before a House oversight panel, a spokesman for the committee said.

Lois Lerner, who oversaw the IRS division handling requests for tax-exempt status, made her intentions known in a letter to the committee's chairman, Rep. Darrell Issa. Lerner was the first IRS official to publically admit that the tax agency was using extra scrutiny on conservative groups applying to become tax exempt.



""The Committee has been contacted by Ms. Lerner's lawyer who stated that his client intended to invoke her 5th amendment right and refuse to answer questions,"" the committee's spokesman Ali Ahmad wrote in a statement. ""Ms. Lerner remains under subpoena from Chairman Issa to appear at tomorrow's hearing - the Committee has a Constitutional obligation to conduct oversight. Chairman Issa remains hopeful that she will ultimately decide to testify tomorrow about her knowledge of outrageous IRS targeting of Americans for their political beliefs.""

Lerner revealed during a question-and-answer session at a meeting of the American Bar Association a week and a half ago that the IRS was targeting conservative groups when assessing applications for tax exempt status. Later, officials at the agency said the question that prompted Lerner's response was planted as a way for the information to become public.

Her disclosure came days before the release of an independent inspector general's report, which indicated Lerner learned about the conservative targeting in June 2011. While she took steps to stop the practice, lawmakers want to know why she didn't notify members of Congress.

“While we respect Ms. Lerner’s use of the Constitution’s Fifth Amendment, we are disturbed she saw fit to trample over our First Amendment rights by harassing us and many other groups for our views,” Jenny Beth Martin, the co-Founder and national coordinator of Tea Party Patriots, wrote in a statement Tuesday."

IRS sorted tax-exempt applications based on names of group%2C not actual political activity

WASHINGTON -- An inspector general report into the Internal Revenue Service's heightened scrutiny of Tea Party groups blames ""ineffective management"" at the agency, but does not address whether the policy was politically motivated.

The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration's report, released Tuesday, was an audit -- not an investigative report. It made recommendations about how tax-exempt applications should be processed in the future. It did not blame specific employees or suggest disciplinary action.

The report found the IRS office in Cincinnati, which processes all applications for tax-exempt status, singled out ""Tea Party,"" ""Patriot"" and ""9/12"" groups based solely on their names. The applications were singled out for further review of whether they were involved in political campaign activity. The groups were applying for tax exempt status reserved for groups that conduct ""social welfare"" activities as the bulk of their work.

The IRS's special treatment of Tea Party applications led to long processing delays, the inspector general said. For 13 months beginning in October 2010, the Cincinnati office stopped working on potential political cases entirely.

The report said 170 groups received IRS letters asking for additional information, and in 98 of those cases the questions asked were later determined to be inappropriate or unnecessary. Those questions included the names of donors, the political affiliation of officers, and their employment outside the organization.

In a response to the draft report, the IRS defended its decision to separate out groups involved in potential political activities. ""While centralization was warranted, the manner in which we initially designated cases for centralization was inappropriate,"" wrote Joseph H. Grant, the acting commissioner for tax exempt and government entities.

He also said determining which groups are engaged in prohibited political activity is difficult: ""There are no bright line tests for what constitutes political campaign intervention ... or whether an organization is primarily engaged in social welfare activities,"" Grant said.

On May10, when Lois Lerner, the former Director of the IRS Exempt Organizations Division, answered a question at a legal conference – a question she arranged to have asked in advance -- she clearly had no idea what would happen next.

When she admitted that the IRS had targeted conservative groups, simply because of their political beliefs, she touched off a national firestorm. Her inept attempt to apologize for the Agency’s blunder, and put it to rest, backfired.

In the past three months, we have learned that the Obama administration repeatedly tried to downplay this unlawful targeting scheme which is an unprecedented breach of the public’s trust by the IRS.

[pullquote]

We also know that the scandal continues to expand. And we know that the Obama administration is doing very little to get to the bottom of what happened, despite the president's promise to the American people that the administration would “hold the responsible parties accountable.”

Today, after all this time, it’s clear that the Obama administration isn't really interested in the facts about how this could happen at the IRS or about holding anyone accountable.

In fact, President Obama has moved on, calling the IRS targeting scheme a “phony” scandal and acting as if corrective action has been taken and problem solved.

Not so fast.

From the beginning, the facts did not square with the excuses offered up to the American public by the Obama administration.

It did not take long to punch holes in the IRS’ story that the scheme to target conservatives began in a small office run by just a couple of rogue agents.

In our lawsuit against the IRS, on behalf of 41 conservative organizations in 22 states, the evidence is very clear: documents have revealed that IRS offices coast-to-coast were involved in the scheme, including Lois Lerner herself! In fact, she sent more than a dozen letters to conservative organizations asking them intrusive and inappropriate questions.

The White House has also claimed that the unconstitutional targeting of conservative organizations ended in May 2012. Again, our documents clearly show that the IRS abuse continued through May of 2013 with the most recent letter dated May 6, 2013 – just four days before Lerner's admission.

And we now know, thanks to the testimony of former IRS attorneys, that the office of the IRS Chief Counsel (a political presidential appointee) was involved in the scheme, too. This testimony raises important questions about President Obama’s knowledge or involvement in the scheme.

Now, there’s new information to suggest that the IRS may have been providing taxpayer information to the Federal Election Commission, something that violates federal law and the IRS's own regulations.

An FEC commissioner says he has seen previously undisclosed emails between the IRS and FEC about the targeting scheme. And lawmakers are now demanding the FEC turn over records of more than five years of communications with the IRS.

All of this information comes as the Obama administration continues to stonewall Congress about the scandal -- providing just a fraction of the information requested.

Noting the three month mark since the scandal began, Reps. Darrell Issa (Calif.) and Dave Camp (Mich.), chairmen of the House committees on Oversight and Ways and Means have voiced their concern, saying in a statement, “The American people demand and deserve accountability from their government, not to live in fear of being subject to an audit or other extra scrutiny for reasons unrelated to the content of their filing. So far, the IRS and this administration have provided no assurances that oversight and accountability is in place to prevent such abuses from happening again.”

The president did order the new Acting IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel to conduct a 30-day review of the IRS scandal. Yes, you read that right, just a 30-day review to investigate a scheme that had been underway for years. It’s no surprise that Werfel claims the 30-day review turned up no “evidence of intentional wrongdoing by anyone in the IRS.”

It’s been 3 months since the American public learned about this outrageous behavior by the IRS. No one has been fired. Lerner and a handful of others are on leave and still being paid.

And what has happened to the investigations underway by the FBI and Department of Justice? Three months later, not one of our clients has been contacted by investigators at the FBI or Justice Department.

It’s difficult to imagine how anyone could claim that a thorough investigation -- or any investigation for that matter – has been conducted without even bothering to interview the taxpayers who were targeted.

So, the IRS scandal continues. It’s been three months and counting. The last three months have produced many more questions and very few answers.

Where’s the accountability, Mr. President?"

Jesse Jackson Jr. was charged in federal court Friday with conspiring to use campaign funds for personal use -- in an alleged $750,000 spending spree that included purchases of a gold-plated Rolex and pricey children's furniture.

It had been expected that a plea agreement would be entered into court Friday, but that agreement is apparently still pending.

Instead, federal prosecutors charged Jackson Friday with conspiracy. Prosecutors separately charged his wife Sandi with filing false federal tax returns, but according to her attorney she has reached a plea agreement.

In a statement, the former Illinois Democratic congressman said he offers ""no excuses.""

""Over the course of my life I have come to realize that none of us are immune from our share of shortcomings and human frailties,"" he said. ""Still I offer no excuses for my conduct, and I fully accept my responsibility for the improper decisions and mistakes I have made.""

He continued: ""To that end I want to offer my sincerest apologies to my family, my friends and all of my supporters for my errors in judgment and while my journey is not yet complete, it is my hope that I am remembered for the things that I did right.""

The charging document accused Jackson and an unnamed co-conspirator of submitting false campaign finance reports ""to conceal their conversion of approximately $750,000 from the campaign for their personal benefit.""

Prosecutors claim Jackson and the co-conspirator used more than $580,000 of that to pay off credit card bills for their purchases. They claim the purchases included a more than $43,000 ""gold-plated men's Rolex watch"" and nearly $10,000 worth of ""children's furniture,"" as well as $5,000 of ""fur capes and parkas.""

The document also called for Jackson to hand over a slew of expensive memorabilia items if found guilty, including Bruce Lee and Michael Jackson memorabilia.

The penalty for Jackson is a maximum of five years in jail and $250,000 in fines. For his wife, the maximum is three years and $100,000 in fines.

Fox News is told that the former congressman, expected to be in Washington next week when he goes to court, is ""extremely depressed"" and ""broken-hearted."" A source said he feels ""like he's losing everything"" and is trying to figure out how to provide for his family.

Jackson resigned last November shortly after being reelected to the House. The son of civil rights leader Jesse Jackson Sr. had been treated for bipolar disorder, but also has been the subject of an ongoing federal investigation over campaign funds.

The Chicago Sun-Times earlier reported that the probe had split into two separate investigations, with one into Jackson's wife Sandi. Sandi recently resigned as a Chicago city alderman.

The filing Friday is a blow for a public figure who was once considered a rising star.

Jesse Jackson Jr. first took office in 1995 after winning a special election and began his career in Washington with a star power and pedigree that set him apart from his hundreds of other House colleagues.

But despite high expectations, he largely went unnoticed as a policymaker. Instead, he gained a reputation for quixotic pursuits such as trying to impeach President George W. Bush and push through constitutional amendments that had no chance.

Jackson, 47, disappeared in June, and it was later revealed that he was being treated at the Mayo Clinic for bipolar disorder and gastrointestinal issues. He returned to his Washington home in September but went back to the clinic the next month.

Originally the product of a merger between several Louisville newspapers in 1868, the newspaper has been the largest print outlet in the city for well over a century. But of late, the newspaper has undergone severe economic problems, with owner Gannett Company laying off 51 employees in 2008 and 44 more in 2009.

Part of that is the newspaper’s dramatic shift to the left over the past few years. Since the election in November, the newspaper’s editorial board has called for Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to resign as Senate Minority Leader and accused McConnell of being the target of “national ridicule,” and run comics depicting McConnell consigned to the flames of hell; it has suggested that Senate Republicans “smacked down the disabled of this country and the world.”

In the latest symptom of that circulation-killing shift left, the newspaper is laying off longtime columnist John David Dyche, a Harvard Law grad and area lawyer who has been writing the token conservative column on the paper since 2003.

Why are they laying Dyche off? Dyche proposed a column to the newspaper suggesting fixes for their editorial woes, including:

“balanced opinion pages” rather than “stridently liberal”;

disclosing editors’ and reporters’ politics – “Journalists believe that they, unlike mere mortals, can transcend their personal opinions to be basically fair and objective in presenting the news. Perhaps, but readers should be the ones to judge”;

open meetings about editorial decisions – “Let the public see how and by whom decisions are made as to what to cover, who should cover it, and what headlines, photographs, and placement it receives.”

The editorial board did not take such suggestions kindly, and rejected the column outright. They told Dyche that the column was not within the purview of his mandate as a conservative columnists. Editorial Director Pam Platt left Dyche a message:

Hi, John David, it’s Pam Platt at the Courier-Journal and I’m just calling to let you know that I’m not going to run your column tomorrow. To me it goes sort of off of what your column is supposed to be. My understanding is a conservative take on issues of the day and that’s not what this is. So, anyway, thanks a lot and I’ll talk to you soon.

Dyche responded by email:

[T]he submitted column is very much about “a conservative take on the issues of the day.” One of those issues is liberal media bias. Another such issue is the survival of old line newspapers in a changing media marketplace. Conservatives think there is liberal media bias and that old line newspapers would fare better in the marketplace if they made changes of the sort I propose. Indeed, your refusal to run this column vividly illustrates the very issues about which I write!

Dyche added, “If there is no change of mind on the paper’s part we should probably end my decade-old relationship with the paper.” Platt quickly wrote back, “I do want to thank you for the pieces you did on the opinion pages for the past 10 years, and I wish you the very best in your life and your work.”

That’s how the left handles calls for balance. By destroying the only semblance of balance they have left.

http://news.yahoo.com/huma-lost-her-halo-135605503.html,,[],Huma Has Lost Her Halo,"When Michele Bachmann picked on Huma Abedin a year ago — claiming she had some convoluted connection to the Muslim Brotherhood — there was a rush to defend the longtime Hillary Clinton aide. The Minnesota congresswoman quickly got a scolding from House Speaker John Boehner, Sen. John McCain, House Intelligence Committee chair Mile Rogers. But now that her husband, Anthony Weiner, is running for New York City mayor, the attacks on Abedin aren't so ridiculous, and Abedin herself is not quite so untouchable. Sen. Chuck Grassley is continuing his investigation into Abedin's unusual arrangement from June 2012 to February 2013 to work part-time as a consultant to the State Department while working as a consultant to Teneo Holdings, a New York-based strategic advisory group, the New York Daily News' Dan Friedman reports.

RELATED: Anthony Weiner May Think He's Closer Friends with the Clintons Than They Do

Grassley claims Abedin is stonewalling his investigation into whether she used her government connections to give information to Teneo clients. Abedin didn't respond to Grassley's June letter until July 5, when the Daily News reported her silence. ""I certainly never 'gathered information from government sources for the purpose of informing investment decisions of Teneo's clients,' as the Senate letter suggests,"" Abedin wrote. Grassley responds that ""The State Department and Ms. Abedin haven't provided a single document that I requested."" He says he'll keep pursuing his probe.

RELATED: What Did Huma Abedin Really Learn from Hillary Clinton?

And while there has been much praise of Abedin's handling of her first press conference this week, after it was reported that Weiner sent crotch pictures to other women more than a year after he resigned from Congress, she doesn't quite have the halo she once did. Slate's Dave Weigel points out that six years of news coverage of Abedin has remarkably focused on rave reviews of her physical appearance. (""Her appearance is just like, ‘Hoh my God!’ She takes your breath away,"" James Carville said. ""[T]he women in our office definitely watch what Huma wears,"" Philippe Reines, who later worked as Clinton's spokesman, said.) The two main non-fashion things she's known for — standing by her husband and cashing in on Washington connections — are pretty ""ordinary,"" Weigel says.

Story continues

RELATED: Huma Abedin Will Not Have Trouble Finding Her Next Job

It's in the latter category that Abedin still shines. As The Washington Post reported on Thursday, friends of Bill and Hillary Clinton generally felt that ""if you wanted to stay in Hillary’s good graces, you answer the call from Huma."" So they donated to Weiner's mayoral campaign. And they still are! At least, as long as Abedin sticks by him, the New York Post reports:

“If you look at the contributors to Anthony around the country, they weren’t giving for Anthony — they were giving for Huma,” the source said. “For many people, Huma is the gateway to Hillary. She’s one of the closest aides; she’s an adopted daughter. You think [power agent] Bob Barnett would give to Anthony? [Billionaire] Haim Saban wouldn’t give Anthony a second chance.”

But Clinton's biggest donors haven't bothered with Weiner, the Post says. That's because they ties to Hillary are already close enough."

Audits Cites Ineffective Management,"“The F.B.I. is coordinating with the Justice Department to see if any laws were broken in connection with those matters related to the I.R.S.,” Mr. Holder told reporters. “Those were, I think, as everyone can agree, if not criminal, they were certainly outrageous and unacceptable, but we are examining the facts to see if there were criminal violations.”

But a matter portrayed by the I.R.S. on Friday as a little-known operation conducted in Cincinnati, largely out of the sight of Washington officials, continued to sprawl. The report by the Treasury inspector general for tax administration offered new details on the scope and duration of the I.R.S. targeting effort.

Mismanagement at the agency allowed “inappropriate criteria” for the singling out of conservative groups to be developed and stay in place for more than 18 months, starting in 2010, the report said. That resulted in “substantial delays” for groups applying for tax-exempt status, either as 501(c)(4) or 501(c)(3) organizations, and it allowed unnecessary and intrusive information like donor lists to be gathered. I.R.S. officials told the inspector general that all donor information received was later destroyed.

Of the 296 applications the inspector general reviewed, 108 were approved, 28 were withdrawn by the applicants and 160 were still open, some pending for up to 1,138 days.

In a statement Tuesday night, the I.R.S. acknowledged that “inappropriate shortcuts were used to determine which cases may be engaging in political activities.” But it said the agency had a responsibility to make sure that such organizations did not engage in impermissible political actions, and that not just conservative groups were singled out. It also said that “there was no intent to hide this issue,” but that the agency had been awaiting the inspector general’s report.

The report said that senior I.R.S. officials told inspectors that no individual or organization outside the agency influenced the criteria used to single out Tea Party or other conservative groups.

But Congressional aides looking into the matter are not convinced. One notation in a 12-page timeline of events prepared by the inspector general stood out for exploration. On Aug. 4, 2011, officials at the I.R.S.’s rulings and agreement office met with the I.R.S.’s chief counsel “so that everyone would have the latest information on the issue,” according to the inspector general."

The Free Press reported that Bentivolio, no Edmund Gwenn in “Miracle on 34th Street,” left a teaching job in 2011 “after complaints he bullied students, even telling one class on its first day that his goal was to make all the students cry once during the year.” How much more gratifying to bully the president.

Not content with fighting off a popular immigration overhaul or threatening to shut down the government and set off the first federal default, hard-core Congressional Republicans want to nullify the election. Unlike when the Republicans did their nutty impeachment of Bill Clinton — (Newt Gingrich is back, starring in the “Crossfire” reboot) — they don’t even control the Senate. And as David Axelrod told me, there isn’t a “scintilla of justification.”

It’s lucky the president got another dog if Tom Coburn is his friend. At a town hall in Muskogee Wednesday, when an audience member called the administration “lawless,” the Oklahoma senator said his buddy was “getting perilously close” to the standard of high crimes and misdemeanors.

“I wonder what Coburn is saying about his enemies,” Axelrod says dryly.

In Texas recently, another Republican congressman, Blake Farenthold, answered a birther at a town hall. “If we were to impeach the president tomorrow, we would probably get the votes in the House of Representatives to do it,” he said, but added that it would never pass in the Senate.

At another Texas session Monday, someone asked Senator Ted Cruz (R-Canada), why they couldn’t impeach Obama. “It’s a good question,” Cruz replied, before noting that Democrats control the Senate.

Earlier this month, the president’s motorcade pulled into the Orlando Hilton and was greeted by about 50 protesters holding signs saying “Kenyan Go Home,” “Impeach Obama” and “Obama Lies.”"

Republicans say an upscale vacation is extravagant when people are struggling to make ends meet.

Democrats criticized George W. Bush for spending too much time away from Washington%2C too.

Wherever the president is%2C technology and aides make sure he%27s never completely away from work.

President Obama and his family are heading to Martha's Vineyard on Saturday for a week of rest and relaxation, but not before facing the ritual partisan grumblings that presidential vacations are extravagant and waste taxpayer money.

While Congress is in the midst of its own five-week break, Republican officials haven't missed the opportunity to question the president for heading to the upscale Massachusetts community at a time when automatic cuts to the federal budget have left the Defense Department and other agencies furloughing employees.

Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, said no one begrudges the president taking some time with his family. But Stewart, who earlier this year introduced a resolution calling on Obama to skip vacations until the White House restored public tours — mothballed as a result of across-the-board federal cuts known as sequestration— suggested the president's trip to the upscale community in Chilmark, Mass., appears ""tone deaf.""

""Most of the people in my district could never afford to visit Martha's Vineyard, and those who could would feel uncomfortable vacationing in a place that has a reputation for being for the elite,"" said Stewart in a telephone interview from his district.

Obama is scheduled to arrive on Saturday after he and first lady Michelle Obama travel to Orlando, where he will address the Disabled American Veterans National Convention. While on the Vineyard this year, the Obamas will be staying at the $7.6 million vacation home of David Schulte, a Democratic campaign donor and corporate finance manager.

Diana Waterman, chairman of the Maryland Republican Party, listed personal trips that the president and his family have taken to Hawaii, New York and Europe since the start of his presidency that were partially paid by taxpayers. With unemployment still at 7.4%, Waterman said going to the Vineyard seems exorbitant and suggested that Obama instead take his time off at the presidential retreat at Camp David.

""When there are so many people out there looking for jobs and Americans are struggling to make ends meet, this sends the wrong message to people who are struggling to survive,"" Waterman said.

White House spokesman Jay Carney on Thursday dismissed the criticism and said that Republicans scoffed at those who pilloried George W. Bush for spending too much time away from Washington during his presidency.

At the same point in Bush's presidency, the 43rd president had spent 367 days at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, and his parent's compound at Kennebunkport, Maine, according to a count by CBS News reporter Mark Knoller. Obama, who doesn't own a vacation home, has spent a total of 92 days of his presidency on vacation, according to Knoller.

""I would just check what they said six years ago,"" Carney said of the Republican criticism.

The tradition of criticizing presidents for the choice of vacation spots and duration of their holiday is as old as the Republic itself.

Republicans jeered at Bill Clinton, who famously decided to vacation at Jackson Hole, Wyo., instead of Martha's Vineyard at the advice of his pollster ahead of the 1996 election.

Even Franklin Roosevelt was criticized for spending time on a yacht, which may have led to him taking a seven-day fishing trip to Canada during World War II without letting the media know. And John Adams spent seven months at his Quincy, Mass., farm in 1798, and was accused of abdicating his office. The criticism didn't help him in his bid for a second term.

But these days, when the president is tethered by technology and a coterie of staff is always nearby, he is never completely away from work.

Obama, like his predecessors, will travel with a large entourage of aides and Secret Service, and he will receive his daily briefing on national security and the economy.

Between golf outings with friends and ice cream runs with his daughters, there will likely be private conversations with aides on a variety of issues, including the looming budget and debt-ceiling deadlines and whom he's going to pick to be the next Federal Reserve chairman.

If he's lucky, no big emergencies will upend his trip. George W. Bush had to deal with Hurricane Katrina during a vacation in the summer. Bill Clinton ordered airstrikes against al-Qaeda terrorists from Martha's Vineyard in response to the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. And George H.W. Bush was at his family's compound in coastal Maine when he planned the U.S. response to Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

Obama had to break up his annual Christmas vacation to Hawaii last year to return to Washington after he was unable to negotiate a compromise with Congress to avert across-the-board tax increases before the holiday.

It ""remains the case that wherever he is, he's president of the United States and will be dedicating a portion of his day to being briefed and working on all the issues that are on the table in front of him,"" Carney said.

Tom Fitton, the president of the conservative group Judicial Watch, said the more substantive issue is about the cost that taxpayers are footing for the president and his family's personal travel. His group has filed a series of lawsuits that have forced the Secret Service to release detailed cost breakdowns for several of the president's and his family's personal trips.

While the president pays for lodging, food and other incidentals, the government pays for Air Force One — which costs approximately $180,000 per hour to operate — and the expenses of Secret Service that must travel with him for his protection. Hotel receipts obtained by Judicial Watch earlier this summer showed that two days of hotel costs for Secret Service agents in Hawaii came to nearly $83,000.

""It's not a question of whether he's better or worse than his predecessors,"" Fitton said. ""It's a question of: Should our government be spending money on this sort of thing in this day and age?""

Surveillance programs sparked a damaging controversy

Defending the programs threaten to move key agenda items to back burner

The scarcest precious resource for second-term presidents is time

WASHINGTON — President Obama, meet the second-term curse.

Revelations that the U.S. government has been collecting a massive database of telephone usage by millions of Americans — citizens not suspected of any wrongdoing — created a firestorm Thursday that would be damaging for any administration. But it is is especially problematic for Obama because it stokes controversies he already was struggling to contain and reinforces criticism that has dogged him from the start.

Republicans have long depicted Obama as an advocate of a big, dangerous and overreaching government, back to the federal bailout of the auto industry he undertook during the financial crisis that greeted his first inauguration. That has been their fundamental philosophical objection to his signature Affordable Care Act, now just months away from implementation of its major provisions.

In recent weeks, it has fueled outrage over the targeting by the Internal Revenue Service of conservative Tea Party groups seeking non-profit status, and over the use of secret subpoenas and search warrants against the Associated Press and Fox News in Justice Department investigations of news leaks.

Now the headlines are focused on governmental monitoring that touches not just reporters but, apparently, just about anyone who makes a phone call. Thursday began with explosions over a story in The Guardian in London of a broad secret U.S. warrant for phone records from Verizon. By midday, Senate Intelligence Chairman Dianne Feinstein had confirmed the surveillance had been going on for years. By the end of the day, The Washington Post and The Guardian reported that a data-mining program targeting foreigners was tapping into such Internet companies as Microsoft, Google, Yahoo and Facebook.

All that overwhelmed the president's planned message for the day, and likely well beyond. (For the record, he had stopped by Mooresville Middle School outside Charlotte to promote his plan to provide schools with high-speed Internet access. Not that anyone noticed.)

And in a bit of timing that is at least awkward, he holds high-profile meetings in California today with President Xi Jinping of China — a government the United States has long faulted for its heavy-handed treatment of its own people.

Indeed, as a U.S. senator from Illinois in 2007, Barack Obama blasted President George W. Bush for sweeping surveillance of Americans in the name of battling terrorism — just the sort of justification that Obama officials were making Thursday.

Then, Obama called it ""a false choice between the liberties we cherish and the security we demand.""

""I will provide our intelligence and law enforcement agencies with the tools they need to track and take out the terrorists without undermining our Constitution and our freedom,"" he said in a speech then. ""No more national security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime. No more tracking citizens who do nothing more than protest a misguided war. No more ignoring the law when it is inconvenient. That is not who we are. And it is not what is necessary to defeat the terrorists.""

To be sure, Obama didn't launch the data-mining initiatives, which were started during the Bush administration, though he has expanded them. He had defenders Thursday ranging from California Sen. Feinstein, a liberal Democrat, to South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a conservative Republican. ""It's called protecting America,"" Feinstein said.

But his critics also spanned the political spectrum. ""Is it just me, or is secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous?"" former vice president Al Gore posted on Twitter. Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, an author of the Patriot Act that was used to obtain the court order, called it ""excessive and un-American.""

The scarcest precious resource for second-term presidents isn't political clout, which they demonstrate by joining the small fraternity of those who have managed to win the presidency twice. It is time — the time to pursue the agenda they choose before a scandal or foreign-policy crisis erupts, and before the next presidential campaign begins to consume all the oxygen in town. For former president Bill Clinton, the Monica Lewinsky affair ended his hopes of winning serious entitlement reform during his second term. Former president Richard Nixon found himself bedeviled with and eventually forced from office by the Watergate scandal.

Obama's plan has been to be able to win approval for and sign a comprehensive immigration bill in Congress by fall. He hopes to be able to negotiate a big budget deal that would curb the deficit and put Medicare on a firmer long-term footing before the 2014 midterm elections and the 2016 presidential race seize the political world.

Instead, explaining and defending these surveillance programs — what they are, how they work and why he thinks they're needed — are about to take up a lot of his time."

Yeah, why didn’t these guys do things the normal way? A donation to the campaign war chest and a promise to “keep in close contact,” followed by a visit from a lobbyist with a copy of the proposed legislation?

“Most lawmakers in Congress do a lot of that stuff. They’re just more tactful in how they go about it,” said Melanie Sloan of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. She recalled the recent discovery that Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey had been using his influence to try to resolve a multimillion-dollar Medicare billing dispute for a Florida ophthalmologist whose company contributed more than $700,000 toward the election of Senate Democrats, Menendez included. The senator, who is nothing if not a skilled practitioner of business as usual, is shocked, wounded and dismayed that anyone would imagine a quid pro quo.

“At least he’s expensive,” Sloan said.

Our New York gang comes pretty cheap. Although perhaps it’s heartening to realize that America is still a country so filled with promise that even the chairman of the Bronx Republican Party can dream of one day being indicted for taking a $15,000 bribe. There are hardly any Republicans in the Bronx to chair — the party leader himself, who got the job when his predecessor went to the clink, actually lives someplace in the suburbs.

One of the stranger elements to the New York story was word that a Bronx assemblyman named Nelson Castro has been wearing a wire for the feds for virtually his entire political career. He originally got into trouble when election officials noticed nine voters were registered as living with him in his one-bedroom apartment. Unable to demonstrate how all that worked out, Castro agreed to cooperate with authorities and became the F.B.I.’s own social networking system. Nobody knows yet what else showed up on the Castro tapes, but the assemblyman announced his resignation this week, expressing pride “of my accomplishments and the many benefits that I have secured on behalf of my district over the last four years.”

The 70-year-old Democrat vowed to change his behavior, admitting “I need help.”

“I have reached into my heart and soul and realize I must and will change my behavior,” Filner said, indicating he will not resign. He said he and his staff will take the sexual harassment training offered by the city.

“If my behavior doesn’t change, I cannot succeed in leading this city,” Filner said.

On a DVD given to the media, Filner said: “As someone who has spent a lifetime fighting for equality for all people, I am embarrassed to admit that I have failed to fully respect the women who work for me and with me, and that at times I have intimidated them.”

Filner, elected in November, said he knows that San Diego residents “have every right to be disappointed” in him but asked that “you give me an opportunity to prove I am capable of change, so that the vision I have for our city’s future can be realized.”

Filner was not available to answer questions about the allegations.

Earlier Thursday, three longtime Filner friends and supporters — former City Councilwoman Donna Frye and lawyers Marco Gonzalez and Cory Briggs — called on him to resign for what one called “truly reprehensible” behavior toward several women on his staff.

Frye, her voice breaking, said the women “are too scared to speak.” Briggs said his message to the women is, “When you’re ready to file lawsuits, I’ll be standing in court.”

“The mayor is in control of the script,” Gonzalez said. “The next chapter will largely be defined by his response.”

Gonzalez said late Thursday that he, Frye, and Briggs would not comment on Filner’s statement until Friday.

The mayor was particularly stung by Frye’s call for his resignation. “When a friend like Donna Frye is compelled to call for my resignation, I’m clearly doing something wrong,” Filner said.

Even as he issued his apology, Filner sought to indicate his support for anti-sex harassment measures.

“It’s a good thing that behavior that would have been tolerated in the past is being called out in this generation for what it is: inappropriate and wrong,” Filner said.

USA TODAY

At least 18 women have accused the mayor of inappropriate behavior

Filner has been sued by former aide for sexual harassment and faces a recall attempt

He recently underwent therapy

San Diego Mayor Bob Filner reportedly will resign as part of a deal to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit, according to news media reports

The Los Angeles Times, NBC News 7 and ABC in San Diego quoted unnamed sources saying the embattled mayor will step down after the proposed settlement is discussed at a closed-door City Council session Friday. The sources were granted anonymity by the news outlets because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

An attorney for Filner, James Payne, released a statement acknowledging a tentative agreement with the city but said he could not comment or disclose details.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed by City Attorney Jan Goldsmith, who said the City Council has to review and vote on the details.

In exchange for Filner's resignation, the city will reportedly pay ""some, if not all"" of Filner's share of damages awarded in the lawsuit, according to the Los Angeles Times story. The article cites unnamed sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.

At least 18 women have come forward to accuse the mayor, a Democrat and former member of Congress, of inappropriate behavior such as groping and unwanted kissing. He has apologized for his behavior and recently went through two weeks of therapy.

Attorney Gloria Allred, who represents Filner accuser Irene McCormack Jackson in the lawsuit, said Thursday that she and her client have not signed off on any details agreed to between the mayor and the city of San Diego.

Allred stressed that taxpayer money should not be used to help Filner pay any current or future legal bills or for ""any payment to him whatsoever.""

""I would like to see a resignation without conditions and without taxpayers being forced to make a gift of public funds to him in order for him to resign,"" Allred said at a news conference, adding that if the deal between Filner and the city involved only his resignation there would be no need for the council to approve the terms.

Steve Erie, University of California-San Diego political science professor who participated in writing the city's charter, said any agreement that gets the mayor to resign would likely involve covering his legal costs. He said the city already does that in cases of misconduct by other municipal workers including police.

He called Allred's latest comments ""grandstanding'' and said such objections to an agreement with Filner could prolong efforts to get him to leave office. Erie said the city's only real leverage in getting the mayor to leave voluntarily is financial.

""He doesn't have deep pockets,"" Erie said. ""Plus if he hasn't resigned by now, you have to remove the financial risk to get him to resign. Anything that makes that harder, like Allred's statement, I find deeply troubling.''

The council agreed last month not to pay Filner's legal bills and voted to sue him to recover any costs the city incurs as a result of the sexual harassment lawsuit.

Council member Kevin Faulconer, who was part of the mediation talks, said he was trying to balance protecting taxpayers with ending the drama over the embattled mayor.

""I joined these mediation discussions to ensure the city gets the best deal possible for taxpayers,'' he said. ""We must put this civic dysfunction behind us and return to providing city services to San Diegans.""

Allred and her client, along with representatives of the city, took part in the first of three days of mediation presided over by a retired federal judge this week. Filner, his attorneys, representatives of the city and two council members also participated in the mediation.

A petition drive to recall the mayor began recently, and organizers have vowed they will not stop collecting signatures unless Filner, elected in November, leaves office. Filner has rebuffed repeated calls to step aside from his colleagues on the City Council as well as from top Democrats, such as national party chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and both of California's U.S. senators.

Dianne York, a San Diego businesswoman, became the 18th woman to accuse Filner when she came forward this week. She said the mayor put his hands on her buttocks during a photo opportunity this year.

McCormack Jackson, Filner's former communication director, filed her lawsuit in July accusing Filner of inappropriate behavior. In the court documents, she described being drawn into a virtual ""head lock"" with the mayor as he suggested they have sex.

Filner, 70, served in Congress for 10 terms until he became the first Democrat elected to lead San Diego in 20 years.

He Previously Wrote About The Russia Investigation.']",Calderon family’s ties to Central Basin water board probed by FBI,"This post has been updated. See below for details.

SACRAMENTO — A day after FBI agents raided the Capitol office of Sen. Ron Calderon (D-Montebello), local officials from Southern California said they have been interviewed by federal agents about the senator’s connection to a local water board.

While the U.S. Attorney’s office on Wednesday remained mum about the focus of the investigation, the Central Basin Municipal Water District has been at the center of a number of controversies for years. Some of those controversies have focused on the Calderon family’s relationship with the district.

FOR THE RECORD:

Calderon investigation: An article in the June 6 Section A about an FBI investigation into Sen. Ron Calderon (D-Montebello) said that the senator’s brother, former Assemblyman Tom Calderon, received $140,000 per year from the company Water2Save, which was chosen for a project by the Central Basin Municipal Water District. Tom Calderon’s $140,000-per-year contract was with Central Basin. He had a separate consulting contract with Water2Save.



Among those who have raised public concerns about the district is Congresswoman Grace Napolitano (D-Norwalk). In an interview Wednesday, she said she has heard complaints from cities she represents dating back more than a decade about the Central Basin Water District’s lack of transparency and questionable spending of public funds.

IN DEPTH: Calderon targeted by FBI

In particular, Napolitano questioned how the district spent $5.6 million in federal funds she helped secure to build infrastructure for a regional system to recycle water.

The district received a subsequent research grant from the Department of Energy in conjunction with HydroEarth, a Lake Forest-based water management firm. But instead of moving forward with the original research proposal, Central Basin amended the project and opened it up for competitive bidding. Staffers subsequently chose to partner with a different company, Water2Save, a firm that paid Ron Calderon’s brother, former Assemblyman Tom Calderon, $140,000 per year.

[UPDATED: 3:22 p.m. June 5: Tom Calderon also received more than $10,000 per month as a consultant for the district.]

Questions emerged from cities in the area about increased water rates and how the district was spending that money. Napolitano said she was never able to get answers about what was happening.

“It was just ridiculous,” she said. “This is ratepayer money. It’s not the Central Basin’s money.”

In 2009, she pushed for state auditors to step in and examine the board’s proposed rate hike, its spending of federal stimulus dollars, and review its spending on lobbying and political consultants.

Napolitano blames Ron Calderon for thwarting her audit request. “I was concerned there was state money, too, that was being misused,” she said.

She said Calderon assured state officials he would convene meetings of local stakeholders to work through their concerns. Those meetings never happened, according to Napolitano.

Concerns extend to cities that are members of the Central Basin Water District.

“There’s been a lot of seemingly dubious things in regards to their contracts, the costs of certain projects, and how they spend their money,” said Thaddeus McCormack, city manager for Santa Fe Springs. “We’ve had questions for a long time. Now, we may finally get some answers to those questions.”

One of McCormack’s concerns involved the Calderons. “Tom is a paid consultant to the district. We believe the senator is an advocate for them. That connection never seemed comfortable,” he said. “It’s raised eyebrows for years.”

In 2011, Ron Calderon introduced a bill that would have given the Central Basin control over groundwater in the area, part of an ongoing rivalry between Central Basin and a neighboring water district.

The bill died in the Senate without ever having a hearing.

Another city official in Los Angeles County, who declined to be identified speaking about the investigation, said he spoke with the FBI about the water district.

The conversation focused on consulting contracts held by Tom Calderon and legislation authored by Ron Calderon, the official said.

“That was 100% of what they were asking about,” the official added.

Note: An earlier version of this post said that Tom Calderon is a paid consultant for the water district. That contract was terminated earlier this year, according to James Roybal, president of the Central Basin Municipal Water District’s board of directors

During Thanksgiving week, the Treasury Department announced a proposal to limit the political activity of 501(c)(4) groups. The Obama Administration claimed that the plan was necessary to clarify confusing tax laws.

The House Ways and Means Committee investigators believe that the proposal was designed by examining Tea Party group applications, figuring out exactly how they proceeded, then limiting those very actions in the new proposal, thus shutting them out of the political process.

House Ways & Means Chairman Dave Camp said, “The committee has reviewed thousands of tax exempt applications. The new regulation so closely mirrors the abused tea-party group applications, it leads me to question if this new proposed regulation is simply another form of targeting.”

Tea Party groups, just as other tax-exempt 501(c)(4) organizations, have to prove that the majority of their work is for “primary” social-welfare purpose if they want to keep their tax-exempt status. The primary purpose of most Tea party groups is illuminating for Americans the size of government and the erosion of the Constitution. They do so through nonpartisan voter guides, speakers forums, pamphlets, or voter-registration drives.

Now, however, the IRS is planning to recognize those very activities as “political activity,” not “social welfare,” thus rendering Tea Party groups unfit for 501(c)(4) status.

Thus, the new proposal is not about clarifying tax laws but rather, as Dave Camp stated, “to put Tea Party groups out of business.”

The new rule only applies to 501(c)(4) groups. The League of Women Voters Education Fund, a Democratic stronghold, is registered as a 501(c)(3), considered a “charity” that is strictly limited regarding its political activity. That same organization claims on its website that it holds “candidate debates and forums,” and its “educational activities” include “understanding candidate views and ballot initiatives.”

The League can still issue its voter guides, registrations, and candidate forums. Any conservative social-welfare organization acting similarly will probably lose its tax-exempt status. And guess which groups are unaffected by the new rule, because they are 501(c)(5)s?

As Strassel writes:

The same president who in May was “outraged” by the IRS’s actions now says it was all just some confusion over tax law (which his new rule fixes). He told Chris Matthews last week that the media had hyped what was a few poor IRS souls in Cincinnati who were “trying to streamline what is a difficult law to interpret… And they’ve got a list, and suddenly everybody’s outraged.”"

USA TODAY

Two years after saying President Obama had not met an uncle who faced deportation, the White House said Thursday that Obama lived briefly with him back in the 1980s.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said that Obama met Onyango Obama when he arrived in Cambridge, Mass., in the late 1980s to attend Harvard Law School; Obama stayed briefly with his uncle until his new apartment was ready.

Carney said the White House staff based its 2011 claim that the two had never met on a review of the documentary record — including Obama's memoir — and had not asked the president himself.

When the issue resurfaced this week, Carney said, ""I thought it was the right thing to do to go ask him (Obama). Nobody had asked him in the past.""

On Tuesday, an immigration judge ruled that the Kenya-born Onyango Obama could stay in the United States, saying he met the criteria for legal permanent residency.

During the hearing, Onyango Obama — the half-brother of the president's father — claimed a relationship with his famous nephew.

The president and his uncle have not stayed in touch, Carney said.

""The president has not seen Omar Obama in 20 years and has not spoken with him in roughly 10 years,"" Carney said.

Carney also repeated that the White House had ""absolutely zero"" involvement in the uncle's deportation case.

From The Boston Globe, which first reported the story:

""President Obama acknowledged on Thursday that he lived with his Kenyan uncle for a brief period in the 1980s while preparing to attend Harvard Law School, contradicting a statement more than a year ago that the White House had no record of the two ever meeting.

""Their relationship came into question on Tuesday at the deportation hearing of his uncle, Onyango Obama, in Boston immigration court. His uncle had lived in the United States illegally since the 1970s and revealed in testimony for the first time that his famous nephew had stayed at his Cambridge apartment for about three weeks. At the time, Onyango Obama was here illegally and fighting deportation.

""On Thursday, a White House official said the press office had not fully researched the relationship between the president and his uncle before telling the Globe that they had no record of the two meeting. This time, the press office asked the president directly, which they had not done in 2011."""

WASHINGTON, June 4 (Reuters) - Tea Party and other conservative groups delivered an emotional plea for Washington to rein in government overreach on Tuesday as they told lawmakers about how the Internal Revenue Service targeted them with relentless paperwork and intrusive questions when they sought tax-exempt status.

The House Ways and Means Committee invited a collection of groups to speak about their experiences as details continue to emerge about how and why IRS officials in a Cincinnati, Ohio, field office began targeting conservative groups for extra scrutiny.

""This was not an accident. This is a willful act of intimidation intended to discourage a point of view,"" said Becky Gerritson, president of a Tea Party group in Wetumpka, Alabama.

She tearfully described how she and her husband had to seek legal counsel when confronted with questionnaires about their donors, communications with legislators and their voter education activities.

""I'm not interested in scoring political points. I want to protect and preserve the America I grew up in,"" Gerritson said.

Multiple congressional committees and the Department of Justice have opened probes into the matter, which has become a distraction as President Barack Obama pursues an aggressive second-term agenda.

They are trying to determine if the IRS had a political agenda in subjecting these groups to extra scrutiny, or if workers in the tax-exempt division chose partisan criteria as a way to cope with a flood of applications starting in 2010.

Current and former officials have defended IRS employees by saying they were given a challenging task of determining the level of political activity among 501(c)4 groups. Those social welfare groups are eligible for tax-exempt status as long as their activities are not primarily political.

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle on Tuesday condemned the IRS and pledged to find out who was responsible for the targeting and what their motivation was.

""We have found a cancer someplace in Cincinnati...and we have to find out what caused this,"" Democrat Representative Charles Rangel of New York said during the hearing.

The leaders of Tea Party and religious groups said they were harassed by IRS officials and said the demanding questionnaires reflected an intolerance for their views.

Coalition for Life of Iowa president Sue Martinek recounted how an IRS employee asked that her group, which opposes abortion rights, agree in writing not to picket the abortion provider Planned Parenthood.

""We had done nothing wrong. We had not indicated that we would do anything but peaceably assemble and hold up signs like 'Stop abortion' and 'Pray to end abortion,'"" she said.

Democrat Jim McDermott, while expressing outrage at the IRS mismanagement, challenged some of the groups' assertions that they were repressed by the IRS's treatment. He said the groups were seeking a tax exemption and the IRS had to ask questions.

""None of your organizations were kept from organizing or silenced. We are talking about whether or not the American public will subsidize your work,"" said McDermott. ""Each of your groups is highly political."" (Reporting By Kim Dixon, writing by Karey Van Hall; Editing by Claudia Parsons)"

According to reports in the New York Times and Politico, Hillary Clinton “created an arrangement” for Abedin to “work for private clients as a consultant while serving as a top adviser in the department” during her final months at the State Department last year.

The arrangement was reportedly made in June of 2012, when Abedin “quietly left her position” as deputy chief of and became a “special government employee.”

Abedin continued to be publicly identified as Clinton’s “deputy chief of staff,” and she allegedly “did not disclose the arrangement–or how much income she earned–on her financial report” that “requires officials to make public any significant sources of income.”

According to the Times, Abedin “worked for Teneo, a strategic consulting firm, which was founded by Doug Band, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton.” The firm has “advised corporate clients like Coca-Cola and MF Global,” which collapsed while being run by disgraced former New Jersey Governor and top Obama bundler Jon Corzine.

Abedin also “served as a consultant to the William Jefferson Clinton Foundation and worked in a personal capacity” for Hillary Clinton “as she prepared to transition out of her job as secretary of state.”

Officials in the State Department are reportedly sensitive about the arrangement, which ended in March when Abedin became director of Clinton’s transition office.

Even liberal watchdog groups like CREW said the arrangement was “unusual.”

“If she was being held out as a deputy chief of staff, it would be highly unusual for her to be a part-time employee or a consultant,” Melanie Sloan, CREW’s director, told the Times.

These revelations come to light as Abedin’s husband–Weiner–has hired Danny Kedem, a former staffer for Hillary Clinton’s failed 2008 presidential bid, as his campaign manager and is reportedly expected to formally announce next week that he will run for mayor of New York."

Attorney General Eric Holder, a political lightning rod for Republican critics of the Obama administration, is under fire for two cases involving secret subpoenas or searches for phone records and other information of journalists involved in reports about leaked classified information.

1. What’s the problem?

In the first case, the Justice Department last year obtained two months of phone records for reporters and editors at The Associated Press as part of a probe that the news service said was focused on its account of a foiled plot to bomb a U.S. airliner in May 2012.

The second case involves subpoenas and search warrants in 2010 to obtain phone records, e-mails and security badge tracking of a Fox News correspondent who reported on classified intelligence about North Korea in 2009.

Leak probe notification called into question

Members of the press and critics led by Republican foes of Holder complained the covert surveillance amounted to targeting journalists as potential criminals, which would chill investigative reporting and potentially violate First Amendment rights of a free press.

Lawmakers question whether Holder gave false testimony

Shield law might have kept feds from prying

In the investigation of leaks to the AP, employees of the news service were never singled out as potential criminals.

However, the affidavit for a search warrant in the Fox case included an FBI agent’s statement that a network reporter – later identified as James Rosen – could potentially be an “aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator” to the crime of disclosing secret information.

In addition, Justice Department officials confirmed that Holder took part in “discussions” about seeking the search warrant.

The Justice Department did not prosecute Rosen, nor did it file charges against him. While he was listed as a “co-conspirator,” that often does not mean he would be considered a target.

Last week, President Barack Obama ordered Holder to review government practices in investigating leaks of secret information.

Obama wants review of leaks probe

His administration has been more aggressive in probing classified leaks than those of his predecessors, but Obama said he was “troubled by the possibility that leak investigations may chill the investigative journalism that holds government accountable.”

Some Republicans complained that Holder’s involvement meant he would be reviewing himself, due to the affidavit that said he took part in discussions on a search warrant of Rosen’s phone records and emails.

Choice of Holder to lead leak review questioned

2. What are the latest developments?

On Wednesday, the GOP leaders of the House Judiciary Committee sent Holder a letter asking for further information about whether he lied to Congress when he said at a May 15 hearing that he never took part in any “potential prosecution of the press for the disclosure of material.”

“… That is not something that I have ever been involved in, heard or, or would think would be wise policy,” Holder said in response to questioning by Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia on possible use of the Espionage Act to prosecute members of the news media for publishing classified information.

May 15: Holder cites recusal, says little about AP probe

The letter to Holder from committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia and Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin noted that the affidavit for the search warrant for Rosen’s phone, e-mail and security badge information only became public after the May 15 hearing.

They questioned whether Holder’s response to Johnson’s question amounted to lying under oath because of subsequent media reports that the Justice Department confirmed Holder took part in discussions on seeking a search warrant.

“How can you claim to have never even heard of’ the potential prosecution of the press but were, at a minimum, involved in discussions regarding Mr. Rosen?” asked the letter by Goodlatte and Sensenbrenner.

While Holder was asked about the AP case at the May 15 committee hearing, the issue of the Fox reporter never came up.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday that no prosecution ever took place in the Fox case, and therefore it was “self-evident” that any charge Holder lied to the House panel was “inaccurate.”

Implying that Republicans were playing politics, Carney said reporters should “be careful not to conflate facts with statements by members of Congress about what they want to be true.” Pressed further, he added that reporters were “conflating a subpoena with prosecution.”

Asked if Obama still had full confidence in the attorney general, Carney replied: “He absolutely does, yes.”

On Tuesday, Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said Holder “was forthright and did not mislead the committee” on May 15.

“Certainly, there are policy disagreements as to how the First Amendment should apply to these series of leak investigations being conducted by the Justice Department and that is and should be an area for the committee to consider,” Conyers said in a statement. “However, there is no need to turn a policy disagreement into allegations of misconduct.”

Meanwhile, a Justice Department official said Wednesday that Holder will meet with officials from media organizations this week as part of his review of how the federal government handles leak investigations.

The meetings with chiefs of Washington bureaus will begin Thursday and include representatives from newspapers, wire services, radio and television broadcasters, and online organizations, the official said.

3. What’s the background?

With an eye toward the 2014 congressional elections and the 2016 presidential campaign, Republicans are trying to depict the Obama administration as rife with scandals.

These include the two cases involving Holder as well as IRS targeting of conservative groups and erroneous talking points about the Benghazi, Libya, terrorist attack.

Benghazi: GOP digs in for long haul

Like many attorneys general, Holder has been a focus of political attacks throughout Obama’s White House tenure.

In particular, conservative Republicans have taken aim at Holder over efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility, a decision to stop enforcing the Defense of Marriage Act, and the handling of the botched “Fast and Furious” gun-walking program.

At the same time, Holder has been praised by Obama and liberals for taking a lead role on socially progressive issues such as gay marriage and immigration.

Last year, House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa of California led a GOP effort to cite Holder for contempt of Congress in a dispute over documents the panel sought in the “Fast and Furious” investigation.

Issa and other Republicans said Holder refused to turn over requested documents necessary for a full inquiry of the program in which federal agents allowed illegal weapons sales across the border with Mexico, then lost track of the firearms.

Holder maintained the House contempt vote boycotted by most Democrats amounted to political theater, and he recently criticized Issa for what he called a pattern of incomplete or misleading statements.

“It is inappropriate and it is too consistent with the way in which you conduct yourself as a member of Congress,” Holder said at the May 15 hearing of the judiciary panel that includes Issa. “It is unacceptable and it is shameful.”

4. What does Holder have to say?

At the May 15 hearing, Holder testified under oath that he had recused himself from the AP case because he had previously been questioned regarding who knew what about the classified leak. Therefore, he said, he had no role in last year’s decision by Deputy Attorney General James Cole to seek the secret subpoena of AP phone records.

Holder has yet to comment specifically on Rosen’s case. On Tuesday, he told reporters he was “not satisfied” with some federal guidelines on how prosecutors conduct leak investigations involving reporters.

“We’re going to have a real frank, good conversation about this,” Holder said. “And I think, we’re going to make some changes because I’m not satisfied with where we are.”

5. What happens now?

There will be more congressional hearings and investigations, more political rancor and the possibility of some fallout if further disclosures reveal Holder knowingly misled Congress or inappropriately concealed information.

His defiance in the face of the House contempt citation indicates Holder won’t voluntarily step down unless pressured to do so by Obama, who has steadfastly maintained confidence in him.

The question will be whether Holder becomes a liability for the president.

If the multiple controversies (IRS targeting, Benghazi, reporters phone records) continue to dominate the political discussion, Obama could decide a drastic gesture is needed to try to move past a climate of crises. However, nothing at this point suggests that is imminent or under consideration.

This was only the latest attack on the news media under Holder's leadership.

His value to President Obama has been his absolute loyalty.

The feeble response was the ultimate proof that these are Obama's sins.

Recently, Attorney General Eric Holder appeared before the House Judiciary Committee to answer questions about the administration's sweeping surveillance of journalists with the Associated Press. In the greatest attack on the free press in decades, the Justice Department seized phone records for reporters and editors in at least three AP offices as well as its office in the House of Representatives. Holder, however, proceeded to claim absolute and blissful ignorance of the investigation, even failing to recall when or how he recused himself.

Yet, this was only the latest attack on the news media under Holder's leadership. Despite his record, he expressed surprise at the hearing that the head of the Republican National Committee had called for his resignation. After all, Holder pointed out, he did nothing. That is, of course, precisely the point. Unlike the head of the RNC, I am neither a Republican nor conservative, and I believe Holder should be fired.

The 'sin eater'

Holder's refusal to accept responsibility for the AP investigation was something of a change for the political insider. His value to President Obama has been his absolute loyalty. Holder is what we call a ""sin eater"" inside the Beltway — high-ranking associates who shield presidents from responsibility for their actions. Richard Nixon had H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman. Ronald Reagan had Oliver North and Robert ""Bud"" McFarlane. George W. Bush had the ultimate sin eater: Dick Cheney, who seemed to have an insatiable appetite for sins to eat.

This role can be traced to 18th century Europe, when families would use a sin eater to clean the moral record of a dying person by eating bread from the person's chest and drinking ale passed over his body. Back then, the ritual's power was confined to removing minor sins.

For Obama, there has been no better sin eater than Holder. When the president promised CIA employees early in his first term that they would not be investigated for torture, it was the attorney general who shielded officials from prosecution. When the Obama administration decided it would expand secret and warrantless surveillance, it was Holder who justified it. When the president wanted the authority to kill any American he deemed a threat without charge or trial, it was Holder who went public to announce the ""kill list"" policy.

Last week, the Justice Department confirmed that it was Holder who personally approved the equally abusive search of Fox News correspondent James Rosen's e-mail and phone records in another story involving leaked classified information. In the 2010 application for a secret warrant, the Obama administration named Rosen as ""an aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator"" to the leaking of classified materials. The Justice Department even investigated Rosen's parents' telephone number, and Holder was there to justify every attack on the news media.

Ignoble legacy

Yet, at this month's hearing, the attorney general had had his fill. Accordingly, Holder adopted an embarrassing mantra of ""I have no knowledge"" and ""I had no involvement"" throughout the questioning. When he was not reciting the equivalent to his name, rank and serial number, he was implicating his aide, Deputy Attorney General James Cole. Cole, it appears, is Holder's sin eater. Holder was so busy denying responsibility for today's scandals, he began denying known facts about older scandals, such as the ""Fast and Furious"" gun operation.

In the end, Holder was the best witness against his continuing in office. His insistence that he did nothing was a telling moment. The attorney general has done little in his tenure to protect civil liberties or the free press. Rather, Holder has supervised a comprehensive erosion of privacy rights, press freedom and due process. This ignoble legacy was made possible by Democrats who would look at their shoes whenever the Obama administration was accused of constitutional abuses.

On Thursday, Obama responded to the outcry over the AP and Fox scandals by calling for an investigation by ... you guessed it ... Eric Holder. He ordered Holder to meet with news media representatives to hear their ""concerns"" and report back to him. He sent his old sin eater for a confab with the very targets of the abusive surveillance. Such an inquiry offers no reason to trust its conclusions.

The feeble response was the ultimate proof that these are Obama's sins despite his effort to feign ignorance. It did not matter that Holder is the sin eater who has lost his stomach or that such mortal sins are not so easily digested. Indeed, these sins should be fatal for any attorney general.

Who knows? Because, for all 54 instances, there were only three Congressional hearings, or bleh. But young William thought our study needed more study.



BILL O'REILLY (5/9/2013): When you study the study, you find that many of the cited attacks occurred in Iraq, during the war.

Eight out of 54! How is that ""many""? I mean, by that math, you, Bill O'Reilly, have many viewers who are not bedridden and cathetera... catheterized. Catheterized, I said cathedralized.

And by the way, I'm pretty sure attacking diplomatic targets in Iraq still counts as an attack. But here's where my friend, he just got mean!



BILL O'REILLY (5/9/2013): Jon Stewart apparently got his information from the far-left websites Media Matters and the DailyKos.

(audience laughter)

Do you see DailyKos or Media Matters in there? It's mostly side boob related sites and a little ESPN.

Actually, we did get our info straight from the University of Maryland's National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, an outfit so reliable, it was even cited last week by a certain FoxNews.com. So, boom. By the way, that website could use a side boob section.

All right, listen. But here's the thing. Why bother? Why bother fighting, O'Reilly? It doesn't matter. It doesn't even make sense to argue with him, because facts don't matter to that side. In their paranoid fever dreams, the State Department and the CIA changing talking points is irrefutable evidence Obama left people to die so that he could swing Ohio, despite there being no shred of evidence to validate their full-blown right-wing persecution victimization complex.



SCOTT PELLEY (5/10/2013): The Internal Revenue Service admitted today that some of its employees targeted conservative political groups for extra scrutiny, in violation of its own policy, and despite its earlier denials.

NANCY CORDES, CBS (5/13/2013): In the spring of 2010, just as the Tea Party movement was gaining steam, a group of IRS specialists were told to focus on organizations with ""political sounding names"" seeking tax-exempt status.

NANCY CORDES, CBS (5/13/2013): Groups with names like ""We the People"" or ""Take Back the Country"".

NANCY CORDES, CBS (5/13/2013): Specialists were told to ""be on the lookout for Tea Party applications"", along with groups whose mission was to ""educate about the Constitution"".

And while the tax-exempt status that all political groups get is kind of bullshit, it's bullshit that should at least be granted fairly and equitably, spread around evenly, if you will. So unlike much of the Benghazi inquiry, this seems like a genuine scandal. So explanation please, let's say from the individual who oversees tax-exempt organizations for the IRS.



LOIS LERNER, IRS DIRECTOR OF EXEMPT ORGANIZATIONS (5/10/2013): They used names like Tea Party or Patriots, and they selected cases simply because the application had those names in the title. That was wrong. The IRS would like to apologize for that.

And since we're talking about this, you know how on my taxes I put down that I have a farm? Actually, I had a salad. So... sorry.

But don't worry, it gets funnier!



5/10/2013: LOIS LERNER, IRS DIRECTOR OF EXEMPT ORGANIZATIONS: I said that about a quarter of the cases that were selected for full developments had either Tea Party or Patriot in their name. TOM COSTELLO, NBC NEWS: OK. Sorry. Thank you for the clarification. But that would be a quarter of the 300 then, so we are talking 75 or so? LOIS LERNER, IRS DIRECTOR OF EXEMPT ORGANIZATIONS: That's correct. Is that a quarter? That's correct. Thank you. I'm not good at math.

That's a good one! Lady who works at the place that calculates people's taxes.

Well, congratulations, President Barack Obama. Conspiracy theorists, who generally can survive in anaerobic environments, have just had an algae bloom dropped on their fucking heads. Thus removing the last arrow in your pro-governance quiver. Skepticism about your opponents. Gun control. Why can't we have background checks?



SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (4/17/2013): I believe it would put us inexorably on the path to a national gun registry.

This has, in one seismic moment, shifted the burden of proof from the tinfoil-behatted to the government. The VA claims backlog and the bounced checks foreclosure clusterfuck had already given government competence fetishists fits. (tries saying that again) Government competence fetishists fits.

And now this. In a few short weeks, you've managed to show that when the government wants to do good things, your managerial competence falls somewhere between David Brent, and a cat chasing a laser pointer. But when government wants to flex its more malevolent muscles, YOU'RE FUCKING IRON MAN!!

You know what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm overreacting. I still believe, I really do, that good government has the power to improve people's lives, and that the people have the power to restrain its excesses. I forget that sometimes, and I'm sorry. It's gonna be OK, and form of government is bigger than just these issues. This storm will pass. It's just... (listens to earpiece) Really? Right now?

Also entering the building were two members of the City Council and attorney Gloria Allred, who represents Filner’s former director of communications, Irene McCormack Jackson, in a lawsuit seeking unspecified damages from Filner and the city.

Council President Todd Gloria, a Democrat, and Councilman Kevin Faulconer, the council’s senior Republican, are set to meet with City Atty. Jan Goldsmith on Tuesday.

Goldsmith last week said that he expects Filner to either resign or be ousted and that he was working on a potential settlement to the lawsuit that would provide Filner with “an exit.”

Allred declined comment Monday on whether the settlement discussions involved the possibility that Filner would resign as she has demanded.

The 70-year-old Democrat has refused demands from all nine council members, and numerous members of the the Democratic Party in Sacramento and Washington, to resign.

Sixteen women have accused Filner of sexual harassment, including three city employees, two military veterans, a retired Navy admiral, a nurse, two singers, two business executives, and two college officials. The harassment, they said, included unwanted touching and inappropriate sexual comments.

A recall movement began Sunday to gather enough signatures to force a recall election. Former Councilman Carl DeMaio, who lost to Filner in the November election, announced Monday that he will assist the signature-gathering campaign and urged members of the City Council to do the same.

But also Monday, supporters of Filner held a rally and news conference outside City Hall. Kathleen Harmon, a longtime supporter, told a small crowd that, “We’re going to stand behind him. We ask him not to resign.”

Rally organizer Enrique Morones, an activist on the issue of immigrant rights, ended the rally with the call, “Bob, get back to mayoring. We love you.”

When Filner announced he would undergo two weeks of intensive behavioral therapy, he said he would return to City Hall on Aug. 19 ready to be “the best mayor I can.”

But the Justice Department's leak investigation is different. Mainstream outrage is built into the scandal, because it directly affects mainstream news reporters. And so, The Daily Beast's Daniel Klaidman reports, when it became public that the DOJ had subpoenaed Associated Press phone records and gotten a search warrant a Fox News reporter's emails, Holder ""was also beginning to feel a creeping sense of personal remorse."" The remorse came not when he approved the Rosen search warrant, but once everyone found out about it. The DOJ went into ""damage-control mode."" That Holder takes this controversy very seriously is clear in all the things he's doing to fix his image.

RELATED: Tracy Flick-Like D.C. People Shocked That Kids Nap During Holder's Speech

1. Promise we didn't mean it. After being called by The Washington Post about the Rosen story, the DOJ prepared a response to say they never were going to prosecute Rosen.

2. Promise it will never happen again. Holder ""and his advisers began exploring ways to reform the Justice Department’s internal guidelines for investigating leaks to safeguard the media against overly intrusive tactics,"" Klaidman reports. He offers a few reasons for the decision Holder now regrets: he was under a lot of pressure to prosecute leaks, the White House didn't push back against that pressure, there were gaps in the DOJ guidelines, and prosecutors tend to try to collect as much evidence as possible -- forgetting to think about the bigger picture.

3. Promise a law to make sure it never happens again. Then Holder starting calling senators to propse a media shield law, saying, according to an unnamed Holder adviser, ""Look we get it. We understand why this is so controversial, and we’re ready to make changes to find the right balance.""

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/06/06/Mainstream-Media-Did-Not-break-Even-One-of-Four-Obama-Scandals,2013-06-06 00:00:00,['John Nolte'],Mainstream Media Did Not Break Even One of Four Obama Scandals,"Well, if it is Thursday, there must be a new Obama scandal. But one thing is for damn sure: whatever that scandal is, you can bet the American mainstream media will be playing catch up and not having the glory of breaking a story about a major White House scandal.

Fact: Over the past few weeks, four major scandals have broken over the Obama administration, and it is a very sad (and frightening) truth that our pathetic, American, lapdog mainstream media are not responsible for breaking even a single one.

Verizon? Nope, not our guys. That was the Brits over at The Guardian.

IRS? Nope, not our guys. The IRS broke their own scandal with a planted question.

The Justice Department’s seizure of Associated Press phone records? Nope, not our guys. Believe it or not, the Associated Press didn’t even break that story. Like the IRS, we only found out because the Justice Department outted itself in a letter notifying the AP of what it had done.

Benghazi? Are you kidding. With a couple of rare exceptions (Jake Tapper, Sharyl Attkisson) the media have spent the last eight months attacking those seeking the truth (Congress, Fox News)–not seeking the truth. It was the GOP congress that demanded the email exchanges concerning the shaping of the talking points, not the media.

Left up to the media, we wouldn’t know anything about Libya. All of the media’s energy was collectively poured into ensuring the truth was never discovered.

And do you want to know what makes this realization especially pathetic? In three of the four scandals (the AP being the exception), had our media been less interested in protecting Power and more interested in holding Power accountable, these huge, career-making stories were right there for the taking.

For over a year now, conservative Tea Party groups have been complaining about IRS harassment. But because Obama told them to, the media hate the Tea Party. So in the face of these complaints and even a few Congressional inquiries, the media either ignored the harassment reports or openly sided with the IRS. (No joke. Click the link.)

Obviously, you can say the same about Libya. All the dots were there to connect: Security failures, two weeks of lies, the midnight arrest of some hapless filmmaker… But rather than connect the dots, the media played goalie for Obama against Fox News and Darrell Issa. Besides, there was a re-election to win and Todd Akin got something wrong about The Womanparts.

Moreover, there are still plenty of dots to connect about Libya. But the new SQUIRREL is OVERREACH, and already the lapdogs are back in goalie formation.

As for the Verizon story, members of Congress, specifically Democrat Senators Ron Wyden (OR) and Mark Udall (CO), have been hint-hint-wink-winking to the media that something is horribly amiss going back to December:

In a Senate floor speech in December, Wyden hinted at classified information he had received but could not share due to Senate rules that indicated the law “on Americans’ privacy has been real, and it is not hypothetical.”

“When the public finds out that these secret interpretations are so dramatically different than what the public law says, I think there’s going to be extraordinary anger in the country,” he told The Huffington Post the following month.

That is from today’s Politico report on the Verizon scandal. Apparently, Politico knew of this back in December but had all their investigative researchers digging into why those short-skirted Tea Partiers had it coming, so they missed another one of the biggest stories of the year.

Politico shouldn’t feel bad, though, because when it comes to missing the four biggest scoops of the Obama administration, they have plenty of lazy, lapdog, sycophant company in that department.

Our media are not only biased; it is an utter and complete failure and embarrassment. And although there are plenty of remaining table scraps to make meals out of, the media are already losing interest in the IRS, Libya, and AP scandals, but for only one reason–they are absolutely terrified of where they might lead.

During the Bush years, it was the New York Times, Washington Post and Sy Hersh breaking story after story after story about the White House. And yes, some of that reporting was–ahem –overreach, but at least Power knew it was being watched; our democracy was safe because an overzealous media is what you call a luxury problem.

Today, it is the complete opposite, and the result is an administration run amok.

Get down on your knees and thank your Maker for conservative New Media, Roger Ailes, and for the few true liberals left in the media, like Glenn Greenwald–who works for the Brits.

“The president’s absolutely not telling the truth when he said the Secret Service made that decision to cut [the White House] tours,” Bongino said. “That’s the core of it: he is not telling the truth.”

In an interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos, Obama said the decision, made as a part of sequestration, was not one “that went up to the White House.”

“But what the Secret Service explained to us was that they’re going to have to furlough some folks,” Obama said in the interview. What furloughs mean is–is that people lose a day of work and a day of pay. And, you know, the question for them is, you know, how deeply do they have to furlough their staff and is it worth it to make sure that we’ve got White House tours that means that you got a whole bunch of families who are depending on a paycheck who suddenly are seeing a 5% or 10%–reduction in their pay. Well, what I’m asking them is are there ways, for example, for us to accommodate school groups–you know, who may have traveled here with some bake sales. Can we make sure that- kids, potentially, can–can still come to tour?”

Bongino, who served 12 years in the Secret Service including five years working directly at the White House before leaving to run as a Republican for U.S. Senate in Maryland, said Obama is lying because the Secret Service does not make such decisions.

“The Secret Service does not make political decisions,” Bongino said. “The Secret Service makes security decisions. His statement that it was a Secret Service decision internal budget decision–and keep in mind, I’m not speaking for the Secret Service, I’m speaking from experience of being with them. All he’d have to do is cancel one or two of his political trips and his Martha’s Vineyard vacation, which two years ago I was on and helped coordinate, he would save that money times ten. There was just no way this was a sound decision. To insinuate this is the first administration where the White House social office and the Executive Office of the President had no role in cancelling public tours at the White House, that he was the first president who was left out of the decision, is absolute nonsense.”

Bongino said he thinks the president is using “the Washington Monument strategy”–a ploy by a politician who tries to garner public opposition to spending cuts by eliminating popular public services first–in doing this to White House tours. “He wanted to inflict, there is no question in my mind, maximum pain upon the American people. But here’s the caveat: it had to be public pain. If you don’t see it, it doesn’t hurt.”

But Bongino said all the public pressure Obama has taken for the decision to cancel the tours caused the ploy to “backfire.” Regardless, the ex Secret Service agent who served three years at the George W. Bush White House and two years at Obama’s White House said Obama still will not admit he was wrong and is now trying to blame the Secret Service for his own behavior.

“Instead of coming clean and being honest with the American people that your office and likely you as well had a role in this, he’s again pulling the wool over your eyes just like he’s done on Benghazi, the immigration release [of thousands of illegal immigrants] where he said he didn’t know and Janet Napolitano said she didn’t know, this is nonsense,” Bongino said. “These are not security or budget decisions. These are strictly political decisions. Make no mistake about it.”

Bongino said the Secret Service is not correcting Obama because the agency has “a great, elite group of guys and they’re always going to take it on the chin.”

“I don’t speak for them but they’re obviously a patriotic group of men and women and they’re not lying when they say there will be overtime costs saved so it’s not like they’re being disingenuous,” Bongino said. “They’re trying to cover for this guy, I think, because they know it looks bad and they don’t want to get involved in the politics and I don’t blame them.”"

The response made clear that she maintains huge political capital with the conservative base.

She also hit Obama for his and the first lady's many appearances on television.

""Remember no-drama Obama? If only. Now it’s all-drama Obama,"" Palin said. ""We don’t have leadership coming out of Washington. We have reality television. Except it’s really bad TV, and America tuned out a long time ago.”

Turning to guns, Palin criticized the background-checks bill that passed through a Senate committee this week and Obama's push for more gun control.

“More background checks?"" Palin said. ""Dandy idea, Mr. President. Shoulda started with yours.”

Palin reserved some of her jabs for other politicians, though, focusing specifically on New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's (I) ban on sugary beverages over 16 ounces -- she paused to take a sip of a Big Gulp midway through her speech, mugging while the crowd applauded -- and Karl Rove's effort to find more electable Republican candidates.

Without naming Rove, Palin said that the architects of the GOP's nascent electability effort should ""come back to the Lone Star State and put their name on the ballot."" (Rove is from Texas and got his start in that state's politics.)

Obama was the biggest target of Palin's speech, though, and she got her biggest applause lines when she took on the incumbent president, often addressing him directly.

“You won. We get it. Now step away from the teleprompter and do your job,"" she said."

During a tense hearing on Capitol Hill held shortly before lawmakers headed out for summer recess, acting IRS chief Danny Werfel weathered tough questioning from Republicans including Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

Issa claimed the IRS has been slow to produce documents, and that the documents it does produce are so thoroughly blacked out, they are useless to investigators.

""When you eliminate search terms unilaterally you are obstructing us by limiting the scope of discovery. Do you understand that, Mr. Werfel?"" Issa said, complaining that the IRS had narrowed the date range for the requested documents.

Though Werfel repeatedly denied that his agency was being uncooperative, Issa subsequently issued a statement saying he had issued a subpoena to Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew.

More On This...

A Treasury spokesman said the department has received the subpoena and is ""committed"" to cooperating with the committee's review.

The committee is trying to force the department to hand over a series of documents pertaining to the program in which IRS agents subjected Tea Party and other conservative groups to additional scrutiny as they applied for tax-exempt status. Issa is asking for ""all communications"" to and from embattled IRS agent Lois Lerner, the first IRS official to publicly acknowledge the program, as well as other high-level personnel including White House appointee William Wilkins.

""While the Committee is willing to work with the IRS to guide the agency in responding to oversight requests, it is patently unacceptable for the IRS to unilaterally revise the scope or search terms used to identify responsive material,"" Issa wrote.

Issa and other Republicans have been evidently agitated by White House attempts to label the IRS controversy as a ""phony scandal."" Issa referenced this rhetoric in his letter to Lew, accusing the administration of trying to ""thwart"" congressional oversight.

Tensions boiled over in the hearing room.

""You are slow-rolling us,"" Issa told Werfel in a heated exchange. ""There are important facts to get out, and you are obstructing.""

""That is not true,"" Werfel fired back.

Werfel said that by the end of the day Friday, the IRS will have given more than 16,000 pages of documents to Issa's committee and more than 70,000 pages to Congress as a whole. Werfel said documents are blacked out to protect confidential taxpayer information.

Issa's committee does not have legal authority to receive confidential taxpayer information. In Congress, that authority is reserved for the chairmen of the two tax-writing committees, House Ways and Means and Senate Finance, and their designated staff.

Werfel said the two tax-writing committees are receiving full documents. However, Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., who chairs the Ways and Means Committee, has also complained that the IRS is producing documents too slowly.

Werfel rejected the accusation that he's limited the scope of the document search.

""We are prioritizing searches in order to get you more documents more quickly and that's having an impact,"" he said.

He said: ""The notion that we're impeding or obstructing is completely false. In fact the opposite is true.

More than 100 IRS employees are working to produce documents for Congress, including 70 lawyers who are reviewing documents full time, Werfel said.

In addition, 19 employees have been made available for interviews by congressional investigators, and IRS officials have appeared at 15 congressional hearings since the scandal broke, Werfel said. He also said the agency has offered to make Wilkins available for meetings with committee members.

The personal responsibility finger-wagging, delivered most recently Sunday at Morehouse College’s commencement, is getting old.

During the speech, Obama admonished black men to take care of their families and their communities and told the graduates that despite the lingering legacies of slavery and discrimination, “we’ve got no time for excuses.” Obama also used the occasion to talk about his own life, touching on the fact that he was raised by a single mother and that growing up he sometimes blamed some of his bad choices on “the world trying to keep a black man down.”

The half-hour speech in Atlanta drew a rousing response from those who had sat in pouring rain waiting for the president to speak.

Coleman, a former speechwriter for former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm, said that although parts of the talk were strong and lofty, including passages honoring Morehouse graduate Martin Luther King Jr., he was disappointed that Obama almost always defaults to the clean-up-your-act message when talking to predominantly black audiences. First lady Michelle Obama issued a similar tongue-lashing last week at Bowie State University’s commencement ceremony. She told graduates at the historically black Maryland school that too many young people are “fantasizing about being a baller or a rapper.”

“The first couple of times, it was okay, but I and a lot of other people are beginning to grow weary of it,” said Coleman, adding that the message was particularly galling at Sunday’s event at the historically black Georgia school. “What made it so gratuitous was this was Morehouse College! In the African American community, the very definition of a Morehouse man is someone who is a leader, who is taught to go out and make a difference in his community.” (The White House declined comment.)

Obama has been making this point — and stirring controversy — since he was a candidate in 2008. Jesse Jackson Sr. was incensed by what he saw as Obama’s “talking down to black people,” yet it was Jackson who was criticized. Many in the black community believed that Obama’s chastisements were necessary to make himself politically palatable to white voters.

The president’s most recent such remarks — there were only a few Sunday, but they were widely reported — triggered a debate on blogs and social media that, in part, asked why Obama continued his lecturing.

Leola Johnson, an associate professor and chair of the Media and Cultural Studies Department at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn., said the Obamas’ speeches “are actually not aimed at black people.”

“They’re actually for white people, liberals especially,” she said. Liberal bloggers were brimming with praise for Obama after the Morehouse speech. “It’s the legacy of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and that whole group of white liberals who want to say it’s not just about structural problems that black people aren’t doing well, it’s about their own values.”

Kevin Powell, an activist based in New York who travels the country encouraging black men to take responsibility for their lives, said he has no problem with Obama challenging the black community, but . . .

“You also have to challenge the system, just as you challenge the people. It’s not an either/or,” said Powell, president and founder of BK Nation, an organization focused on education and civic engagement.

The Morehouse speech offered an instance of Obama discussing race, a topic he has been criticized for avoiding given his unique vantage point as the country’s first African American president. Some African Americans have been disappointed at Obama’s frequent refrain that he is president of all Americans when asked why he hasn’t specifically addressed problems that afflict many black communities, including chronic unemployment and failing schools.

On this front, A. Scott Bolden, a Washington lawyer and Morehouse graduate, and Coleman, the former speechwriter and Detroit-based writer, offered finger-wagging lectures of their own.

“It’s interesting that President Obama is always asking black people to take responsibility for themselves,” Bolden said. “It would be really nice if he’d take responsibility for black people in his second term.”

Coleman says he’ll find the president’s next commencement speech, scheduled for Friday at the U.S. Naval Academy, particularly instructive. “That will be interesting given the reports of sex harassment in the military,” Coleman said. “Is he going to chide those cadets about addressing the social pathologies in that population?”"

He Previously Wrote About The Russia Investigation.']",Calderon says investigation is payback,"SACRAMENTO — State Sen. Ronald S. Calderon, who is being investigated by the FBI on suspicion that he accepted bribes, accused federal authorities Wednesday of trying to smear him for refusing to wear a wire in a sting operation against two other senators.

In a motion filed in federal court in Sacramento, Calderon (D-Montebello) says authorities from the FBI and the U.S attorney’s office repeatedly asked him to participate in an investigation of Senate leader Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento) and Sen. Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles).

He was asked to wear a wire to secretly record conversations with them, the filing says.

Calderon declined and “refused to continue participating in the FBI’s sting operation,” the motion says. It is not clear what, if any, assistance Calderon had provided.

Federal agents raided the senator’s office in June. Last month, a 124-page, sealed FBI affidavit detailing bribery allegations against Calderon was posted on a media website. Calderon’s court filing accuses the authorities of leaking the document.

Calderon has not been charged with any crime and has denied the allegations, which include accepting $60,000 from an undercover FBI agent posing as a film studio executive and $28,000 from a Long Beach hospital executive in exchange for efforts to influence legislation.

Leaking the affidavit broke the law, Calderon’s motion asserts, and federal authorities should be held in contempt of court. The document was illegally released to the media “in an effort to defame and retaliate against Senator Calderon for not cooperating in its ‘sting’ operation,” the filing says.

Mark Geragos, Calderon’s attorney, said federal authorities have been “targeting the entire state Senate. When they realized they didn’t have anything, that’s why they engaged in payback.”

Included in the court filing is a copy of a receipt that Geragos said was signed by a federal official the week after the office raid, when Calderon returned wire equipment that investigators had given him.

Lauren Horwood, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Sacramento, declined to comment Wednesday. The Department of Justice is reviewing the source of the leak, according to a previous statement from Laura Eimiller, a spokeswoman for the FBI in Los Angeles.

Eimiller declined to comment Wednesday.

Calderon’s court filing is the latest development in a corruption investigation that has rocked the Capitol, and its assertions were quickly disputed by Steinberg, the Senate leader, who issued a statement calling it “pure fantasy.”

His spokesman, Mark Hedlund, said the Senate leader has been informed by federal authorities that he is not a target of the investigation.

Dan Reeves, chief of staff for De Leon, declined to comment Wednesday. De Leon recently released a letter from a federal prosecutor in Los Angeles saying “he is a witness, as opposed to a subject or a target” in the investigation involving Calderon.

Calderon’s motion came a day after Steinberg and other senators stripped him of his committee posts. He lost six assignments, including his position as chairman of the Senate Insurance Committee.

Steinberg said the allegations against Calderon “are serious enough to potentially cloud any interaction the senator might have with colleagues, advocates and the public on issues within a committee’s jurisdiction.”

In addition, Calderon is being pressured to resign by Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia (D-Bell Gardens) and local leaders in his district. At a news conference Wednesday, they said the investigation of Calderon has hurt their efforts to regain voters’ trust after a series of corruption scandals in the area.

“The public must be able to trust their elected officials,” Garcia said. “Everyday I’m hearing from them: ‘We don’t trust you.’ This is sucking the air out of everything we do.”

Gil Hurtado, mayor of South Gate, complained that the investigation particularly hurts Latino officials.

“We are getting judged based on this,” he said.

In a statement Wednesday, Calderon suggested that the call for his resignation was politically motivated. He took aim at Garcia, who organized the news conference and who some believe may be interested in running for Calderon’s Senate seat.

“Without knowing the full story and waiting to hear all the facts in this case, she has assumed the role of judge and jury by calling for my resignation,” Calderon said. “What has happened to me could happen to anyone in public office.”

Hagel had been asked to disclose details about foreign funding he had received, either through paid speeches or through entities with which he was involved. In a short statement yesterday, Hagel said he couldn’t comply with the request.

This information is critical to determining Hagel’s fitness to head the Defense Department. As Secretary, he assumes a lead role in defining, and protecting, America’s national security interests. The Senate is absolutely right to demand details about compensation he received from foreign entities. The disclosure will help allay concerns about possible conflicts of interest.

The stonewalling on the disclosure is just the latest stumble in Hagel’s path to confirmation. His performance at his confirmation hearing on January 31st was widely panned. Even Democrat supporters reported they were “shocked at how ill-prepared” Hagel was in the hearing. He didn’t seem ready to answer questions that were widely expected to be asked. On other questions he fumbled, having to later clarify his answers.

The worst part, though, was probably when Hagel admitted “I don’t know enough about [military programs and technology]. There are a lot of things I don’t know about. I, if confirmed, intend to know a lot more than I do.”

Heading the Defense Department is not made for on-the-job training. It is the largest, most complex organization in the world. It is also vital to America’s safety. Hagel has not been nominated for Commerce or Labor, where the nation could easily withstand a failed Secretary. He will be managing America’ military, through a period of budget cuts and reassessment of strategic threats.

Only a seasoned executive, with intimate knowledge of America’s military, could navigate the department and our country safely through those waters. Regardless of party, each Senator must carefully ask themselves whether they can support a nominee who seemed so ill-prepared and visibly incompetent in his hearing. If they do, then they are at least partly responsible for any calamities that may ensue.

Jones' good fortune comes courtesy of legislation he sponsored in 1989. Under that law, members of the General Assembly who worked long enough to hit their limit on pension benefits — a generous 85 percent of their final salary after just 20 years — would get an extra reward.

For every additional year they stayed on, 3 percent of their initial pension would be added to their retirement checks. For Jones, working an extra 16 years netted him a $41,000 pension boost in 2009; he drew $126,004 last year.

The 3 percent deal, available to no one in state government outside of the General Assembly Retirement System, or GARS, is another in a long line of pension provisions written by lawmakers for lawmakers, a Tribune investigation found. It also stands as a glaring example of how the legislature repeatedly passed benefit increases with little or no concern for the costs.

Jones was a direct sponsor of many of these questionable deals. In addition to helping long-serving state lawmakers, the former senator sponsored legislation that allowed Chicago aldermen to receive the most lucrative pensions in city government and gave labor leaders public pensions based on their private salaries.

Jones justified giving the 3 percent perk to himself and his colleagues by noting that they were still contributing money to their pensions after they had served long enough to receive the maximum benefit.

""(F)or those members of the General Assembly right now who ... have maxed out ... they are still contributing to that retirement system,"" Jones told his colleagues the day the bill passed. ""So all this does is give them a little 3 percent on their own money.""

Jones' quote implied that lawmakers' pensions were already fully funded. But that is not correct. Jones would have had to double his pension contributions to cover the high benefit he is receiving, records show, even after generous contributions from the state, healthy investment returns and the extra 16 years of payments he put in.

Even more important to the pension system's bottom line was another provision in the same 1989 legislation, one that dramatically increased the annual cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, for all retirees in the state and Chicago.

It was a subtle change: The COLA formula was switched from simple to compounding interest. At the time, it was expected to cost the state $3.2 billion over the next 40 years. But because consecutive governors and legislatures failed to make payments adequate to cover the increase, the price tag has grown much higher and now accounts for a large portion of the state's $83 billion in unfunded liabilities.

With Illinois' pension system racing toward insolvency, the General Assembly is working feverishly to find a way to shore up the foundering funds before the legislative session ends Thursday. But with elections looming over all General Assembly members, many are skittish about making sweeping changes before the campaign season.

Aside from the political price they stand to pay, legislators have more to lose than nearly any other group caught up in Illinois' pension mess. That's because, along with judges, their benefits are the most lucrative in state government, despite the fact that their positions are part time and many members hold jobs outside of the legislature.

More than a third of all retirees in the legislative pension fund make more money now than they did when they served in government. Ten percent of them receive more than $100,000 in pension payouts every year, benefits that come on top of the free or deeply discounted health insurance that retired lawmakers have long received.

The result is that at a time when the state has $8 billion in unpaid bills and is cutting funding for public schools, health care and other services, Illinois is sending out ever larger retirement checks to former lawmakers. Their pension fund is also the state's worst-funded plan, with just 21 percent of the assets needed to cover what the legislature has promised itself over the years.

House Speaker Michael Madigan and Senate President John Cullerton played roles in many of the pension perks now on the books but are quick to point out that most of the loopholes that allowed lawmakers to spike their pensions have been closed. The 3 percent perk ended in 2003.

But anyone who was in office before those changes took effect can still benefit. And as lawmakers consider reforms, many of them say it would be unconstitutional to eliminate even the most outrageous pension perks once they've been bestowed.

Take Madigan's case. If he retired this year after roughly 40 years in office, the 1989 law would boost his annual pension from about $81,000 to $131,000 according to current figures from GARS. That's 137 percent of his current salary. Cullerton's pension would go up by roughly $31,000 to $112,000 a year, or 117 percent of what he now earns. Both lawmakers helped advance, and eventually voted for, the legislation that created the perk for longtime lawmakers.

Jones, meanwhile, will be allowed to continue collecting his inflated pension, along with an annual 3 percent compounding COLA, for as long as he lives.

Reached by phone, Jones blamed the current pension crisis on Republican governors who failed to make adequate contributions to the pension funds.

""That's where the problem started, and that's why you have the pension system the way it is,"" Jones said. ""If you take away the COLA and take away the 3 percent (for lawmakers), that's not going to solve the problems.""

Madigan declined to be interviewed for this story. In a statement, Cullerton said: ""I've made it clear that meaningful and constitutional pension reform is needed to restore financial stability to the state. It is my hope that in the days ahead we will be able to address issues like the compounding COLA. And let me be clear in saying that all along I've believed that lawmakers have to sacrifice too in the changes to the pension system.""

The findings are part of a 19-month investigation by the nonprofit group on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s “Communities Putting Prevention to Work Program.”

Beyond potentially breaking federal law, the communities also appear to have violated CDC guidelines, according to the 36-page report titled “How the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s … Grant Program Became a Front for Lobbying, Government Propaganda and Cronyism.”

Congressional hearings in 2011 and follow-up letters to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius addressed a potential violation in a South Carolina community.

However, the April 16 report found seven other potential violations and states the CDC’s one recorded violation “was worse than disclosed.”

The CDC could not respond Sunday to a request for comment.

The group identifies five of the states in which the violations allegedly occurred -- Arizona, Alabama, Florida, Georgia and California.

The findings are based on such information as internal emails, meeting notes and CDC grant applications that “blatantly show systemic corruption and use of taxpayer dollars for lobbying,” according to the report.

In one example, California’s Santa Clara County Public Health Department allegedly used taxpayer money to hire a tobacco-retail-license coordinator to lobby for a workplace smoking ordinance and also used program funds to support a state-wide tobacco tax increase.

In the South Carolina case, the CDC found the state violated rules by using program money to plan a press conference to lobby a city council to support a pending, clean-indoor-air ordinance with no exemptions.

The group is asking for further investigation of the program and says the request is timely, considering the scheduled release of $2 billion annually, starting in 2015, for a similar program under President Obama’s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act."

The poll shows an 8-point swing against Obama since April. Another shocking finding, undoubtedly linked to recent scandals, is that 68% of voters think the federal government is “out of control.”

Last month, 47% of voters approved of the job Obama was doing, while 45% disapproved. Disapproval of Obama has jumped 6 points since the latest scandal revelations. Among Independents, only 40% approve of Obama, while 52% disapprove. At this time 4 years ago, 60% of voters approved of Obama and only 30% disapproved.

The scandals are also taking a toll on voters expectations for Obama’s second term. A plurality 49% believe his is a lame-duck, while 47% think he still has the ability to accomplish things in his final years in office. For the first time ever, also, less than a majority see Obama has “honest and trustworthy.”

The poll also contained troubling news for embattled Attorney General Eric Holder. Just 28% of voters approve of Holder’s job performance, while 40% disapprove. It is surprising that almost 70% of voters even have an opinion of an Attorney General’s job performance.

The particular nature of the current scandals, featuring cover-ups and abuses of power, are having a dramatic effect on how voters see the federal government. 68% believe the government is “out of control” and acting in a way that threatens civil liberties. Only 26% of voters report they don’t feel this way. Even a plurality of Democrats, 47-45, say the government is “out of control.”

These are no ordinary scandals and their consequences for Obama and the Democrats are only beginning to be felt.

Suddenly, outraged commentators and bloggers who feared the loss of a key measure of citizenship were referring to “jury service” instead of “jury duty.” Although the news was generally reported accurately, some went overboard; at foxnews.com, for example, the headline said: “California bill would let illegal immigrants serve on juries.”

No it wouldn’t. This isn’t a story about yet one more unsavory job that must be done by undocumented immigrants because U.S. citizens won’t do it. AB 1401 by Democrat Bob Wieckowski of Fremont would not extend any new powers or duties to anyone without the legal right to be present in the country. It would, however, allow courts to call lawful permanent residents who are not citizens to serve on juries. After all, you don’t have to be a citizen to be a lawyer or a judge in Superior Court; why, lawmakers asked, should you have to be a citizen to serve on a jury?

It’s an important question — and there is an answer.

Jury service is not burdensome drudge work imposed by an overbearing government on an unwilling citizenry. Nor is it a favor that citizens do for their courts. To the contrary, it is a citizen’s chief means of oversight on the judicial branch, allowing him or her not merely to help rule on the facts of a particular case but to keep tabs on the judge, the prosecutors, the public defenders and the court system itself. It’s the place where citizens observe firsthand the effect of court budget cuts.

Just as citizens, and only citizens, have the power to elect their executive branch leaders and their delegates to the legislative branch, citizen jurors have the final check on at least some judicial branch decisions. Yes, we can vote judges out of office, but especially with a court system the size of the Los Angeles County Superior Court, it is difficult at best to know who they are and how they work. Jury duty, or rather jury service — or even better, jury power — is a reminder that the government works for us, and not the other way around.

That check on government is a right and a duty properly exercised by the sovereign, and in a democracy that means the citizens. Plenty of noncitizens make up our society, but citizenship is the norm, as it should be. And if we find that an overwhelming number of residents, workers and taxpayers are not citizens, it should not be seen as a signal to redistribute the powers of citizenship, but rather to step up the speed at which those who want to be fully incorporated into society are naturalized. AB 1401 is an interesting idea, but in the end it would move California in the wrong direction."

Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling in the Enron scandal; she worked with her friend Lisa Monaco, now Mr. Obama’s chief counterterrorism adviser, on a related Enron case. Near the desk in Ms. Ruemmler’s dark-paneled office is a plaque of a Houston Chronicle front page with the headline “Guilty! Guilty!” above the men’s photos — a gift from an F.B.I. agent on the case.

After that, Ms. Ruemmler returned to private practice in Washington, but in 2009 she took one of the most powerful jobs at the Justice Department — the “Padag,” for principal associate deputy attorney general, who essentially runs the place. She impressed the White House counsel, Robert F. Bauer. In 2010 he made her his deputy, and the next year, seeking to leave over Mr. Obama’s objections, Mr. Bauer pressed for Ms. Ruemmler to get the job.

The president did not know her well and, associates say, Ms. Ruemmler had strained relations with two Obama confidants — the attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., and the president’s senior adviser, Valerie Jarrett. Even so, Alyssa Mastromonaco, a deputy chief of staff, said Mr. Obama considered “only Kathy.” He promoted her in June 2011, saying, “Kathy is an outstanding lawyer with impeccable judgment.”

Ms. Ruemmler, who declined to speak for the record for this article, gets credit from colleagues for legal strategies that are crucial to sustaining Obama policies besides the health care law. They include a compromise with religious groups on the law’s mandate for insurance coverage of contraceptives and an agreement deferring deportations of illegal immigrants who were brought to the country as children.

She is responsible for judicial nominations — including selecting, vetting and selling them to Senate Republicans — and has helped Mr. Obama diversify the federal bench, naming higher percentages of women and minorities than his Republican and Democratic predecessors. With a 25-member staff, she also monitors Congressional investigations, negotiates with Republicans who demand administration documents, advises the White House on ethics and serves as Mr. Obama’s liaison to the Justice Department and the F.B.I.

It was that last role that kept her preoccupied the week of April 15 as she coordinated Mr. Obama’s response to the Boston Marathon bombings and accompanied him to the city. “She came with us because there was information coming in, and he wanted one filter,” Ms. Mastromonaco said. “He wanted Kathy.”"

(CNN) —

In a place accustomed to tough stretches, this has been a particularly tough few days at the White House.

After emerging from the showdown over the Republican-led government shutdown relatively unscathed, the Obama administration finds itself under assault on three fronts: problems surrounding Obamacare, the revelations of the U.S. spying on allies, and the 2012 attack on the U.S diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, the latter for which a senator has threatened to hold up all of the Obama administration’s nominations.

The controversies are sure to fuel continued Republican attacks on President Barack Obama and his Democratic allies as the nation gears up for midterm elections next year, and the White House has portrayed the attacks as so much partisan chatter.

But to CNN senior political analyst David Gergen, they reflect the relative inexperience of the Obama White House.

“This is an administration that has been very, very good at its politics, but has never been very good at execution of policies from Day One,” he said Monday.

“It’s an administration which has some really smart people in it, and a lot of younger people. It doesn’t have very many heavyweights.”

The worst part for Obama may be figuring out what to do about it all – not just the various individual fires, but more generally how to “take control of his own government,” CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger said.

If you’re the President, how do you make sure that subordinates aren’t withholding information you should know? How do you strike the right balance, and explain it clearly, on things such as gathering intelligence versus maximizing privacy and protecting key relationships? And how do you make sure those tied to your administration avoid big missteps that could come back to bite you?

“Four out of five Americans have little or no trust in their government to do anything right,” Borger writes in an analysis. “And now Obama probably feels the same way.”

Does Obama still have faith in government?

Here are the latest details on the issues causing the administration the most heartache today:

Obamacare

Another week, another congressional hearing on the problem-plagued rollout of Obama’s health insurance program.

This time, Marilyn Tavenner, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services – which is in charge of the Obamacare website – became the first administration official to formally apologize to Americans for the troublesome start.

She offered the apology Tuesday in an appearance before the House Ways and Means Committee.

“We know that consumers are eager to purchase this coverage, and to the millions of Americans who have attempted to use Healthcare.gov to shop and enroll in health care coverage, I want to apologize to you that the website has not worked as well as it should,” she told lawmakers.

Obamacare website administrator apologizes

The website, which would-be applicants have found difficult to use, at best, embarrassingly crashed over the weekend, leaving consumers completely locked out.

Then, the White House found itself on the defensive over revelations that, despite claims to the contrary by the Obama administration, some who have purchased insurance on the open market will lose their coverage and have to buy new policies.

An insurance industry source told CNN Monday that the vast majority of Americans who have purchased coverage on the individual market will find their policies changed or even canceled under Obamacare rules.

It’s been known for some time that some of the policies would have to change – the Department of Health and Human Services said in 2010 as part of a federal regulation that up to two thirds of individual policies wouldn’t meet regulations allowing them to continue under what’s called “grandfathered” status.

That refers to plans allowed to continue even though they don’t provide all the rights and protections of those offered under Obamacare.

White House spokesman Jay Carney argued Monday the administration has always said some health care plans would not meet new Obamacare requirements.

“There are existing health care plans on the individual market that don’t meet those minimum standards and therefore do not qualify for the Affordable Care Act,” he said. “There are some that can be grandfathered if people want to keep insurance that’s substandard.”

And those who lose coverage will be able to buy more comprehensive coverage on the health insurance exchanges – some of them at a subsidized price, he said.

But the reality that so many plans will disappear or have to change seems to fly in the face of what Obama said so often in selling the plan to voters.

“If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan,” the president said in 2009, and frequently since.

It also offered Republicans ammunition to renew their attacks on the plan.

“The larger problem is how Obamacare is hurting people out there,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday. “It is about college graduates and middle-class families getting hit with massive premium increases they can’t afford.”

NSA spying

After months of seemingly endless leaks about U.S. surveillance programs, the pressure on the administration rose to new levels in recent days with revelations published by the German news magazine Der Spiegel that the United States was collecting the communications of allied leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Obamacare and NSA spying: What did Obama know, and when did he find out?

German leaders respond angrily to the news, with Merkel demanding a stop to the practice and proclaiming that her country’s confidence in the United States had been “shaken.”

But it was comments by the administration claiming that Obama did not know of the practice until recently that drew the sharpest criticism – from both the right and the left.

Rep. Peter King, the Republican chairman of the House Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, was incredulous that the president didn’t know what was going on.

“He certainly should have known, if he didn’t,” the former chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on “The Situation Room.” “I think that’s almost more of a serious issue that something like that at that level would be conducted without him knowing it.”

Rep. King on NSA spying: If Obama didn’t know, he should have

And Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said not knowing about the program was a “big problem” for both Obama and the Senate Intelligence Committee, which she chairs.

“As far as I’m concerned, Congress needs to know exactly what our intelligence community is doing,” her statement said. “To that end, the committee will initiate a major review into all intelligence collection programs.”

Benghazi

Longstanding Republican criticism of the administration’s handling of the attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, which left the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans dead, resurfaced this week with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, threatening to hold up administration nominations over the issue.

Senators are expected soon to review Obama’s nominations for several high-profile judicial appointments and other nominations.

Senate rules allow a single senator to at least temporarily hold up presidential nominations, and Graham says he will do so until the administration makes survivors of the attack available for congressional testimony.

“I’m going to block every appointment in the United States Senate until the survivors are being made available to Congress,” he said. “I’m tired of hearing from people on TV and reading about stuff in books. We need to get to the bottom of this.”

The White House said Monday that Graham and other Republicans are using Benghazi for political purposes, “and we find that unfortunate.”

(CNN) —

Two Secret Service supervisors on President Barack Obama’s protective detail are under investigation for alleged misconduct, a federal law enforcement source with knowledge of the internal Secret Service investigation told CNN’s John King.

The details were first reported in the Washington Post Wednesday night.

The investigation began after an incident at the posh Hay-Adams Hotel near the White House in May. As first reported by the Post, one Secret Service agent allegedly removed ammunition from his service weapon and left a bullet in the room of a female guest, whom he had met in the hotel bar.

The agent tried to regain entry to the room when he realized the bullet was left behind, the Post said. Hotel staff notified the White House after he identified himself as a Secret Service agent and demanded to be let in to the room.

No police report was filed and no complaint was filed with the Secret Service by any of the parties involved, a government source told CNN’s Joe Johns Thursday.

“The Secret Service takes allegations of improper behavior seriously and works diligently to investigate and resolve issues. Any misconduct is regrettable, but when it is identified, appropriate action is always taken based on established rules and regulations,” Edwin M. Donovan, deputy assistant director of the Secret Service, said in a statement.

Investigation revisits Secret Service prostitution scandal

The internal investigation was launched as a result of inquiries by the Post, the government source said.

That probe led to a routine search of the agent’s agency-issued BlackBerry, the Post reported.

The federal law enforcement source confirmed that the agent, a supervisor, and a second supervisor were discovered to have sent sexually suggestive e-mails to a female Secret Service employee. Nothing explicitly suggestive has been found, the government source said.

The first supervisor was removed from his position, the source said, but the second supervisor remains on the presidential security detail. The Post reported that the second supervisor was removed from the security detail.

While the paper named the two supervisors involved, CNN is not yet identifying them.

The investigation follows the Secret Service scandal in April 2012 involving prostitution and drinking before a presidential trip to Cartagena, Colombia. A review prompted new rules of conduct for Secret Service employees in the wake of the incident.

Sen. Ron Johnson said at a Senate hearing Thursday that despite assurances from Department of Homeland Security and Secret Service that the 2012 Cartagena prostitution scandal involving presidential detail agents was an anomaly, congress has found similar instances in 17 countries.

“Yesterday we learned that two senior level United States Secret Service agents assigned to the President’s detail were recently disciplined for sexual misconduct. According to whistle-blowers, one of these men helped lead the USSS internal investigation of the sexual misconduct in Cartagena in April of last year. This is like the fox guarding the hen house,” the Wisconsin Republican said. “This type of behavior jeopardizes the security of the President of the United States and makes U.S. government personnel susceptible to coercion and blackmail.”

While not addressing the specifics of the most recent case, William Hillsburg, acting director of the Public Affairs Department of the Homeland Security office of the inspector general, said that in the next couple of weeks his office is expected to release an inspection report with an in-depth look at the culture of the U.S. Secret Service.

The report will look at whether there’s something in the Secret Service culture that led to the behavior in Cartagena. It will also include recommendations on how agents are trained.

That distinction goes, with some reluctance on my part, to Hillary Rodham Clinton. As has sometimes happened in her life, events got away from her.

A good politician, as Napoleon once said about military men, has to have luck — and this has not been a lucky year for Clinton. If she’s the next Democratic presidential candidate, she will have to follow a Democratic president whose approval ratings — once as high as 76 percent — are now scraping 40. As a former member of Barack Obama’s Cabinet, she has to defend the indefensible, kiss the ugly baby of Obamacare and smile for the cameras. She can do it — no one soldiers on better — but ugly is ugly, and the rollout of Obamacare has been just that.

Maybe time will prove Obamacare a success, which I suspect will be the case. But until that distant day, it will remain emblematic of governmental overreach and (supposedly arrogant) liberalism run amok. The catastrophic rollout has been followed by even more bad news — higher-than-expected premiums, lower-than-expected coverage or, worse, no coverage at all.

Things will get better, especially if more young people sign up, but the program has left an indelible impression of ineptitude and dishonesty. In short, it has become a vindication of everything conservatives say of liberal programs. Even liberals are wondering if the government can make such an extensive contraption work, and at a reasonable cost.

Of course, Hillary Clinton is not a conventional liberal — not nearly liberal enough for some people on the Democratic left. Among other things, her foreign policy — as much as it can be discerned — has been robust and muscular, not shying away from the use of force. That’s not terribly liberal, but it won’t matter in a general election. She will still be caricatured as the classic lefty, the architect of her own failed health-insurance program. That was a dreadnought of a bill (1,000 pages!) dubbed Hillarycare that was torpedoed by Republicans and even some Democrats and sank — but not quite without a trace. The GOP will refloat it for the next campaign, bringing those two frauds, Harry and Louise, back from retirement. By the time the malicious generalizers of the GOP are through, it will sound like one of Stalin’s five-year plans.

It remains to be seen if gender will play the role for Clinton that race did for Obama. Probably not. The prospect of a woman becoming president has an air of inevitability about it, rather than the gleeful surprise that accompanied Obama’s stunning rise. She, like him, would be a first — not to mention an about-time. But Obama was otherwise an unknown. It was easy to vote for him, hard to vote against him. He stood for all things good and opposed all things bad. (Who knew that, like a surgeon who can’t stand the sight of blood, Obama is phobic about politicians?)

Clinton, in contrast, is no ingenue. She has been around for a very long time. She’s been a senator from New York. She’s been secretary of state. What she has — and has in abundance — is experience and knowledge, plus a vast network of friends and associates, who could in a moment fill every available slot in the government. Clinton comes fully assembled, White House-ready. She has been her husband’s go-to person in times of crisis, and she possesses — even her critics would have to concede — a daunting intellect. The only politician I know who is smarter than her is also named Clinton.

Alas, in American politics, the good can be bad. Recent Democratic presidents, with the exception of the exceptional Obama, have come from statehouses — Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. They proclaimed themselves Washington outsiders and ran their campaigns down the middle of the road — Clinton even ran over Sister Souljah.

Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, is the quintessential Washington insider, a former secretary of state whose portfolio is devoid of a soaring triumph and whose name is attached not to some diplomatic doctrine but to a failed health-insurance plan. She might make a wonderful president, but she’s following a man who, by virtue of his failures, has made that harder. As in 2008, Barack Obama could wind up defeating her.

Pollak'],"Holder Faces New Questions About Racial Bias, Credibility After IG Report & Documents Released","Attorney General Eric Holder faces new questions about racial bias at the Department of Justice (DOJ), as well as about the veracity of his testimony before Congress, as the result of a new Inspector General report and documents obtained by Judicial Watch.

The Inspector General’s report, covered extensively by former DOJ official J. Christian Adams, reveals that many Civil Rights Division attorneys do not believe that the Voting Rights Act ought to be enforced to protect white victims as well as black victims, and that black employees who were willing to help prosecute black defendants–such as the New Black Panther Party–were subject to alleged threats and intimidation by DOJ officials.

The Judicial Watch documents suggest that political appointees at DOJ were involved in the decision to drop the case against the New Black Panther Party, contrary to Holder’s sworn testimony before Congress, in which he said: “The decisions made in the New Black Panther Party case were made by career attorneys in the department. And beyond that, you know, if we’re going to look at the record, let’s look at it in its totality.”

The documents also contradict the testimony of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Thomas Perez, who claimed that there was no political intervention in the case.

Perez is currently considered the frontrunner to be President Barack Obama’s next Secretary of Labor, despite a controversial history that includes heavy involvement with the pro-amnesty group La Raza as well as the New Black Panther Party case.

Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton, who fought the DOJ in court for access to the documents, called for “an independent investigation into whether Messrs. Holder and Perez committed perjury in testifying under oath about the Black Panther controversy.”"

As poll results came in showing the former congressman in distant fifth place, Weiner took to the stage at Connolly's Pub in Midtown and put an end to a once-promising campaign.

""Now, sadly, we did not win this time,"" he said. ""But I could not be more proud of the campaign we ran.""

""There's no doubt about it,"" he added. ""We have the best ideas. Sadly, I was an imperfect messenger.""

Weiner, who resigned from Congress in 2011 amid a sexting scandal, joined the Democratic mayoral primary earlier this summer. He quickly climbed in the polls, even briefly gaining frontrunner status.

In July, however, revelations that Weiner had more online relationships with women after his resignation caused him to plummet in the polls.

Though his wife, longtime Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, often stood by his side on the campaign trail, she was absent from his concession speech."

Lois Lerner, director of exempt organizations for the IRS, will assert her right against self-incrimination during her scheduled appearance Wednesday before the House oversight panel.

The news about Lerner is yet another low point for the IRS and the Obama administration in their struggles to explain how IRS employees in a field office in Cincinnati targeted some groups that had applied for tax-exempt status.

Lerner’s criminal defense attorney, William W. Taylor III, sent the committee a letter saying that he advised Lerner, because of a federal criminal investigation, not to answer questions about the screening or about what the committee said were “false or misleading” responses she made four times to the committee’s earlier queries about the IRS’ actions.

“She has not committed any crime or made any misrepresentation, but under the circumstances she has no choice but to take this course,” Taylor wrote to Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Vista), chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. He asked that Lerner be excused from appearing, but an Issa spokesman said she would be expected to show up anyway.

“Chairman Issa remains hopeful that she will ultimately decide to testify tomorrow about her knowledge of outrageous IRS targeting of Americans for their political beliefs,” spokesman Ali Ahmad said.

That news came as the last two commissioners of the agency, Douglas Shulman and Steven Miller, endured a barrage of hostile questions from members of the Senate Finance Committee about who was responsible and why they didn’t reveal the problems earlier.

And a White House spokesman defended the decision by senior officials not to brief President Obama about the matter. White House spokesman Jay Carney said there was “nothing the president could or should do until that process was completed.”

New details have emerged this week showing that, with an audit by an inspector general nearing release, officials at the IRS, the Treasury Department and the White House started talking a month ago about some kind of preemptive public disclosure about the improper targeting.

In late April, IRS officials reported to the Treasury Department that they were thinking about having Lerner talk about it in a speech, with an apology, according to a Treasury Department official. Treasury officials “expressed some concern” about the idea but “deferred” to the IRS.

Advertisement

About the same time, the IRS floated the idea of having Miller reveal the targeting during congressional testimony. Once again, the Treasury Department said it was the IRS’ call, according to a statement from a Treasury official.

And the Treasury Department also knew in advance that Lerner would reveal the targeting on May 10, answering a planted question during an American Bar Assn. conference. The disclosure quickly turned messy, with Lerner struggling to answer questions during a follow-up call with reporters. The White House knew about the speech idea but not the plan to plant a question, the Treasury official said.

Miller, the acting IRS commissioner forced to resign last week, said he took responsibility for that bungled rollout strategy.

“Did not work out,” he said bluntly. “Obviously the entire thing was an incredibly bad idea.”

Advertisement

Lerner, head of the unit that scrutinizes nonprofits for the IRS, came to the agency from the Federal Election Commission in 2001. In June 2011, according to the inspector general’s report, Lerner learned that employees in Cincinnati were using terms like “tea party” and “patriots” to cull applications from nonprofit groups for review.

Lerner immediately ordered changes, the report says. But in January 2012, someone at the IRS put out another email telling screeners to watch out for groups that used other political terms, including those involved in educating on the Constitution.

The groups raised protests after the IRS sent them letters with a long list of questions, including the identity of their donors and the names of the people invited to their events. Congress started asking questions. But Lerner, along with other senior IRS employees, did not reveal the improper targeting before May 10.

During the hearing Tuesday, senators on the Finance Committee accused Shulman and Miller of deliberately hiding the matter from Congress. “It’s a lie by omission. There’s no question about that in my mind,” said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the committee’s top Republican.

Advertisement

“I did not lie, sir,” Miller responded.

Shulman also said he wasn’t trying to hide anything.

Advertisement

He said he didn’t know about the screenings when he told Congress that no improper targeting had occurred. Afterward, he kept quiet because the audit was still underway. “And sitting there then and sitting here today, I think I made the right decision, which is to let the inspector general get to the bottom of it, chase down all the facts and then make his findings public,” he said.

Miller said he still could not provide the names of the IRS employees who were responsible for the inappropriate screening. The inspector general, J. Russell George, promised further scrutiny.

Advertisement

Shulman, who retired in November 2012 after five years as commissioner, said he regretted that the problems happened on his watch, but he resisted a suggestion by one senator that he apologize to several Texas groups that received long lists of questions during the screening process.

“I didn’t touch individual cases and I certainly didn’t touch cases that involved political activity,” Shulman said.

Advertisement

“The buck doesn’t stop with you,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas).

“I certainly am not personally responsible for creating a list that had inappropriate criteria on it,” Shulman said.

Advertisement

Shulman and Miller also were taken to task for failing to address the underlying issue that helped create the mess: determining how much political activity is permitted by social welfare organizations that get tax-exempt status. Federal tax law says these groups should be “exclusively” devoted to the public welfare. But the IRS later issued a rule that said politics could not be the group’s “primary purpose,” and neither the agency nor Congress has ever defined that rule.

Since the Citizens United decision in 2010, such groups — which don’t have to report their donors to the public, as do political entities — have been used as vehicles for hundreds of millions in political spending.

Advertisement

Miller agreed that the IRS had done a poor job at providing guidance on what level of political activity was acceptable.

“How long do we wait?” asked Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio).

Advertisement

“That’s a question that you’ll have to ask my successor, sir,” Miller said.

The latest claim comes from Lanny Davis, who served as counsel to former President Bill Clinton and later went on to write a column for The Washington Times. In a radio interview on WMAL, Davis said that a ""senior Obama White House official"" once called his editor at the Times and said that if the paper continued to run his columns, ""his reporters would lose their credentials.""

Davis said he ""couldn't imagine why this call was made"" since he's an Obama supporter.

But he called the alleged threat ""unfortunate.""

The account comes after Woodward claimed Wednesday night that a White House aide sent him an email saying he would ""regret"" his recent reporting on the sequester battle. The aide was not identified, but an official familiar with the exchange told Fox News it was National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling -- the tone of the email was rather mixed, as it also included an apology. That was after Woodward wrote a column this past weekend claiming Obama was trying to re-write history -- regarding not only whose idea the sequester was, but also how it would take effect.

Woodward wrote that based on his reporting earlier in the budget battle, the president was trying to move the goalposts by trying to replace the sequester with a mix of tax hikes and spending cuts -- instead of solely spending cuts.

After Politico reported late Wednesday that Woodward was coming forward to claim he was threatened, a White House aide denied the claim.

""Of course no threat was intended,"" wrote the White House aide. ""As Mr. Woodward noted, the email from the aide was sent to apologize for voices being raised in their previous conversation. The note suggested that Mr. Woodward would regret the observation he made regarding the sequester because that observation was inaccurate, nothing more. And Mr. Woodward responded to this aide's email in a friendly manner.""

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Thursday that Woodward and Obama's advisers merely ""had a factual disagreement that I think we stand by.""

He stressed that it's clear nobody was threatening anybody, and that the tone was ""respectful.""

According to Politico, Woodward said he was ""yelled at"" by an Obama aide over his weekend column in the Post. Then, he said he received a page-long email from the aide -- apparently Sperling -- that said: ""I apologize for raising my voice in our conversation today. ... You're focusing on a few specific trees that give a very wrong impression of the forest. But perhaps we will just not see eye to eye here. ... I think you will regret staking out that claim.""

Animosity between Woodward and the Obama team is rising, as the journalist has repeatedly needled the administration on its sequester talking points. His reporting bolstered claims that the sequester idea originated at the White House. And this week, he called the administration's handling of the cuts ""madness.""

Former Obama adviser David Plouffe tweeted Wednesday: ""Watching Woodward last 2 days is like imagining my idol Mike Schmidt facing live pitching again. Perfection gained once is rarely repeated.""

Members of the press, who consistently hide behind their own objectivity, have been forced to come out in Fox News’ favor in the Department of Justice targeting of Fox News journalist James Rosen. Democrats have been forced to come out of the woodwork to declare that the Obama administration’s treatment of journalists has indeed been abysmal.

But this is a political set-up that cannot hold. The journalistic establishment is generally all too happy to watch their conservative colleagues burned at the stake. Only the fact that the Associated Press was targeted before James Rosen forces the press to embrace the united front approach against the administration.

So what comes next?

The Obama administration surely will not stop targeting its opponents in the press. Whether they are monitoring James Rosen’s communications, screaming at CBS News reporter Sharyl Attkisson for daring to cover the Fast and Furious scandal, or giving “advice” to Bob Woodward about covering President Obama, the White House operates through intimidation. For years, the White House has made Fox News its primary target in the anti-media war, recognizing that the rest of the media would play along.

Now Obama and company must win back their traditional media allies. That will start with a coordinated play – likely led by White House ally Media Matters – directed at Fox News. An opinion host will be targeted for destruction, and the White House will jump in with both feet. Other reporters, recognizing the cover provided by the White House targeting an opinion journalist at Fox News rather than a straight reporter, will join in. Soon the alliance between Fox News and their erstwhile friends will be broken completely, even as the mainstream press pretends to back journalistic integrity.

This game is not over. Not by a long shot. The Democrats and their press allies know that turning on Fox News is the only way to prevent the burgeoning Obama scandals from turning their man into an early lame duck. The united front will undoubtedly cave soon.

The question, then, is simple: will the American people hold the members of the Democrat-Media Complex accountable for abandoning their journalistic mission in favor of Obama administration shilling?

""This is part of due process,"" City Attorney Jan Goldsmith said. ""If Bob Filner engaged in unlawful conduct and the city is held liable, he will have to reimburse us every penny the city pays and its attorney fees.""

The dispute over legal costs comes as a pair of competing recall efforts against Filner, who is accused by eight women of behavior such as groping, unwanted kissing and sexual advances, began in earnest Monday.

Lisa Curtin, director of government and military education at San Diego City College, became the eighth woman to go public with allegations about Filner when she told KPBS that he made unwanted advances to her during a meeting in 2011, when he was a Democratic member of Congress, the station reported.

Curtin said that Filner asked to meet with her privately at the conclusion of a business meeting, and that once alone with her he asked about the wedding ring she was wearing. She replied that she had been married for 25 years, she said.

""He then asked me if it could come off while I was in D.C. and if I would go out with him,"" Curtin said. ""I said I really didn't think so. And at that point, he pulled my hand closer to him and he reached over to kiss me. I turned my head at that moment and on the side of my face, I got a very wet, saliva-filled kiss including feeling his tongue on my cheek.""

Curtin said she did not report the incident to police at the time but has since reported it to the San Diego Sheriff's Department, which has established a hotline for reports of alleged misconduct by the mayor.

Irene McCormack Jackson, Filner's former aide, filed suit against the mayor and the city last week alleging, among other things, that the mayor told her he wanted to see her naked and asked her to work without wearing underwear.

Filner apologized for his behavior and said he would undergo ""intensive therapy"" for two weeks starting Aug. 5. The former Democratic congressman, who was elected to the city post in November, has rejected repeated calls to resign.

Seven of the nine San Diego City Council members have called on Filner to step down. Resignation calls have also come from top Democrats such as Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the state's senior senator, and national party chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.

""Intimidating women is not in Mayor Filner's job description,'' council member Kevin Faulconer said. ""His employer -- San Diego taxpayers -- shouldn't have to bail him out of the mess he created.''.

Filner has hired a private attorney, Harvey Berger, to defend him in the lawsuit.

Filner is the first Democratic mayor of the nation's eighth most populous city in 20 years.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/05/Obama-Under-Fire-for-Bypassing-Congress,2013-12-05 00:00:00,['William Bigelow'],Obama Under Fire for Bypassing Congress,"Barack Obama is coming under fire for his willingness to bypass Congress when implementing his agenda in contravention of the Constitution’s desire for three equal branches of government. GOP congressmen speaking at a House Judiciary Committee meeting this week were blunt about Obama’s defiance of the traditional negotiation with Congress.

Committee Chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) blasted that Obama “doesn’t have a debate in the Oval Office about what he wants to do … he does what he wants to do, and then you no longer have representative democracy.” GOP members noted that Obama has acted unilaterally on issues ranging from immigration laws, which he ignores, to consistent and enormous revisions of ObamaCare, which was passed as law.

Even Obama supporter Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, had the temerity to question his Obama’s methods, although he felt compelled to include George W. Bush when he commented, “The problem of what the president is doing is that he is not simply posing a danger to the constitutional system; he is becoming the very danger the Constitution was designed to avoid: that is, the concentration of power in any single branch.”

Of course, there are the other Obama acolytes who will defend him. Simon Lazarus, Senior Counsel for the Constitutional Accountability Center, said that Obama’s changes to ObamaCare after it was already passed do not conflict with Article II of the U.S. Constitution, which requires the president to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” Lazarus loftily intoned, “I have to say that hyperventilating about how extraordinary and unprecedented and unconstitutional these delays are is just that, it’s hyperventilation and it’s contrary to obvious historical fact.”

Should we be surprised by Obama’s circumvention? This is the same man who boasted in March 2012, “If Congress refuses to act, I’ll do everything in my power to act without them.”

Although there was a suggestion before the House Committee that the only way to solve the problem would be to impeach Obama, the reality is that the Democratic-controlled Senate would shoot that down. Those who called for impeachment concluded that the only real answer “comes down to elections.”"

He Sketches The Foolish', 'The Fallacious', 'The Felonious In Politics.']",Dana Milbank: The Democrats’ naked power grab,"“Congress is broken,” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Thursday before holding a party-line vote that disposed of rules that have guided and protected the chamber since 1789.

If Congress wasn’t broken before, it certainly is now. What Reid (Nev.) and his fellow Democrats effectively did was take the chamber of Congress that still functioned at a modest level and turn it into a clone of the other chamber, which functions not at all. They turned the Senate into the House.

Democrats were fully justified in stripping Republicans of their right to filibuster President Obama’s nominees — yet they will come to deeply regret what they have done.

Certainly, Republicans have abused the dilatory tactics that Senate minorities have, for centuries, used with greater responsibility; they seem intent on bringing government to a halt. And the Senate in 2013 is hardly a healthy institution. Yet it has achieved far more than the House — passing bipartisan immigration legislation and a farm bill and working out deals to avoid default and to end the federal government shutdown — largely because, until Thursday, Senate rules required the majority party to win votes from the minority.

Here’s what then-Sen. Joe Biden said in 2005 when a Republican Senate majority threatened to use a similar “nuclear option” to allow a simple majority to carry the day:

Caption The many controversies that the White House says the president was kept in the dark about. Health-care insurance cancellations



In fact, that wasn’t the case. Thousands who had bought insurance have been receiving cancellations notices from insurers. The president said he wasn’t aware his promise before the rollout would result in cancellations, and Obama had repeatedly stated that, although new health-care insurance would be available through the Affordable Care Act, those willing to stay on their plan would be able to do so.In fact, that wasn’t the case. Thousands who had bought insurance have been receiving cancellations notices from insurers. The president said he wasn’t aware his promise before the rollout would result in cancellations, and has apologized for his assurances ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images Wait 1 second to continue.

“The nuclear option abandons America’s sense of fair play . . . tilting the playing field on the side of those who control and own the field. I say to my friends on the Republican side: You may own the field right now, but you won’t own it forever. I pray God when the Democrats take back control, we don’t make the kind of naked power grab you are doing.”

Sen. Carl Levin (Mich.), one of just three Democrats who opposed his colleagues’ naked power grab, read those words on the Senate floor Thursday after Reid invoked the nuclear option. The rumpled Levin is not known for his oratory. But he is retiring next year and free to speak his mind — and his words were potent.

“We need to change the rules, but to change it in the way we changed it today means there are no rules except as the majority wants them,” Levin said. “This precedent is going to be used, I fear, to change the rules on consideration of legislation, and down the road — we don’t know how far down the road; we never know that in a democracy — but, down the road, the hard-won protections and benefits for our people’s health and welfare will be lost.”

The word “historic” is often tossed around in Washington, but this change ends a tradition dating to the earliest days of the republic. For the nation’s first 118 years, there were no limits on debate in the Senate. After 1917, cutting off debate, or reaching “cloture,” required a two-thirds majority. In 1975, that threshold was reduced to 60 of 100 votes. Even that lower minimum required lawmakers to cooperate with each other.

“Cloture has fostered more bipartisanship in the Senate,” Donald Ritchie, the Senate historian, told me Thursday after Reid detonated his nuclear device. “The majority leader of the Senate is expected to try to work out some kind of a bipartisan deal to get enough votes to get cloture. Because the House is run by majority rule, it is seen as a sign of weakness if the majority leadership of the House has to get votes from the minority side.”

Now the Senate will be just as dysfunctional.

Reid was right that Republican obstruction has been intolerable; half of the 168 filibusters of executive and judicial nominations in the nation’s history, he noted, have come during the Obama presidency.

But Reid’s remedy — calling a simple- majority vote to undo more than two centuries of custom — has created a situation in which the minority leader, Mitch McConnell (Ky.), is expected to use the minority’s remaining powers to gum up the works, and to get revenge when Republicans regain the majority.

“If a Senate majority demonstrates it can make such a change once, there are no rules which binds a majority, and all future majorities will feel free to exercise the same power, not just on judges and executive appointments but on legislation,” Levin said Thursday. Quoting one of the Senate’s giants, Arthur Vandenberg, Levin said his fellow Democrats had sacrificed “vital principle for the sake of momentary convenience.”

If it was possible to make things even worse in Washington, Reid just did it.

“To say that the president hates Fox News may be an understatement,” writes Newsmax in a book review of Roger Ailes: Off Camera by Zev Chafets. “Early in his first term Obama actually sought to ban Fox News from the White House press corps, ripping away its press credential.”

Chafets, who received unprecedented access to Ailes and his Fox News inner circle, recounts an intense private 2008 meeting at New York’s Waldorf Astoria Hotel between News Corporation Chairman and CEO Rupert Murdoch, Barack Obama, and Roger Ailes. When Ailes asked Obama about his stated support for unilateral arms reductions, Ailes says Obama looked him square in the eye and denied ever taking such a position.

“He said this looking me right in the eyes. He never dropped his gaze, which is the usual tell. It was as good a lie as anyone ever told me,” said Ailes.

The Newsmax book review says the Ailes biography contains several “surprising revelations,” including:

How Glenn Beck’s exposé on Van Jones led to the White House efforts to ban Fox News;

Obama’s surprising remark at a White House Christmas party, telling Ailes that he was “the most powerful man in the world;”

The truth about the George Soros-backed efforts to torpedo the “two Great Satans” — Roger Ailes and Rush Limbaugh;

Why Beck really left Fox News to start his own network;

Fox and Hollywood: the funny account by Ailes of the time he went to dinner with Al Pacino and Shirley MacLaine;

Ailes’ role in saving Ronald Reagan after his disastrous debate performance against Walter Mondale;

O’Reilly wars: the inside story of how Fox dealt with MSNBC’s Keith Olbermann and why, to this day, Bill O’Reilly hates his liberal critics at NBC

Newsmax is not alone in its praiseworthy book review; Rush Limbaugh said the biography is “great because Ailes opened up to Zev like he hasn’t opened up to anybody else.” Limbaugh encouraged readers who are tired of progressive caricatures of Fox News to “get Roger Ailes: Off Camera.”"

(CNN) – U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said she has regretted calling then-Sen. Hillary Clinton a ""monster"" nearly every day since she made the comment in the 2008 primary battle when Power worked as an adviser to then-Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaign.

""There is a fair amount of negativity heaped upon her that I find massively unfair. And the idea that I could have contributed in some way to that narrative...that was terrible. So yeah, I have regretted it pretty much every day since,"" she said in an interview that aired Thursday on NBC's ""Today.""



Power apologized for her comments in March 2008 after they were published in a Scottish newspaper.

""She is a monster, too – that is off the record – she is stooping to anything,"" Power was quoted as saying.

""You just look at her and think, 'Ergh,' "" Power also said. ""But if you are poor and she is telling you some story about how Obama is going to take your job away, maybe it will be more effective. The amount of deceit she has put forward is really unattractive.""

Power resigned from the Obama campaign after apologizing for the comments, and she apologized to Clinton personally. In the Thursday interview, she said ""it was very emotional for me.""

""To be able to say that in person was something that I'm immensely grateful to her to have given me that opportunity to do,"" she said.

Power went on to become the special assistant to the president and senior director for multilateral affairs and human rights at the National Security Council during Obama's first term. She left the administration in February and was nominated for the ambassadorship in June.

In the Thursday interview, Power said she and Clinton have ""worked together very effectively on issues of common concern the last four years."""
http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/12/16/is-president-obama-too-big-to-jail/,2013-12-16 00:00:00,[],Is President Obama 'too big to jail?',"A Chinese proverb says, “May you live in interesting times.” We certainly do. Historians will look back on this time as “the Obama criminal years.”

How lawless is the Obama administration? Many of the dirty deeds and scandals of Obama & Co. are public knowledge. Let’s start with the most astonishing.

Many citizens are aware that because of ObamaCare, millions of Americans are losing their health care coverage. Is this incompetence, or criminal fraud?

One thing is certain: it would be fraud if a private sector CEO knew that millions of customers would lose their insurance, yet repeated the same lie over and over -- “If you like your health insurance, you can keep it. Period.”

Why would we not hold a politician to the same standard?

That brings up the question “IS THIS PRESIDENT TOO BIG TO JAIL?”

But this fraud isn’t just about money and power. It’s about cancer patients, our fellow citizens who may lose their lives as well as their health care coverage because of ObamaCare.

Even innocent children with cancer are among the victims of ObamaCare.

Yes, it turns out ObamaCare is one big death panel. With their policies being cancelled, these sick Americans are losing the very doctors, hospitals and treatments that have kept them alive.

What if some of them die from the stoppage of treatment? What if some die from stress and worry? What if some commit suicide from depression?

These are complicated questions. But isn’t the person whose lies and misrepresentations harmed them, at least partly responsible for their deaths?

So, IS THIS PRESIDENT TOO BIG TO JAIL?

This president has no shame. How many Americans know that a cancer patient merely discussing the disastrous ramifications of ObamaCare in public (thereby embarrassing Obama), is now being persecuted by the IRS?

Yes, it’s true. Bill Elliott is that terminally-ill cancer patient. He was audited by the IRS within days of an appearance on Fox News.

The IRS scandal is far more widespread than the American public knows. It is not just about Tea Party groups.

The IRS was used by Obama to go after any citizen daring to criticize him in the national media.

I’m one of those victims. These actions by a president are absolutely criminal. Richard Nixon’s articles of impeachment included the exact same charge of using the IRS to punish critics and silence free speech. But terminally ill cancer patients?

Obama has sunk to new lows. I'm a big boy. What he did to critics like me is disgusting and un-American. But what he did to a terminally ill cancer patient is disgraceful and unimaginable. This president is an out-of-control bully, pure and simple.

Will anyone show the courage to investigate and prosecute Obama?

“IS THIS PRESIDENT TOO BIG TO JAIL?”

But wait (as late night infomercial pitchmen like to say), “There’s more.” When the citizens went to the ""state of the art"" ObamaCare web site for help, to try to save themselves, they found it defective.

It turns out the website was built so poorly, the personal information of consumers can be easily stolen. And it’s not just online scam artists we’re worried about. The “Obama navigators” themselves might do the stealing -- after all, it turns out many of them have criminal records.

Rather than hiring one of many highly-qualified American high tech Internet companies, why would Obama give a NO BID contract for hundreds of millions of dollars to a firm with less than stellar credentials?

Surely the reason couldn’t be that it’s the firm of one of Michelle Obama’s Princeton Black Alumni Association buddies?

Don’t you wonder how many of those millions of taxpayer dollars are committed to Democrat causes, or are now sitting in a Swiss bank account?

Can you imagine if this happened at a private sector company?

Can you imagine the outrage and criminal accusations coming from consumer protection advocates?

Can you imagine how quickly the federal government would shut down the business?

The criminal would have been “perp walked” out of his office in front of waiting journalists and photographers. He’d be facing a lifetime in prison.

So, “IS THIS PRESIDENT TOO BIG TO JAIL?”

As bad as it is, ObamaCare is just another of the nonstop scandals of this administration. Any one of these scandals would have already forced a Republican president out of office. Obama owns all of them.

Benghazi. More absurd lies than ObamaCare, a possible arms deal with rebels gone bad, and the cover-up of murder.

Fast and Furious. Another government arms deal gone bad, responsibility for the murder of a U.S. border guard, another blatant cover-up.

The NSA scandal. Obama listens into all of our calls and communications. I hope he’s listening to mine. He’ll hear the word IMPEACHMENT come up in every sentence.

The AP scandal. Obama and paranoid buddies like Attorney General Eric Holder are even illegally spying on their adoring Kool-Aid drinking friends in the media.

The IRS scandal. It’s not just about targeting his political opposition. It’s about the much more serious scandal of using the IRS to change the outcome of the election. Obama’s goal was to neutralize the powerful Tea Parties to prevent a repeat of the 2010 GOP landslide.

Guess what? It worked.

Obama used the IRS to kill conservative momentum, intensity, and enthusiasm, silence criticism in the media, and starve conservative fundraising. These guys put the ""thug"" in Chicago.

The Census Bureau scandal. It appears government employees faked the unemployment numbers in the weeks leading up to the election to re-elect a president who wouldn’t know what a job looked like, if it hit him in the face.

How could one leader be involved in this many lies, frauds, scandals, and cover-ups? There’s enough here for a century of presidents!

Forget impeachment, it’s time for criminal prosecution. There’s enough here to put a CEO away for multiple life sentences. Bernie Madoff would blush at what Obama has pulled off (so far).

The question is, “IS THIS PRESIDENT TOO BIG TO JAIL?”"

The potty-mouth professor is Joseph Schwartz, a political science professor who told he’s won every teaching award at the university. He’s also a card-carrying Democratic Socialist (but he stresses he’s not an authoritarian communist).

The good professor, along with a handful of his followers, took over a “right to work” discussion hosted by Temple’s College Republicans and featuring a representative from Pennsylvania Right to Work Defense and Education Foundation.

Joseph Oleksak, the chairman of Temple’s Republican group, said the meeting was running smoothly until Professor Joseph Schwartz started raising questions.

[pullquote]

“I understand that not everyone agrees with my point of view,” Oleksak told me. “But the fact that somebody can come into another person’s meeting and take it over and then accuse them of racism – it’s an insult.”

Watchdog group Campus Reform obtained a video of the meeting and it shows Schwartz, along with students identified as members of the Temple Democratic Socialistic club, raising arguments with the speaker.

At some point, the professor used the “F-word” leading to a warning from the speaker. A member of the College Republicans told him that if kept cursing he would have to leave.

“The guest speaker took great offense to that and he asked him that if he was going to swear to get out of the presentation,” Oleksak said.

“Oh come on, f*****g a--,” Schwartz said. “I believe in the religion of foul language.”

A university spokesperson told me they were investigating the incident and would determine if any actions should be taken.

“Temple University is a community of scholars in which freedom of inquiry, freedom of expression and mutual respect are valued,” spokesperson Eryn Jelesiewicz said.

“It’s important that we all foster an environment conducive to civilized intellectual and educational stimulation within the university free from unlawful harassment by other members of the community.”

Professor Schwartz told me that he was passionate but not disrespectful.

“I would apologize for using profane language,” he said. ‘Otherwise, I think I made substantive points and I don’t think they were responded to. If people want to be effective in their politics, they’re going to have to learn to argue for it.”

Schwartz said he was just trying to “generate an intellectual exchange.”

“A university is a place for open dialogue,” he said. “People should not disrupt other speakers. They should respect speakers with other points of view.”

Oleksak said he’s not surprised that their meeting was disrupted by the professor and his followers. He said it’s just a way of life on one of the nation’s most liberal college campuses.

“It’s sad to say [but] I didn’t expect anything else,” he said. “That’s the sad part. I knew something like this was coming.”

The cold, hard reality is that American college and university campuses are hostile places to young people who cherish freedom.

Some of the nation’s great institutions of higher learning are infested with left-wing professors, protected by tenure, who use their classrooms to spew their anti-American rhetoric.

Where else are they going to find gainful employment?"

The ""quid pro quo,"" according to the report, potentially cost taxpayers as much as $200 million.

The allegations are highly unusual, though are already being disputed by congressional Democrats. Perez is not a favorite of congressional Republicans, and the charges could impact his pending confirmation hearing -- scheduled for this Thursday.

The report, obtained in advance by Fox News, claimed Perez in February 2012 ""manipulated"" federal law as assistant attorney general and ""pushed the limits of justice to make this deal happen.""

Both cases involved the city of St. Paul. The 67-page report states that the Justice Department's decision to opt out of the whistleblower cases potentially cost taxpayers as much as $200 million -- the amount the government could have won had it pursued damages in the case.

More On This...

But, according to the report, the Justice Department stayed away from that case in order to get the city to drop an appeal to the Supreme Court on another matter. The department was allegedly concerned that the high court, in the course of reviewing that case, would strike down a major element of civil rights enforcement.

""Perez simply could not allow the Court to rule,"" the report said. ""Perez sought leverage to stop the city from pressing its appeal.""

The case the Justice Department was allegedly concerned about was St. Paul's appeal to the Supreme Court, on a case in which property owners said the city made extraordinary efforts, through strict code enforcement, to condemn their properties.

The owners said reducing the amount of affordable housing for minorities violated the federal Fair Housing Act -- by what is known as ""disparate impact.""

Perez appeared to think the Supreme Court overturning the case would have been a severe blow to civil rights enforcement, the report concluded.

The ""disparate impact"" provision, which the report described as legally questionable, prohibits housing policies that end up discriminating against certain groups even if those policies are not blatantly discriminatory.

""Perez sought, facilitated, and consummated this deal because he feared that the Court would find disparate impact unsupported by the text of the Fair Housing Act,"" the report said.

The other end of the alleged deal was for the Justice Department not to get involved in cases against the city of St. Paul that alleged the city received millions in Department of Housing and Urban Development funds -- including stimulus money -- but failed to file the requisite paperwork regarding the hiring of low-income workers.

In that case, which also involved the city of Minneapolis, plaintiff Thomas Newell got neither the backing of the agency nor the Justice Department and lost the case, which if won would likely have resulted in the cities repaying tens of millions in damages.

The Obama administration has acknowledged that senior Justice Department attorneys recommended intervening in the case and characterized the False Claims Act infractions reported by Newell as ""particularly egregious.""

However, they thought the case would be ""quite weak and never should have been a serious candidate for intervention,"" according to the report.

The Justice Department claims everything was above board -- and that the department held three staff briefings, heard 24 hours of additional testimony and reviewed 1,400 pages of documents before deciding not to intervene.

""The litigation decisions made by the department were in the best interests of the United States and were consistent with the department's legal, ethical, and professional responsibility obligations,"" the department said in a statement.

Former Justice Department spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler also questioned the use of the term ""quid pro quo"" to describe what happened.

""It's such a loaded term,"" she said. ""I think in fact you have almost everybody agreeing nothing inappropriate happened.""

The report -- subtitled ""How Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez manipulated Justice and Ignored Rule of Law"" -- was a joint effort by minority leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Republican-led House's Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform committees.

""The facts surrounding this quid pro quo show that Perez may have exceeded the scope of the ethics and professional-responsibility opinions he received from the department and thereby violated his duties of loyalty and confidentiality to the United States. Perez also misled senior Justice Department officials about the quid pro quo,"" the report states.

But congressional Democrats put out a statement and memo of their own late Sunday refuting the details.

The statement said the ""overwhelming evidence"" indicates Perez and others ""acted professionally to advance the interests of civil rights and effectively combat the scourge of discrimination in housing."" They said the decision not to intervene in the suit against St. Paul was based on expert recommendations.

""Instead of identifying inappropriate conduct by Mr. Perez, it appears that the accusations against him are part of a broader political campaign to undermine the legal safeguards against discrimination that Mr. Perez was protecting,"" they said."

Simple: The iron law of longevity. All governments make mistakes, and all governments try to hide those mistakes. But the longer an administration is in office, the more errors it makes, and the harder they are to conceal.

Just ask Richard M. Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton or George W. Bush, all of whom spent much of their second terms playing defense.

The longevity rule caught up with Barack Obama last week as he wrestled clumsily with not one controversy but three: the Internal Revenue Service’s treatment of “tea party” groups, the Benghazi killings and the Justice Department’s seizure of Associated Press telephone records.

Inevitably, the president’s Republican critics reached for historical comparisons: It’s another Watergate, said some. Another Iran-Contra, said others. To the hyperbolic Rep. Steve King of Iowa, Benghazi alone was worse than Watergate and Iran-Contra combined, “times maybe 10.”

So far, though, the three imbroglios don’t add up to another Watergate; not even close. But there are enough unanswered questions to keep any administration tied up for months in congressional hearings, and that’s exactly what’s about to happen.

Let’s take the three issues in turn.

The IRS scandal is the most straightforward: A mismanaged unit of the tax agency applied political criteria to its scrutiny of applications for tax-exempt status. Despite the initial portrayal of a rogue operation confined to Cincinnati, IRS officials in Washington knew about the problem and failed to fix it. At least one appears to have misled Congress last year by suggesting that tea party complaints were unfounded.

Last week, Obama condemned the IRS conduct as “intolerable and inexcusable,” and he fired the agency’s acting director.

But every customer of the IRS, not only Republicans, should want an independent investigation to determine whether higher-ups encouraged the Cincinnati cabal.

Benghazi is the most tangled issue, and the most partisan. A State Department review board has already concluded that security for Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens’ fatal visit to the Libyan city was inexcusably weak; then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton accepted responsibility for that.

But the political side of the Benghazi “scandal,” which still needs to be in quotes, has focused on other targets. Republicans charge that Obama lied about the attacks, portraying them as spontaneous to avoid weakening his election-year claim that he had put Al Qaeda on the path to defeat.

It’s true that Obama was slow to blame terrorists for the killing. “We don’t have all the information yet,” he said on Sept. 25. But by then, other officials had already told Congress that Al Qaeda affiliates were involved. That was five weeks before the election; if the White House was trying to mount a coverup, it apparently forgot to tell the rest of the administration.

It’s also true that Obama aides presided over an internal debate over what information would be in official talking points. But when the White House finally released emails from that wrangle, they mostly revealed a bureaucratic fight between the CIA, which wanted to trumpet its warnings about Libya, and the State Department, which didn’t want to expose its failings. There’s no evidence of anyone acting to protect the Obama reelection campaign.

Still, the White House has a problem: It’s been acting guilty. Obama spokesman Jay Carney said initially that the White House had little to do with the talking points, and that only one substantive change was made to the text. Those descriptions turned out to be false. It’s no wonder Republicans have demanded more answers. But the Benghazi talking points still look mostly like a partisan sideshow, too complicated and murky to engage most voters.

The third controversy, over the Justice Department’s secret decision to seize telephone records of dozens of reporters and editors at the Associated Press, is a different kind of scandal. Republicans have been careful about this one because many have long demanded that the Obama administration get tough on leaks of classified information.

But it still fits into the GOP’s critique of Obama as imperious and authoritarian. And it puts another dent in Obama’s already battered image as a onetime civil libertarian who has grown fond of executive power in office.

If Obama is both smart and lucky, all three controversies will gradually fade away, assuming no more wrongdoing comes to light. His Republican critics already run the risk of repeating their error in the 1998 impeachment of Clinton; if they hound the White House on charges that don’t pan out, they’ll be vulnerable to charges that they’re wasting time on partisan squabbles.

During the Monica Lewinsky scandal, the Clinton White House made a point of putting the president on camera every day to show he was at work on the economy, not his legal troubles. The Obama White House is already following the same path.

But a season of scandal still comes with a cost. If Congress spends much of its time on investigations (and one-third of all House committees have announced they plan to do just that), it will have fewer hours to work on other issues. If the White House must focus on defending the president against charges of malpractice, that saps its energy as well.

Any second-term president has limited time after reelection to win legislative battles. Obama’s clock is already ticking; his agenda is already in trouble. If the remainder of 2013 is dominated by inquests that widen the partisan divide, the chances for bipartisan deal-making — especially a grand bargain on taxes and spending — will wane even further.

In 2004, David Blood and former Vice President Al Gore co-founded Generation Investment Management. Schweizer says despite the perception that Gore’s investments are all green energy-related, Blood and Gore’s investment portfolio is currently comprised of 27% health care investments and stands poised to score big from Obamacare.

“David Blood was a bundler for Barack Obama,” said Schweizer. “Even though they talk about being in green technology, 27% of their investment portfolio right now is in health insurance companies designed to profit from this sector.”

Blood bundled over $500,000 in campaign donations for Obama in 2012.

Schweizer, whose new book Extortion debuted at number eight on the New York Times bestseller list, said other Obama fundraisers are also cashing in on the government health care overhaul.

“The same thing goes for the private equity firms,” said Schweizer. “Evercore Partners–who is headed by Roger Altman, a bundler for the Obama campaign–they are said to cash in on what everybody is saying is going to be massive mergers between hospital companies, etc. Wall Street firms need to broker those deals and a company like Evercore Partners is perfectly positioned to do that.”

Even as 4.9 million Americans are losing their health insurance plans under Obamacare, Schweizer says top Obama campaign fundraisers and insiders stand to rake in millions.

“It’s a great business for them because the law basically creates a market for products that didn’t exist before,” said Schweizer.

“Your book, Extortion, is going to open a lot of eyes,” said Fox & Friends co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck."

Gosar on Napolitano Resignation: Eric Holder Should 'Follow Her Lead',"Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) said Friday that the resignation of President Barack Obama’s Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is not enough. He said Attorney General Eric Holder should step down too.

“One down and one to go,” Gosar said in a statement. “While Secretary Napolitano may be gone she will not be forgotten. Her inaction and incompetence on border security will continue to plague our nation for years to come.”

“‘See no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil’ is no way to govern and yet it is exactly how she and this administration operates,” he continued. “The American public deserve better.”

Gosar added that it is time for Holder to resign as well.

“What the American people need now is for Attorney General Eric Holder to follow her lead and resign,” Gosar said. “The American people have no confidence in him or his ability to do his job. My message to him would be: Better late than never. Today is a good day to go.”

Gosar has a resolution in the House calling for Holder’s resignation that a number of members of Congress have signed onto. During the previous session, 130 House members, eight U.S. Senators, and several governors from around the country called for Holder to resign over Operation Fast and Furious.

In Fast and Furious, the Obama administration’s Department of Justice and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives allowed 2,000 weapons bought through straw purchases to fall into the hands of Mexican drug cartels. Holder remains in both criminal and civil contempt of Congress for his failure to cooperate with the congressional investigation into the scandal, which left hundreds of Mexican citizens and U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry dead.

President Obama has asserted executive privilege to continue concealing thousands of pages of documents related to the scandal from Congress.

Fast and Furious is hardly Holder’s only problem moving forward, especially as House Republicans draw closer to obtaining the documents uncovered via a federal court lawsuit. The Attorney General faces multiple scandals, particularly his decision to approve secret investigations into members of the news media. Holder reportedly met with President Obama on a forthcoming report on the DOJ’s activities in regards to that issue on Friday.

The Associated Press noted how Gosar’s harsh words for Napolitano contrast sharply with those of his fellow Arizona Republican, Sen. John McCain. McCain rushed to praise Napolitano for her work, saying she “served our nation with honor.”

Napolitano’s DHS released hundreds of illegal aliens from prisons earlier this year, citing the sequester as the reason."
http://news.yahoo.com/obama-apologizes-calif-ag-looks-183506438--politics.html,,[],Obama apologizes to Calif. AG for comment on looks,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama has apologized to California Attorney General Kamala Harris for causing a stir when he called her ""the best-looking attorney general"" at a Democratic fundraiser they attended together this week.

A spokesman for Harris said she had a great conversation with Obama and strongly supports him but would not say whether she had accepted the president's apology.

Obama apologized to Harris by telephone Thursday night after returning from two days of fundraising in California, White House press secretary Jay Carney said.

At a fundraiser in Silicon Valley earlier that day, Obama raised eyebrows when he said Harris ""happens to be, by far, the best-looking attorney general in the country. It's true! C'mon."" He prefaced the remark by saying she is ""brilliant and she is dedicated and she is tough, and she is exactly what you'd want in anybody who is administering the law.""

Harris was present and had addressed the crowd before the president spoke.

The ""best-looking"" comment instantly lit up news blogs and websites, with some highlighting it as an example of the hurdles working women still face.

Carney and Harris' spokesman, Gil Duran, both noted that Obama and Harris are longtime friends.

""He called her to apologize for the distraction created by his comments,"" Carney told reporters Friday. ""He did not want in any way to diminish the attorney general's professional accomplishments and her capabilities.""

He noted that Obama also commented on Harris' smarts.

Carney went on to say that Obama ""fully recognizes the challenge women continue to face in the workplace and that they should not be judged based on appearance.""

In an emailed statement, Duran noted the longstanding ties between Obama and Harris.

""They had a great conversation yesterday, and she strongly supports him,"" he said.

Duran later said he would not comment beyond the statement. He declined to say whether Harris had accepted the president's apology or whether she was offended by his comment.

Story continues

Harris had scheduled no public appearances Friday and was not expected to comment herself.

Harris and Obama have campaigned for each other in prior elections. Some pundits also have described her as a female version of Obama because of her stage presence and because, like the president, she is of mixed race.

The question is, will the media once again cave to the wishes of their beloved Obama administration or do their jobs and demand a full accounting from an out-of-control Justice Department on a chilling rampage to intimidate journalists and their sources?

Yesterday, the Daily Beast embarrassed itself with a Holder profile so glowing and so obviously aimed at tamping down the media’s frustration with him, that even BuzzFeed’s left-wing Ben Smith raised his eyebrows over it on “Morning Joe” Wednesday.

We also learned Wednesday that Holder has already set up meetings with various representatives from a number of print and television organizations to discuss how the DOJ will handle leak investigations in the future.

During his Congressional testimony two weeks ago, Holder didn’t seem at all contrite during questioning about his department’s role in the seizure of phone records from the Associated Press. In fact, the Attorney General came off as cocky, bored, and peevish.

Holder also didn’t even seem terribly fazed after it was discovered that he was the one who signed an application for a warrant to seize the private emails and phone records of Fox News reporter James Rosen.

What has come out since, though, has obviously knocked the smug out of him. The House Judiciary Committee is now investigating Holder’s statements during his recent testimony. It seems that Holder’s statement about never hearing or having anything to do with attempting to prosecute a journalist or reporter doesn’t quite reconcile with an application that accused Rosen of espionage. A perjury charge could be forthcoming.

What has to worry Holder the most, though, is that the revelations surrounding the Justice Department’s hysterical actions toward Fox News have not elicited the kind of reaction from the mainstream media that Holder likely expected. The media hates Fox News almost as much as the Obama administration does, but only almost.

Rather than let their political hatred and envy of Fox News’s success turn into a Get Out of Jail Free card for Holder, the media has instead rallied around Fox. This means that once Congress is back in session next and the hearings into the Justice Department begin, the press coverage could be very bad for an Attorney General who up till now has been zealously protected by the media in scandal after scandal.

The Huffington Post has already called for Holder to be fired. If the rest of the mainstream media jumps on board, Holder is toast and Holder knows this. More importantly, so does Obama. In short, Holder’s fate and legacy will be decided by how the media collective chooses to cover this scandal in the coming weeks.

So starting as early as Thursday, Holder is going to attempt to charm and convince the media to ignore their duty, circle the wagons, and play goalie for him just one more time.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/05/27/The-Ailes-Manifesto,2013-05-27 00:00:00,['Stephen K. Bannon'],The Ailes Manifesto: America Rallies Around Roger Ailes and Fox News,"Fox News CEO Roger Ailes’ May 23 stirring letter to Fox employees will be remembered as a turning point in the battle for freedom of the press in the age of Obama.

The Ailes letter, denouncing the Obama administration’s trampling on the First Amendment, should be seen, of course, as a strong defense of Fox correspondent James Rosen. In addition, the Ailes letter–in truth, a manifesto–is a staunch vindication of Fox News and its “speak-truth-to-power” approach to journalism. Finally, the Ailes Manifesto should be seen as a clarion call for freedom–for freedom of the press, and also for the right of all Americans to think freely, liberated from the MSM thought-monopoly.

As Patrick Caddell has pointed out here at Breitbart News, the Obama Administration has never truly been worried about leaks, because the Administration itself has been the main source of leaks. Why? For political advantage, of course. That is, to make the Administration look good, especially in regard to the war on terror in the run-up to the 2012 election.

The Obamans wanted to maintain their exclusive “franchise” on leaks, rewarding friendly reporters, such as The New York Times’ David Sanger, with information on highly-classified programs, including the Stuxnet virus used against Iran. In fact, Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, upon reading Sanger’s book Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power, said, “You learn more from the book than I did as Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and that’s very disturbing to me.” In other words, US national security was a distant second, well behind the primary goal, which was the President’s re-election.

To be sure, the Obama Administration leaked for other reasons, as well. As Breitbart News’ Matthew Boyle reported, the Obama Justice Department was happy to leak documents to advance its own interests in the “Fast and Furious” scandal.

It is obvious that the Obama Administration will leak any information regardless of its sensitivity to national security or to individuals’ reputations when it is expedient for political gain. The facts are incontrovertible, over a broad range of issues, over a long period of time.

While the Obama administration has been playing this dangerous game, Roger Ailes has been clear and straightforward. The Ailes Manifesto is, indeed, fierce in its defense of freedom. As the Fox News founder–at the helm, now, for 17 years–wrote:

The administration’s attempt to intimidate Fox News and its employees will not succeed and their excuses will stand neither the test of law, the test of decency, nor the test of time. We will not allow a climate of press intimidation, unseen since the McCarthy era, to frighten any of us away from the truth.

Even amidst the greatest threat to press freedom in six decades, neither Fox, nor its friends and allies, are going to back away, or back down. The fight for freedom is a fight for all of us.

Indeed, as the Ailes Manifesto continues to reverberate through the media and political landscape, we can observe three kinds of reaction: first, strong awareness and support from the activist public; second, a surprising amount of solidarity from the other journalists and journalistic organizations; and third, a cringing U-turn by some notorious Obama administration lackeys and lapdogs.

So let’s look at each of these three categories in turn.

First, support from the activist public. Social media showed a huge outpouring of support for reporter Rosen and the Ailes letter. “Ailes’ letter give you a sense of him as a boss,” one Twitter user said. “Kind of man that inspires real loyalty out of respect.”

“Simply put, Roger Ailes, a true principled Leader,” said another. One response read, “The Roger Ailes memo might be the most badass thing I’ve ever read.”

Another reader remarked, “Roger Ailes sounds downright Churchillian.”

Second, others in the MSM have chosen to side with Fox, at least on this one issue. Urged on by press leaders–including Fox News’ Ed Henry, who said to fellow pressies, “let’s not be a bunch of lemmings”–many MSM-ers have chosen to do the right thing, even if it pains them. As Joel Pollak noted, stalwart liberal Alex Seitz-Wald of Salon.com was moved to tweet, “I understand lib cognitive dissonance on Obama admin going after Fox reporter, but only right answer is #TeamRosen.”

Fox News Opinion summed up much of this diverse media support in a May 23 compendium titled, “They All Stand with Fox News’ James Rosen.” The piece took note of supportive comments from staffers of CNN, The New Yorker, The Washington Post–even former anchor Keith Olbermann. Remarkably, the tabloid-y TMZ, not known for its political coverage, had to agree that the controversy, and the Ailes Manifesto, constituted a hot story.

On May 21, the White House Correspondents Association issued a strong statement:

Reporters should never be threatened with prosecution for the simple act of doing their jobs. The problem is that in two recent cases, one involving Fox News’ James Rosen and the other focused on the Associated Press, serious questions have been raised about whether our government has gotten far too aggressive in its monitoring of reporters’ movements, phone records, and even personal email.

Meanwhile, the support keeps coming. On Saturday, The Washington Post wrote a tough pro-Rosen editorial titled, “The freedom to ask,” in which the Post quoted the Justice Department’s own stated policy on leak investigations, which declares, “The prosecutorial power of the government should not be used in such a way that it impairs a reporter’s responsibility to cover as broadly as possible controversial public issues.” The Post then added, “The Obama administration should recommit to its spirit.”

Third, even some of Obama’s most groveling fans have had to adjust course in light of the new knowledge about his administration’s bullying methods. In fact, support for Ailes and Fox has been so broad and strong that even mortal enemies of Fox have had to come around, however grudgingly. For example, Media Matters for America (MMFA), the George Soros-funded anti-Fox smear operation run by David Brock, has been forced to do a 180 from its original pro-Obama position.

On May 14, as the news about the Justice Department investigations was breaking, MMFA slavishly published talking points in support for the Obama administration. In other words, the MMFA Obama-propaganda operation was trying to teach others how they, too, could be Obama-propagandists. Yet after a firestorm of criticism, MMFA shifted its position, albeit over ten long days.

On May 24, MMFA Senior Fellow and Andrew Breitbart bête noire Eric Boehlert, reflecting this new line, complained that “federal law enforcement seems preoccupied with snooping around, in increasingly clandestine ways, and ensnaring reporters in criminal investigations.” Well, yes; better late than never.

Boehlert continued in this manner, even allowing for the heretical thought that Fox News might not be at fault in everything:

Whether it was the Department of Justice’s wild overreach in seizing phone records of more than 20 separate telephone lines used by Associated Press editors and reporters, or the Department’s more focused, yet even more troubling, information grab of a Fox News reporter, the practice is wrong and shortsighted. It’s also un-American.

One can only imagine the drama inside MMFA before those anti-Obama Administration words were printed on its site. Which was more gut-wrenching for David Brock, criticizing the Obama Administration or defending Fox News from it?

Of course, as Pollak wrote, the pro-Ailes/pro-Fox sentiment, while welcome, is unlikely to last for long:

Now that Holder has been caught in a hacking scandal of his own–first of telephones at the Associated Press, then of Rosen and other Fox News journalists–the playing field is leveled. And even though the wider media solidarity with Fox News is doomed to be short-lived, from now on the White House will face bolder, fearless conservative media, confident in the knowledge that they are defending universal principles.

Still, Ailes and Fox have made their point, and it will be an enduring point. The impact of the strong Ailes Manifesto and the unyielding Fox stance may be felt only briefly among the MSM, but it will remembered forever in conservative, libertarian, and constitutionalist circles.

On this Memorial Day, these words of Ailes have it exactly right:

Too many Americans fought and died to protect our unique American right of press freedom. We can’t and we won’t forget that. To be an American journalist is not only a great responsibility, but also a great honor. To be a Fox journalist is a high honor, not a high crime.

And we here at Breitbart News might humbly add: it’s a high honor to be an American on the same side as Roger Ailes, James Rosen, and Fox News, in this historic fight for freedom. Together, we will win, because victory begets victory."

(CNN) —

Rep. Darrell Issa must be ruing his bad luck. The hearing he carefully orchestrated to pick at the scab of Benghazi was stepped on by the verdict in the Jodi Arias murder trial and by the story of three women held captive and brutalized for a decade in Cleveland. He was out-sensationalized and out-tawdried this week despite his own best efforts and those of his committee colleagues and staff members.

That is not to say that the tragic events that unfolded last year in Benghazi are not worthy of serious investigation. They just didn’t get them from Issa’s committee. As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in her passionate testimony in December, we need to know what went wrong to prevent future tragedies. That’s why she began an investigation immediately after the attacks. But Issa and his co-inquisitors were more interested in the arithmetic of 2016 presidential politics than with the events of last September 11 in Libya.

David Rothkopf

The testimony of Gregory Hicks, the former Libya deputy chief of mission, was striking and at times moving, and offered useful additional perspectives. He said he had suffered negative repercussions because he challenged the State Department line on what happened in Benghazi. But even while some of what he said was new and resonant, the Republicans on the committee weren’t listening. They focused less on learning what could have been done differently than on trying to establish that Clinton and her closest associates had tried to cover up the tragedy.

John King: Benghazi investigation both legitimate and partisan

On this point, very little was revealed that was either material or new. Hicks said a Clinton aide had been angry at him over how he conducted himself with investigators after the incident. He disputed the way the attack and its origins were depicted by senior officials on television. He deplored the losses that took place. But to say that any of this points at a cover-up “has all the elements of Pulitzer Prize-class fiction attached to it,” as former Ambassador Thomas Pickering, co-chairman of the committee that first investigated the attacks suggested.

That Clinton’s team might want to have a clear sense of how what was clearly a politically motivated congressional investigation was being conducted seems only logical and responsible. That the origins of the attack were framed as related to an inflammatory amateur video that appeared on the Internet has long ago been established as wrong and misguided.

That the losses were terrible and that U.S. diplomatic outposts in dangerous places need more security is absolutely true, and if they really cared about such things, Issa and his team would devote more of their attention to reaching consensus on how to find the funding needed to ensure that security is available

Nothing spoken of in the hearing suggested a cover-up by a Cabinet secretary, who instantly took personal responsibility for the attacks and swiftly appointed an independent commission led by two of the most distinguished, nonpartisan career civil servants in recent American history to investigate them. To say otherwise is more than a reach. It’s an effort by the Republican Party to damage the person most likely to be the next Democratic presidential candidate.

In the calculus of Washington today, Clinton is a bigger and more valuable target even than her former boss, the president. Having said that, it is almost certainly the case that the reason the initial focus in these hearings was not on the White House or elsewhere in the executive branch was that there was no evidence of a cover-up or of a politically spinning of the post-Benghazi message there either. Indeed, even Republican Sen. Bob Corker said that having reviewed all the evidence he felt there was nothing new to be revealed by these latest hearings.

No, this is just the latest example of the fine Washington art of promoting an enduring scandal out of not very much, demonstrating the ability of microphones in congressional hearings to turn scattered inconclusive facts and emotion into innuendo and blips in opinion polls. That the process also debases and, perversely, distracts from the very serious issues associated with protecting our diplomats and our interests overseas is hardly important, it seems, to the political attack dogs whose appetites are so insatiable that any nutrition-free scrap of half-truth looks like a meal.

Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.) was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison followed by three years probation by a federal judge in Washington on Wednesday for misusing about $750,000 in campaign funds.

Jackson's wife, Sandra, was also sentenced Wednesday. She will serve one year in prison and was ordered to pay $22,000 in restitution, after pleading guilty to a related charge of filing false tax returns. U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who is not related to the Jacksons, allowed the couple to stagger their sentences so their children would have at least one parent at all times. Jackson Jr. will go to prison first, followed by Sandra.

Jackson Jr. pleaded guilty in February to using campaign funds to purchase an array of personal items, including Bruce Lee memorabilia, a $43,000 Rolex watch and a mink cashmere cape.

Jackson, the son of the civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, made an emotional plea to the judge Wednesday, wiping his eyes and blowing his nose as he asked the judge for some leniency. He apologized to his constituents and his family.

""If probation is not available to her, give me her time,"" Jackson said, referring to his wife. He said he needed to be ""as far away from everybody for a while that I could be.""

Reid Weingarten, Jackson's defense attorney, asked for an 18-month sentence for his client and argued that there were ""not widows and orphans surrounding the courthouse"" wanting Jackson's head. Weingarten said that there was a time when members of Congress could treat their campaign funds as retirement accounts. ""This is not Madoff, this is not a ponzi scheme,"" Weingarten said.

But a federal prosecutor handling the case called Jackson's fraud one of the most significant abuses of the campaign system that has ever been documented and prosecuted. The government asked for four years in prison.

U.S. District Judge Jackson said the Jacksons used the campaign as a ""personal piggybank,"" but said she was confident that ""there will be another chapter"" for Jackson Jr. But the judge said that while Jackson did not pose a threat to society, a significant jail sentence was necessary to serve as a deterrent to other politicians who might consider raiding their campaign coffers for personal gain.

""The ethical standard has got to be simply higher than unindicted,"" Judge Jackson said. She said she would have trouble explaining a probation sentence to the donors whose campaigns funds the couple misused.

Judge Jackson said that the fact that the couple had two young children did not mean that Sandra Jackson could get off with just probation.

""It is not the court that put your children in this position,"" Judge Jackson said. ""It is not the government that put your children in this position,"" she added, calling the prison sentence ""survivable.""

Jackson Jr. will have to forfeit $750,000, but Judge Jackson ruled against a government request that the Chicago Democrat additionally pay $750,000 to the defunct campaign fund. The DOJ's request, Judge Jackson said, made no sense and served no purpose, calling the plan ""impractical and unworkable"" to create a ""new campaign from scratch"" without any clear goal.

“Jesse Jackson Jr.’s journey from the halls of Congress to federal prison is a tragedy of his own making,” U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Ronald Machen said in a statement. “Jackson’s political potential was unlimited, but he instead chose to treat his campaign account as a personal slush fund, stealing from the people who believed in him so he could live extravagantly. He squandered his great capacity for public service through outright theft. The prison sentence imposed today should serve as a wake-up call to other public officials who believe there are no consequences for betraying the public trust.”

Jackson Jr. made brief comments to reporters and cameras waiting outside the federal courthouse.

""I still believe in the power of forgiveness. I believe in the power of redemption. Today I manned up and tried to accept responsibility for the error of my ways, and I still believe in the resurrection,"" Jackson Jr. said before boarding an awaiting SUV.

But this morning, Sandy Rios did something that hit way below the belt even by AFR standards. On her daily morning show, Rios claimed that Hillary Clinton is lying about her recent health problems, including the blood clot found on her brain. As if that wasn't bad enough, she claimed the whole story was a plot straight out of Saul Alinsky's playbook. People for the American Way got a clip.



She’s out of the hospital, so they say, but did anybody see that yesterday? They saw pictures of her riding in the car, a camera caught her, she looked perfectly happy, laughing. Leaving the hospital but there had been no report that she had left the hospital and then suddenly the State Department issues a statement, ‘oh yes she’s out of the hospital.’ This has been a bizarre story to me. I would be lying if I said I wasn’t one of the skeptics, I am a skeptic, I’m a huge skeptic. Let me just give you the exaggerated claims here. The National Enquirer printed a story saying that Hillary Clinton is having a ‘brain cancer drama.’ And then of course we’ve had detailed reports of this blood clot that supposedly happened as a result of a fall which supposedly happened as a result of a terrible flu which that had caught. I read an article in the Washington Post just a couple of days ago where her two doctors, and I’m sorry I can do this because I’m a girl, they are both women and they have these very strong female names and I say to myself: you know what, I just, I’m sorry, I just—do you know that the doctors have refused to make statements? They have not been allowed to ask questions, it’s just been statements from the State Department reporting how dreadfully awful, terrible the disease, that Hillary Clinton has is. I think the point I want to make is that Hillary Clinton has a long history. Many of us remember what a liar she is. She sat at the feet of Saul Alinsky, she wrote her master’s thesis on how to do propaganda and lie; I see her finger prints on Benghazi, I see her finger prints on this illness. I have to say this is like the ‘Boy that Cried Wolf,’ when you lie that many times in your life, when you won’t testify in all of these scandals with your family, when you destroy women that your husband’s been involved in by lying about them, when you create this vast right-wing conspiracy, then who can believe you when you say you’re sick? I’m sorry, I’m not there.

Listen to the whole show here

Sick. Absolutely sick. Even for a network that actively promoted the smear that Christopher Stevens brought his beating on himself because he was supposedly an openly gay ambassador in a Muslim country, this is just disgusting. Can you imagine what would happen if someone from our side suggested a prominent conservative was faking an injury?

Tell Rios what you think of her idiocy on her Facebook."

The primary focus of the bill is Section 215 of FISA. This is the part of the law that provides the legal justification for the bulk collection of the telephone metadata of Americans, including phone numbers and the date and duration of calls (but not the content of those conversations). While the bill's language amends the statute to prevent the NSA from hoovering up phone metadata en masse, it provides gaping loopholes that could allow the agency to continue with its bulk collection practices as usual, such as if there's a ""reasonable articulable suspicion"" that an investigation is related to international terrorism. The legislation also makes it legal for the government to collect and search records that are three ""hops"" from a target who is suspected of terrorism—in other words, a suspect, all of that suspect's contacts, and all of their contacts. The bill makes only surface fixes and ""absolutely allows for the kind of collection that is already happening right now,"" according to Amie Stepanovich, the director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center's (EPIC) Domestic Surveillance Project.

The sweeping surveillance programs the NSA has used to spy on Americans outside the bounds of existing laws would be officially authorized under new legislation from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, passed out of the Intelligence committee last week. Feinstein calls this a ""reform,"" but what it would actually do is make legal all of the abuses uncovered by Edward Snowden's leaks, codifying the NSA's collection of all of our phone records—a massive setback for privacy rights.The legislation would also expand the NSA's surveillance powers, giving it new authority to tap the cell phones of non-Americans believed to be living outside of the U.S., but who enter the country. The NSA would have 72 hours to track these cell phones. It would also impose a 10-year prison sentence on any unauthorized person who accesses NSA information, a Snowden penalty, basically. Feinstein's bill has a few weak reforms, mostly dealing with the FISA court, allowing it to hear amicus briefs in certain cases (though it already does have that authority and has used it on some occasions) and authorizes a report from the Court to Congress about its decisions. That's not a release of decisions, but rather a report on decision.

This isn't reform. This is about as bad the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 which retroactively legalized warrantless wiretapping and gave all the telecomms who helped conduct it retroactive immunity. It's an attempt to sweep all of the abuses recently brought to light under the rug of legality. The icing on this Feinstein cake is that all of the committee meetings about this bill, indeed the committee meeting in which it was passed, were conducted in secret. Ironic for a bill that Feinstein says is intended to increase transparency in surveillance programs.

Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) has been working with Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI) on legislation also introduced last week that does include real reform. It would end the bulk collection of data, require the government obtain court orders before it could use the information collected on Americans, create transparency allowing communications providers to disclose information about the orders they've received from the NSA, make FISA court orders since 2003 public, and create a public advocate for the FISA Court. Feinstein has vowed to kill this actual reform legislation.

Ronald S. Calderon (D-Montebello).

Assistant U.S. Atty. Douglas M. Miller surfaced in the Calderon case Friday when he issued a letter at the request of Sen. Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles), who has been subpoenaed in the case, indicating that De Leon is not the target of the investigation.

“Please accept this letter as confirmation that, at this time, Kevin de Leon is viewed as a witness in this Office’s ongoing investigation,” said the letter from Miller and Assistant U.S. Atty. Mack Jenkins that was addressed to an attorney for De Leon..

The two prosecutors are part of the Public Corruption and Civil Rights Section of the U.S. Attorney’s office in Los Angeles.

“The assessment that he is a witness, as opposed to a subject or a target, is based on the information we have obtained to date,” the letter said. “Of course, this assessment could change in the event that new and different information regarding your client comes to our attention.”

De Leon requested the letter after his name appeared in a sealed FBI affidavit as someone Calderon tried to influence on legislation on worker’s compensation laws to benefit a man who had allegedly paid bribes to Calderon. The affidavit was released this week by Al Jazeera America, triggering a federal investigation into the leak of a sealed document.

Miller has had to deal with leaks before.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office last year decided against filing criminal charges against Armstrong after the cyclist’s attorneys alleged in court papers that government sources had leaked confidential grand jury information “with the transparent agenda of publicly smearing Armstrong and aggrandizing the government’s investigation.”

Miller also led the U.S. attorney’s 2004 probe into who leaked confidential grand jury testimony concerning former San Francisco Giants slugger Barry Bonds and other baseball players in the BALCO doping case. That investigation resulted in a private attorney being sentenced to prison for leaking the documents.

Reached by telephone Friday, Miller declined to discuss the Calderon case or his role in it.

Jay Carney, the occasionally charming spokesman for the newly charming president, began his daily media briefing Monday with a smile, a sunny disposition and a bit of percussion on the lectern. Bum-ba-da-bum-bum, he drummed with his hands.

“Happy Monday!” began Carney, wearing a festive yellow tie and striking a casual pose. “Good afternoon. Thanks for being here for your White House briefing. Spring is here early.”

But it was not long before the White House press secretary was back in his winter of discontent. The first questioner, the Associated Press’s Jim Kuhnhenn, asked Carney to square President Obama’s “charm offensive” with his decision to speak this week to the highly partisan Organizing for Action group.

“I think you’re misrepresenting the group,” Carney informed Kuhnhenn.

NPR’s Mara Liasson asked him a question about Obama’s yet-to-be-released budget. “Mara, the way you phrase that question, you know, makes me think that you’re still working on a typewriter or something,” Carney told the 57-year-old radio correspondent.

He further informed ABC News’s Ann Compton that she had a mistaken understanding of the president’s meetings this week with lawmakers. And when CBS’s Bill Plante pressed him on when Obama would release a budget (it was supposed to have been done last month), Carney leaned forward to argue.

“I challenge virtually every premise of your question,” he told Plante. “I don’t know what your question is here,” he said when Plante tried to ask it in a different way.

“Bill, how long have you been covering Washington?” Carney asked the 75-year-old newsman when he persisted in inquiring about the tardiness of the budget. “Has there ever been a presidential budget that was enacted, word for word, into law?”

NBC’s Chuck Todd broke in, telling Carney that a president never waits until after the House and the Senate introduce budgets to introduce his own.

“Well, I disagree with that,” Carney snapped.

This might be called putting the “offense” in charm offensive.

Here’s the early line from The Fix’s Chris Cillizza on the 2016 candidates, in no particular order. So, dear readers, if it’s not too early for you, here goes: Wait 1 second to continue.

It was a caution to those swept away by the notion that an entirely new and amiable Obama White House has suddenly emerged: Charm is hard.

The offensive began last week, when Obama took a dozen Republican senators to the Jefferson Hotel for a meal of blue crab risotto, lobster Thermidor, sea bass and the like. Next, he invited House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan to the White House for some more sea bass, accompanied by vegetable soup. This week, Obama is expected to pay three visits to Capitol Hill — a feat that ordinarily would take him months.

At the same time, White House reporters say they’ve noticed a softening in Obama advisers’ tone since Bob Woodward’s public spat with White House official Gene Sperling. The phone calls and e-mails from the president’s aides have become less confrontational and less vulgar, they say.

The charm offensive — both toward lawmakers and reporters — is a welcome development. Republicans who have been the targets of Obama’s attention report sincerity and warm feelings.

But the meals and the House (and Senate) calls don’t necessarily mean things will change in the capital. Obama may have had a nice lunch with Ryan last week, but on Monday, Carney blasted Ryan’s Medicare proposal anew. “This debate was had over the previous year and a half, and I think the American people were categorically opposed to the approach that says that we should voucherize Medicare,” he said.

Carney also vigorously defended Obama’s decision to speak to Organizing for Action, a group of former Obama staffers and donors using his reelection campaign’s infrastructure to pressure Republicans to support his agenda.

“I’m wondering whether there’s potentially a mixed message there,” the AP’s Kuhnhenn said to Carney, “because last week, OFA sent out an e-mail calling Republicans obstructionists, blaming them for the sequester, saying if only they had voted for closing tax loopholes, the public wouldn’t be in this jam.”

Carney smiled, charmingly. “Republicans made a choice,” he said. “The sequester is here, it’s being implemented as a result of the choice made on Capitol Hill by Republicans,” he added.

As for cooperating with Republicans, Carney argued that Obama’s agenda “is inherently bipartisan” — and that it was up to Republicans to sign on. “There’s nothing partisan about deficit reduction,” he said. “There’s nothing partisan about comprehensive immigration reform. . . . I would argue that there’s nothing partisan about common-sense solutions to reduce gun violence in America.”

If these claims weren’t strange enough, the moment was made more absurd by the ringing of a Japanese cameraman’s cellphone, which broadcast a loud message in Japanese that competed with Carney’s voice.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/05/21/white-house-timeline-irs-scandal-when-were-told-shifts/,2013-05-21 00:00:00,[],Ex-IRS chief heads to Hill as Carney says White House senior staff told of probe findings,"Lawmakers will get their first opportunity to question the man who ran the IRS when agents were improperly targeting tea party groups Tuesday, as the timeline for when senior White House officials knew about the scandal seems to be shifting.

The lawmakers are expected to ask former IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman why he didn't tell Congress that agents had been singling out conservative political groups for additional scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status -- even after he was briefed on the matter.

Shulman, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, left the IRS in November when his five-year term ended. He is testifying before the Senate Finance Committee, which has launched a bipartisan investigation into the matter.

The hearing comes after White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday that the president’s counsel was told on April 24 about the preliminary findings of an IRS audit that showed tax officials unfairly targeted Tea Party groups applying for tax-exempt status.

Carney had previously said that White House counsel did not have any details about the IRS probe and was given a generic heads up that one was being conducted.

More On This...

Senior legal counsel Kathryn Ruemmler was told about the audit on April 24, Carney said Monday. She then told Denis McDonough, Obama’s chief of staff and other senior officials about the investigation.

“It was the judgment of counsel this is not a matter she should convey to the president,” Carney said. “Her opinion that this is not the kind of thing that requires notification to the president.”

“No one in this building intervened in an independent investigation or anything that could be seen that way,” he said, adding that the misconduct had stopped in 2012, “almost a year before we knew about it.”

Carney also said while Ruemmler knew the subject of the investigation and potential findings, they were not given a draft of the report and understood details could change.

Ahead of the hearing, the committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., and Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, the ranking Republican, sent a letter to the IRS Monday, asking for an explanation. The letter included 41 separate requests for information. They gave the IRS until May 31 to respond.

The two senators said the IRS had not been forthcoming about the issue in the past.

""Targeting applicants for tax-exempt status using political labels threatens to undermine the public's trust in the IRS,"" Baucus and Hatch wrote. ""Lack of candor in advising the Senate of this practice is equally troubling.""

For more than a year, from 2011 through the 2012 election, members of Congress repeatedly asked Shulman about complaints from tea party groups that they were being harassed by the IRS.

Shulman's responses, usually relayed by a deputy, did not acknowledge that agents had ever targeted tea party groups for special scrutiny. At a congressional hearing March 22, 2012, Shulman was adamant in his denials.

""There's absolutely no targeting. This is the kind of back and forth that happens to people"" who apply for tax-exempt status, Shulman said at the House Ways and Means subcommittee hearing.

The IRS has said Shulman did not know about the targeting at the time of the hearing.

The agency's inspector general says he told Shulman on May 30, 2012, that his office was auditing the way applications for tax-exempt status were being handled, in part because of complaints from conservative groups. However, the inspector general, J. Russell George, said he did not reveal the results of his investigation.

George was also testifying at Tuesday's hearing. So was Steven Miller, who took over as acting commissioner in November, when Shulman's term expired. Last week, Obama forced Miller to resign.

George issued a report last week blaming ineffective management for allowing agents to inappropriately target conservative groups for more than 18 months during the 2010 and 2012 elections.

The agents were trying to determine whether the groups were engaged in political activity. Certain tax-exempt groups are allowed to engage in politics, but politics cannot be their primary mission. It is up to the IRS to make the determination, so agents are supposed to look for clues when reviewing applications for tax-exempt status.

In March 2010, agents starting singling out groups with ""Tea Party"" or ""Patriots"" on their applications. By August 2010, it was part of the written criteria for identifying groups that required more scrutiny, according to George's report.

Agents did not flag similar progressive or liberal labels, though some liberal groups received additional scrutiny because their applications were singled out for other reasons, the report said.

The apology that launched the IRS scandal into the news came in response to a planted question

IRS disclosed the Tea Party targeting to lawyers group after denying it to Congress

Members of Congress criticize the strategy as a %22scheme%22 and %22manipulation%22

WASHINGTON — It was an unusual way to deliver bad news, even in a town known for its selective leaks, Friday-night news dumps and wag-the-dog distractions.

The Internal Revenue Service, apparently determined to get out ahead of an inspector general report critical of its handling of tax exemptions for Tea Party groups, came up with a plan: Lois Lerner, the official responsible for the tax-exempt division, would publicly apologize in response to a question at the American Bar Association conference in Washington.

Details of the now-infamous planted question emerged Friday after acting IRS commissioner Steven Miller admitted the gambit under questioning from members of the House Ways and Means Committee.

It was the day after Lerner had testified to Congress last week, failing once again to disclose the extent of the Tea Party targeting even under direct questioning. The damning inspector general report would come out any day, and Lerner and Miller wanted to figure out a way to disclose the news publicly.

Miller testified about the thought process behind the release strategy Friday. ""Now that the (inspector general) report was finalized, now that we knew all the facts, now that we had responded in writing and everything was done, did it make sense for us to start talking about this in public,"" he said.

The plan, he said, was to simultaneously notify Congress, but that never happened.

After talking to Miller, Lerner called Celia Roady, a Washington tax lawyer whose office is immediately across Pennsylvania Avenue from the IRS headquarters. She also serves on the IRS Advisory Committee on Tax-Exempt and Government Entities.

Roady released this written statement late Friday explaining her role:

""On May 9, I received a call from Lois Lerner, who told me that she wanted to address an issue after her prepared remarks at the ABA Tax Section's Exempt Organizations Committee Meeting, and asked if I would pose a question to her after her remarks. I agreed to do so, and she then gave me the question that I asked at the meeting the next day. We had no discussion thereafter on the topic of the question, nor had we spoken about any of this before I received her call. She did not tell me, and I did not know, how she would answer the question.""

And so that's how it happened. Within minutes, the Associated Press reported her remarks with a one-line news alert: ""WASHINGTON (AP) — IRS apologizes for inappropriately targeting conservative political groups in 2012 election.""

In a conference call with reporters later that day, Lerner emphasized that her apology came in response to a question.

""I was asked a question at the ABA meeting to give a status update of things that have been in the press"" about the agency's treatment of Tea Party groups, she said. Asked why the IRS chose to make an apology that day, she said, ""Someone asked me a question today, so I answered it.""

Members of Congress in both parties criticized what they called a ""scheme"" and a ""manipulation.""

""I find it incredibly ironic. You know, on the one hand, you're arguing today that the IRS is not corrupt. But the subtext of that is you're saying, 'Look, we're just incompetent,' "" said an exasperated Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill., after one line of questioning on Roady's involvement.

Communications professionals said it was a puzzling move that backfired and alienated members of Congress.

""It violates the golden rule of political crisis management — disclosing critical facts early,"" said Nu Wexler, a former Democratic Hill staffer and vice president of Rasky Baerlein Strategic Communications.

Lerner ""had an opportunity to explain the full story in the May 8th hearing, and she passed. Members of Congress don't like being misled, and that's why two key House Democrats are now calling for her resignation,"" Wexler said.

Wendy Davis has been asked mostly softball questions by the national media. When David Gregory did give her one tough question on Meet the Press she gave an answer which could be used to undercut her own position.

John McCormack at the Weekly Standard pointed out that the media fawning over State Sen. Wendy Davis has produced more questions about her shoes than challenging her stance on abortion. That’s not an exaggeration. This Week reporter Jeff Zelezny asked 6 questions, two of which were about Davis’ footwear. To his credit, David Gregory did ask Davis one question that no other reporter has:

David Gregory: Senator, do you think a 20-week ban on abortion is acceptable? Do you think it’s reasonable? Sen. Davis: Right now that ban of course is being talked about because of the idea of fetal pain and at the constitutional level what we of course have assured is that women have the ability to make these reproductive decisions up to the point of viability. That has to remain the key question here. And of course when we’re talking about that particular issue there are very, very few. It’s used more as an emotional trigger point as part of the argument but remember it’s a huge omnibus bill that involves many other aspects to it that are setting Texas back in time.

The first part of Davis’ answer is coherent but invites an obvious follow up question. Should we consider fetal pain if there is evidence it begins earlier than viability? But then Davis undercuts her own argument when she says “there are very, very few.” If that’s so then the portion of SB5 which bans abortions after 20 weeks won’t have much impact.

As for it being an “emotional trigger point” keep in mind that the pro-abortion lobby routinely refers to the equally rare instances of rape and incest as reasons we need to keep abortion legal. NARAL and Planned Parenthood are no strangers to using emotional trigger arguments. A neutral observer might point this out.

As for the remainder of the “huge omnibus bill” one of the main features requires abortion clinics to meet the standards of ambulatory surgical facilities. This is the same determination that was reached in Pennsylvania, Virginia and other states in the wake of the Gosnell trial. As I pointed out here, the grand jury in the Gosnell case explicitly recommended that abortion facilities be regulated as ASFs, noting that failure to do so likely contributed to Karnamaya Mongar’s death.

“To say that the president hates Fox News may be an understatement,” writes Newsmax in a book review of Roger Ailes: Off Camera by Zev Chafets. “Early in his first term Obama actually sought to ban Fox News from the White House press corps, ripping away its press credential.”

Chafets, who received unprecedented access to Ailes and his Fox News inner circle, recounts an intense private 2008 meeting at New York’s Waldorf Astoria Hotel between News Corporation Chairman and CEO Rupert Murdoch, Barack Obama, and Roger Ailes. When Ailes asked Obama about his stated support for unilateral arms reductions, Ailes says Obama looked him square in the eye and denied ever taking such a position.

“He said this looking me right in the eyes. He never dropped his gaze, which is the usual tell. It was as good a lie as anyone ever told me,” said Ailes.

The Newsmax book review says the Ailes biography contains several “surprising revelations,” including:

How Glenn Beck’s exposé on Van Jones led to the White House efforts to ban Fox News;

Obama’s surprising remark at a White House Christmas party, telling Ailes that he was “the most powerful man in the world;”

The truth about the George Soros-backed efforts to torpedo the “two Great Satans” — Roger Ailes and Rush Limbaugh;

Why Beck really left Fox News to start his own network;

Fox and Hollywood: the funny account by Ailes of the time he went to dinner with Al Pacino and Shirley MacLaine;

Ailes’ role in saving Ronald Reagan after his disastrous debate performance against Walter Mondale;

O’Reilly wars: the inside story of how Fox dealt with MSNBC’s Keith Olbermann and why, to this day, Bill O’Reilly hates his liberal critics at NBC

Newsmax is not alone in its praiseworthy book review; Rush Limbaugh said the biography is “great because Ailes opened up to Zev like he hasn’t opened up to anybody else.” Limbaugh encouraged readers who are tired of progressive caricatures of Fox News to “get Roger Ailes: Off Camera.”"

In remarks made on Tuesday night at a fundraiser for Massachusetts Senate candidate Ed Markey in front of an audience of donating (doting?) Democrats, Biden went for the jugular. In a reference to Al Gore, who introduced Biden at the Washington, D.C., event, Biden said, ""This man was elected president of the United States of America,"" according to the pool report. ""But for the good of the nation, when the bad decision, in my view, was made, he did the right thing for the nation,"" Biden continued.

“Al, you set an example for this country that is going to live as long as recorded history, about the man who won by a decision that I think constitutional scholars now and in the future will conclude was an ill-fated decision,” Biden said. “The way you stepped up, it was amazing.”

Biden was just getting warmed up:This is pretty amazing stuff coming from a sitting Vice-President--to take a hammer to the very legitimacy of the prior Administration. Don't think we've ever seen anything quite like that before. Of course, it also helps when it happens to be true.

Nor did the Biden stop there. He characterized the divide between Democrats and the modern Republicans, once merely differentiated by competing principles, as akin now to an unbridgeable abyss.



It’s a pretty simple proposition: The United States of America, and the state of Massachusetts, does not need another Republican in the Senate,” Biden said, also according to the pool report. “I’m being straight about this. This is not your father’s Republican Party. It really is a fundamentally different party. There’s never been as much distance, at least since I’ve been alive, distance between where the mainstream of the Republican congressional party is and the Democratic Party is. It’s a chasm. It’s a gigantic chasm.





[T]he last thing in the world we need now is someone who will go down to the United States Senate and support [Texas freshman Sen.] Ted Cruz, support the new senator from Kentucky—or the old senator from Kentucky,"" Biden said, referring to freshman Sen. Rand Paul and veteran Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. “Think about this,” he said. “Have you ever seen a time when two freshman senators are able to cower the bulk of the Republican Party in the Senate? That is not hyperbole.”

And still more of the knife did the Biden twist:Yow!"

Gen. Kamala Harris as “by far the best-looking attorney general in the country” at a public appearance has divided even some of his strongest supporters.

Some found the comment sexist, others harmless.

On Friday, the president apologized for the remark. “He called her to apologize for the distraction created by his comments,” spokesman Jay Carney told reporters.

The president “did not want in any way to diminish the attorney general’s professional accomplishments and her capabilities. He fully recognizes the challenges women continue to face in the workplace and that they should not be judged based on appearance,” Carney added.

Harris has not commented. But, according to the Times’ PolitiCal blog, her communications director, Gil Duran, issued a statement saying “the attorney general and the president have been friends for many years. They had a great conversation yesterday and she strongly supports him.”

Willie Brown, the former head of the California Assembly, said critics are wrongly jumping on the comment.

“They can’t criticize him for budget, they can’t criticize him for taxes on the rich, they can’t criticize him for medical care, they got to say something,” he told CBS News.

Liberal columnist Joan Walsh said her “stomach turned” when she heard the remark.

“I doubt Obama knew any of the lurid history of Harris’s opponents smear attempts,” she wrote. “I assume he thought he was just paying someone he admires a compliment. But most women in public life have a complex relationship with their appearance, whether they’re as attractive as Harris or not.”

The Times’ Robin Abcarian weighed in on the controversy Thursday, saying: “Does merely stating the obvious make the president sexist? More wolfish than sexist, I’d say. And this may be a little problem he needs to work on .... Obama got into some hot water a while back when he addressed a reporter as ‘sweetie.’ That was obnoxious, and demeaning, and Obama rightfully apologized. In 2008, he told Hillary Clinton she was ‘likable enough’ during one of the primary debates, which turned off God knows how many women, who heard the smug judgment of an arrogant upstart.’ ”

The controversy began Thursday when Obama was at a California fundraiser. Here are the remarks:

“You have to be careful to, first of all, say she is brilliant and she is dedicated and she is tough, and she is exactly what you’d want in anybody who is administering the law, and making sure that everybody is getting a fair shake.

“She also happens to be by far the best-looking attorney general in the country -- Kamala Harris is here. [Applause.] It’s true. Come on. [Laughter] And she is a great friend and has just been a great supporter for many, many years.”

But as with many storms, the residual damage is proving to be distinctly uneven.

Consider the cases of Susan E. Rice and Victoria Nuland, two high-ranking diplomats whose internal roles were put on display when the White House released e-mails this month documenting how the administration drafted its official talking points about the attacks, which killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.

Ms. Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations and the favorite to be President Obama’s next national security adviser, continues to be criticized by Senate Republicans for going on Sunday news programs a few days after the attacks to deliver the talking points, which later proved to be inaccurate. But the e-mails reinforced her lack of involvement in the drafting process.

Ms. Nuland, a former State Department spokeswoman nominated by Mr. Obama to be an assistant secretary of state, was backed by some of the same Republicans, even though the e-mails show she pushed to edit the talking points — a process critics say was calculated to airbrush the White House’s account of the attacks for political reasons."

The question is, will the media once again cave to the wishes of their beloved Obama administration or do their jobs and demand a full accounting from an out-of-control Justice Department on a chilling rampage to intimidate journalists and their sources?

Yesterday, the Daily Beast embarrassed itself with a Holder profile so glowing and so obviously aimed at tamping down the media’s frustration with him, that even BuzzFeed’s left-wing Ben Smith raised his eyebrows over it on “Morning Joe” Wednesday.

We also learned Wednesday that Holder has already set up meetings with various representatives from a number of print and television organizations to discuss how the DOJ will handle leak investigations in the future.

During his Congressional testimony two weeks ago, Holder didn’t seem at all contrite during questioning about his department’s role in the seizure of phone records from the Associated Press. In fact, the Attorney General came off as cocky, bored, and peevish.

Holder also didn’t even seem terribly fazed after it was discovered that he was the one who signed an application for a warrant to seize the private emails and phone records of Fox News reporter James Rosen.

What has come out since, though, has obviously knocked the smug out of him. The House Judiciary Committee is now investigating Holder’s statements during his recent testimony. It seems that Holder’s statement about never hearing or having anything to do with attempting to prosecute a journalist or reporter doesn’t quite reconcile with an application that accused Rosen of espionage. A perjury charge could be forthcoming.

What has to worry Holder the most, though, is that the revelations surrounding the Justice Department’s hysterical actions toward Fox News have not elicited the kind of reaction from the mainstream media that Holder likely expected. The media hates Fox News almost as much as the Obama administration does, but only almost.

Rather than let their political hatred and envy of Fox News’s success turn into a Get Out of Jail Free card for Holder, the media has instead rallied around Fox. This means that once Congress is back in session next and the hearings into the Justice Department begin, the press coverage could be very bad for an Attorney General who up till now has been zealously protected by the media in scandal after scandal.

The Huffington Post has already called for Holder to be fired. If the rest of the mainstream media jumps on board, Holder is toast and Holder knows this. More importantly, so does Obama. In short, Holder’s fate and legacy will be decided by how the media collective chooses to cover this scandal in the coming weeks.

So starting as early as Thursday, Holder is going to attempt to charm and convince the media to ignore their duty, circle the wagons, and play goalie for him just one more time.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/08/18/The-Clintons-Legacy-of-Lies,2013-08-18 00:00:00,['Joel B. Pollak'],The Clintons' Legacy of Lies,"It is difficult to explain to Americans, particularly young Americans, what was wrong with the Clinton era, and why we ought not want to re-live it. The 1990s are sealed into our national memory as a time of great prosperity and expectation–killed off, in Democrats’ rewriting of history, by the 2000 recount and all that followed.

The truth is that by 2000, Democrats could not run away from Clinton quickly enough. It’s worth revisiting why.

By 2000, President Bill Clinton had survived the scandal that led to his impeachment, but the dot-com bubble had burst and the country had plunged into recession.

(It never really recovered. A college friend and I recently observed that the career trajectories of our friends were deeply affected by whether they graduated in 1998, at the height of the boom, or 1999, just before the crash, and with little time to gain real work experience.)

The political right, frustrated by the perceived failure of the 1994 revolution, decided to adopt its own version of Clinton’s “third way” politics by embracing George W. Bush and his “compassionate conservatism.” But on the left, those who resented Clinton’s market-oriented, free-trade policies finally gained the upper hand, shutting down the Seattle World Trade Organization talks in 1999, inaugurating the anti-globalization movement.

Things were unraveling overseas, as well. The Oslo Peace Process, which Clinton had pushed, and which promised a “new Middle East,” collapsed, and a new wave of terror began.

Just days later, the U.S.S. Cole was attacked by Al Qaeda, the follow-up to the embassy bombings of two years before, and a sign that Clinton’s cruise-missile, light-footprint response to those attacks had encouraged rather than placated the enemy.

The party was over. And Americans were tired of it.

Culturally, for instance, it was a time of stagnation. The Clinton era was a time of classic-rock revival and derivative hip-hop, each mining the past for inspiration as major stars died out. Grunge and alternative rose and fell in an arc of self-loathing. Across the arts, nostalgia for more meaningful times–what Harvard critic Philip Fisher mocked as “nightmare envy”–was a dominant theme.

Beneath the surface of Clinton-era complacency also lay the roots of future crises. The president reauthorized the Community Reinvestment Act in 1999, for example, pushing big banks into subprime lending and setting the stage for the 2007-8 housing crisis.

At the same time, Clinton cronies like Jack Lew and Rahm Emanuel seized the opportunity of deregulation for self-enrichment at the country’s decrepit “too big to fail” banks.

It was Bill Clinton’s lies about his personal life that led to his impeachment; it was his manipulation and broken promises that led to public disenchantment. And that came at the worst possible time.

A newly-globalized world, under attack by the far-left, the Islamists, and thinly-disguised nationalists, needed an effective leader to guide it through turbulent times, to affirm the value of freedom despite the great risks involved.

But Clinton had undermined himself, and his collapse left no political successors. His “New Democrats,” who once sought to move the party beyond old labor alliances and leftist dogmas, withered and faded.

Worse, Clinton abandoned his own achievements. Later, when President Obama gutted welfare reform’s work requirements, Clinton refused to criticize him, collaborating in the death of his own legacy–all for the sake of 2016.

Democrats forget all of that now, and the “Clinton fatigue” of 1999-2000. But what they still remembered about the Clintons in 2008 was their dishonesty.

To moderates, that was a virtue: when Hillary mouthed the new left-wing rhetoric of her party, they knew she was saying what she thought would win primary voters.

But to others, it was a fatal flaw. They preferred Barack Obama’s apparent left-wing authenticity (though Bill Clinton warned it was a “fairy tale”).

Hillary Clinton has all of the fakery, and none of the charm, of her husband. From her comical pandering to the black community, to her cover-ups at the State Department, she has done little of substance to redeem her duplicity.

After Obama’s many failures, Americans may be content to embrace someone they never trusted anyway. But those lies do make a “difference,” and opponents ought to remind Americans of that, constantly."

Mr. Filner is the first Democrat elected mayor here in 20 years, and he has championed liberal positions in dealing with labor, the environment and civil rights issues.

“I am devastated,” said Lorena Gonzalez, a state assemblywoman who was secretary-treasurer of the San Diego labor council that pumped close to $2 million into his race. “Until this happened last week, I would have told you we have the most progressive big-city mayor in America. We worked incredibly hard.”

Ms. Gonzalez, after initially saying the decision on whether the mayor should quit should be left to the women affected, changed her mind after talking to two more women who she said worked in his office and described in chilling detail advances, including linking job advancement to sexual favors.

“Before that I had heard about his boorish behavior, generational behavior,” she said. “Inappropriate. But I had not heard anything to make me think he was unfit to be mayor.”

Mr. Filner did not respond to a request for an interview.

The episode threatens to further taint the history of a city that is no stranger to scandal. Richard M. Murphy, a Republican mayor, was forced out of office in 2005 in the midst of a pension-underfunding crisis that led San Diego to earn the nickname Enron-by-the-Sea.

Mr. Filner is finding little support among Democrats as he tries to hold his ground here. Several Democrats, even while applauding his politics, said the dearth of support was testimony to the reputation of a man known for bringing his abrasive manner from Washington, where he was charged with assault and battery of an airline employee after he tried to force his way into a secure area of Dulles airport to grab his bag, here to San Diego. (He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in the airport incident.)

“Mayor Filner has lost the confidence of San Diegans to lead,” said Representative Susan A. Davis, a Democrat from San Diego. “He has taken advantage of the trust the voters placed in him and lost both the promise and capacity to ignite positive change. His behavior, if not illegal, is reprehensible.”"

If Congress wasn’t broken before, it certainly is now. What Reid (Nev.) and his fellow Democrats effectively did was take the chamber of Congress that still functioned at a modest level and turn it into a clone of the other chamber, which functions not at all. They turned the Senate into the House.

Democrats were fully justified in stripping Republicans of their right to filibuster President Obama’s nominees — yet they will come to deeply regret what they have done.

Certainly, Republicans have abused the dilatory tactics that Senate minorities have, for centuries, used with greater responsibility; they seem intent on bringing government to a halt. And the Senate in 2013 is hardly a healthy institution. Yet it has achieved far more than the House — passing bipartisan immigration legislation and a farm bill and working out deals to avoid default and to end the federal government shutdown — largely because, until Thursday, Senate rules required the majority party to win votes from the minority.

Here’s what then-Sen. Joe Biden said in 2005 when a Republican Senate majority threatened to use a similar “nuclear option” to allow a simple majority to carry the day:

In fact, that wasn’t the case. Thousands who had bought insurance have been receiving cancellations notices from insurers. The president said he wasn’t aware his promise before the rollout would result in cancellations, and Obama had repeatedly stated that, although new health-care insurance would be available through the Affordable Care Act, those willing to stay on their plan would be able to do so.In fact, that wasn’t the case. Thousands who had bought insurance have been receiving cancellations notices from insurers. The president said he wasn’t aware his promise before the rollout would result in cancellations, and has apologized for his assurances ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images Wait 1 second to continue.

“The nuclear option abandons America’s sense of fair play . . . tilting the playing field on the side of those who control and own the field. I say to my friends on the Republican side: You may own the field right now, but you won’t own it forever. I pray God when the Democrats take back control, we don’t make the kind of naked power grab you are doing.”

Sen. Carl Levin (Mich.), one of just three Democrats who opposed his colleagues’ naked power grab, read those words on the Senate floor Thursday after Reid invoked the nuclear option. The rumpled Levin is not known for his oratory. But he is retiring next year and free to speak his mind — and his words were potent.

“We need to change the rules, but to change it in the way we changed it today means there are no rules except as the majority wants them,” Levin said. “This precedent is going to be used, I fear, to change the rules on consideration of legislation, and down the road — we don’t know how far down the road; we never know that in a democracy — but, down the road, the hard-won protections and benefits for our people’s health and welfare will be lost.”

The word “historic” is often tossed around in Washington, but this change ends a tradition dating to the earliest days of the republic. For the nation’s first 118 years, there were no limits on debate in the Senate. After 1917, cutting off debate, or reaching “cloture,” required a two-thirds majority. In 1975, that threshold was reduced to 60 of 100 votes. Even that lower minimum required lawmakers to cooperate with each other.

“Cloture has fostered more bipartisanship in the Senate,” Donald Ritchie, the Senate historian, told me Thursday after Reid detonated his nuclear device. “The majority leader of the Senate is expected to try to work out some kind of a bipartisan deal to get enough votes to get cloture. Because the House is run by majority rule, it is seen as a sign of weakness if the majority leadership of the House has to get votes from the minority side.”

Now the Senate will be just as dysfunctional.

Reid was right that Republican obstruction has been intolerable; half of the 168 filibusters of executive and judicial nominations in the nation’s history, he noted, have come during the Obama presidency.

But Reid’s remedy — calling a simple- majority vote to undo more than two centuries of custom — has created a situation in which the minority leader, Mitch McConnell (Ky.), is expected to use the minority’s remaining powers to gum up the works, and to get revenge when Republicans regain the majority.

“If a Senate majority demonstrates it can make such a change once, there are no rules which binds a majority, and all future majorities will feel free to exercise the same power, not just on judges and executive appointments but on legislation,” Levin said Thursday. Quoting one of the Senate’s giants, Arthur Vandenberg, Levin said his fellow Democrats had sacrificed “vital principle for the sake of momentary convenience.”

If it was possible to make things even worse in Washington, Reid just did it.

I was covering Iran-Contra during the Reagan administration when [Peggy Noonan] was working for that president, in which we were funding a war illegally. We were trying to make a deal with the Iranians at the time. That was a pretty big damn scandal.

Brokaw seems to be employing a tactic common among has-been journalists these days. They seem to be afraid that any story seen as “bigger” than the stories they covered in their day somehow diminishes their life work, and therefore any suggestion to this effect must be smacked down immediately.

So, in Brokaw’s opinion:

The Department of Justice obtaining secret subpoenas naming reporters as an aider, abetter and co-conspirator and confiscating thousands of reporters’ phone records is not as serious as Abu Ghraib.

The President’s inaction as our consulate was under attack in Libya, resulting in the death of four Americans at the hands of terrorists, and the Administration’s efforts to mislead the press and American people during a presidential campaign doesn’t rise to the level of Abu Ghraib.

The IRS using their power and intimidation tactics to discriminate against groups and individuals because of their political beliefs is not as significant as Abu Ghraib

Brokaw explained his rationale for making Abu Ghraib the be all and end all of presidential scandals: “Abu Ghraib was a big scandal and how it – no one was really held accountable for it.”

If accountability (or lack thereof) is the new standard for scandals, then Brokaw needs to re-calibrate his memory of Abu Ghraib and the comparison to the Obama scandals. Eleven soldiers were convicted of various charges relating to the Abu Ghraib incident. Meanwhile, every single government employee involved with Benghazi, the IRS, HHS fundraising, AP subpoenas and the Fox News/James Rosen subpoenas continues to cash their paychecks and are in line for full government pensions.

http://news.yahoo.com/dhs-freed-over-2-000-immigrants-since-february-085455718.html,,[],"DHS freed over 2,000 immigrants since February.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Homeland Security Department released from its jails more than 2,000 illegal immigrants facing deportation in recent weeks due to looming budget cuts and planned to release 3,000 more during March, The Associated Press has learned.

The newly disclosed figures, cited in internal budget documents reviewed by the AP, are significantly higher than the ""few hundred"" illegal immigrants the Obama administration acknowledged this week had been released under the budget-savings process.

The government documents show that Immigrations and Customs Enforcement released roughly 1,000 illegal immigrants from its jails around the U.S. each week since at least Feb. 15. The agency's field offices have reported more than 2,000 immigrants released before intense criticism this week led to a temporary shutdown of the plan, according to the documents.

The states where immigrants were released include Arizona, California, Georgia and Texas.

The White House has said it was not consulted about the releases, and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has acknowledged they occurred in a manner she regrets.

White House spokesman Jay Carney on Wednesday said the government had released ""a few hundred"" of the roughly 30,000 illegal immigrants held in federal detention pending deportation proceedings. Carney said the immigrants released were ""low-risk, noncriminal detainees,"" and the decision was made by career ICE officials.

As of last week, the agency held an average daily population of 30,733 in its jails. The internal budget documents reviewed by the AP show the Obama administration had intended to reduce those figures to 25,748 by March 31.

The White House did not comment immediately Friday on the higher number of immigrants released.

ICE spokesman Brian Hale said Friday the numbers of immigration detainees fluctuate daily, but he reiterated only several hundred illegal immigrants had been released. ""Beyond that normal movement, and as fiscal uncertainty remains over the continuing resolution and possible sequestration, ICE reviewed its detained population to ensure detention levels stay within ICE's current budget and placed several hundred individuals on methods of supervision less costly than detention,"" Hale said in a statement. ""At this point, we don't anticipate additional releases, but that could change.""

Story continues

The immigrants who were released still eventually face deportation and are required to appear for upcoming court hearings. But they are no longer confined in immigration jails, where advocacy experts say they cost about $164 per day per person. Immigrants who are granted supervised release — with conditions that can include mandatory check-ins, home visits and GPS devices — cost the government from 30 cents to $14 a day, according to the National Immigration Forum, a group that advocates on behalf of immigrants.

The release of thousands from immigration jails is consistent with Napolitano's early warnings on Monday — hours before anyone knew publicly that any illegal immigrants had been released — that the pending, automatic budget cuts known as the sequester would limit the government's ability to maintain enough detention center beds for at least 34,000 immigrants.

""We're doing our very best to minimize the impacts of sequester, but there's only so much I can do,"" Napolitano said Monday. ""You know, I'm supposed to have 34,000 detention beds for immigration. How do I pay for those?""

Late Thursday, after intense criticism over what the administration acknowledged was the release this week of several hundred immigrants, Napolitano told ABC News that she had been surprised to learn about the action.

""Detainee populations and how that is managed back and forth is really handled by career officials in the field,"" Napolitano told ABC. ""Do I wish that this all hadn't been done all of a sudden and so that people weren't surprised by it? Of course.""

The announcement that a few hundred illegal immigrants were being released was among the most significant and direct implications described so far by the automatic budget cuts. Republicans in Congress quickly criticized the decision and pressed the Homeland Security Department for details, including the number of illegal immigrants released and the nature of any criminal charges they were facing as part of the deportation process.

""Simply blaming budget reductions as a means to turn a blind eye toward the national security of the American people is a dangerous plan, and one that calls into question the department's preparations for sequestration,"" wrote two Republican lawmakers, Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa and Rep. Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.

Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., who sits on the Senate panel that oversees the Department of Homeland Security, harshly criticized the administration for downplaying the number of immigrants released, adding the revelation ""makes it less and less possible for lawmakers to have productive negotiations with the White House over a comprehensive immigration bill.""

The senior Homeland Security Department official in charge of arresting and deporting illegal immigrants announced his retirement to his staff on Tuesday, the same day the administration first openly confirmed the release of what it called several hundred immigrants. The executive associate director over ICE enforcement and removal operations, Gary Mead, told his staff he was leaving his job with mixed emotions. A career law enforcement officer, Mead will leave at the end of April.

After AP reported on Mead's retirement, ICE spokeswoman Gillian Christensen said his decision was not related to criticism over the jail releases and said Mead had notified the agency's senior leaders ""several weeks ago"" that he intended to leave. She also called AP's reporting about Mead's departure ""inaccurate and misleading."" On Thursday, ICE corrected her statement to say that Mead has notified his bosses ""more than a week ago,"" not several weeks ago.

The later government statement also criticized AP's reporting as ""ill-informed, inaccurate information"" and complained that AP had failed to contact the agency before publishing what it called a ""misguided headline,"" although the AP had noted its unsuccessful efforts to contact Mead directly by telephone and email.

prev Image 2 of 2

A man who stood close to President Barack Obama and other heads of state while providing sign language interpretation at Nelson Mandela’s memorial Tuesday was a “fake” who was making up his own gestures, sign language experts say, raising questions about the security at the event.

""[He] was moving his hands around, but there was no meaning in what he used his hands for,"" Bruno Druchen, the Deaf Federation of South Africa’s national director, told The Associated Press Wednesday.

The country’s deaf community and the ruling African National Congress have no knowledge of who the man actually is, despite him appearing on television gesticulating alongside South African President Jacob Zuma last year, Reuters reported. Zuma’s office is trying to figure out the man's identity.

""I don't know this guy. He doesn't work for the ANC. It was a government event. Ask them,"" ANC spokesman Jackson Mthembu said.

U.S. Secret Service Spokesman Brian Leary told FoxNews.com on Wednesday that the department is aware of the matter, but declined to elaborate.

More On This...

White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest said during a press briefing that he wasn't aware of any security concerns with the man being near Obama.

""I think my only reaction to that is that it's a shame that you had a service that was dedicated to honoring the life and celebrating the legacy of one of the great leaders of the 20th century, [and it] has gotten distracted by this and a few other issues that are far less important than the legacy of Nelson Mandela,"" he said.

Druchen and three other sign language experts said the man was not signing in South African or American sign languages and could not have been signing in any other known sign language because there was no structure to his arm and hand movements. South African sign language covers all of the country's 11 official languages, according to the federation.

""He didn't follow any of the grammatical rules and structure of the language. He just invented his signs as he went along,"" Delphin Hlungwane, an official South African sign language interpreter at DeafSA, told Reuters.

""There was zero percent accuracy. He couldn't even get the basics right. He couldn't even say thank you,"" she added.

Ingrid Parkin, principal of the St. Vincent School for the Deaf in Johannesburg, said she's received complaints from the deaf community from Canada to China about the man on stage and that his movements look ""like he's signing gibberish."" He also used no facial expression to convey the emotions of the leaders, a key element of sign language interpretation.

""This man himself knows he cannot sign and he had the guts to stand on an international stage and do that,"" Parkin said.

The scandal over the interpreter is another indication of shoddy organization of the historic memorial service, which took place Tuesday at FNB Stadium in Johannesburg, South Africa. Other difficulties included public transportation breakdowns which hindered mourners from getting to the event and a faulty audio system that prevented many of the tens of thousands in the stadium from hearing the leaders' speeches. In an apparent security failure, police did not search the first wave of crowds arriving at the stadium.

When the man appeared last year with Zuma, a deaf person in the audience videotaped the event and gave it to the federation for the deaf, which analyzed the video, prepared a report about it and a submitted a formal complaint to the ANC, Druchen said.

In their complaint, the federation suggested that the man should take the five years of training needed to become a qualified sign language interpreter in South Africa.

Druchen said a fresh complaint will be filed to the ANC about the interpreter he called a ""fake"" with a demand for an urgent meeting.

""It was horrible, an absolute circus, really, really bad,"" Nicole Du Toit, an official sign language interpreter who also watched the broadcast, told The Associated Press.

Bogus sign language interpreters are a problem in South Africa, because people who know a few signs try to pass themselves off as interpreters, Parkin said. And those hiring them usually don't sign, so they have no idea that the people they are hiring cannot do the job, she said.

""They advertise themselves as interpreters because they know 10 signs and they can make some quick money,"" said Parkin. ""It is plain and simple abuse of the deaf community, they are taking advantage of the deaf community to make money.""

USA TODAY

President Obama and his team are looking to turn the page this week, but it won't be easy.

White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer hit the talk show circuit Sunday, but faced many more questions about the Internal Revenue Service and Benghazi than about the economy and national security.

Pfeiffer dismissed Republican ""conspiracy theories"" about the Benghazi attack last September, and said the White House did not know about IRS targeting of conservative groups until recent news about an inspector general's investigation.

Calling IRS actions ""outrageous and inexcusable,"" Pfeiffer told ABC's This Week that the administration would work with Congress on ""legitimate oversight"" — but ""what we're not going to participate in is partisan fishing expeditions designed to distract from the real issues at hand.""

On NBC's Meet the Press, Pfeiffer sad that while there is ""a very real problem at the IRS,"" the Republicans are also trying ""to drag Washington into a swamp of partisan fishing expeditions, trumped-up hearings and false allegations.""

""We are not going to let that happen,"" Pfeiffer said. ""The president has got business to do for the American people.""

Republicans, meanwhile, are gearing up for more congressional hearings on the IRS, trying to find out if any high-ranking Obama administration or campaign officials knew about the targeting of conservative groups for extra scrutiny.

""This is just the beginning of this investigation,"" said Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on Fox News Sunday.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told NBC that the recent allegations reflect a ""culture of intimidation"" within the Obama administration.

""What we're talking about here is an attitude that the government knows best,"" McConnell said. ""The nanny state is here to tell us all what to do. And if we start criticizing, you get targeted.""

Turning the page in the short term may be impossible, with two major congressional hearings coming up this week.

The Senate Finance Committee has a session Tuesday featuring the first testimony on Tea Party targeting, from former IRS commissioner Douglas Shulman.

The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform plans a hearing Wednesday that is scheduled to include Shulman and Lois Lerner, director of tax-exempt organizations for the IRS.

In his string of Sunday interviews, Pfeiffer noted that Obama has installed a new temporary director of the IRS, and authorized a 30-day review of agency operations. He told Fox that there will be ""a top-down review of the IRS, and everything will be looked at.""

Republicans also say they will continue investigating whether the White House sought to cover up the Sept. 11 terrorist attack on a U.S. facility in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans. The administration initially attributed that attack to a violent protest over an anti-Islam film, but said days later it was a terrorist group operation after all.

Pfeiffer said last week's White House release of administration e-mails detailing the development of ""talking points"" about Benghazi show that initial intelligence did indicate a protest. He said changes were made out of concern for undermining the investigation of the attack.

Republicans have also criticized the administration over the Justice Department seizure of Associated Press phone records, part of an investigation into news leaks.

As Obama tries to move the past the scandal allegations, his schedule this week includes a meeting with the president of Burma, a speech on counterterrorism, and a commencement address at the U.S. Naval Academy. The administration is also trying to strike deals with Congress on the budget and a major immigration bills.

Ongoing investigations could complicate the administration's efforts to get back to its own agenda.

Some Republicans said the recent revelations, especially at the IRS, undermine Obama's support of ""big government"" initiatives.

Ryan, the 2012 Republican candidate for vice president, told Fox News Sunday that he and GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney had to run last year against big government in theory.

""Now we are seeing big government in practice,"" Ryan said. ""Now, we're seeing the arrogance. We're seeing the cronyism in practice in this second term. And that is even uglier than big government in theory.""

On ABC, Pfeiffer said Obama has take steps to overhaul government, and will continue to do so.

""The test here is, when problems arise, how do we address it?"" Pfeiffer said. ""And in the IRS, we are taking decisive action to make sure this never happens again, and we're going to hold those responsible accountable."""

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/10/19/media-hate-speech-cruz-death-threat,2013-10-19 00:00:00,['John Nolte'],"After Weeks of Hate Speech from Media & Obama, Cruz Receives Death Threat","After weeks of being vilified by the national media and White House as a terrorist, racist, and radical hostage-taker out to destroy the economy, Ted Cruz (R-TX) is receiving the kind of death threats that are all-too expected after this kind of national demonization campaign. A person who identifies himself on Twitter as Troy Gilmore, Jr. listed the Senator’s homes address and suggested Cruz be taught a “street wise lesson.” Capitol Police are investigating:

The Hill reported Capitol Police were looking into the post by someone identifying himself as Troy Gilmore Jr.

The tweet, posted early Friday, said, “Take down Ted Cruz, at his home” and listed Cruz’s home address in Houston, The Hill reported.

It also said, “What goes around comes around CRUZ!!”

The Hill said the poster — using the Twitter handle @ArmyVet54 — said he had served in the U.S. Army and Navy, and posted another tweet Friday afternoon saying Cruz “needs tobe [sic] taught a street wise [sic] lesson.”

In the last couple of weeks, the hate speech directed at Cruz from the elite media has been merciless. Politico mused about drowning Cruz; The Washington Post compared Cruz to an evil, mass-murdering terrorist – “Ted Bin Laden”; a writer for The New Yorker compared Cruz to O.J. Simpson. The media have also made Cruz the face of a movement they have described as a bunch of racists “wearing suicide vests” and “taking hostages.”

Mind you, this is just what the elite media have been saying. President Obama and top Democrats have been just as bad.

After all of this, the only surprise is that this is the only death threat against Cruz, or at least the only one we know of. Why would someone not feel a seething hostility towards an individual the national media and our president are wishing dead, comparing to terrorists, and relentlessly demonizing as the leader of a radical, dangerous, arsonist, anarchist, racist, hostage-taking cause that will destroy America?

We sure have come a long way from a media and White House that just two years ago made a national crusade out of finding a New Tone in politics. In the wake of the horrific shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, within an hour, the media blamed Governor Sarah Palin over a standard issue campaign map that placed crosshairs over Giffords’ district. Even after it was clear there was no connection to the map and the deranged killer, the media and President Obama still lectured America over the corrosive effect violent political rhetoric was having on our culture.

But just two years later, the media are no longer interested in enforcing the New Tone. And just a year after trying to destroy Rush Limbaugh over his labeling of a left-wing activist as a “slut,” the media are currently engaged in a hate speech campaign beyond anything we have seen in years.

Politics aside, although the media will never publicly acknowledge the possibility that their “othering campaign” might have contributed to a death threat against a U.S. Senator serious enough to involve police, let’s hope that privately there is at least some soul searching going on.

In at least a dozen sexual assault cases since the president’s remarks at the White House in May, judges and defense lawyers have said that Mr. Obama’s words as commander in chief amounted to “unlawful command influence,” tainting trials as a result. Military law experts said that those cases were only the beginning and that the president’s remarks were certain to complicate almost all prosecutions for sexual assault.

“Unlawful command influence” refers to actions of commanders that could be interpreted by jurors as an attempt to influence a court-martial, in effect ordering a specific outcome. Mr. Obama, as commander in chief of the armed forces, is considered the most powerful person to wield such influence.

The president’s remarks might have seemed innocuous to civilians, but military law experts say defense lawyers will seize on the president’s call for an automatic dishonorable discharge, the most severe discharge available in a court-martial, arguing that his words will affect their cases."

But, of course, there is an important difference between the First Daughter and other students. When Malia Obama takes a trip, the American taxpayers get stuck with a hefty bill. How hefty? That’s what we’ve been trying to find out.

As you know, JW has kept close watch on the First Family’s extravagant personal trips for the American people, since we’re the ones footing the bill. And last week we released records detailing the government funds expended on Malia’s March 2012 Spring Break vacation to Mexico. According to the records, obtained from the U.S. Secret Service as a result of a Judicial Watch Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed on September 20, 2012, the total cost of the trip amounted to $115,500.87.

The following is a breakdown of the costs as detailed in the documents, which are available in full here:

Ground transportation: $23,964.81

Lodging: $21,682.92

Airfare: $47,767.34

“Vouchers”: $21,636.14 (not itemized)

Support Charges: $449.66 (travel for one from Mexico City to Oaxaca, not itemized)

Malia Obama’s Spring Break trip evoked a significant amount of controversy after the Obama White House reportedly ordered the removal of press reports detailing the trip.

On March 19, 2012, numerous online press outlets reported on Malia Obama’s Mexico trip, noting the fact that she was accompanied by 25 U.S. Secret Service Agents and as many as 12 of her friends. However, shortly after the press reports surfaced, they were quickly removed from the Internet.

As reported by Politico:

The AFP, the Huffington Post and other websites have scrubbed a report about first daughter Malia Obama’s school trip. On Monday, the AFP reported that Obama’s daughter was on a school trip along with a number of friends and 25 Secret Service agents. The story was picked up by Yahoo, the Huffington Post, and the International Business Times, as well as UK publications like the Daily Mail and the Telegraph and other overseas publications like The Australian. But on Monday night, the story had been removed from those sites.

In an update to this story, Politico published a statement issued by Kristina Schake, Communications Director to the First Lady, indicating that the removal of these news stories was “a White House effort:”

“From the beginning of the administration, the White House has asked news outlets not to report on or photograph the Obama children when they are not with their parents and there is no vital news interest. We have reminded outlets of this request in order to protect the privacy and security of these girls.”

The trip reportedly took place shortly after the Texas Department of Public Safety issued a statement advising students on Spring Break “to avoid Mexico.”

I think we can all agree that in these economic times, with huge public debt and high unemployment, spending $115,000 in taxpayer funds on a Spring Break trip to Mexico is inappropriate. Is this what Americans are being asked to pay higher taxes for?

This is far from the first time the Obamas have taken advantage of the American taxpayer to enjoy expensive vacations.

We previously obtained records from the United States Air Force and the United States Secret Service detailing Michelle Obama’s February 2012 President’s Day weekend ski vacation to Aspen, Colorado, with her two daughters. The records indicate U.S. Secret Service costs, including accommodations at the Fasching Haus deluxe condominium and the Inn at Aspen, were $48,950.38.

Judicial Watch also obtained documents from the United States Air Force and the United States Secret Service detailing costs associated with Michelle Obama’s controversial August 2010 vacation to Spain. According to a Judicial Watch analysis, the records indicate a total combined cost of at least $467,585.

Judicial Watch also obtained documents detailing costs of a June 21-27, 2011, trip taken by Michelle Obama, her family and her staff to South Africa and Botswana. Judicial Watch received mission expense records and passenger manifests for the Africa trip that described costs of $424,142 for the flight and crew alone. Other expenses, such as off-flight food, transportation, security, etc. were not included.

That’s a total of four trips at a cost of almost $1 million. And these are the trips we know about.

Rest assured, JW will continue to monitor these First Family excursions in a second Obama term. I suspect they will continue."

Columnist Rich Benjamin at Salon.com called the effort “safe, over-rated and airy” and compared it unfavorably to Attorney General Eric Holder’s recent address to the NAACP by asking the provocative question: “Some of us have an Inner Child. Others have an Inner Ni**er. Is Holder the president’s conscience? Or his Inner Ni**er?”

Finally the president has spoken about George Zimmerman’s acquittal. Even as the country waited for his singular response – the nation’s leader and a law professor who once looked like Trayvon Martin – the president danced around the issues. And what a dramatic anti-climax, listening to the president refuse to say anything insightful or profound about the acquittal. In signature professorial style, the president gave us the “context” to the episode and to black people’s “pain.” But he didn’t offer a meaningful opinion on the episode’s hot molten core: racial profiling, vigilantism, and “Stand Your Ground” laws. Meanwhile, Attorney General Eric Holder delivered trenchant thoughts on the acquittal, demanding action. Before an audience of supporters, Holder recently called for a full investigation of Martin’s death after Zimmerman’s acquittal. Holder vowed that the Justice Department will act “in a manner that is consistent with the facts and the law. We will not be afraid.” “We must stand our ground,” he told supporters. Some of us have an Inner Child. Others have an Inner Ni**er. Is Holder the president’s conscience? Or his Inner Ni**er?

It’s an attention-getting way to suggest that Obama and Holder play “good cop/bad cop” on racial issues, and Benjamin goes on to show examples over their careers that support the idea. Benjamin is a Senior Fellow at the liberal think tank Demos, has written extensively about the Zimmerman case, and has been critical of Obama’s reaction.

The “Inner Ni**er” charge got a volatile reaction from most liberals who absolutely loved the meaningless, identity-politics-pander that President Obama passed off as a meaningful speech, and they took to Twitter to let Benjamin know. (H/T Tommy Christopher)

An IRS official said groups with words %22tea party%22 or %22patriot%22 in applications were singled out

Many conservative organizations said they were being harassed by the IRS

Head of House investigating panel say further probes on the horizon

WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service apologized Friday for subjecting Tea Party groups to additional scrutiny during the 2012 election, but denied any political motive.

Lois Lerner, who heads the IRS unit that oversees tax-exempt groups, said organizations that included the words ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" in their applications for tax-exempt status were singled out for additional reviews. Her remarks, which came at an American Bar Association gathering, were first reported by the Associated Press.

White House spokesman Jay Carney on Friday afternoon called the IRS action ""inappropriate"" and said the Obama administration supports a full investigation, suggesting the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration would have jurisdiction.

Lerner said the practice, initiated by low-level workers in Cincinnati, was wrong.

""It was an error in judgment, and it was not appropriate, but that's what they did,"" Lerner told reporters. She declined to talk about how many employees were involved and whether there would disciplinary action. ""I think they were insensitive, or less sensitive than they should have been.""

The error, she said, was in assuming that any group with ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" in its name necessarily needed more scrutiny for political activity just because of its name. About 300 groups that had applied for tax-exempt status were put into a ""bucket"" of cases needing further scrutiny, and of those, about a quarter had tea party affiliations.

That problem was compounded when examiners asked more intrusive questions in what's known as a ""development"" process. ""Some of the development letters that were send were far too broad and include things like asking for the organization's donor list, which is not generally what we do,"" Lerner said.

Since the problem was discovered sometime last year, the IRS has approved about 130 of the original 300 applications, and about 25 have been withdrawn. The rest remain pending, and no application has been denied.

Lerner said she had never discussed the issue with Treasury or White House officials and could not say whether they knew of the problems before her apology Friday. She said her focus had been on fixing the problem.

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., announced Friday afternoon that the Republican-led chamber will investigate.



Earlier, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., asked the White House to conduct a government-wide review to ensure ""that these thuggish practices are not underway at the IRS or elsewhere in the administration against anyone, regardless of their political views.""

Tea Party groups said they were outraged by the IRS actions.

Jenny Beth Martin, the national coordinator of Tea Party Patriots, said the IRS workers involved should resign. ""The IRS has demonstrated the most disturbing, illegal and outrageous abuse of government power,"" she said in a statement.""This deliberate targeting and harassment of tea party groups reaches a new low in illegal government activity and overreach. It is suspicious that the activity of these 'low-level workers' was unknown to IRS leadership at the time it occurred.""

Conservative groups complained during the election that they were being harassed by the IRS. They said the agency asked them an inordinate number of questions to justify their tax-exempt status, and 27 Tea Party groups joined with conservative lawyer Jay Sekulow of the American Center for Law and Justice to push back on the IRS.

Kentucky 9/12 Project is one of the conservative organizations that joined with Sekulow to complain of government overreach.

Its executive director, Eric Wilson, said his group applied for tax-exempt status in December 2010. He said the IRS responded with an 88-page questionnaire that sought all the organization's correspondence, the names of its members -- along with details of group's activity on Facebook and Twitter. It was eventually granted its nonprofit designation last month.

""I would love to say that I feel vindicated, but to think that the government has the capability to reach into the lives of people in our organization is not only scary but describes the times we live in today,"" Wilson said of the apology.

Certain tax-exempt charitable groups can conduct political activities but it cannot be their primary activity.

In March 2012, Rep. Charles Boustany Jr., R-La., asked the IRS to explain why it was ""questioning new tax-exempt applicants, including grassroots political entities such as Tea Party groups, about their operations and donors.""

In response, the IRS acknowledged last June that there were backlogs in processing tax-exempt determinations for political groups, which were attributed to a spike in applications during an election year. But IRS Deputy Commissioner Steven T. Miller assured Boustany at the time that the office ""took steps to coordinate the handling of the cases to ensure consistency.""

""Despite their unwillingness to cooperate, more than a year later, the IRS has now admitted to what we long suspected — it was targeting tea party groups,"" Boustany said in a statement Friday. ""The IRS's 'too little too late' response is unacceptable, and I will continue to work to ensure there are protections in place so no American, regardless of political affiliation, has their right to free speech threatened by the IRS.""

WASHINGTON — Embroiled in scandal, the IRS has replaced the official who supervised agents involved in targeting Tea Party groups.

Lois Lerner, IRS director of exempt organizations, refused to answer questions by a House committee Wednesday, saying she did nothing wrong but was nevertheless invoking her Fifth Amendment right not to testify against herself.

""I have not done anything wrong. I have not broken any laws. I have not violated any IRS rules and regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee,"" Lerner said.

She was replaced Thursday by Ken Corbin, a 27-year IRS veteran who had a deputy director in the wage and investment division.

In announcing the change in an e-mail to IRS employees, the agency's new acting commissioner, Danny Werfel, did not mention Lerner. Administration and congressional sources told news organizations that she was placed on administrative leave.

The move came hours after Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and John McCain, R-Ariz., who lead the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, sent Werfel a letter urging him to suspend Lerner ""immediately.""

Lerner was the IRS official responsible for the office in Cincinnati that created a ""be on the lookout"" list for tax-exempt applications from groups using the words ""tea party,"" ""patriot"" and ""9/12 project"" in their names. Those applications were held up for more than a year while applications from liberal groups requesting similar status were routinely approved, a USA TODAY review found.

An audit by the IRS inspector general found that Lerner tried to immediately correct that list when she learned about it in 2011 but replaced it with criteria that included groups ""critical of how the country is being run."" Members of Congress from both parties want to know why she never informed Congress — even under direct questioning.

Levin and McCain wrote that they believe that Lerner ""failed to disclose crucial information concerning the IRS's inappropriate targeting of some conservative ... organizations"" during the committee's investigation into how the IRS enforces the law for tax-exempt 501(c)(4) groups.

""Given the serious failure by Ms. Lerner to disclose to this Subcommittee key information on topics that the Subcommittee was investigating, we have lost confidence in her ability to fulfill her duties as Director of Exempt Organizations at the IRS,"" the senators wrote. ""Ms. Lerner's continued tenure in the office she holds, where she is responsible for overseeing 1.6 million tax-exempt organizations, would erode public trust and confidence in the IRS and its professional integrity. We believe that the immediate removal of Ms. Lerner from office would be a vital step in helping to restore public trust in the agency.""

Last week, acting IRS commissioner Steven Miller resigned at the request of President Obama.

(CNN) - Republicans pushed forward in their criticism of Attorney General Eric Holder on Sunday, standing by a new investigation of his comments at a congressional hearing about leaks.

Holder has come under fire for saying in the May 15 grilling on Capitol Hill that he has never been involved with the ""potential prosecution of the press,"" despite signing off on a 2010 warrant application that listed a Fox News reporter as a ""co-conspirator"" for receiving classified material from a government official.

""With regard to the potential prosecution of the press for the disclosure of material, that is not something that I've ever been involved in or heard of or would think would be a wise policy,"" Holder said.

Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill are focusing on that comment, now that the Justice Department has acknowledged it tracked Fox reporter Jay Rosen's e-mails and movements in and out of the State Department. The decision to apply for the search warrant was vetted at the department's highest levels, including Holder, a Justice Department official said.

Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, for example, said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that Holder's comments amount to ""a lie, by most people's standards.""

The Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee announced last week it is now looking into whether Holder lied under oath when he made that statement, which came before news of the Justice Department's monitoring of Rosen but after news that the department had subpoenaed phone records of Associated Press reporters.

Rep. Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the judiciary committee, said Sunday it's giving Holder until Wednesday to ""answer some very pointed questions about the conflict between his testimony under oath.""

""Those remarks were made under oath,"" he said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""But we also think it's very important that the attorney general be afforded the opportunity to respond. So we will wait to pass judgment on that until after we receive his response - unless, of course, he's not forthcoming with that.""

On the same program, Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen said the ""whole thing reeks of hypocrisy.""

""It wasn't that long ago you had Republicans on Capitol Hill and a lot of folks on Fox going after the Obama administration saying, 'You're not getting to the bottom of these national security leaks.' It was nonstop for a while. Then the administration goes after these national leaks and people say, 'Oh, you can't do that,'"" he said.

Asked Sunday whether he thinks Holder lied, Issa said, ""It would be kind to say he misled Congress.""

""It would be less kind and more accurate to say that would rise to be a lie by most people's standards,"" the House oversight committee chairman told CNN's chief political correspondent, Candy Crowley. ""By the American people's standard, you don't sign a warrant and then pretend you wouldn't know about it.""

""One of the things about perjury, this is the attorney general. Don't use perjury lightly,"" he added. ""Perjury is a criminal charge that has to be proven. But certainly it's hard to have confidence in what this attorney general says or his people say, when so often it turns out not to be true.""

Issa pointed to ""Fast and Furious,"" the botched firearm program in Mexico run by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, saying Holder still hasn't provided answers about the controversy.

""This attorney general maliciously covered up and will not give us the facts as to when Congress was lied to in the Fast and Furious case,"" he said. ""So now when he does something similar, tries to cover up his tracks potentially as to a warrant he signed, am I surprised? No.""

Sen. John McCain also expressed a lack of confidence in Holder.

“The Attorney General has to ask himself the question, ‘Is he really able to effectively serve the president of the United States and the American people under the present circumstances?’ That’s a decision he’d have to make,” McCain said on CBS’ “Face The Nation.”

The FBI affidavit used to obtain the warrant for Rosen's e-mails said there was probable cause the reporter had broken the law when he allegedly received a leaked classified report from a State Department contractor named Stephen Kim. The affidavit described Rosen as potentially being an ""aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator"" to the crime of disclosing government secrets.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday that no prosecution ever took place in the case involving Rosen and Fox News, and therefore it was ""self-evident"" that any charge Holder lied to the House panel was ""inaccurate.""

Implying that Republicans were playing politics on the matter, Carney said reporters should ""be careful not to conflate facts with statements by members of Congress about what they want to be true."" Pressed further, he added that reporters were ""conflating a subpoena with prosecution.""

Asked if Obama still had full confidence in the attorney general, Carney replied: ""He absolutely does, yes.""

The Justice Department also released a statement late Thursday night, saying Holder did not lie in his May 15 testimony and that his comments were ""accurate and consistent with the facts."" An official said that prosecutors have never sought to bring criminal charges against Rosen, meaning Holder's testimony was accurate.

""The search warrant application in the Kim matter was focused on obtaining evidence relating to allegations that a government official had leaked highly classified information, which was a threat to our national security,"" the Justice official wrote. ""The warrant application was drafted during the investigation phase of the case, which came before any decisions about prosecution. And nearly three years after completing our thorough investigation of the Kim matter, the Department does not anticipate bringing any additional charges. During the Attorney General's tenure, no reporter has ever been prosecuted.""

Reines has been known to defend and protect the former First Lady in his role as spokesperson and adviser to Clinton. But as the New York Times reports, that defense has extended to Abedin in recent weeks as revelations about her husband, former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), and his recurring sexting scandals came to light.

When a crew from People magazine came to the Weiner residence for an interview and photo shoot last summer, Reines was present. And minutes before Abedin was to appear at a nationally televised press conference, Reines was on the phone with her.

When Reines learned that Weiner had continued sexting after resigning from Congress over a conference call, he said he would ""reach through his phone"" to ""pull out"" his throat, the Times reports.

Abedin, an aide to Clinton since the former First Lady's White House days, has been in the spotlight as she stands her husband in his New York City mayoral campaign.

""Anthony has made some horrible mistakes, both before he resigned from Congress and after,"" Abedin said last week. ""But I do strongly believe that that is between us and our marriage. We discussed all of this before Anthony decided to run for mayor.""

Abedin recently returned to Washington, DC, where she has been spotted out with Reines. On Wednesday, hours after the New York Post reported that comparisons between the Weiner and Clinton scandals had the former first couple ""livid,"" Abedin and Reines were seen dining together.

Reines told the Times that he's known Abedin for over a decade.

“I’m not sure there’s anyone I’ve spoken to or spent more time with over that period,” he said."
http://news.yahoo.com/money-tangle-irs-tea-party-tempest-144831224.html,,[],Money tangle: The IRS and its tea party tempest,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Internal Revenue Service is feeling the sort of heat that targeted taxpayers feel from the tax agency. It's the sense that a powerful someone is breathing down your neck.

Republicans in Congress are livid with the IRS over its systematic scrutiny of conservative groups during the 2010 and 2012 elections. Democrats agree that something must be done. Likewise, President Barack Obama isn't at all happy with the tax collectors.

That kind of commonality in Washington is about as rare as a budget surplus. So expect a bumpy ride for the IRS, unloved in the best of times, as a Justice Department criminal investigation and multiple congressional inquiries try to get to the bottom of it all.

A look at the matter:

___

IN BRIEF

The central issue is whether IRS agents who determine whether nonprofit organizations have to pay federal income taxes played political favorites or even broke the law when they subjected tea party groups and other conservative organizations to special scrutiny.

Also foremost in the concerns of Congress: Why senior IRS officials, for many months, did not disclose what they had learned about the actions of lower-level employees despite persistent questions from Republican lawmakers and howls from aggrieved organizations.

___

WHY IT MATTERS

The IRS is expected to be pesky, even intimidating, to miscreants, but at all times politically neutral. Nonpartisanship is the coin of its realm, perhaps more so than in any other part of government.

""I will not tolerate this kind of behavior in any agency but especially in the IRS, given the power that it has and the reach that it has into all of our lives,"" Obama said in ousting the agency's acting chief, Steven T. Miller.

The president named Daniel Werfel, a senior White House budget official, to take charge of the agency temporarily. Werfel launched a 30-day review of IRS operations, a step unlikely by itself to quiet the storm. Some Republicans want a special counsel appointed to investigate; Democrats are resistant to that.

Story continues

There's no question IRS actions in the period covering the 2010 congressional elections and the early going of the 2012 presidential campaign have tattered the perception that the agency is clean of political leanings. Whether that was also the reality remains to be discovered.

A report by the Treasury Department's top investigator for tax matters found no evidence that sheer partisanship drove the targeting. But the watchdog disclosed Friday that he is still investigating. His report faulted lax management for not stopping it sooner.

It's a sensitive time for the agency's professionalism to be in doubt because the IRS soon will loom even larger in people's lives. It's to be the enforcer of the individual mandate to carry insurance under Obama's health care law, itself an object of suspicion for many conservatives. To the right, that's insult upon injury from the left.

___

WHAT WOULD MAKE IT MATTER EVEN MORE

Any effort from top levels of the administration or political operatives to manipulate the IRS for campaign purposes would put the scandal in the realm of Nixonian skullduggery.

The public record as it is known does not show interference.

At the same time, early IRS assurances that high-level people inside the agency did not know what was going on have been contradicted by evidence that the head of the agency's tax-exemption operation and later its deputy commissioner were briefed about it and did not tell Congress.

As well, J. Russell George, the Treasury inspector general for tax administration, testified Friday that he informed senior Treasury Department officials of his investigation last summer. Obama adviser Dan Pfeiffer said Sunday, ""No one in the White House was aware.""

___

RED-FLAG WORDS

To qualify for exemption from federal income taxes, organizations must show they are not too political in nature to meet the standard. In the cases in question, applications that raised eyebrows were referred to a team of specialists who took a much closer look at a group's operations. That's normal.

But in early 2010, IRS agents in the Determinations Unit began paying special attention to tax-exempt applications from groups associated with the tea party or with certain words or phrases in their materials, according to the IRS inspector general's report. That's not normal.

The red-flag keywords came to include ""Patriots,"" ''Take Back the Country"" and ""We the People.""

That August, agents were given an explicit ""be on the lookout"" directive for ""various local organizations in the Tea Party movement"" that are seeking tax-exempt status. Such organizations saw their applications languish except when they were hit with lots of questions, some of which the IRS was not entitled to ask, such as the names of donors.

In June 2011, after the congressional elections, Lois G. Lerner, in charge of overseeing tax-exempt organizations, learned of the flagging and ordered the criteria to be changed right away, the inspector general said. The new guidance was more generic and stripped of any explicit partisan freight. But it did not last.

In January 2012, the screening was modified again, this time to watch for references to the Constitution or Bill of Rights, and for ""political action type organizations involved in limiting/expanding government.""

The Constitution and Bill of Rights are touchstones for liberals, too. But in modern politics, they've been appropriated as rallying cries of conservatives and libertarians. Finally, that May, such flagging ended.

Altogether, specialists reviewed a variety of potentially too-political applications, presumably covering the liberal-conservative spectrum. But fully one-third of the cases were of the tea party-patriot variety. During the height of the flagging, the inspector general says, all applications fitting the conservative-focused criteria went to the specialists while others that should have stirred concern did not.

In short, if you were with the tea party, you were guaranteed a close second look and almost certainly months more of delay. If you were leading a liberal activist group, maybe yes, maybe no.

___

ON THE RECEIVING END

""Dealing with this was like dealing with tax day every day for 2½ years,"" says Laurence Nordvig, executive director of the Richmond Tea Party in Virginia. ""Like your worst audit nightmare.""

His group applied for tax-exempt status in December 2009 and finally got it in July 2012.

Tom Zawistowski applied for the tax exemption for his group, the Ohio Liberty Coalition, in June 2010 when the flagging was gathering steam. He got it in December 2012, after the presidential election.

The IRS asked him for the identity of the group's members, times and location of group activities, printouts of its website and Facebook pages, contents of speeches and the names and credentials of speakers at forums. He said the IRS also audited his personal finances and his wife's.

""The intent of this was to hurt the ability of tea party groups to function in an election year,"" he said.

An Associated Press analysis of 93 ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" groups found that most were shoestring operations, with only two dozen raising more than $20,000 a year.

___

FIVE-OH WHAT?

If the IRS merely rolled over and played dead when it got an application for a tax exemption, the government would be even more broke than it is and big money would have an even more pernicious grip on campaigns.

The IRS knows better than most that politically driven organizations, out to elect and defeat candidates, can masquerade as ""social welfare"" or other charitable entities under the tax-exempting articles of Section 501 (c) of the tax code.

Or they can align themselves with one, allowing unlimited donations to be raised and the identities of the contributors to stay secret as long as the nonprofit entities don't go too far in overt politicking.

In recent years, advocacy groups have paired their nonprofit arms with ""super"" political action committees, moves that took hold after a series of court rulings — including the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision — loosened the rules on money in politics.

The rulings gave rise to such pairings as the American Crossroads super PAC with its Crossroads GPS nonprofit on behalf of Republicans in the 2012 campaign, and the Priorities USA Action super PAC with its own nonprofit arm, for Obama's benefit.

Section 501 (c) (3) can be the most lucrative financially for organizations because in addition to conferring tax-exempt status, it allows donations to qualifying groups to be tax deductible.

Section 501 (c) (4) doesn't permit tax-deductible donations but gives groups more latitude to lobby and to dabble more directly in political campaigns as long as ""social welfare"" remains their primary mission. They can also keep their donors secret, a big benefit over more blatantly political super PACs.

It's all complex, squishy and in some ways subjective, so it might not come as a shock that the IRS would look for shortcuts such as political buzzwords and slogans when deciding what a group is really up to. But the record as yet known does not show that the scrutiny cut both ways.

In congressional testimony about the discredited IRS actions, Attorney General Eric Holder said there is good reason to take a skeptical look at some Section 501 applications but ""it has to be done in a way that does not depend on the political persuasion of the group.""

___

BY THE NUMBERS

The inspector general's office reviewed 296 tax-exempt applications that had been flagged as potentially too political. Of them, 108 were ultimately approved, 28 were withdrawn by the applicant, none had been rejected and 160 were still open in December 2012, some languishing for more than three years.

___

STONEWALLING?

Hearing complaints of IRS harassment from constituents, lawmakers began asking a lot of questions of the agency starting in mid-2011. They got a lot of answers — just not answers revealing what was going on.

In multiple letters, some as long as 45 pages, as well as in meetings and congressional hearings, senior IRS officials laid out in painstaking detail the process of checking tax-exempt applications but did not disclose what they had come to learn of the flagging.

Miller, for example, was told by staff in May 2012 about the inappropriate screening but did not pass that on in communications with inquiring members of Congress or in his appearance two months later with the House panel most concerned about the reports.

Lois G. Lerner, in charge of overseeing tax-exempt organizations at the IRS, was briefed about the screening a year earlier and ordered an end to explicit tea party-type flagging. But she did not tell lawmakers about that when asked about the constituent complaints.

Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan, the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said Lerner ""should be relieved of her duties.""

___

ABOUT THAT SKULLDUGGERY

A number of presidents or their operatives have tried to twist the IRS against ""dissidents"" or political opponents. Presidents Franklin Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower and John Kennedy are among them.

President Richard Nixon, though, surely takes the cake here.

The Senate Judiciary Committee cited his IRS manipulations, including his pursuit of those on his ""enemies list,"" in the articles of impeachment accusing the president of high crimes and misdemeanors in the Watergate scandal and of actions ""subversive of constitutional government.""

Article 2, Abuse of Power, said: ""He has, acting personally and through his subordinates and agents, endeavored to obtain from the Internal Revenue Service, in violation of the constitutional rights of citizens, confidential information contained in income tax returns for purposes not authorized by law, and to cause, in violation of the constitutional rights of citizens, income tax audits or other income tax investigations to be initiated or conducted in a discriminatory manner.""

Nixon resigned after it became clear that a Senate impeachment trial would drive him from office.

http://news.yahoo.com/gop-leader-warns-attacks-free-speech-080754980.html,,[],GOP leader warns of attacks on free speech,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate Republican leader, who last year accused the Obama administration of Nixon-style dirty tricks, said Friday the Internal Revenue Service's targeting of conservative groups is part of a broader government assault on free speech.

Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky seized on the spate of controversies besetting the White House, saying Americans are recognizing a pattern of attack on First Amendment rights across government agencies, the administration, President Barack Obama's congressional allies, left-wing groups and public employee unions.

""As serious as the IRS scandal is, what we're dealing with here is larger than the actions of one agency or any group of employees,"" McConnell, who is up for re-election next year, said in a speech to the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""This administration has institutionalized the practice of pitting bureaucrats against the very people they're supposed to be serving, and it needs to stop.""

White House spokesman Jay Carney said the charge leveled by McConnell was ""demonstrably bogus.""

""As I'm sure the minority leader in the Senate is aware, the independent inspector general has testified and has made clear in his report that he has found no evidence that anyone outside of the IRS had any involvement in the inappropriate targeting of conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status,"" Carney said.

Speaking to the same organization last year, McConnell accused the administration and Obama's re-election campaign of leaking tax information and maintaining an enemies list in a chilling style reminiscent of President Richard Nixon, the Republican who resigned in 1974 amid the Watergate scandal. McConnell's criticism was largely dismissed as election-year hyperbole.

In the first six months of Obama's second term, the administration's problems have produced an assortment of political targets for Republicans. One is the IRS affair, which has resulted in resignations and departures from the agency. So far, no evidence has come to light that anyone in the Obama administration outside the IRS was involved in targeting conservative groups for extra scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status.

Story continues

Other issues facing the Obama administration this year include government surveillance of phone and Internet records; its handling of last year's terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, which killed four Americans; the Justice Department's seizure of phone records of journalists at The Associated Press and, in another case, reading the emails of Fox News reporter James Rosen.

McConnell referred to the IRS episode with a bit of I-told-you-so.

""When I warned about all this last year, I got slammed by the usual suspects on the left. They said I was full of it,"" he said. ""But even some of them now seem to realize that just because McConnell is the one pulling the alarm doesn't mean there isn't a fire. The IRS scandal has reminded people of the temptations to abuse that big government, and its political patrons, are prone to. People are waking up to a pattern here.""

In comments certain to appeal to Republican voters, McConnell described public sector unions as power hungry and able to expand their reach with the help of congressional friends. He said the unions no longer serve the public's interest but rather serve the government's.

""There's no better illustration of this than the announcement this week that in the midst of congressional hearings into their activities, unionized employees at the IRS are about to get $70 million in bonuses,"" McConnell complained.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said earlier this week that the IRS plans to hand out $70 million in bonuses to employees. Under a contract with the employees' union, IRS workers can receive individual performance bonuses of up to $3,500 a year.

In response to Grassley's criticism, the agency said it's under a legal obligation to comply with its collective bargaining agreement with the National Treasury Employees Union. The agency and the union say they are in negotiations over the matter.

But he seems to be proud of how little he knows.

Why didn’t his Justice Department inform the Associated Press, as the law requires, before pawing through reporters’ phone records?

“I do not know,” the attorney general told the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday afternoon, “why that was or was not done. I simply don’t have a factual basis to answer that question.”

Why didn’t the DOJ seek the AP’s cooperation, as the law also requires, before issuing subpoenas?

“I don’t know what happened there,” Holder replied. “I was recused from the case.”

Why, asked the committee’s chairman, Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), was the whole matter handled in a manner that appears “contrary to the law and standard procedure”?

“I don’t have a factual basis to answer the questions that you have asked, because I was recused,” the attorney general said.

On and on Holder went: “I don’t know. I don’t know. . . . I would not want to reveal what I know. . . . I don’t know why that didn’t happen. . . . I know nothing, so I’m not in a position really to answer.”

Holder seemed to regard this ignorance as a shield protecting him and the Justice Department from all criticism of the Obama administration’s assault on press freedoms. But his claim that his “recusal” from the case exempted him from all discussion of the matter didn’t fly with Republicans or Democrats on the committee, who justifiably saw his recusal as more of an abdication.

“There doesn’t seem to be any acceptance of responsibility in the Justice Department for things that have gone wrong,” said Rep. James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), after Holder placed the AP matter in the lap of his deputy. “We don’t know where the buck stops.”

The best Holder could do was offer an “after-action analysis” of the matter and pledge the administration’s renewed support for a media shield law (the same proposed law the Obama administration undermined three years ago). But that does nothing to reverse the damage the administration has already done with its wholesale snooping into reporters’ phone records and its unprecedented number of leak prosecutions.

“I realize there are exceptions and that you have recused yourself, but it seems to me clear that the actions of the department have, in fact, impaired the First Amendment,” Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) told Holder. “Reporters who might have previously believed that a confidential source would speak to them would no longer have that level of confidence, because those confidential sources are now going to be chilled in their relationship with the press.”

Ann Telnaes animation: Eric Holder gets stuck. (Ann Telnaes/The Washington Post)

In a sense, the two topics that dogged Holder most on Wednesday — the AP phone records and the IRS’s targeting of conservative groups — were one and the same. In both cases, Americans are being punished and intimidated for exercising their right of free expression — by the taxing authorities, in the conservatives’ case, and by federal prosecutors, in the reporters’ case.

But Holder cared so little about those two issues that he said not a peep about either the IRS or the AP in his opening statement. When he was questioned about the AP case, his first response was to suggest the criticism of him was political. “I mean, there’s been a lot of criticism,” Holder said. “In fact, the head of the RNC called for my resignation, in spite of the fact that I was not the person involved in that decision.”

Republicans on the House committee had voted previously to hold Holder in contempt of Congress, and Holder made clear the feeling was mutual; he informed Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) that his line of questioning was “too consistent with the way in which you conduct yourself as a member of Congress. It’s unacceptable, and it’s shameful.” Some of the Republicans provided Holder justification for his disdain. Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.), defying the chairman’s gavel, shouted a stream of exotic accusations at Holder, closing with the complaint that Holder was casting “aspersions on my asparagus.”

But there would be more sympathy, and support, for Holder if he took seriously the lawmakers’ legitimate questions about his department’s abuse of power in the AP case. He may have recused himself from the leak probe that led to the searches of reporters’ phone records (a decision he took so lightly that he didn’t put it in writing), but he isn’t recused from defending the First Amendment.

Didn’t the deputy attorney general who approved the subpoenas have the same potential conflict of interest that Holder claimed?

“I don’t know.”

When did Holder recuse himself?

“I’m not sure.”

How much time was spent exploring alternatives to the subpoenas?

“I don’t know, because, as I said, I recused myself.”

But when the Justice Department undermines the Constitution, recusal is no excuse.

The first woman mayor of San Diego has acknowledged in court she misappropriated more than $2 million from her late husband’s foundation to fund a casino gambling habit with which she allegedly won and lost $1 billion over nine years.

O’Connor, mayor of San Diego from 1986 to 1992, reported to the IRS more than $1 billion in casino winnings but also reported losses bigger than those winnings, resulting in a net loss from 2000 to 2009, prosecutors said in court papers.

O’Connor was married to Robert O. Peterson, founder of the Jack in the Box restaurant chain, from 1977 until his death in 1994, but court documents don’t disclose the size of the couple’s fortune that apparently funded O’Connor’s gambling habit.

O’Connor, 66, entered a deferred prosecution agreement Thursday in federal court in San Diego in which she admitted misappropriating money from the R.P. Foundation, on which she served as a trustee.

Under the agreement, she will repay the foundation $2,088,000, pay owed taxes, and be treated for her gambling addiction, prosecutors said.

O’Connor, however, is bankrupt and unable to work, court papers say. Her ability to repay the foundation is “limited,” they say.

In 2011, surgeons removed a large tumor from O’Connor’s brain, and she suffered complications that included cognitive impairment and a pulmonary embolism, prosecutors said. Magistrate Judge David Bartick found that her continuing health problems made it highly improbable she could be brought to trial, prosecutors said.

If O’Connor repays the foundation and satisfies the conditions of her deferred prosecution, the government will dismiss its prosecution in two years, prosecutors said.

She faces an unlawful monetary transaction charge carrying a maximum prison sentence of 10 years, documents say.

“Maureen O’Connor was a selfless public official who contributed much to the well-being of San Diego,” U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy of San Diego said in a prepared statement. “However, no figure, regardless of how much good they’ve done or how much they’ve given to charity, can escape criminal liability with impunity.”

O’Connor told reporters Thursday that for a while, she didn’t know she had a brain tumor.

“There were two Maureens – Maureen No. 1 and Maureen No. 2,” she said. “Maureen No. 2 is the woman that did not know she had a tumor growing in her head.”

She described that era as “the last chapter of my life where I lost my husband, I lost three of my siblings, I lost my two best friends and I had a difficult time.

“I think most of you who know me here would know that I never meant to hurt the city,” she told reporters. She began to choke up and cry.

O’Connor was described as “a public figure and a civic treasure to the San Diego community” for 30 years, according to court papers filed by her attorney.

She is the eighth of 13 children of a mother who was a registered nurse and a father, Jerome, who was a boxer known as “Kid Jerome” and later became a prominent businessman, defense documents said.

She was elected to city council at age 25 in 1971 and, later as mayor, “put our city on the map as a destination for international tourism,” partly by presiding over the completion of the city’s Convention Center, defense documents said.

O’Connor’s attorney attributed her gambling addiction to her medical condition.

“This was not, we think, a psychiatric problem or a characterological defect because there is substantial evidence that during this same time, there was a tumor growing in her brain, in the centers of the brain that affect and control, logic, reasoning and, most importantly, judgment,” attorney Eugene Iredale said at a news conference Thursday.

O’Connor sat next to him with her head lowered.

O’Connor didn’t plead guilty this week and the charge is played in abeyance for two years, Iredale said.

“It is fair to say in the last eight to 10 years a multiple amount of tragedies have befallen a person who was a great civic leader – one of the sweetest, funniest people who ever existed in our city’s history,” the attorney said. “She suffered from terrible loneliness. She began around 2001 to gamble heavily.”

“Although it’s not fair of us to say there is no moral culpability, Maureen acknowledges doing something she ought not to have done,” he added.

Photographs of her head after surgery show a fluid-filled cavity without brain matter at all, he said.

From 2000 to 2008, O’Connor gambled in Las Vegas, Atlantic City and San Diego casinos, court papers said. In 2008, when she became nearly broke, she began to siphon off funds from the R.P. Foundation and continued the activity into 2009, court documents said.

To fund her high-stakes gambling, she had liquidated her savings, sold several real estate holdings, auctioned valuables, and obtained a third mortgage on her home in La Jolla, California, the documents say.

O’Connor allegedly bankrupted the foundation and tried to avoid paying federal income taxes on the charity’s money by characterizing what she took as “loans,” court papers say.

“Despite having limited, if any, assets other than the funds misappropriated from the foundation, defendant continued high-stakes gambling,” the documents say.

By March 2009, O’Connor allegedly had paid off casinos’ gambling markers, or lines of credit, but hadn’t repaid the foundation, prosecutors said.

She then enjoyed a streak of “several large gambling winnings after March 2009 that were used to continue gambling, not bring the foundation out of bankruptcy,” court papers say.

Prior to 2008, the foundation funded such philanthropies as City of Hope, the Alzheimer’s Association, Sharp Healthcare, Little Wishes Foundation, San Diego Hospice and the John Burton Foundation, authorities said.

Pollak'],Top 10 Questions Journalists Won't Ask President Obama at Press Conference,"President Barack Obama rarely makes himself available to the mainstream media. They adore him anyway. At rare press conferences, such as the one scheduled for noon Friday at the White House, they lob softball questions or accept his evasive, meandering answers, rarely pressing him for clarity, much less truth. But there are many questions that the president ought to answer, yet which he is unlikely to face at all.

10. In 2008 you promised not to “do an end-run around Congress” with signing statements. Yet you have used signing statements and you have taken executive actions to circumvent Congress on immigration and other issues. Recently, you decided the employer mandate will not be enforced on October 1. Yet that date is stipulated by law. Doesn’t the Obamacare delay violate your powers under the Constitution?

9. Last week we learned that dozens of CIA personnel were in Benghazi at the time of the attack, and that there may be ongoing efforts to suppress information about what actually happened. In October 2012, you said that you issued three directives when you learned of the attack, yet these have never been seen. What did you actually do during the Benghazi attack, and why weren’t you more actively involved?

8. Last month, IRS officials testified to Congress that IRS Chief Counsel William J. Wilkins, whom you appointed, was directly involved in reviewing applications for non-profit status by Tea Party groups. He also met with you in April 2012, prior to issuing new “Be on the Lookout” (BOLO) criteria for evaluating such applications. What was your personal knowledge of the IRS scrutiny of conservative groups?

7. Recently your administration launched a new round of peace negotiations between Israel and Palestinian leaders. Israel had repeatedly said that it would negotiate without preconditions, but Palestinian leaders would not. Your administration, through Secretary of State John Kerry, pressed Israel to release 104 terrorists from Israeli jails. Was there a single new concession you demanded from Palestinians?

6. You have publicly dressed down the U.S. military on the issue of sexual assault. In the 2012 campaign, you were very involved in specific controversies, even calling Sandra Fluke, for example. Yet you have refused to say anything about the conduct of a fellow Democrat, Mayor Bob Filner of San Diego, who refuses to resign. Aren’t you setting a bad example on sexual assault, as commander-in-chief, in the Filner case?

5. Edward Snowden has continued to reveal new information about the National Security Agency’s abilities to gather information about Americans’ private communications. Leaving aside the question of whether the government should have that power, or whether you have broken past promises on civil liberties, the fact that these leaks happened at all is striking. Why is Gen. Keith Alexander still the head of the NSA?

4. Recently you announced that you were canceling a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, over the Snowden issue and gay rights. Yet last month, even after Putin indicated he might offer Snowden asylum, you were still offering drastic cuts in America’s nuclear arsenal. It looks like the “reset” with Russia is a failure, after so many concessions. Isn’t it time to stop offering new cuts to U.S. nuclear weapons?

3. You are backing the Senate immigration bill, which passed because Democrats agreed to include border security measures. Regardless of whether those measures are sufficient, they depend on a commitment to enforce the law as written. Yet you have refused to enforce existing immigration laws, even imposing a so-called “Dream Act” by fiat. Why should Americans trust you to enforce a new immigration law?

2. You campaigned on the promise to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan. Yet you have helped the Taliban open a new office in Qatar, complicating relations with President Hamid Karzai, and recently suggested that there could be a “zero option” in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, as the U.S. withdraws, Al Qaeda is on the offensive across the region, and might return. Are we not repeating the mistakes of the past in Afghanistan?

1. You are about to head into a new round of budget negotiations. Some Republicans leaders have suggested that they are willing to offer concessions on the budget sequester if you commit to entitlement reform. You have spoken in theory about making some cuts but have never presented a plan, on paper, and have rejected all suggestions, even the Simpson-Bowles commission. Where is your plan to reform entitlements?

Bonus question: Last month, you spoke at length about how the African-American community views the death of Trayvon Martin case. You also asked people to respect the decision of the jury. Yet your Department of Justice is still aggressively investigating George Zimmerman, who is living in hiding, though all previous investigations showed no racial bias. Aren’t you violating Zimmerman’s civil rights?

UPDATE – Additional bonus question (from the comments): When you signed the Affordable Care Act, it included the Grassley amendment, subjecting members of Congress and their staff to the same rules as everyone else. Yet this week you signed off on special subsidies for members of Congress and their staff. Given your focus on inequality, how do you justify giving Congress Obamacare subsidies?

UPDATE 2 – Another bonus question (via Twitter): There is no longer any doubt that Nidal Hasan was motivated by radical Islamist beliefs. In May, you actually acknowledged for the first time that the Ft. Hood attack was an act of “Islamic jihad.” Yet your administration still considers is “workplace violence,” which denies victims certain benefits. Isn’t it time to declare the Ft. Hood shootings a terrorist act?"

(CNN) - After the emergence of photographs showing Secretary of State John Kerry on his 76-foot yacht “Isabel” on Nantucket Sound on Thursday, the State Department issued an embarrassing correction Friday morning, back-tracking and acknowledging that the Secretary was in fact on the yacht on Wednesday, the day the Egyptian military staged a coup against democratically-elected Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy.

Originally, State Department officials were quick to deny a Wednesday tweet from CBS News’ Mosheh Oinounou that: “A @CBSThisMorning producer just spotted Secretary of State Kerry on yacht in the Nantucket Boat Basin. No response when she shouted ‘Morsi.’”

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki issued a statement Wednesday saying “any report or tweet that he was on a boat is completely inaccurate.”

“Since his plane touched down in Washington at 4 am, Secretary Kerry was working all day and on the phone dealing with the crisis in Egypt,” Psaki said. “He participated in the White House meeting with the President by secure phone and was and is in non-stop contact with foreign leaders, and his senior team in Washington and Cairo.”

But overnight, photographs emerged showing Kerry on “Isabel” and taking in some kayaking on Thursday.

The New York Daily News just published some of them.

On Friday morning, Psaki issued a second statement, acknowledging that Kerry was “briefly on his boat on Wednesday.”



Kerry again swamped by nautical controversy

She went on to say that “Secretary Kerry worked around the clock all day including participating in the President’s meeting with his national security council, and calls with Norwegian Foreign Minister Eade, Qatari Foreign Minister al-Attiyah, Turkish Foreign Minister Davutoglu, Egyptian Constitution Party President ElBaradei and five calls Ambassador Patterson on that day alone and since then he continued to make calls to leaders including Emirati Foreign Minister bin Zayed, Prime Minister Netanyahu and Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr.”

An administration official added that none of those calls happened while Kerry was on his boat."

What with the IRS targeting of tea party groups; the poor security at the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya; the eavesdropping on close allies; and the botched rollout of the landmark healthcare law, Obama increasingly seems to be battling top-level management failures as much as policy or political problems.

On each of these controversies, Obama has claimed ignorance before the fact and outrage afterward, leaving even some Democrats to see him as asleep at the wheel.

“There’s a sort of distance in his style,” said Elaine C. Kamarck, who led the Clinton administration’s government reform effort and now is at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution. “On the one hand, he’s not getting into terrible details like [President] Carter did. But on the other hand, it comes back to bite him because he seems to not know a lot of stuff that’s going on.”

That perception is growing. In public opinion surveys, Obama’s job performance numbers have dropped sharply this year. One poll last week showed his approval down to 42%, a rate comparable to that of President George W. Bush after the horrors of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

PHOTOS: The battle over Obamacare

Although unpredictable crises often upend presidents’ second terms, some of Obama’s worst problems seem self-inflicted.

The iPad-toting president who promised high-tech efficiency in government — even appointing the first chief performance officer, chief technology officer and team of innovation fellows at the White House — has launched his only major domestic policy program with a website that almost feels like a clunky relic from the dial-up age.

“They had a tech-savvy campaign, but that has very little to do with running a tech-savvy government because the presidency really doesn’t run in a management way,” said William Daley, Obama’s chief of staff from January 2011 to January 2012.

“The one kind of surprising thing, since this was the signature” domestic program, Daley said, “and for four years everybody knew this was a complicated, difficult thing to do, that there wasn’t a heavier kind of skepticism around the process.... Can the federal government bite off such an enormous thing?”

The underlying premise of the Obama presidency was an affirmative answer to that question. As a candidate, he vowed to restore government competence to earn back trust, and to make a case for expanding the government’s role in people’s lives.

“We simply cannot afford to perpetuate a system in Washington where politicians and bureaucrats make decisions behind closed doors, with little accountability for the consequences … and where outdated technology and information systems undermine efficiency, threaten our security and fail to serve an engaged citizenry,” Obama said in 2009 as he named Jeffrey Zients, a former corporate chief executive, as chief performance officer, a new title that borrowed from corporate culture.

PHOTOS: 2013’s memorable political moments

If the name is familiar, that’s because Obama tapped Zients again last month, calling him in to consult on the effort to fix the healthcare.gov website.

But Obama did not sustain the zeal for good management, Kamarck said. Initiatives that leaned heavily on updating technology, consumer-friendly interaction and trimming inefficiencies rarely got top billing at the White House.

He hardly discussed his attempt to scale back outside contracting, for example, disappointing those who called for reform. His effort to reorganize Commerce Department agencies that deal with small business stalled when it met resistance in Congress.

In 2012, Zients was named acting chief of the Office of Management and Budget. His previous duties, ensuring the government was setting and achieving performance goals, were shifted to another official. When a new chief performance officer was nominated in September, the post was announced via a news release with a list of nominees.

Inconsistency at the top is part of the problem, said Bob Stone, project director of the Clinton-era government reform effort, which was led by then-Vice President Al Gore. Gore devoted time every day to the project and stayed in close contact with agency heads.

In one of those meetings, during the federal government shutdowns in the mid-1990s, Gore learned that the Justice Department had furloughed its procurement staff, leaving no one to order food at federal prisons. The problem was fixed on the spot, Stone said.

“It seems to be that this White House has no chain to the top, even just the conventional ‘protect the boss’ standard that ought to be in place everywhere,” Stone said. “When something is about to burst, you warn the boss. That’s both a management issue and a political issue.”

PHOTOS: Team Obama, where are they now?

He added, “It’s hard to see that the president has really had any interest in actually managing the government.”

White House spokesman Jay Carney on Friday disputed that claim.

When it comes to U.S. eavesdropping on friendly foreign leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Carney said, the president is a “deliberate consumer” of intelligence reports. But he said Obama was focused on security threats that “keep him up at night,” not a close ally’s phone calls.

On the healthcare rollout, Carney said, the president did not know the website wasn’t fully functional before it was launched Oct. 1.

“The president expects results,” Carney said. “That’s the way he manages this White House. That’s the way he manages this administration. He believes that smart people ought to bring all their talents to bear to solving problems, but he expects results.”

Some past presidents learned the hard way that the mundane work of management can prove crucial.

Bush’s popularity never recovered from his slow response to Katrina’s devastation on the Gulf Coast. Carter’s reelection in 1980 was doomed by his handling of the Iran hostage crisis, when militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held 52 American diplomats for 444 days.

“In both those cases, management issues became the point of no return,” Kamarck said.

Story highlights NEW: The ACLU says it filed a lawsuit against NSA domestic surveillance President Obama slammed by controversies, criticism from the right and left The bitter political divide of his first term remains, and may be getting worse History shows that second terms can be tougher for presidents

(CNN) —

History shows that second terms in the White House can be much tougher than first ones, and that is proving true so far for President Barack Obama.

Less than five months in, Obama and his administration appear knocked off balance by a barrage of controversies and criticisms exacerbating the bitter political battles that marked his first four years in office.

He’s under fire from the right and left, accused by some of conspiratorial machinations to grab even more power than the leader of the free world legally holds.

Headlines are dominated by scandals such as the Internal Revenue Service targeting of conservative groups and classified leaks that disclosed details of the vast data mining and surveillance apparatus created after the 2001 terrorist attacks.

Meanwhile, Republicans and some Democrats say his attorney general should resign over various issues including secret subpoenas of journalist phone records.

Conservative Democrat: Holder should think about quitting

Now, late night comedians are making the controversies a staple of opening monologues, and even the first lady got heckled – at a Democratic fundraiser, no less.

While the issue was gay rights, the incident showed how Obama supporters also were frustrated by what they consider to be a lack of sufficient progress on progressive issues they expect the president to champion.

Second-term blues

Second-term blues have been the norm for presidents in recent decades, with Ronald Reagan facing the Iran-Contra scandal in the 1980s and Bill Clinton getting impeached over the Monica Lewinskly affair in the 1990s.

To columnist and CNN contributor John Avlon, the latest Washington scandals “have put the president off balance,” with the administration on defense instead of driving the agenda.

“The choice will be in how the administration tries to deal with it,” Avlon said. “If it’s in denial and acts like these events are occurring outside its purview or control, that will be a big problem.”

Obama finds himself mired in topics and disputes far from his second-term agenda, in part because he maintained some of the national security policies of his predecessor that were adopted in a nation traumatized by 9/11, noted CNN Senior Political Analyst Gloria Borger.

“This is a president now who’s dealing with issues he never thought he was going to have to deal with,” Borger said Monday, referring to drone strikes, government surveillance and classified leaks. “But when you continue some of the policies of George W. Bush, you’re going to have some of the same questions that are raised about them.”

How should Obama respond?

Avlon and Borger agreed that Obama must be proactive in dealing with the newly revealed details about how the government has access to phone records and Internet activity as tools in fighting terrorism.

Last week’s leak of classified documents on the U.S. intelligence programs forced Obama to try to reassure the nation by declaring “nobody is listening to your telephone calls.”

However, the president who campaigned in 2007 by criticizing what he called his predecessor’s claim of a “false choice” between civil liberties and national security following the 2001 al Qaeda attacks now argued that such a choice was inevitable.

“You can’t have 100% security and also then have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience,” Obama said. “We’re going to have to make some choices as a society.”

12 moments in national security for Obama’s team

Borger said Obama now needs to bolster his administration’s explanation so far – that Congress and federal judges have sufficient oversight to prevent abuses of the information available.

“I think he ought to get out there, speak with the American public, say not only why this kind of surveillance is defensible, but why he thinks it is essential in a post-9/11 world and lay it out there for the American people within the strictures of what he can say given the classified nature of the program,” she said.

CNN Chief National Correspondent John King noted that despite Obama’s insistence his administration struck a proper balance between national security and domestic surveillance, critics from ranging from libertarian GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky to liberal Democratic Sens. Mark Udall of Colorado and Ron Wyden of Oregon are calling for more details and debate.

“If the president doesn’t try to get ahead of it, guess what, he’ll get dragged along with it,” King said.

Other issues on the table

On Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union said it filed a constitutional challenge to the National Security Agency program that collected information on phone calls, arguing it violated First Amendment rights to free speech and association as well as Fourth Amendment rights to privacy.

The controversies come as the administration and Congress wrestle with other volatile issues, including a bipartisan push for immigration reform and a debate over whether to arm Syrian rebels.

Avlon and King agreed that Obama needs to move forward on issues where progress can occur, and both cited the Senate immigration bill that would offer a path to legal status for millions of immigrants living illegally in the United States.

Conservative Republicans fiercely oppose the measure, but more mainstream GOP legislators consider it vital to the party’s hopes of building support among the nation’s fastest-growing demographic – the Hispanic vote.

In last year’s presidential election, exit polls showed Obama trounced GOP nominee Mitt Romney among Hispanic voters.

“The fact that immigration reform looks possible is significant,” Avlon said, saying passage of a bill would be a “significant legacy accomplishment” for Obama and also a boost for Congress at a time of extremely low public approval ratings.

Republicans led by Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama consider the immigration measure drafted by a bipartisan Senate “Gang of Eight” little more than amnesty for undocumented immigrants. They demand stricter border enforcement provisions before providing legal status of the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally.

Despite such opposition, the Senate voted Tuesday to open debate on the measure, with many Republican foes joining Democrats on the procedural move.

However, conservative Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas predicted that while the measure would pass the Senate, it had no chance of winning approval from the GOP-led House unless the pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants was removed.

Meanwhile, the Obama administration is looking at possible options this week to increase support to Syrian rebels after resisting persistent calls for months to provide weapons.

“There is a recognition that unless we provide help, a lot of help, the situation is going to be very, very terrible,” one senior administration official said.

The official described a “somber mood” among Syria hands throughout the administration, who remain frustrated at inaction by the Obama administration in the face of a deterioration on the ground in Syria and spillover to neighboring states like Lebanon.

GOP scrutinizes Justice Department

Republicans are quick to seize on any foreign policy objection with the Obama administration as an opening to attack former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is considered the leading possible Democratic presidential contender in 2016.

In the House, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee has demanded more information on erroneous talking points by the administration four days after the terrorist attack last September on a diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.

Rep. Darrell Issa of California, the panel’s GOP chairman, also is a leading critic of Attorney General Eric Holder over the botched “Fast and Furious” gun walking program and other issues.

Holder now faces further scrutiny over the Justice Department’s secret subpoenas of phone records for Associated Press journalists last year as part of an investigation of a classified leak.

He has told legislators he recused himself from that case and never would prosecute a journalist for doing investigative reporting.

Republicans question if Holder lied to Congress when he told a congressional hearing last month that he had no knowledge of any possible prosecution of journalists linked to classified leaks.

Avlon said the various issues provide grist for Obama critics now, but the major factor in determining public opinion on a presidency will be the economy, which is moving in the right direction for the White House.

“Teflon presidents are Teflon in part because of the economy,” he said, rejecting accusations by some conservatives that Obama’s troubles amount to scandals that could lead to impeachment.

“The impulse to simply throw out Nixon narratives as a poster boy for the second-term curse is silly,” Avlon added. “This ain’t Watergate and calls for impeachment reflect hyperpartisan wishes rather than reality.”

Maybe not impeachment, but certainly fodder for television comedians. For example, David Letterman joked that for his daughter Sasha’s birthday, Obama gave her Justin Bieber’s phone records.

According to reports in the New York Times and Politico, Hillary Clinton “created an arrangement” for Abedin to “work for private clients as a consultant while serving as a top adviser in the department” during her final months at the State Department last year.

The arrangement was reportedly made in June of 2012, when Abedin “quietly left her position” as deputy chief of and became a “special government employee.”

Abedin continued to be publicly identified as Clinton’s “deputy chief of staff,” and she allegedly “did not disclose the arrangement–or how much income she earned–on her financial report” that “requires officials to make public any significant sources of income.”

According to the Times, Abedin “worked for Teneo, a strategic consulting firm, which was founded by Doug Band, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton.” The firm has “advised corporate clients like Coca-Cola and MF Global,” which collapsed while being run by disgraced former New Jersey Governor and top Obama bundler Jon Corzine.

Abedin also “served as a consultant to the William Jefferson Clinton Foundation and worked in a personal capacity” for Hillary Clinton “as she prepared to transition out of her job as secretary of state.”

Officials in the State Department are reportedly sensitive about the arrangement, which ended in March when Abedin became director of Clinton’s transition office.

Even liberal watchdog groups like CREW said the arrangement was “unusual.”

“If she was being held out as a deputy chief of staff, it would be highly unusual for her to be a part-time employee or a consultant,” Melanie Sloan, CREW’s director, told the Times.

These revelations come to light as Abedin’s husband–Weiner–has hired Danny Kedem, a former staffer for Hillary Clinton’s failed 2008 presidential bid, as his campaign manager and is reportedly expected to formally announce next week that he will run for mayor of New York."

Caddell accused GOP consultants of caring more about money than winning elections or principles and engaging in acts that could border on racketeering.

Limbaugh said Caddell “launched both barrels at CPAC” and let the Republican consultant class “have it” while blowing “the lid off of CPAC” with what Limbaugh described was a message that “the Republican consultant class is taking the party down the tubes, that they’re making filthy amounts of money–$150 million a campaign–whether the candidate wins or loses.”

“In my party we play to win. We play for life and death,” Caddell said at a panel in a room that was only one-third full when it started and was standing room only once word spread throughout CPAC that Caddell was blistering the Republican elite. “You people play for a different kind of agenda…Your party has no problem playing the Washington Generals to the Harlem Globetrotters.”

Caddell said this mentality infected Romney, whose campaign consultants thold him to “back off” toward the end of the 2012 election and failed to realize that “you must also get your base” while courting independents.

He then blasted the “CLEC–the consultant, lobbyist, and establishment complex,” which he said was a “self serving interconnected network of individuals and organizations interested in preserving their own power far more than they’re interested in winning elections.”

“I blame the donors who allow themselves to be played for marks,” Caddell continued. “I blame the people in the grassroots for allowing themselves to be played for suckers….It’s time to stop being marks. It’s time to stop being suckers. It’s time for you people to get real.”

Limbaugh read these quotes on his radio show and wholeheartedly endorsed them, for Limbaugh told his listeners that for years he has warned of consultants who claim they have the secret formula for winning over so-called “independents” at the expense of conservatives, and the “candidates fall for it year after year after year” and lose.

“They’re all moderates. None of them are really conservative,” Limbaugh said of the GOP consultant class. “They say they are, and they think they’ve got the recipe to win.”

Limbaugh said the consultant class thinks “people in the middle, these great moderate independents, aren’t conservative. And furthermore, they think that conservatism scares these people” and they “make no effort to educate or inform or correct that impression.”

The conservative radio show host said he has always been confused by consultants who think Republicans will turn off independents by getting aggressive because “Democrats are the meanest, most extreme, insufferable” people and, “there’s nothing nice about them.”

“Somehow that doesn’t scare the independents,” Limbaugh said.

Case in point: Romney’s 2012 loss to Obama.

“He won the independents, just like these brainiacs said,” Limbaugh said. “But four million conservatives sat home and didn’t vote.”

Limbaugh noted that Caddell was right to know that consultants get advertising commissions whether the candidate wins and the GOP leaders threaten candidates they will not receive institutional support if the candidate does not hire their cronies from a list of “approved” consultants and strategists.

He said this was the “foundation for Caddell’s speech at CPAC” and consultants who led the charge of, “The era of Reagan is over,” are not big fans of him or conservatives. He emphasized that he has always been confused about why Republicans have the two Reagan campaigns as blueprints for how to win majorities by running on core beliefs and principles and fail to use them.

Limbaugh said Caddell’s speech about the CLEC was “really important” because it explains why Republicans continue to lose national elections because the consultant class just wants to be liked by the liberal Washington mainstream media and ecosytem.

“You’re happy to be walked all over. You’re just happy to be in the game. You’re happy to be acknowledged,” Limbaugh said of the permanent political class. “I really believe the pursuit to make everybody like you is the greatest prison you could put yourself in.”

Limbaugh said Republicans who want to get liked “cease being” who they are and then “you end up not even knowing who you are.”

Limbaugh blamed Romney’s consultants for telling Romney to “back off” on critical issues like Benghazi and not attack Obama in the final days of the campaign because they did not want to be disliked by their liberal peers in the mainstream media and Washington’s permanent political class.

“You try to be all things to all people, and that can’t be done,” Limbaugh said, noting that the mainstream media wants Republicans to be content with being “perennial losers” who know their place. “This effort to make themselves liked never gets anywhere. They never gain respect.”"

Of course, Mrs. Clinton, if she remained secretary of state, could not participate in a political campaign. So the poll, and the former first lady’s popularity, only intensified speculation that Mr. Obama was considering moving Mrs. Clinton onto his ticket, replacing Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

The idea never gained traction, but all the chatter irritated Mr. Biden.

The next year, when a draft of the president’s speech for the annual White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner included a joke about dropping Mr. Biden from the ticket, Mr. Obama edited it out, fearing that the subject would upset Mr. Biden.

By all accounts, Mr. Biden and Mrs. Clinton have enjoyed a genuine friendship starting in the first days of her husband’s presidential administration, with shared Amtrak rides when they were in the Senate and, during Mr. Obama’s first term, early Saturday morning phone calls that Mr. Biden sometimes ended with “I love you, darling.”"

After all he was involved, publicly, from the beginning.

Last Friday, the American Center for Law and Justice (where I serve as Chief Counsel) filed its Second Amended Complaint against the United States, the IRS, and a legion of IRS officials. This Complaint, in which we represent 41 organizations in 22 states, presents perhaps the most complete story yet of the IRS conservative targeting scandal.

And it is an ugly story indeed.

What was sold to the American public as a low-level scandal perpetrated by a few rogue employees – a scandal stopped after senior officials became aware and asserted control – is now (to borrow a Watergate phrase) “no longer operative.”

[pullquote]

Instead, we detail a long-running assault on the Tea Party, beginning shortly after its emergence in 2009, that is empowered, encouraged, and orchestrated not only by senior IRS officials in Washington, but also through outright targeting by the White House, Congressional Democrats, and the mainstream media.

In fact, the IRS was doing little more than focusing its attention exactly where the president of the United States told it to focus – on the groups the president himself identified as a “threat to democracy.”

Consider President Obama’s aggressive public statements – made just as we now know senior IRS officials were intentionally and aggressively scrutinizing conservative groups’ applications for tax exemption.

On August 9, 2010 the president warned of “attack ads run by shadowy groups with harmless-sounding names” during his weekly radio address. The President said: We don’t know who’s behind these ads and we don’t know who’s paying for them . . . you don’t know if it’s a foreign controlled corporation. ... The only people who don’t want to disclose the truth are people with something to hide.”

On September 16, 2010, President Obama once again warned that some unidentified “foreign-controlled entity” could be providing “millions of dollars” for “attack ads.” Less than one week later, he complained that “nobody knows” the identities of the individuals who support conservative groups.

On September 22, 2010, President Obama warned of groups opposing his policies “pos[ing] as non-for-profit social and welfare trade groups” and he claimed such groups were “guided by seasoned Republican political operatives” and potentially supported by some unidentified “foreign controlled entity.”

On October 14, 2010, President Obama called organizations with “benign sounding” names “a problem for democracy”; the next week he complained about individuals who “hide behind those front groups,” called such groups a “threat to our democracy,” and claimed such groups were engaged in “unsupervised” spending.

Next, consider the IRS’s actions following those statements. Not only did the IRS continue its targeting, it issued broad questionnaires that made unconstitutionally-intrusive inquiries designed to get answers to exactly the questions President Obama posed.

Who are your donors?

What is the political activity of your family and associates?

What are the passwords for your websites?

After all, according to the president, you’re only afraid to answer these questions if “you’ve got something to hide.”

The demagoguery is breathtaking. Not only does he raise the wholly-unsubstantiated possibility of shadowy “foreign” involvement in the Tea Party groups, a charge incredible on its face, but he goes the extra mile of calling such groups, a “threat to our democracy.”

When the president of the United States declares these groups a “threat to our democracy” is it any surprise that his enthusiastic supporters (and donors) within the IRS responded with an unprecedented campaign of selective targeting, intimidation, and governmental intrusion?

One grows weary of stating the obvious, but if President Bush had declared a specific category of citizen groups a “threat to democracy” potentially run by “political operatives” or “foreign-controlled,” and the IRS launched an unprecedented campaign of targeting and intrusive questioning, the mainstream media would have been relentless not only in its independent investigations but in its calls for accountability – at the highest levels.

Was the president of the United States involved in the IRS scandal? He was the one who identified the targets – in the most public manner possible.

A president singling out citizens groups for targeting and intrusive questioning merely because he dislikes their message and fears their political influence?

Now that is a “threat to democracy.”"

White House senior advisor Dan Pfeiffer made the rounds of the Sunday talk shows to vigorously defend Obama over the IRS case, the attacks that killed four U.S. government employees in Benghazi, Libya, and a federal prosecutor’s seizure of the phone records of 20 phone lines belonging to the Associated Press or its reporters and editors.

Republican critics argue the cases reflect a president out of touch and a White House out of control during the 2012 election season, charges that have energized the GOP and that have put Obama on the defensive barely five months into his second term.

The president and his aides have condemned the IRS misbehavior, denounced the GOP inquiries into the Benghazi attack as blatantly partisan, and defended the investigation of AP as necessary to determine who leaked classified information.

Pfeiffer insisted that Obama had no advance knowledge that federal investigators had begun investigating the IRS misdeeds until he learned about it from media reports on May 10.

It is a “cardinal rule … for all White Houses is you do not interfere in an independent investigation and you do not do anything to give off the appearance of interference in an independent investigation,” Pfeiffer said on CNN.

“The activity was outrageous and inexcusable, and it was stopped and it needs to be fixed to ensure it never happens again,” Pfeiffer said. He said anyone “who did anything wrong will be held accountable.”

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) asserted on CNN that a written policy had directed the IRS to target conservative groups, and vowed to find out “who wrote the policy and who approved the policy.” But he acknowledged that he had no direct knowledge that a written policy existed.

Senate minority leader Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said that the IRS case reflected a “culture of intimidation” in the administration. But he acknowledged on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that no evidence yet indicates that the White House ordered the behavior or tried to cover it up.

Rep. Dave Camp (R-Mich.), who heads the House committee looking into the IRS misconduct, also said he has no evidence to suggest Obama had advance knowledge of the IRS actions.

Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said on ABC’s “This Week” that he believed it would be necessary to appoint a special counsel, independent of administration control, to unearth the facts.

A report released last week by an internal Treasury Department inspector general said an IRS unit based in Cincinnati had used “inappropriate” and “politically sensitive” criteria to scrutinize conservative groups that had applied for tax-exempt status, delaying action on some applications for more than 18 months.

http://news.yahoo.com/gop-questions-irs-scrutiny-anti-abortion-groups-071630476.html,,[],GOP questions IRS scrutiny of anti-abortion groups,"IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) — When a small anti-abortion group in Iowa sought nonprofit status, the Internal Revenue Service asked its board to promise not to organize protests outside Planned Parenthood and demanded to know how its prayer meetings and protest signs were educational.

Although the Coalition for Life of Iowa's application was ultimately approved in 2009, the tax collection agency's treatment of that and other anti-abortion groups has gotten new attention in the wake of an ongoing scandal over the alleged targeting of conservative groups.

The IRS apologized for singling out tea party groups for scrutiny in 2010 and 2011, but Republicans now are seizing on the coalition's case to question whether the effort may have been broader and started earlier.

Groups with tax-exempt status, known as 501(c)(3) nonprofits, must have educational, religious or charitable purposes and cannot be involved in elections or engage in substantial lobbying activity. But they can conduct educational campaigns about their causes that do not have to be balanced, and their members retain their constitutional rights to assemble and protest.

U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said Tuesday the IRS was out of bounds in seeking information on the group's prayer activities and a guarantee that it wouldn't protest at Planned Parenthood.

""That's outrageous that that statement would be made by anybody in government, that somehow you've got to compromise your First Amendment rights,"" Grassley said. ""It appears the IRS offered this group a quid pro quo: you can become a charity if you don't protest in front of a Planned Parenthood.""

Outgoing Acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller told Grassley he was unaware of the case, but apologized generally for poor service.

The Iowa group isn't the only anti-abortion organization that appears to have been singled out for scrutiny. In 2011, another IRS employee asked Christian Voices for Life of Fort Bend County in Texas whether it provided ""education on both sides of the issues"" in its programs and whether its members try to speak with anyone entering medical clinics, correspondence shows.

Story continues

Rep. Aaron Schock, R-Ill., said last week that the Iowa and Texas groups faced unfair IRS intrusion into their activities because of ""political and religious bias"" that chilled their constitutional rights. He turned over their IRS correspondence to the inspector general for tax administration and demanded an explanation.

Both groups received tax-exempt status after seeking help from the Thomas More Society, a conservative legal group. But counsel Sally Wagenmaker said the cases were troubling because the IRS asked inappropriate questions about their activities even though their applications should've raised no red flags, and they were forced to retain lawyers to win approval.

""Is it something bigger? I can't say. But is it of concern? Absolutely. Now the IRS is getting into content,"" she said. ""The common thread here is scrutiny on a content basis and seeming to really bend over backwards on the conservative side.""

Tax experts said the IRS inquiries appeared to be misguided attempts to ensure that groups were educational in nature and did not interfere with the rights of patients and employees.

""I can see what they are raising, but it seems to be there are very strong First Amendment issues here,"" said Richard Koontz, director of the Iowa Nonprofit Resource Center. ""You don't want to let one nonprofit stop the activities of another. But you certainly want them to be able to criticize from dawn to dusk what another nonprofit is doing.""

The Iowa group considers its mission to educate citizens about ""the sanctity of life"" and it has held forums on issues such as stem-cell research and euthanasia. Members also routinely walk and pray outside Planned Parenthood in Cedar Rapids. Sue Martinek, the group's president, submitted its application for tax-exempt status in October 2008.

An IRS employee identifying herself as ""Ms. Richards"" from the Cincinnati office responded in April 2009 that she needed more information about its events, including all ""advertisements, schedules, syllabuses, handouts, a summary of each person's speech"" and more, records show.

The coalition turned over those records, including Catholic writings opposing embryonic stem cell research and cloning and brochures handed out at events, including one that accused Planned Parenthood of promoting promiscuous behavior. In follow-up calls, ""Ms. Richards"" asked Martinek whether the group protested outside Planned Parenthood, Martinek said.

""Ms. Richards"" informed her that its prayer gatherings there would be permissible — as long as ""what we were doing would not be construed as protesting or picketing"" and didn't involve harassment, according to a June 2009 email that Martinek sent to Wagenmaker. ""Ms. Richards"" said its application would be approved if board members promised in writing that the group would not protest outside Planned Parenthood, Martinek wrote.

Martinek said she and others were ready to sign such a statement, but that one board member saw it as a free speech violation and contacted Thomas More Society to protest.

Martinek sent a letter to IRS saying that members had debated its request not to organize Planned Parenthood protests, but wanted definitions of ""organize, picketing, protesting"" to ensure compliance. Rather than answer those questions, ""Ms. Richards"" responded with a letter seeking an explanation of how ""prayer meetings held outside of Planned Parenthood are considered educational.""

Wagenmaker responded with a letter saying the inquiries were legally improper and calling for the IRS to grant the application promptly. She said the coalition had organized one event to pray the rosary at Planned Parenthood and that members otherwise assembled there peacefully on their own, carrying signs such as ""Women deserve better than abortion"" that do not contain graphic images.

Days later, the IRS sent its approval notification.

""It was a little weird and it seemed like they wanted lots of information, but we wanted our status,"" Martinek said. ""The IRS is so powerful, we were just hesitant to get on their bad list."""

USA TODAY

Ad advocating legalization was made for about %24350 over three days

It will not appear anywhere inside the track or on track property

Ad says marijuana is %27less harmful than alcohol%27

Fans attending a major NASCAR race this weekend will see a most unlikely video posted on a giant video screen shortly before entering the track: a pro-marijuana legalization ad.

Outside the NASCAR Brickyard 400 in Indianapolis, the same track that hosts the famed Indianapolis 500, Marijuana Policy Project, the nation's largest pro-marijuana legalization advocacy group, has purchased space to air – dozens of times over the weekend – a video that pushes the theme that marijuana is less harmful than alcohol.

It marks the first time a pro-marijuana legalization ad will appear so close to an entrance gate of a major sporting event. The Brickyard 400, in its 20th year, is regarded as one of NASCAR's biggest races.

But the video ad isn't just pro-marijuana. While it's made to look like a beer ad, its tone sounds anti-alcohol. Unlike beer, a narrator in the video says, marijuana has ""no calories,"" ""no hangovers"" and, the ad says, ""it's not linked to violence or reckless behavior.""

The video ends with this tagline: ""Less harmful than alcohol, and time to treat it that way.""

NASCAR has no affiliation with the advertiser or the company selling the inventory, and the ad will not appear anywhere on track property. NASCAR executives declined to comment.

Even then, it makes for a potentially uncomfortable pairing for NASCAR. Crown Royal whiskey is a major sponsor of the race. Miller Lite also is a sponsor.

For the Marijuana Policy Project, the Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group behind the video ad, it's a potential PR bonanza. Over the three-day weekend race, upwards of 600,000 fans may attend the race. The privately-owned track seats 225,000.

""We think it's critical that the public recognize that marijuana is objectively less harmful than alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert, who created the spot and who is a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project. ""We wanted to reach out to an audience that clearly appreciates that adults should be able to use beer and alcohol responsibly. They should also be able to use marijuana responsibly – since it's less harmful.""

He says he bought the ad space from Grazie Media for a ""non-profit"" rate of $2,200. The spot, which he says he and two staffers made with stock film footage for about $350 over three days, is scheduled to appear 72 times over the three-day period.

J. Douglas Boles, president of Indianapolis Motor Speedway, said in a statement that the track is not affiliated with Grazie Media and the ad is not on track property ""or on property over which we have any control.""

Grazie Media executives declined to comment."

The California Supreme Court ruled Monday that cities can ban stores that sell marijuana

The state%27s voter-approved medical marijuana law doesn%27t prevent towns from using zoning to keep pot shops out

The ruling is in response to a 2010 ban in Riverside%2C Calif.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - California cities and counties can ban pot shops, the state's highest court ruled Monday in a unanimous opinion likely to further diminish California's once-robust medical marijuana industry.

The California Supreme Court said neither the state's voter-approved law legalizing medical marijuana nor a companion measure adopted by the Legislature prevent local governments from using their land use and zoning powers to prohibit storefront dispensaries.

The ruling came in a legal challenge to a ban enacted by the city of Riverside in 2010.

""While some counties and cities might consider themselves well-suited to accommodating medical marijuana dispensaries, conditions in other communities might lead to the reasonable decision that such facilities within their borders, even if carefully sited, well managed, and closely monitored, would present unacceptable local risks and burdens,"" Justice Marvin Baxter wrote for the seven-member court.

The advocacy group Americans for Safe Access estimates another 200 jurisdictions statewide have similar prohibitions on retail pot sales. Many were enacted after the number of retail medical marijuana outlets boomed in Southern California after a 2009 memo from the U.S. Justice Department said prosecuting pot sales would be a low priority.

However, the rush to outlaw pot shops has slowed in the 21 months since the four federal prosecutors in California launched a coordinated crackdown on dispensaries by threatening to seize the property of landlords who lease space to the shops. Hundreds of dispensary operators have since been evicted or closed voluntarily.

Marijuana advocates have argued that allowing local governments to bar dispensaries thwarts the intent of the state's medical marijuana law - the nation's first - to make the drug accessible to residents with doctor's recommendations to use it.

Riverside city lawmakers used their zoning authority to declare storefront pot shops as public nuisances and ban the operations in 2010. The Inland Empire Patient's Health and Wellness Center, part of the explosion of retail medical marijuana outlets, sued to stop the city from shutting it down.

A number of counties and cities were awaiting the Supreme Court ruling before moving forward with bans of their own.

A mid-level appeals court previously sided with the city of Riverside, but other courts have come to opposite conclusions. Last summer, a trial judge ruled that Riverside County could not close medical marijuana dispensaries in unincorporated areas because the move did not give the shops any room to operate legally under state law.

Meanwhile, an appeals court in Southern California struck down Los Angeles County's 2-year-old ban on dispensaries, ruling state law allows cooperatives and collectives to grow, store and distribute pot.

The Supreme Court's decision might not be the last word on the issue, however. Pending legislation would establish a new statewide system for regulating and licensing the medical marijuana industry and clarify the role of dispensaries in it.

Activists also are in the early stages of planning a ballot initiative that would legalize the recreational use of marijuana and regulate it like alcohol, as voters in Washington and Colorado did last year."

Updated 8/15/2013 at 11:35 a.m. ET

(CNN) – New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told a desperate father Wednesday that he will decide by Friday whether or not to sign a medical marijuana bill that would make a version of the drug available to the man's epileptic daughter.

The bill, S2842, was passed by the state assembly June 24 with a large majority in the Democratically-controlled legislature, 55-13, but Christie has so far not said whether or not he will sign it. The measure would expand to children the medical marijuana access already in place for adults.



Brian Wilson is the father of two year-old Vivian, who suffers a version of epilepsy called Dravet syndrome. Normal epilepsy medications have so far failed to work for Vivian and her family believes medical marijuana may be able to help.

Father of sick girl to Gov. Christie: Legalize medical marijuana for kids

Trying to get an answer on the bill but unable to get a meeting with the governor, Wilson and members of his family crashed a small Christie campaign stop at a local diner in Scotch Plains, New Jersey. They beseeched the governor to sign the bill and allow for a version of medical marijuana to be administered to Vivian and other children like her.

""I was wondering what the holdup was, it's been like two months now,"" Wilson said to Christie.

Christie responded that while the decision may be simple for Wilson, it's not as simple for the Republican governor. Christie is thought to be a major contender for his party's 2016 nomination for president.

""These are complicated issues,"" Christie told Wilson.

""I know you think it's simple and it's not.""

Christie has in the past expressed trepidation about marijuana. ""I am not going to turn New Jersey into Colorado and California. I'm not legalizing marijuana in New Jersey,"" he said in July.

As for children, Christie said he was ""very reluctant.""

In separate remarks, Christie said that for the medical marijuana bill, ""I'm concerned about expanding the program and I want to make sure that if we do it we do it in a way that is helpful to children,"" Christie said.

Christie worried about going ""down the slippery slope of broadening a program and making it easier to get marijuana that wouldn't necessarily go to other people.""

The Wilson family and their supporters have a website setup called Letters for Vivian where they urge people to write Christie and ask him to support the measure. The letter says that the type of medical marijuana they want for Vivian has no ""high,"" with far less THC than in recreational marijuana. THC is the active ingredient that gets people high.

According to the letter, Vivian has been signed up for medical marijuana but because of her age, she ""has not received any medication due to New Jersey's overreaching and unsafe restrictions"" on the medical marijuana program.

Opinions on the use of marijuana, particularly for medical purposes, have shifted in the United States in recent years, with a growing chorus that it should be made available by prescription.

Why I changed my mind on weed

For his part, Christie promised a response on the medical marijuana bill soon. ""I'll have a decision by Friday,"" he said to Wilson. ""I wish for the best for you, your daughter and your family and I'm going do what I think is best for the people of the state."""

""The war on drugs is now 30, 40 years old,"" he continued. ""There have been a lot of unintended consequences. There's been a decimation of certain communities, in particular communities of color.""

Holder hinted in the interview that the changes could include better prioritization of federal law enforcement and shortened sentences for minor drug offenses. According to NPR, Holder could announce his proposal as early as next week in a speech to the American Bar Association in San Francisco.

While Holder and the Obama administration have drawn criticism for publicly embracing a laissez-faire approach to marijuana laws but cracking down anyway, some observers believe this proposal for reform could be genuine.

""The country is in a bipartisan moment [in regard to drug policy] that makes major criminal justice reform possible,"" Bill Piper, Director of National Affairs of the Drug Policy Alliance, told The Huffington Post. ""You see it with bipartisan bills in Congress and bipartisan calls for sentencing reform. There's an opportunity that the administration realizes it can take advantage of, and I hope that they do.""

Indeed, bills like the Smarter Sentencing Act, which would lower mandatory minimums in sentencing, and the Justice Safety Valve Act, which would grant judges more leniency in imposing lesser sentences, were both introduced by bipartisan authors.

Piper also hopes the time might be right to address federal recommendations for marijuana law enforcement.

""They've been mentioning new recommendations on marijuana for the past year,"" said Piper. ""They've been slow on it for certain, but that is undoubtedly connected to drug policy. This would be a good time to address both."""

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/laura-carlsen/how-legalizing-marijuana_b_777837.html,2010-11-02 15:55:31-04:00,[],How Legalizing Marijuana Would Weaken Mexican Drug Cartels,"In the months leading up to today's vote on California's Proposition 19 to legalize recreational use of marijuana, opponents of legalization have issued a barrage of confused and contradictory arguments. Their aim is to somehow debunk the common-sense fact that legal sourcing erodes the black-market profits of organized crime.

The most recent argument thrown out in the anti-Prop. 19 campaign, claims that the California marijuana market is insignificant to Mexican drug traffickers.

That argument was blown out of the water on October 18 when the Mexican Army and police seized 134 tons of marijuana, wrapped and ready to be smuggled from Tijuana across the border. The huge cache was estimated to be worth at least $338 million dollars on the street. Mexican authorities guessed that it was owned by the nation's most powerful drug-trafficking organization, the Sinaloa Cartel.

Even if much of that is distributed to other states, the sheer size of the potential shipment shows that the U.S. marijuana market for Mexican traffickers, calculated at $20 billion a year, is well worth fighting for. Since before Prop. 19 came along, reports showed that Mexico's drug cartels were concerned about how U.S. production and legalization of medical marijuana cut into their profits.

Prohibition creates the underground market that generates their economic, political and military strength. With the drop in income from marijuana sales, cartels have less money for buying arms and politicians, or recruiting young people into the trade.

The drug cartels also consider the marijuana black market worth killing for. Just days after the historic bust, thirteen young men were massacred at a drug rehabilitation center. An anonymous voice came over police radio saying the act was ""a taste of Juarez"" and that up to 135 people could be murdered in retaliation for the bust--one per ton.

Although calculating Mexican cartel earnings from marijuana sales will always be a guessing game, it's indisputable that as long as it's illegal every penny of those earnings goes into the pockets of organized crime. From the peasant who converts his land from corn to pot to feed his family, to the truckdriver who takes on a bonus cargo, to the Mexican and U.S. border officials who open ""windows"" in international customs controls, to the youth gangs who sell in U.S. cities--all are sucked into a highly organized and brutal system of contraband.

Legalization in part of the world's leading market would take a huge chunk out of this transnational business.

The government of Mexican president Felipe Calderon, along with Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos, has redoubled efforts in U.S. media and international forums to oppose the California legalization measure. This is not surprising. These two nations are deeply entrenched in a military-model drug war that has channeled a combined total of nearly $9 billion dollars in U.S. government funds to their governments. As in any war, powerful political and economic interests are at stake in perpetuating the drug war.

It's interesting to see what they say though. Neither President Santos nor Calderon argue that legalization will strengthen drug cartels. Instead, both complain that legalization will erode their drug war by heightening the contradiction between violent crackdowns on growers and traffickers in their countries and the lax attitude toward consumption of marijuana in the United States.

At a recent meeting of the Tuxtla Dialogue in Cartagena, Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos said, ""It's confusing for our people to see that, while we lose lives and invest resources in the fight against drug trafficking, in consuming countries initiatives like California's referendum are being promoted.""

It's about time that contradiction was exposed. But the way to resolve it is not to increase fumigation operations that destroy peasant livelihoods and the environment and seizures of marijuana shipments that lead to the deaths of innocent civilians, while further criminalizing consumption in the U.S. The way to resolve it is to halt ineffective measures to stop marijuana use, and focus scarce resources on attacking the financial and violent aspects of transnational organized crime, and providing employment and services for vulnerable sectors. Legalization of marijuana, in addition to reducing the economic base of the cartels, frees up resources to do just that.

In a report from the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy former presidents of Mexico, Colombia, Brazil called for discussion on legalizing marijuana, noting, ""Prohibitionist policies based on the eradication of production and on the disruption of drug flows as well as on the criminalization of consumption have not yielded the expected results. We are farther than ever from the announced goal of eradicating drugs."" They add that corruption and violence have increased throughout the region as result of the strategy.

The war on drugs launched by President Felipe Calderon has led to more than 30,000 drug-related deaths since late 2006 and the skyrocketing of human rights violations committed by security forces. Last week an international Forum against militarization and violence in Ciudad Juarez, the epicenter of the drug war, was disrupted when police shot a peace protester.

As Calderon insists that there is ""no alternative"" to the militarized drug war, a recent survey shows that three-fourths of Mexicans polled believe the drug war is failing. Particularly in border towns, grassroots organizations have formed to protest the violence and high social costs. Meanwhile, the government has largely bypassed non-violent ways to reduce the power of cartels, such as legalization, anti-money laundering efforts and social programs to strengthen affected communities in favor of the military/police model supported by the U.S. government.

Organized crime is a business. Reducing demand through providing legal sources hurts that business. Hardline rhetoric and wars of statistics cannot change that fundamental equation.

Nearly 17 years after voters in the state legalized medical marijuana, the court ruled unanimously in a legal challenge to a ban the city of Riverside enacted in 2010.

The advocacy group Americans for Safe Access estimates that another 200 jurisdictions statewide have similar prohibitions on retail pot sales. Many were enacted after the number of retail medical marijuana outlets boomed in Southern California after a 2009 memo from the U.S. Justice Department said prosecuting pot sales would be a low priority.

However, the rush to outlaw pot shops has slowed in the 21 months since the four federal prosecutors in California launched a coordinated crackdown on dispensaries by threatening to seize the property of landlords who lease space to the shops. Hundreds of dispensary operators have since been evicted or closed voluntarily.

Marijuana advocates have argued that allowing local government to bar dispensaries thwarts the intent of the state’s medical marijuana law — the nation’s first — to make the drug accessible to residents with doctor’s recommendations to use it.

The ruling came in the case filed after Riverside city lawmakers used zoning powers to declare storefront pot shops as public nuisances and ban the operations in 2010. The Inland Empire Patient’s Health and Wellness Center, part of the explosion of retail medical marijuana outlets, sued to stop the city from shutting it down.

A number of counties and cities were awaiting the Supreme Court ruling before moving forward with bans of their own.

A mid-level appeals court previously sided with the city of Riverside, but other courts have come to opposite conclusions. Last summer, a trial judge ruled that Riverside County could not close medical marijuana dispensaries in unincorporated areas because the move did not give the shops any room to operate legally under state law.

Meanwhile, an appeals court in Southern California struck down Los Angeles County’s 2-year-old ban on dispensaries, ruling state law allows cooperatives and collectives to grow, store and distribute pot."
http://news.yahoo.com/first-state-licensed-marijuana-retailers-open-january-1-121942452--sector.html,,[],First state-licensed marijuana retailers to open January 1 in Colorado,"By Keith Coffman DENVER (Reuters) - The world's first state-licensed marijuana retailers, catering to Colorado's newly legal recreational market for pot, are stocking their shelves ahead of a New Year's grand opening that supporters and detractors alike see as a turning point in America's drug culture. Possession, cultivation and private personal consumption of marijuana by adults for the sake of just getting high has already been legal in Colorado for more than year under a state constitutional amendment approved by voters. But starting January 1, cannabis will be legally sold and taxed at specially regulated retailers in a system modeled after a regime many states have in place for alcohol sales - but which exists for marijuana nowhere outside of Colorado. For the novelty factor alone, operators of the first eight marijuana retailers slated to open on Wednesday morning in Denver and a handful of establishments in other locations are anticipating a surge in demand for store-bought weed. ""It will be like people waiting in line for tickets to a Pink Floyd concert,"" said Justin Jones, 39, owner of Dank Colorado in Denver who has run a medical marijuana shop for four years and now has a recreational pot license. Jones said he is confident he has enough marijuana on hand for Day One but less sure of inventory levels needed after that. About 90 percent of his merchandise is in smokable form, packaged in small child-proof containers. The rest is a mixture of cannabis-infused edibles, such as cookies, candy and carbonated drinks. ""People seem to prefer smoking,"" he said. FROM MEDICAL TO RECREATIONAL Washington state voters legalized recreational marijuana at the same time Colorado did, in November 2012, but it has yet to be made commercially available there. Pot designated strictly for medical use has been sold for some time in storefront shops in several of the nearly 20 states, including Colorado and Washington, that have deemed marijuana legal for health purposes. But Colorado is the first to open retail pot stores, and craft a regulatory framework to license, tax and enforce its use for recreation. Outside of the United States, Uruguay's parliament recently cleared the way for state-sanctioned marijuana sales, but the South American nation is at least months away from having a system in place. The Netherlands has long had an informal decriminalization policy, with Amsterdam coffee shops allowed to sell marijuana products to customers. But back-end distribution of the drug to those businesses remains illegal. ""It will actually be fully legal in Colorado, at least under state law, whereas in the Netherlands it's been tolerated, not actually legal,"" Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, a pro-liberalization group, told reporters earlier this month. ""Colorado is essentially the first. It's really the first in which this is explicitly legal and where marijuana is being grown legally, sold wholesale legally, sold retail legally,"" Nadelmann said. ""This is groundbreaking,"" said Mike Elliot, spokesman for Colorado's Medical Marijuana Industry Group. ""We are way ahead of Washington state, Amsterdam and Uruguay."" Critics of liberalized marijuana laws likewise view Colorado's new order as a landmark, albeit one they see in a more negative light. Kevin Sabet, co-founder of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a leading anti-legalization group, said the movement toward ending pot prohibition is sending the wrong signal to the nation's youth. ENDING PROHIBITION ""There will still need to be a black market to serve people who are ineligible to buy on a legal market, especially kids,"" Sabet said. ""It's almost the worst of both worlds."" Critics say the social harms of legalizing pot - from anticipated declines in economic productivity to a potential rise in traffic and workplace accidents - will outweigh any benefits. Legalization backers point to tax revenues to be gained and argue that anti-marijuana enforcement has accomplished little but to penalize otherwise law-abiding citizens, especially minorities. They also argue that legalization will free up strained law enforcement resources and strike a blow against drug cartels, much as repealing alcohol prohibition in the 1930s crushed bootlegging by organized crime. But Sabet counters, ""We are witnessing the birth of big marijuana,"" which he compared to the tobacco industry. Under Colorado's law, however, state residents can only buy as much as an ounce of marijuana at a time, while individuals from out of state are limited to quarter-ounce purchases. State law also limits cultivation to six marijuana plants per person. Those limits were not enough to deter a 30-year-old high school sports coach who is visiting Colorado from North Carolina but gave his name only as Matt. ""I don't really drink a whole lot, but I'd prefer to smoke a little bit and have a good time with the friends that I hang out with,"" he told Reuters on Friday. His New Year's plans include a ""Cannabition"" pot party in Denver. Marijuana remains classified an illegal narcotic under U.S. law. But in a major policy shift in August, the Obama administration said it would give states leeway to experiment with pot legalization, and let Colorado and Washington carry out their new laws permitting recreational use. The state has issued a total of 348 recreational pot licenses to businesses statewide, according to the Colorado Department of Revenue's Marijuana Enforcement Division. Of those, 136 are for retail stores, 178 for cultivation operations, 31 for manufacturing of infused edibles and other sundries, and three are for testing facilities. Last month, Colorado voters approved a combined 15 percent excise and 10 percent sales tax to be imposed on recreational pot sales, with the first $40 million raised to fund school construction projects. The Colorado Legislative Council estimates the marijuana taxation scheme will generate $67 million annually in tax revenue to state coffers. Only people over age 21 can buy recreational pot. Public use of marijuana remains illegal, as is driving while stoned. The state has set a blood-THC (the active ingredient in cannabis) limit of 5-nanogram-per-milliliter threshold for motorists. Other states are taking a wait-and-see approach to the Colorado and Washington experiments before they take the leap toward legalization, said Rachel Gillette, head of Colorado's chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. ""Colorado has found an exit strategy for the failed drug war and I hope other states will follow our lead,"" she said.

USA TODAY

Several companies offer tours that supply marijuana

Marijuana may be smoked by adults but only in private

Most ski areas are on leased federal lands where marijuana use remains illegal

Colorado's ski resorts and mountain towns are bracing for an influx of tourists seeking a now-legal Rocky Mountain high.

Last year, the state legalized the possession and use of small amounts of recreational marijuana, and on Jan. 1 special stores will be allowed to sell pot to anyone 21 and over. Voters had previously approved a medical marijuana system, but last fall's vote threw the doors wide open by requiring state officials to regulate pot like alcohol.

With several companies offering marijuana tours — sightseeing tours of the state's high country, with marijuana supplied — police and ski area operators worry that tourists who don't understand the rules will be sparking up on the slopes.

""We're delving into truly uncharted territory here,"" said Summit County Sheriff John Minor, whose jurisdiction covers the Arapahoe Basin, Keystone and Breckenridge ski areas. ""We do have this misperception in Summit County where people have smoked in public, been charged, and were under the perception that it's a free-for-all.""

Under the law, marijuana may be smoked by adults but only in private. But exactly what ""private"" means is still the subject of debate. Minor says a private vehicle on a public road, for example, is considered ""in public.""

Marijuana tour operator Timothy Vee of Colorado High Life Tours says to get around those rules, his drivers sometimes pull into a parking lot, allowing tour guests to partake of the pot he offers. Under current law, it's legal to give another adult marijuana as long as there's no direct payment for it. Vee and other operators charge people to rent the limo and driver and say the pot, snacks and soda are free.

For $1,200 a day, tourists can rent a chauffeured minibus from Vee to pick them up at their hotel and drive them to the slopes while they use marijuana during the ride. Vee said concerns about impaired skiers and riders are overblown. After all, he says, every ski area has a bar at the bottom of the slope. And for decades, skiers and snowboarders in Colorado have been ducking into the trees for a mid-run toke. Many ski areas are home to illicitly built ""smoke shacks"" tucked between the slopes, and locals often refer to gondola ski lifts as ""ganja-las.""

""What I'm getting are a lot of old stoners, and a lot of wealthy people who want to come do it safely with a concierge,"" Vee said. ""Now the kids are gone, they're 60 years old and they want to get high.""

Ski resorts worry their slopes' family-friendly image will take a hit if out-of-state tourists start thinking their kids will be exposed to marijuana smoke in lift lines and gondolas. At Arapahoe Basin in October, mountain manager Al Henceroth confiscated passes from several skiers he caught publicly sharing a joint.

In a series of blog posts that drew sometimes-vitriolic responses, Henceroth made a key point: Because most ski areas are on leased federal lands, marijuana use remains illegal.

""We will not hesitate to call the cops on this issue,"" wrote Henceroth, who declined to be interviewed.

Jenn Rudolph, a spokeswoman for the industry group Colorado Ski Country USA, said people who smoke in lift lines and on the slopes will be prosecuted, either by federal forest rangers or local law enforcement working with the resorts. Getting caught smoking pot by a ranger brings a minimum $250 citation, Forest Service officials said. Last year, rangers wrote 112 tickets for marijuana use at Colorado ski areas. This year, they had already written 93 through this September.

""Colorado is a family-friendly ski destination, and the law is clear that you can't smoke marijuana in public,"" Rudolph said. ""Resorts are going to do what they need to do to enforce that.""

Hughes also reports for the Fort Collins Coloradoan."

Marijuana businesses are drawing the eye of investors, who see it as a growth industry. Ted S. Warren / AP file

It looks like any other business conference — lots of suits, name badges, a long line to the buffet — except that the 700 people who each paid $599 to be in this conference hall south of Seattle are in an industry unlike any other: marijuana.

The people at this meeting aren’t Cheech and Chong. They’ve come bearing business degrees and investor money, looking for the next great thing.

""This conference is 100 percent focused on business,"" said Chris Walsh, editor of the Medical Marijuana Business Daily. His publication is sponsoring the National Marijuana Business Conference. Now in its second year, attendance has doubled, and more than 30 exhibitors paid as much as $16,000 to talk about investments, equipment, legal services and accounting.

""There's a lot of other types of shows out there that are for the typical stoners,"" Walsh said. ""This is all business and financial.""

The pot business is, well, growing. A Gallup poll shows that U.S. support for legalizing cannabis has reached 58 percent. Election night saw pro-marijuana laws passing in places such as Portland, Maine, and Lansing, Mich.

""It's an incredibly exciting time to be in the cannabis industry,"" said Tripp Keber, an investor and the managing director of Dixie Elixirs & Edibles, which sells products laced with THC (tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive ingredient in pot) to medical marijuana dispensaries.

Business has tripled in 2013, according to Keber.

""Three years ago, nobody was interested in investing, but just yesterday I met with a hedge fund. I met with institutional investors,"" he said.

Investment action is ramping up as the two states that have legalized recreational ""adult use"" pot — Washington and Colorado — begin to issue licenses and the first retail outlets prepare to open. The federal government said in August that the Justice Department would not stop states from creating their own regulatory and taxation frameworks.

That federal decision to step back in turn unleashed ""pent-up demand"" from investors, said Troy Dayton, co-founder and CEO of the ArcView Group, which conducts market research on the pot industry. It recently released a report predicting that the legal marijuana business will increase 64 percent this year and top $10 billion within five years.

""This is the next great American industry,"" Dayton said.

Banking and taxes

But there are a few weeds in the weed patch. One is banking. Though the federal government is looking the other way, banks remain reluctant to offer a place for growers and sellers to safely store their cash.

At the same time, new private equity and venture capital investors are coming out of the woodwork. Many want to invest in products and services not directly related to pot itself, such as security systems and software programs.

""Mark Twain had a great quote,"" said Dayton. ""He said that when there is a gold rush on, it's a good time to be in the pick and shovel business.""



The larger dilemma, however, may be the taxes on recreational pot. How high is too high? Colorado voters passed a 25 percent tax on it, more than three times the state tax on medical pot. Washington has mandated a tax of at least 50 percent, versus no tax on medical marijuana.

""I don't think it has gone very well,"" said Shy Sadis on the rollout of Washington's new law.

Sadis, a longtime owner of several medical pot dispensaries in Seattle, is applying for retail licenses to sell recreational cannabis. State officials want to close all untaxed, unregulated medical outlets and move everyone into the taxed, regulated recreational side — even though there will be far fewer outlets and the product will cost a lot more.

""A lot of patients come in here and are upset that medical is going to be gone, and they're thinking, 'Wow, maybe my vote should have went the other way,'"" Sadis said.



Keber is confident that buyers will eventually migrate to a taxed, regulated, tested, legitimate system. ""The alcohol industry has had 80 years to get the process right,"" he said.

Whether it takes 80 years or 80 days, few believe the momentum toward legalization will go up in smoke.

""No one knows how this is going to play out,"" said editor Walsh. ""We're going to find out in a couple months.""

A %242.2 million OAS study says marijuana legalization should be considered

A U.S. spokesman called legalization %27not viable%27

The report said there was %27no significant support%27 for legalization of cocaine

LIMA, Peru (AP) — An Organization of American States study released Friday is calling for a serious discussion on legalizing marijuana.

Drug policy reform advocates called the report historic, even though it made no specific proposals and said there was ""no significant support"" among the OAS' 35 member states for legalizing cocaine, the drug that most directly affects South America.

""This is the first time any multilateral organization anywhere has done something like this,"" said Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance.

The $2.2 million study was commissioned in response to calls by some Latin American leaders at last year's Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, for a rethinking of the war on drugs. Reform advocates call the more than $20 billion that Washington has spent on counterdrug efforts in Latin America over the past decade a damaging waste of taxpayer money.

""Sooner or later decisions in this area will need to be taken,"" says the study, which was presented by outgoing OAS Secretary-General Jose Miguel Insulza in Bogota.

The study examines four different scenarios for confronting the illicit drug trade, which has fueled violent crime and corruption, especially in drug production and transit countries, including destabilizing governments.

The most controversial scenario would involve countries unilaterally abandoning the fight against drug production and trafficking in their territory in order to reduce violence.

President Otto Perez Molina of Guatemala, a hard-hit cocaine transit country along with neighboring Honduras, made headlines before the Cartagena summit when he said he was tempted to put his country on such a path.

The report's authors conclude, however, ""that there is no absolute link between the drug problem and the insecurity experienced by many citizens in the Americas.""

Accompanying Insulza on Friday was Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, whose country remains the No. 1 source of cocaine consumed by U.S. citizens.

Santos said the report presented ""simple, realistic options"" for future action in order to ""reduce the deaths, the violence that drug trafficking wreaks, the consumption of drugs and the profits of criminals.""

The 400-page study emphasizes drug abuse as primarily a public health issue and suggests drug abusers should not be criminally prosecuted but rather treated as ill.

""Decriminalization of drug use needs to be considered as a core element in any public health strategy,"" it says.

That echoes the approach of the U.S. government. But it diverges from Washington's longstanding opposition to legalizing marijuana despite the fact that voters in two states — Colorado and Washington — have done that.

Nadelmann said the U.S. government has in the past suppressed any multilateral attempt to promote discussion of alternatives to the current drug war.

""The notion that the OAS would actually convene 50 people, including a number of my allies and people associated with reform, and then have this open-ended discussion and then produce a report that was not subject to intensive political review and censorship is actually extraordinary,"" he said from New York.

Rafael Lemaitre, spokesman for the White House's drug czar, said in response to the report that ""any suggestion that nations legalize drugs like heroin, cocaine, marijuana, and methamphetamine runs counter to an evidenced-based, public health approach to drug policy and are not viable alternatives.""

The report was released two weeks before Guatemala hosts the OAS General Assembly, where the subject of drugs tops the agenda.

Nadelmann said the report reflects to a large degree of interest in Latin America with voter-driven marijuana legalization in the United States.

Uruguay's president, Jose Mujica, is pushing marijuana legalization and wants to put the government in charge of sales.

Other findings of the study:

—Drug abuse is the 15th direct cause of death in the OAS' northern countries, 40th in Andean countries and 52nd in Central America. That supports arguments that the United States and Canada bear more responsibility for illicit drug demand.

— Retail sales of illicit drugs account for 65% of drug profits, while farmers or producers get 1%."

Gupta, who previously opposed legalizing marijuana, says he’s woken up and smelled the proverbial plant life.

“I apologize because I didn’t look hard enough, until now. I didn’t look far enough,” he wrote in a CNN article. “I didn’t review papers from smaller labs in other countries doing some remarkable research, and I was too dismissive of the loud chorus of legitimate patients whose symptoms improved on cannabis.”

Marijuana was made illegal after assistant Health Secretary Roger Egeberg wrote a letter in 1970, pointing to a “considerable void in our knowledge” about marijuana and that the U.S. should wait to legalize it until there was enough research to “resolve the issue.”

So marijuana was made illegal because of the lack of sound science — but, as Gupta points out, it’s hard to do research in the United States on cannabis when it’s already illegal. And though a fair amount of work is done — more than 20,000 papers just recently, Gupta noted — just 6% of the studies Gupta counted up look at the potential benefits. The rest investigate potential harm, an inherent bias that leads to a profoundly distorted view.

In any case, research outside the U.S. reveals that marijuana has been shown to be effective for medical problems from seizures to neuropathic pain, said Gupta, who is using his research in a documentary called “Weed,” which airs Sunday at 5 p.m. PDT on CNN.

And yet, doctors instead prescribe drugs such as morphine and oxycodone for issues like neuropathic pain, many of which have been shown to to be less than effective and — as a Times series on prescription drug deaths points out — addictive and deadly.

“It is irresponsible not to provide the best care we can as a medical community,” Gupta wrote, “care that could involve marijuana.”

For supporters of the state laws, the policy marked a milestone that they believe will boost their efforts to legalize marijuana in other states, including Oregon, Nevada, Massachusetts and Alaska. But for those who have been fighting the legalization of marijuana, the announcement increased their concern.

“The green rush is upon us. The federal government is saying, ‘We’re just going to back off,’” said a disappointed Derek Franklin, president of the Washington Assn. of Substance Abuse and Violence Prevention, which had campaigned against the state law.

On the other side Alex Cooley, co-founder of Solstice, said to be the first legal cannabis-growing facility in Washington state, called the action a “very large step forward,” but that he expected the controversy to continue. “It is not the end of the war on the prohibition of cannabis.”

But conflict between the Colorado and Washington state laws and federal law — which still considers marijuana a Schedule I drug, along with cocaine and heroin — had been a source of tension and confusion.

Many marijuana advocates said the discord prompted some municipalities to take a wait-and-see approach to enacting zoning and other regulations to permit pot sales, not knowing what the federal ramifications would be.

“I do think it will bring some level of relief or comfort,” said Rachel Gillette, the Colorado executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. “You can operate without fear the [Drug Enforcement Administration] is going to come seize your property and send you to prison.”

But the policy also represents something larger. “It’s a loud statement from the Obama administration that their intent is to let the experiment happen,” said John Davis, executive director of the Washington state-based Coalition for Cannabis Standards and Ethics.

“It’s huge,” he said. “The fact it mentions adult recreational use is historic.”

Franklin, whose organization opposes the Washington state law, said Thursday’s announcement “really opens the door for other states even wider.” He said not enough has been done to regulate the risk of marijuana abuse. He cautioned against empowering the marijuana industry, which he compared to the tobacco and alcohol industries.

But Gillette said this could represent a shift from handling marijuana in punitive ways toward education and rehabilitation.

“We’re finally reaching a point where we can look at alternatives to prohibition,” she said. “It’s become very, very clear that the war on drugs has failed and we need to look at alternative ways to deal with illicit drugs. I’m hoping this will inspire the federal government to treat drug abuse as a health issue, rather than throw [abusers] in jail and leave them there.”

I Got Tested For My Job,"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution

What this means is the government has to have "" information sufficient to warrant a prudent person's belief that the wanted individual had committed a crime (for an arrest warrant) or that evidence of a crime or contraband would be found in a search (for a search warrant) "". A person walking down the street can't be stopped or their house can't be searched unless the police have a concrete reason to stop the person or search the house. The police have to go before a judge and explain their probable cause and if the judge agrees then a warrant is issued for a search or an arrest.

Testing welfare recipients violates that principle because the government is searching a person without knowledge that the person is in fact taking drugs. The common saying is that it would be a ""fishing expedition"". Courts tend to frown on fishing expeditions.

Even police at traffic stops for drug interdiction have to ask the driver for permission to search their vehicle and only if they refuse do they bring a dog in to sniff the outside of the car. If the dog gets a hit then the police have probable cause to search the car.

As the ACLU states concerning drug testing for welfare recipients:

The ACLU challenged the mandatory drug testing program as unconstitutional, arguing that drug testing of welfare recipients violates the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches. The case, Marchwinski v. Howard, concluded when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld a lower court's decision striking down the policy as unconstitutional. In halting the implementation of Michigan's drug testing law, U.S. District Court Judge Victoria Roberts ruled that the state's rationale for testing welfare recipients ""could be used for testing the parents of all children who received Medicaid, State Emergency Relief, educational grants or loans, public education or any other benefit from that State.""[18] Indeed, any of the justifications put forth to subject welfare recipients to random drug testing would also by logical extension apply to the entirety of our population that receives some public benefit and/or that is a parent. It is clear that our constitution – and common sense – would object to the random drug testing of this large group of people, making the drug testing of an equally absurd category of people – welfare recipients – unconstitutional as well. Drug Testing of Public Assistance Recipients as a Condition of Eligibility

But Doug, you are saying, I got tested before I got hired at my job? Fair is fair, right?

The ACLU also is opposed to pre-employment drug testing, but sometimes people forget our Bill of Rights don't always apply to private businesses.

The court has read the Fourth Amendment to prohibit only those government searches or seizures that are ""unreasonable."" Because of this, businesses that are in an industry that is ""closely regulated"" can be searched more frequently and can be searched without a warrant. In one case, an auto parts dealer at a junkyard was charged with receiving stolen auto parts. Part of his defense was to claim that the search that found incriminating evidence was unconstitutional. But the court found the search reasonable, because the dealer was in a ""closely regulated industry."" Note again that constitutional guarantees like the Fourth Amendment apply to governmental action. Your employer or any private enterprise is not bound by constitutional limits. For example, if drug testing of all employees every week is done by government agency, the employees may have a cause of action to object based on the Fourth Amendment. However, if a private employer begins the same kind of routine drug testing, employees have no constitutional arguments to make; they can simply leave that employer, or they may pursue whatever statutory or common-law remedies are available. Introduction to the Law of Property, Estate Planning, and Insurance (4.5 Business and the Bill of Rights)

It is kind of ironic that some of the same friends supporting random drug testing of poor people are the same ones who objected when the story about employers asking for Facebook passwords came out . They claimed the same arguments I'm using here against drug testing to oppose giving up their passwords. I don't see the difference between drug testing and giving up passwords although the 4th amendment is stronger for drug testing than giving up passwords.

I haven't even addressed the fact that drug testing of poor people is both a waste of tax dollars and only catches a insignificant number of drug users.

The state of Florida passed an almost identical testing procedure that ran from 1999 to 2001 and was reintroduced in July of 2011 that was struck down by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta the following month, citing the fact: ""there is nothing inherent to the condition of being impoverished that supports the conclusion that there is a `concrete danger' that impoverished individuals are prone to drug use."" The Tampa Tribune investigated the results of those July 2011 drug tests and found that ""96 percent proved to be drug free"", another 2 percent never bothering to complete the lengthy application process, and 2 percent actually failing drug testing. At an average cost of $30 per test, the state was hemorrhaging tax dollars at a rate of ""$28,800-$43,200 monthly""... FAR out pacing the supposed ""savings"" from preventing drug-abusers from gaming the system to buy drugs. Texas Senate Unanimously Votes to Drug Test Welfare Applicants

Drug testing is expensive. The average cost of a drug test is about $42 per person tested,[8] not including the costs of hiring personnel to administer the tests, to ensure confidentiality of results and to run confirmatory tests to guard against false positives resulting from passive drug exposure, cross-identification with legal, prescription drugs such as codeine and legal substances such as poppy seeds.

Another way to measure the cost is by counting what it costs to ""catch"" each drug user. Drug testing is not used by many private employers because of the exorbitant cost of catching each person who tests positive. One electronics manufacturer, for example, estimated that the cost of finding each person who tested positive was $20,000, since after testing 10,000 employees, only 49 tested positive. A congressional committee also estimated that the cost of each positive drug test of government employees was $77,000, because the positive rate was only 0.5%.[9] Mandatory drug testing is an ineffective means to uncover drug abuse. An Oklahoma study found that a questionnaire was able to accurately detect 94 out of 100 drug abusers. The questionnaire was also useful in detecting alcohol abusers, something drug tests fail to accomplish.[10]

Certain counties in Oregon experimented with drug testing on some welfare recipients, but the process was halted when it was found that drug testing was less effective in identifying drug abuse than less invasive, cheaper methods.[11]

Most types of drug tests fail to detect alcohol abuse – the most commonly abused substance among Americans – and are most likely to detect marijuana use since the active ingredient in marijuana stays in the body's system longer than any other illicit substance. Therefore, drug tests often fail to identify people who are using more powerful, more addictive and more dangerous drugs like methamphetamine or cocaine, which exit the body's system in a matter of hours or days.[12] Many states have rejected the random drug testing of welfare recipients as impractical and fiscally unjustifiable. For example, New York and Maryland each considered a program to randomly drug test those receiving welfare, but abandoned the plan as not cost-effective, given that urinalysis is almost exclusively a barometer of marijuana use and that welfare recipients are required to undergo regular supervision, allowing for effective monitoring absent the cost and intrusion of mandatory drug testing.[13]

Louisiana passed a law in 1997 requiring drug testing for welfare recipients. However, a task force set up to implement the law found more limited drug testing of individuals identified by a questionnaire to be more cost-effective than mandatory drug testing.[14]

Alabama decided against drug testing because it found that focusing on job training programs was a more effective method of moving individuals off of welfare.[15] Drug Testing of Public Assistance Recipients as a Condition of Eligibility

Sen. Tim Schaffer plans to introduce legislation today that would establish a drug-testing pilot program for Ohio Works First applicants. ""It is time that we recognize that many families are trying to survive in drug-induced poverty, and we have an obligation to make sure taxpayer money is not being used to support drug dealers,"" Schaffer said. ""We can no longer turn a blind eye to this problem."" The proposal comes as Ohio's public welfare rolls are at their lowest levels in decades. As of June, slightly fewer than 25,000 adults received cash assistance. Children, who make up the bulk of recipients, about 107,000, would be exempt from drug testing under Schaffer's proposal. Schaffer, R-Lancaster, said he hopes to avoid similar lawsuits by requiring applicants to be tested only if they indicate on a questionnaire that they have used drugs in the past six months. Michigan's drug-testing law, he said, was found unconstitutional because it required all applicants to undergo screenings regardless of whether there was reason to believe they were using illegal drugs. Drug tests for welfare pushed

Ohio State Senator Tim Schaffer (R) has decided again that Ohio needs drug testing. He still doesn't know how public assistance works but he is reaching to show his bigoted constituents he can punch a poor person like a good Republican:There must be an election coming up. That's when we get these silly ""bash the poor"" laws. The simple fact is most people who have little to no money don't buy drugs and the idea that all welfare recipients use drugs is not supported by the evidence. It is a bigoted idea and drug testing is unconstitutional.Thanks for putting this post on the rec list. I appreciate it and the good comments I've been reading. -- dlb

That's because the stores that reefer advocates hope will be the next big thing for the free-smoking movement could be shut out in many communities.

In Colorado, an option was built into constitutional Amendment 64 -- which technically legalized the drug -- for cities and towns to opt out.

So far, at least 51 municipal councils have voted to prohibit marijuana-selling stores. And more than 20 have enacted some kind of moratorium to buy more time, according to the Colorado Municipal League (CML) which is keeping tabs on which way towns are going.

Colorado Springs is the state's second-largest city and has medical marijuana, but the city council recently voted 5-4 to opt out of allowing retail stores as well as facilities for cultivation, manufacturing or testing. Don Knight, a councilman who voted with the majority, explained that potential tax revenue was not enough to justify other likely losses. ""The input of $3.9 million that recreational marijuana would have given us, compared to the loss of tens of millions dollars, in either military or tourism, just didn't provide a balance sheet to me,"" he said.

Colorado Springs has several military assets including Fort Carson, the Air Force Academy, Peterson Air Force Base and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). Knight believes that as military budgets shrink, it is crucial to remain competitive in retaining bases and units.

He said wide availability of marijuana would not help because ""city leaders in other places like Huntsville, Omaha, that we compete against, would use that against us as they walk the halls of the Pentagon, saying, 'keep our unit here, we don't allow recreational marijuana sales.' ""

Directly south of Colorado Springs, a 45-mile ride down Interstate 25, Pueblo County commissioners are working on regulations and fees for the business of selling marijuana to adults.

Pueblo County Commissioner Liane ""Buffie"" McFadyen says they are following the will of the voters and it will provide a revenue stream for the area. McFadyen says they have had success with regulating medical marijuana and ""as we transition through these difficult times, with Washington and Colorado leading the way on recreational marijuana, it may set the precedent for the U.S. Congress to finally take up the issue in a safe and public safety driven manner."" That's because marijuana is still illegal in eyes of federal government.

McFadyen is hopeful for a lucrative ripple effect -- more than just stores could decide to set up shop. ""Maybe we'll be the hub of Colorado where we have the testing labs and have a lot of white-collar, good professional jobs contributing to our economy, testing the product from all over the state to ensure the state law is followed,"" said McFadyen. The county recently approved a greenhouse operation.

Marijuana grown in Pueblo could be trucked up to Denver. The capital's city council is considering legislation that proposes only allowing existing medical marijuana dispensaries to transition to retail for the first two years. In 2016, it would then open up to new businesses.

Despite the chance first stores may be slow coming or isolated to a few sections, legalization co-author Brian Vicente is confident ""almost all four corners of the state will be covered."" He says residents can still light up in private. ""It's important to note citizens of this state who are 21 and over can possess marijuana in those communities, they simply won't be able to purchase it from a store,"" he said.

Vicente compares it to buying booze. ""The marijuana sales will be just like alcohol with dry counties. If I were to live in a dry county, I can drive across the county line, purchase alcohol and bring it home. We're going to see the same with marijuana,"" he said.

A study by the Colorado Futures Center indicates the adult recreational marijuana market in Colorado will be worth more than $600 million. September is expected to be a ""magic month"" with stepped up activity here, according to Colorado Municipal League Deputy Director Kevin Bommer. Municipalities are mandated with either opting out or enacting ordinances by Oct. 1.

Washington state differs from Colorado on an important point. Washington's vote did not have language allowing cities to opt out. The state liquor board is working on regulations and if everything goes according to plan, it expects to start accepting applications in mid-November. It will then be up to businesses to meet local codes and ordinances.

Liquor board spokesman Brian Smith, though, says a few places have passed bans which could be ""tested"" in court; several others have passed moratoriums to wait for final rules."
http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/05/14/feds-recommend-lower-drunken-driving-threshold/,2013-05-14 00:00:00,[],One drink DUI? Feds want lower threshold for drunk driving,"A federal agency is proposing that states lower the threshold for drunken driving to the point where a woman could be charged for driving after one drink and a man after two in a move officials say would save thousands of lives.

The National Transportation Safety Board recommended that all states drop the blood-alcohol level at which motorists can be charged with driving drunk to .05, down from the current rate of .08 that all 50 states impose. The threshold is a matter of state law, but the federal government can pressure states to meet its standard by threatening to withhold highway funding.

[pullquote]

""Our goal is to get to zero deaths because each alcohol-impaired death is preventable,"" NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman said. ""Alcohol-impaired deaths are not accidents, they are crimes. They can and should be prevented. The tools exist. What is needed is the will.""

More than 100 countries have adopted the .05 alcohol content standard or lower, according to an NTSB report. In Europe, drunken driving deaths were cut by more than half a decade after the stricter standard was implemented.

Studies show a woman weighing less than 120 pounds can reach .05 after just one drink, while a man weighing up to 160 pounds reaches .05 after two drinks.

New approaches are needed to combat drunken driving, which claims the lives of more than a third of the 30,000 people killed each year on U.S highways — a level of carnage that that has remained stubbornly consistent for the past decade and a half, the board said.

""Our goal is to get to zero deaths because each alcohol-impaired death is preventable,"" NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman said. ""Alcohol-impaired deaths are not accidents, they are crimes. They can and should be prevented. The tools exist. What is needed is the will.""

But the recommendation to lowering the alcohol content threshold to .05 is likely to meet strong resistance from states, said Jonathan Adkins, an official with the Governors Highway Safety Association, which represents state highway safety offices.

""It was very difficult to get .08 in most states so lowering it again won't be popular,"" Adkins said. ""The focus in the states is on high (blood alcohol content) offenders as well as repeat offenders. We expect industry will also be very vocal about keeping the limit at .08.""

The lower alcohol content threshold was one of nearly 20 recommendations aimed at reducing drunken driving made by the board, including that states adopt measures to ensure more widespread use of use of alcohol ignition interlock devices. Those require a driver to breathe into a tube, much like the breathalyzers police ask suspected drunken drivers to use.

The board has previously recommended states require all convicted drunken drivers install the interlock devices in their vehicles as a condition to resume driving. Currently, 17 states and two California counties require all convicted drivers use the devices.

However, only about a quarter of drivers ordered to use the devices actually end up doing so, NTSB said. Drivers use a variety of ways to evade using the devices, including claiming they won't drive at all or don't own a vehicle and therefore don't need the devices, staff said.

The board recommended the National Highway Safety Administration, which makes safety grants to states, develop a program to encourage states to ensure all convicted drivers actually use the devices. The board also recommended that all suspected drunken drivers whose licenses are confiscated by police be required to install interlocks as a condition of getting their licenses reinstated even though they haven't yet been convicted of a crime.

Courts usually require drivers to pay for the devices, which cost about $50 to $100 to buy plus a $50 a month fee to operate, staff said.

The board has previously called on the safety administration and the auto industry to step up their research into technology for use in all vehicles that can detect whether a driver has elevated blood alcohol without the driver breathing into a tube or taking any other action. Drivers with elevated levels would be unable to start their cars.

But the technology is still years away.

Studies show more than 4 million people a year in the U.S. drive while intoxicated, but about half of the intoxicated drivers stopped by police escape detection, the NTSB report said. The board made several recommendations aimed at increasing both the visibility and effectiveness of police enforcement, including expanded use of passive alcohol devices. The devices are often contained in real flash lights or shaped to look like a cellphone that officers wear on their shirt pockets or belts. If an officer points the flashlight at a driver or the cellphone-like device comes in close proximity to an intoxicated driver, the devices will alert police who may not have any other reason to suspected drunken driving.

The use of the devices currently is very limited, the report said.

Dramatic progress was made in the 1980s through the mid-1990s after the minimum drinking age was raised to 21 and the legally-allowable maximum level of drivers' blood alcohol content was lowered to .08, the report said. Today, drunken driving claims about 10,000 lives a year, down from over 18,000 in 1982. At that time, alcohol-related fatalities accounted for about 40 percent of highway deaths.

Misguided former Rep. Patrick Kennedy to fight 'misguided' legalized marijuana","Patrick Kennedy

Apparently having nothing better to do now that he is no longer in office, former Rep. Patrick Kennedy, the eight-term congressman from Rhode Island, will unveil his personal crusade Wednesday in Denver. It's called Project SAM, Smart Approaches to Marijuana. It is anything but smart, however, what with its opposition to both medical marijuana and legalization of weed. He and those working with him say they seek a third way that ""neither legalizes, nor demonizes, marijuana.""

Thank goodness for small favors, Project SAM won't be promoting more of the arrests and lock-ups that have maimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans over eight decades for partaking of a mind-altering substance which all but the most stubborn opponents know causes harm to vastly fewer people than alcohol. That latter product has been legal in most of the nation for 80 years after a 14-year experiment with prohibition that helped make organized crime big business, exacerbated lethal violence and corrupted police departments from coast to coast as outlaw entrepreneurs sought to meet consumer demand.

Sound familiar? Just a few years after alcohol was re-legalized, marijuana was banned and has stayed that way for 75 years. Supplying the black market for the stuff is a gigantic business, both domestic and imported. The main foreign source is still Mexico, where the drug cartels whose wars have killed an estimated 50,000 people in the past seven years still get about half their profits from the marijuana trade. On the import side, the misbegotten War on Drugs launched 42 years ago by Richard Nixon has consumed a trillion (with a ""t"") dollars, which doesn't include income losses from people having their careers ruined or student loans chopped off because of marijuana convictions.

To his credit, Kennedy wants to see an end to such corrosive stupidity. But in its place, instead of legalization, he wants to impose mandatory drug treatment. That presumes everyone who uses marijuana is addicted or otherwise negatively affected. And this is, to put it plainly, bullshit. As is Kennedy's claim made Tuesday: “Marijuana destroys the brain and expedites psychosis. It’s just overall a very dangerous drug.”

For tens of millions of people, sir?

Disputing this idiocy doesn't mean marijuana isn't without health risks. It has some. Fact of life: Mind-altering substances of all kinds are dangerous to the mental health of a certain percentage of users.

But let's pretend for just a moment that legal marijuana would generate one-tenth the amount of mental illness, extra deaths, extra diseases, car and job accidents, bar fights, marital troubles, violent crimes and addictions as alcohol. I know, I know. Ludicrous. But just for the sake of argument, pretend. If someone could prove to a certainty, with psychic powers, say, that legalizing marijuana would become one tenth as deadly as legal alcohol, wouldn't that be a good reason to join Project SAM?

It might. Assuming, of course, that we were planning to crank up the old Temperance Union and fight to re-prohibit alcohol. Which we will never do.

Like alcohol, narcotics and other drugs, marijuana is not appropriate for underage individuals. People shouldn't drive, hunt or operate chainsaws while high. And, of course, some people are fools sober or high and will do things they shouldn't. But adults should not be forced to accept a misdemeanor or felony marijuana conviction on their record unless, as Kennedy is proposing, they submit to treatment that they don't need for consuming a substance that, for most users, does not cause mental problems, reduce their IQs or spur them to start mainlining heroin or smoking meth.

In the place of medical marijuana, now legal in 20 states, Kennedy wants extracted cannabinoids to be used. That's fine for ailments on which these extracts work. But that is not the case with many afflictions. There is apparently a beneficial synergy among at least some of the many chemicals in marijuana that extracts cannot achieve on their own.

How about instead of Kennedy's ""third way"" nonsense we just stop arresting people for using marijuana? Period. How about legalizing cultivation and sale under strict regulation and taxing?

Too extreme? Compared with what? The f'n War on Drugs?

Perhaps, since Patrick Kennedy has a history of alcohol, cocaine and oxycontin abuse, including driving under the influence, he might try focusing his crusade on the problems associated with substances he knows more intimately instead of one with an overdose death rate of zero and extremely low incidences of triggering violent behavior. Kennedy and the other crusaders involved with Project SAM, like former Bush speechwriter David Frum and former White House economic adviser Austin Goolsbee, who sit on its board, may be well intended. But their third-way approach is way way off the mark."

Two states allow commercial production%2C distribution and possession of pot for nonmedical purposes.

Where will legal pot be grown -- outdoors on commercial farms%2C inside in confined growing spaces%3F

Will states try to limit or counter ads in the communities and stores that sell marijuana%3F

Believe me, I've heard all the pot jokes, and some of them are true. Public support for legalizing marijuana use is at an all-time high. Some state-level marijuana laws are going up in smoke. And yes, Washington and Colorado are embarking on a historic joint venture.

Puns aside, discussions about marijuana legalization are getting serious. In November, voters in Colorado and Washington made the unprecedented decision to allow commercial production, distribution and possession of marijuana for nonmedical purposes. Not even the Netherlands goes that far.

Policymakers in both states are confronting some new and tricky issues that have never been addressed. For them, and for anyone else thinking about changing their pot laws, here are seven key decision areas that will shape the costs and benefits of marijuana legalization:

1. Production. Where will legal pot be grown -- outdoors on commercial farms, inside in confined growing spaces, or somewhere in between? RAND research has found that legalizing marijuana could make it dramatically cheaper to produce -- first because producers will no longer have to operate covertly, and second because suppliers won't need to be compensated for running the risks of getting arrested or assaulted. After lawmakers decide how it will be grown, production costs will be shaped by the number of producers and other regulations such as product testing.

2. Profit motive. If there is a commercial pot industry, businesses will have strong incentives to create and maintain the heavy users who use most of the pot. To get a sense of what this could look like, look no further than the alcohol and tobacco industries, which have found ingenious ways to hook and reel in heavy users. So will private companies be allowed to enter the pot market, or will states limit it to home producers, non-profit groups or cooperatives? If a state insisted on having a monopoly on pot production, it could rake in a decent amount revenue -- but for now, that possibility seems far off in the United States since marijuana remains illegal under federal law.

3. Promotion. Will states try to limit or counter advertisements in the communities and stores that sell marijuana? U.S. jurisprudence against curtailing what's known as ""commercial free speech"" could make it tough to regulate the promotion of pot. While a state monopoly system could help control promotion, those advertisements you see for state lotteries should give you pause.

4. Prevention. If pot is legal for adults, how will school and community prevention programs adapt their messages to prevent kids from using? While some proposals to legalize marijuana would divert tax revenues to prevention efforts, the messaging and strategy should probably be in place before legal marijuana ever hits the streets.

5. Potency. Marijuana potency is usually measured by its tetrahydrocannabinol content, or THC -- the chemical compound largely responsible for creating the ""high"" from pot, as well as increasing the risk of panic attacks. Much of the marijuana coming into the U.S. from Mexico is about 6% THC, while the marijuana sold in medical dispensaries in California ranges from 10%-25% THC. Meanwhile, the Dutch are now considering limiting the pot sold at their famed coffee shops to no more than 15% THC.

While THC receives the most of the attention, don't forget other compounds like cannabidiol, or CBD -- which is believed to counter some of the effects of THC.

6. Price. With marijuana, like any other commodity, price will influence consumption and revenues. A growing body of research suggests that when marijuana prices go down, the probability that someone might use marijuana goes up. So retail prices will largely be a function of consumer demand, production costs and tax rates. If taxes are set too high, pot will become expensive enough to create an incentive for an illicit market -- exactly what legalization is trying to avoid. The way taxes are set will also have an effect on what's purchased and consumed -- that is, whether pot is taxed by value, total weight, THC content, or other chemical properties.

7. Permanency. The first jurisdictions to legalize pot will probably suffer growing pains and want to make changes later on. They would do well to build some flexibility into their taxation and regulatory regime. For example, while it may make sense to tax marijuana as a function of its THC to CBD ratio, 10 years from now we may have research suggesting a better way to tax. Just in case they change their minds, some pioneering jurisdictions may want to include a sunset provision that would give them an escape clause, a chance -- by simply sitting still -- to overcome the lobbying muscle of the newly legal industry that will no doubt fight hard to stay in business. As the sunset date approaches, legislators or voters could choose either to keep their legalization regime or to try something different.

Of course, these aren't the only decisions facing those who are thinking about legalizing marijuana. But if we want to move away from the puns and abstract discussions to serious policy debates, these ""Seven Ps"" are a fine place to start.

(CNN) —

Last year, voters in Colorado approved legalizing recreational marijuana, and on Tuesday night, they resoundingly supported taxing it.

With nearly all votes counted, 65% supported the new tax, while 35% opposed it. The measure would impose a special 15% excise tax on marijuana to help fund school construction, along with a 10% sales tax to bolster marijuana-related law enforcement efforts.

The passage was widely expected, despite opponents arguing it’s unfair to single out marijuana for higher taxation than products such as beer.

Strong support for the measure is pegged largely to the money it is expected to bring in. The nonpartisan Colorado Legislative Council projects that the measure will generate nearly $70 million in additional state tax revenue next year.

There were 30 other measures on the ballot in six states Tuesday, all of which were too early to call for CNN. Here are highlights from a few:

Colorado: secession

Voters in 11 counties in northern Colorado are being asked if they want to secede from the state. Ten counties in conservative, rural northeastern Colorado would theoretically form a 51st state known as North Colorado. Moffat County, located in the northwest corner of the state, would become a panhandle for neighboring Wyoming.

The plan has no chance of becoming reality. Among other things, it would also require statewide and congressional approval. But approval or even a close vote at the county level would send a loud message of growing grassroots conservative anger toward a more liberal Denver-based Democratic establishment that has taken up controversial measures related to gun control, gay rights and green energy.

With more than 50,000 votes counted in Weld County, the most populated county of those trying to secede, 58% of votes were against secession and 42% were in favor of it. CNN, however, does not yet have a projection on this measure.

Similar secession measures have been floated in a number of other states in recent years in a reflection of the country’s growing ideological and partisan divide.

Washington: Labeling genetically modified food

Voters in Washington state are considering a hotly contested initiative that would require labeling all foods containing genetically modified ingredients. The measure pits local consumer advocates, who argue that the measure is needed for consumers to make better informed choices, against large agribusinesses such as Monsanto, which argue that such a law would spook potential customers and unfairly imply that such products are unsafe.

Washington is the second state to consider such a ballot measure. A similar proposal was narrowly rejected by California voters last year.

With more than 800,000 votes counted, 53% of Washington State voters opposed the labeling, while 47% supported it. It is still, however, too early for CNN to call this race.

According to the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures, 95 bills relating to the issue have been introduced in various legislatures so far this year – a reflection of growing public interest in the controversy surrounding genetically modified foods.

Other noteworthy measures

Voters in New Jersey are considering whether to amend their constitution to raise the state minimum wage from the federal level of $7.25 to $8.25 per hour. Future annual increases would be tied to changes in the cost of living. Eighteen states have a minimum wage that exceeds the federal requirement, according to the NCSL.

New York voters are being asked to revise their constitution to allow the legislature in Albany to authorize seven casinos, with the goal of generating new revenue for public schools and potentially cutting property taxes.

It has been more than three months since Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he would announce his department’s response to the new statutes “relatively soon.”

So far: nothing. Mr. Holder has yet to indicate whether he will side with all nine former heads of the Drug Enforcement Administration, who published an open letter urging federal pre-emption.

On Monday, the United States Conference of Mayors passed a resolution suggesting the opposite: that the Obama administration should let the states decide this issue for themselves. “Despite the prohibition of marijuana,” the resolution reads, “and the 22 million marijuana arrests that have occurred in the United States since 1965,” some “42 percent of Americans” have used the drug.

Organized crime, the mayors continue, dominates the illegal marketplace; enforcement is not only costly, but also racially biased, with African-Americans far more likely than Caucasians to be arrested for possession despite similar rates of use across ethnic groups. In light of these facts, they say, states should be able to “set whatever marijuana policies work best to improve the public safety and health of their communities.”"
http://news.yahoo.com/two-tales-constitution-marijuana-guns-104405970--politics.html,,[],"Two tales of the Constitution, marijuana and guns","A constitutional issue stretching back 200 years has popped up in two stories about gun control and marijuana within the past week, with two different twists on the concept of nullification.

Source: United States Fish and Wildlife Service

Source: United States Fish and Wildlife Service.

Nullification is the idea that in a system of state and federal laws, one law passed by a government can be overruled by another.

For example, if the state of New Jersey barred watching reality TV shows and an amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the rights to watch “Storage Wars,” one law trumps the other.

In the case of gun control, a Pennsylvania state lawmaker, State Senator John H. Eichelberger Jr., is introducing a law that makes it illegal for the federal government to enforce its gun control laws within his state.

Eichelberger joins another state legislator, Daryl Metcalfe, in proposing Pennsylvania laws that seek to nullify the enforcement of federal laws. Other states have also proposed their own nullification laws that would trump federal gun laws.

And in the case of marijuana, nine former leaders of the Drug Enforcement Administration said in a statement that they want the federal government to nullify newly passed state laws in Colorado and Washington, which legalize recreational marijuana use under controlled circumstances.

Former DEA administrator Peter Bensinger said nullification was a “no brainer.”

“It is outrageous that a lawsuit hasn’t been filed in federal court yet,” said Bensinger.

What each story has in common is the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Article VI, Clause 2, states that in a conflict of state and federal laws, the federal law is the supreme law of the land:

“This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.”

Story continues

Some proponents of states’ rights and the 10th Amendment don’t agree with the concept. But when challenged, the Supreme Court has decided that federal laws can’t be nullified by the states.

During the 1950s, a group of Southern states passed laws to block the desegregation of public schools. The court ruled in Cooper v. Aaron that the state of Arkansas couldn’t nullify a federal law and that the court had the power to make that decision.

States can contest the constitutionality of a federal law through the court system, and hope that a law is overturned. But they can’t decide to ignore a federal law—at least in theory.

That’s where the marijuana controversy comes into play in Colorado and Washington state, and in states that have passed their own medical marijuana laws.

The current federal statute on controlled substances makes medical and recreational marijuana a Schedule 1 controlled substance that is illegal nationally.

However, 18 states have made medical marijuana legal, and Colorado and Washington are now allowing people to smoke pot for fun under certain circumstances.

The administration of President Barack Obama faces a problem. Attorney General Eric Holder hasn’t made a decision yet about taking Colorado and Washington to court to invalidate their recreational marijuana laws.

If Holder does go to court, what does that mean for the states that have medical marijuana laws on the books? The attorney general has targeted medical marijuana dispensaries in recent years, but not smokers. Will those states also face lawsuits?

What if the Obama administration reaches a compromise with Colorado and Washington to let parts of their recreational marijuana laws stand?

Those state laws effectively nullify federal law, which isn’t exactly a precedent that the Justice Department would want to set for states that ignore possible federal gun control laws.

There’s some hope that Congress may act to change the federal statutes about marijuana use. And it seems unlikely, at this point, that major gun control laws will be coming from Congress in the near future.

But that could change if a compromise is reached in Congress on background checks on gun purchases. Several states strongly oppose the idea, and some local lawmakers have proposed state nullification laws to make gun registration illegal.

In some cases, the proposed state laws provide for the arrest of any federal official trying to enforce a gun-control law.

In recent years, several states have passed laws that decriminalized marijuana, and a majority of Americans now support legalizing the drug. Yet between 2001 and 2010, there were over 8 million pot arrests in the U.S. What's worse, the authorities making the arrests were targeting black Americans far more than whites.

According to a new study from the American Civil Liberties Union, which tracked marijuana arrests by race and county in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, black and white Americans use marijuana at about the same rate. However, blacks were nearly four times as likely than whites to be arrested on charges of marijuana possession in 2010.

In Washington D.C., Iowa, Minnesota and Illinois, blacks were 7.5 to 8.5 times more likely than whites to be arrested for possessing pot.

Most of the people being arrested weren't drug kingpins. Fifty-two percent of all drug arrests in 2010 were for marijuana, and according to the ACLU's analysis, most of the arrestees were in possession of small amounts of the drug.

Having a black president hasn't eased this racial disparity, either. During President Barack Obama’s first three years in office, the arrest rate for marijuana possession was about 5 percent higher than the average rate under President George W. Bush, The New York Times reported.

Obama's first term in office was also marked by an economic recession, a soaring deficit (due to the cost of the Bush tax cuts and two wars) and numerous budget battles that threatened to cause state and federal government shutdowns. In the midst of this, the costs of the War on Marijuana continued to rise.

In 2010, states spent an estimated $3.6 billion enforcing marijuana possession laws, which was a 30 percent increase from a decade earlier. Such a large amount of funding provides a strong financial incentive for police to make arrests and boost their crime-fighting statistics, the ACLU reported. In fact, that same year, more people were arrested for marijuana possession than for all violent crimes combined.

""In the past 75 years we have seen mounting evidence of the benign nature of the marijuana plant, and its tremendous potential for medical development,"" Amanda Reiman, policy manager for the Drug Policy Alliance said in 2012. ""But the rampant misinformation about the effects of marijuana USE is dwarfed by the lifetime of suffering that a marijuana CONVICTION can bring.""

That's because the stores that reefer advocates hope will be the next big thing for the free-smoking movement could be shut out in many communities.

In Colorado, an option was built into constitutional Amendment 64 -- which technically legalized the drug -- for cities and towns to opt out.

So far, at least 51 municipal councils have voted to prohibit marijuana-selling stores. And more than 20 have enacted some kind of moratorium to buy more time, according to the Colorado Municipal League (CML) which is keeping tabs on which way towns are going.

Colorado Springs is the state's second-largest city and has medical marijuana, but the city council recently voted 5-4 to opt out of allowing retail stores as well as facilities for cultivation, manufacturing or testing. Don Knight, a councilman who voted with the majority, explained that potential tax revenue was not enough to justify other likely losses. ""The input of $3.9 million that recreational marijuana would have given us, compared to the loss of tens of millions dollars, in either military or tourism, just didn't provide a balance sheet to me,"" he said.

Colorado Springs has several military assets including Fort Carson, the Air Force Academy, Peterson Air Force Base and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). Knight believes that as military budgets shrink, it is crucial to remain competitive in retaining bases and units.

He said wide availability of marijuana would not help because ""city leaders in other places like Huntsville, Omaha, that we compete against, would use that against us as they walk the halls of the Pentagon, saying, 'keep our unit here, we don't allow recreational marijuana sales.' ""

Directly south of Colorado Springs, a 45-mile ride down Interstate 25, Pueblo County commissioners are working on regulations and fees for the business of selling marijuana to adults.

Pueblo County Commissioner Liane ""Buffie"" McFadyen says they are following the will of the voters and it will provide a revenue stream for the area. McFadyen says they have had success with regulating medical marijuana and ""as we transition through these difficult times, with Washington and Colorado leading the way on recreational marijuana, it may set the precedent for the U.S. Congress to finally take up the issue in a safe and public safety driven manner."" That's because marijuana is still illegal in eyes of federal government.

McFadyen is hopeful for a lucrative ripple effect -- more than just stores could decide to set up shop. ""Maybe we'll be the hub of Colorado where we have the testing labs and have a lot of white-collar, good professional jobs contributing to our economy, testing the product from all over the state to ensure the state law is followed,"" said McFadyen. The county recently approved a greenhouse operation.

Marijuana grown in Pueblo could be trucked up to Denver. The capital's city council is considering legislation that proposes only allowing existing medical marijuana dispensaries to transition to retail for the first two years. In 2016, it would then open up to new businesses.

Despite the chance first stores may be slow coming or isolated to a few sections, legalization co-author Brian Vicente is confident ""almost all four corners of the state will be covered."" He says residents can still light up in private. ""It's important to note citizens of this state who are 21 and over can possess marijuana in those communities, they simply won't be able to purchase it from a store,"" he said.

Vicente compares it to buying booze. ""The marijuana sales will be just like alcohol with dry counties. If I were to live in a dry county, I can drive across the county line, purchase alcohol and bring it home. We're going to see the same with marijuana,"" he said.

A study by the Colorado Futures Center indicates the adult recreational marijuana market in Colorado will be worth more than $600 million. September is expected to be a ""magic month"" with stepped up activity here, according to Colorado Municipal League Deputy Director Kevin Bommer. Municipalities are mandated with either opting out or enacting ordinances by Oct. 1.

Washington state differs from Colorado on an important point. Washington's vote did not have language allowing cities to opt out. The state liquor board is working on regulations and if everything goes according to plan, it expects to start accepting applications in mid-November. It will then be up to businesses to meet local codes and ordinances.

Liquor board spokesman Brian Smith, though, says a few places have passed bans which could be ""tested"" in court; several others have passed moratoriums to wait for final rules."
http://news.yahoo.com/obama-proposes-94-cent-tax-hike-cigarettes-152459146--politics.html,,[],Obama proposes 94-cent tax hike on cigarettes,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama's budget plan would increase taxes by $1 trillion over the next decade, including a new tax on cigarettes and familiar proposals to increases taxes on the wealthy and some corporations.

The president said his plan includes $580 billion in tax increases to help reduce government borrowing. But the tax hikes don't stop there. Obama's budget proposal would also impose an additional $400 billion in tax increases. Much of it would be used to pay for more spending.

Obama's proposal would increase the federal tax on cigarettes from $1.01 a pack to $1.95. The new cigarette tax would raise an estimated $78 billion over the next decade to pay for pre-school programs for children.

Obama says his tax plan is part of a balanced approach to deficit reduction that includes painful cuts to benefit programs like Social Security and Medicare. Most GOP lawmakers adamantly oppose new taxes, which means his plan has little chance of passing Congress.

Obama already got Congress to increase taxes by $600 billion in January. His budget would add to those tax hikes.

""To be clear, the package I am offering includes some difficult cuts that I do not particularly like,"" Obama says in his budget message. ""But these measures will only become law if congressional Republicans agree to meet me in the middle by eliminating special tax breaks and loopholes so millionaires and billionaires do their fair share to cut the deficit.""

In his budget, Obama calls for an overhaul of the nation's tax laws that would cut tax rates and simplify the system while generating additional revenue to help reduce government borrowing. The plan, however, provides few details on how the rate cuts would be financed.

There is a growing movement in Congress to do tax reform but there is much disagreement over whether it should result in higher overall tax receipts. Many Democrats, including Obama, want to use tax reform to raise taxes. Most Republicans oppose higher taxes.

Story continues

Obama's budget would create a fund of about $100 billion that would be used to finance lower corporate tax rates. The fund, however, is more symbolic than substantive because $100 billion would only cover the cost of lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 34 percent.

Obama has said his goal is a corporate income tax rate of 28 percent.

Obama's proposed tax increase on cigarettes is popular among health care advocates who believe it provides the additional benefit of encouraging smokers to cut back or quit. In addition to the direct revenue from the tax, the Congressional Budget Office analysis concluded that health improvements related to less smoking would save the government about $1 billion over 10 years and generate additional revenue of $3 billion because of a boost in earnings from healthier workers.

The tobacco industry promptly criticized the proposal.

""The idea of increasing taxes on low- to middle-income Americans at this time is ludicrous,"" said Bryan Hatchell, a spokesman for Reynolds American Inc., the nation's second-biggest tobacco company. ""As middle-income Americans struggle to make ends meet in a very slow economic recovery period, this is not the time to hit them with higher taxes.""

The biggest tax increase in Obama's budget would limit the value of itemized deductions for wealthy families. The limits would apply to all itemized deductions, including those for mortgage interest, charitable contributions and state and local taxes. They would also apply to tax-exempt interest, employer-sponsored health insurance and income exclusions for employee retirement contributions.

The proposal would raise $529 billion over the next decade.

Charitable groups have already mounted a lobbying campaign to oppose the limits because they are worried they would discourage wealthy people from donating. Obama has made similar proposals in previous budgets and received lukewarm responses from fellow Democrats. Most Republicans oppose it.

Among the other tax changes, Obama's budget would:

— Impose the ""Buffett Rule,"" named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, an Obama supporter who favors higher taxes. The rules say people making more than $1 million must pay at least 30 percent of their income in federal taxes. The rule would raise $53 billion over the next decade.

— Prohibit tax-free contributions to retirement accounts once the account's assets reach a certain limit. The initial limit would be set at $3.4 million. The proposal would raise about $9 billion over the next decade.

— Eliminate a series of tax breaks for oil, gas and coal companies, raising $44 billion over the next decade.

— Change accounting rules for the way companies value their inventories for tax purposes. The change would raise $81 billion over the next decade.

— Expand and make permanent the research and development tax credit, saving businesses $99 billion over the next decade. The current credit expires at the end of the year, though it is routinely extended.

— Make permanent rules that allow small businesses to more quickly write off expenses, saving business $69 billion over the next decade.

The next 25 years took the nation from Bill Clinton, who famously ""didn't inhale,"" to Barack Obama, who most emphatically did.

Now, in just a few short years, public opinion has moved so dramatically toward general acceptance that even those who champion legalization are surprised at how quickly attitudes are changing and states are moving to approve the drug — for medical use and just for fun.

It is a moment in America that is rife with contradictions:

—People are looking more kindly on marijuana even as science reveals more about the drug's potential dangers, particularly for young people.

—States are giving the green light to the drug in direct defiance of a federal prohibition on its use.

—Exploration of the potential medical benefit is limited by high federal hurdles to research.

Washington policymakers seem reluctant to deal with any of it.

Richard Bonnie, a University of Virginia law professor who worked for a national commission that recommended decriminalizing marijuana in 1972, sees the public taking a big leap from prohibition to a more laissez-faire approach without full deliberation.

""It's a remarkable story historically,"" he says. ""But as a matter of public policy, it's a little worrisome.""

More than a little worrisome to those in the anti-drug movement.

""We're on this hundred-mile-an-hour freight train to legalizing a third addictive substance,"" says Kevin Sabet, a former drug policy adviser in the Obama administration, lumping marijuana with tobacco and alcohol.

Legalization strategist Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, likes the direction the marijuana smoke is wafting. But knows his side has considerable work yet to do.

""I'm constantly reminding my allies that marijuana is not going to legalize itself,"" he says.

By the numbers:

Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have legalized the use of marijuana for medical purposes since California voters made the first move in 1996. Voters in Colorado and Washington state took the next step last year and approved pot for recreational use. Alaska is likely to vote on the same question in 2014, and a few other states are expected to put recreational use on the ballot in 2016.

Nearly half of adults have tried marijuana, 12 percent of them in the past year, according to a survey by the Pew Research Center.

Fifty-two percent of adults favor legalizing marijuana, up 11 percentage points just since 2010, according to Pew.

Sixty percent think Washington shouldn't enforce federal laws against marijuana in states that have approved its use.

___

Where California led the charge on medical marijuana, the next chapter in this story is being written in Colorado and Washington state.

Policymakers there are grappling with all sorts of sticky issues revolving around one central question: How do you legally regulate the production, distribution, sale and use of marijuana for recreational purposes when federal law bans all of the above?

The Justice Department began reviewing the matter after last November's election. But seven months later, states still are on their own.

Both sides in the debate paid close attention when Obama said in December that ""it does not make sense, from a prioritization point of view, for us to focus on recreational drug users in a state that has already said that under state law that's legal.""

Rep. Jared Polis, a Colorado Democrat who favors legalization, predicts Washington will take a hands-off approach, based on Obama's comments. But he's quick to add: ""We would like to see that in writing.""

The federal government already has taken a similar approach toward users in states that have approved marijuana for medical use.

It doesn't go after pot-smoking cancer patients or grandmas with glaucoma. But it also has made clear that people who are in the business of growing, selling and distributing marijuana on a large scale are subject to potential prosecution for violations of the Controlled Substances Act — even in states that have legalized medical use.

___

There's a political calculus for the president, or any other politician, in all of this.

Younger people, who tend to vote more Democratic, are more supportive of legalizing marijuana, as are people in the West, where the libertarian streak runs strong.

Despite increasing public acceptance of marijuana overall, politicians know there are complications that could come with commercializing an addictive substance. Opponents of pot are particularly worried that legalization will result in increased use by young people.

Sabet frames the conundrum for Obama: ""Do you want to be the president that stops a popular cause, especially a cause that's popular within your own party? Or do you want to be the president that enables youth drug use that will have ramifications down the road?""

Marijuana legalization advocates offer politicians a rosier scenario, in which legitimate pot businesses eager to keep their operating licenses make sure not to sell to minors.

""Having a regulated system is the only way to ensure that we're not ceding control of this popular substance to the criminal market and to black marketeers,"" says Aaron Smith, executive director of the National Cannabis Industry Association, a trade group for legal pot businesses in the U.S.

___

While the federal government hunkers down, Colorado and Washington state are moving forward on their own with regulations covering everything from how plants will be grown to how many stores will be allowed.

Tim Lynch, director of the libertarian Cato Institute's Project on Criminal Justice, predicts ""the next few years are going to be messy"" as states work to bring a black-market industry into the sunshine.

California's experience with medical marijuana offers a window into potential pitfalls that can come with wider availability of pot.

Dispensaries for medical marijuana have proliferated in the state, and regulation has been lax, prompting a number of cities around the state to ban dispensaries.

In May, the California Supreme Court ruled that cities and counties can ban medical marijuana dispensaries. A few weeks later, Los Angeles voters approved a ballot measure that limits the number of pot shops in the city to 135, down from an estimated high of about 1,000.

This isn't full-scale buyer's remorse, but more a course correction before the inevitable next push for full-on legalization in the state.

___

Growing support for legalization doesn't mean everybody wants to light up: Barely one in 10 Americans used pot in the past year.

Those who do want to see marijuana legalized range from libertarians who oppose much government intervention to people who want to see an activist government aggressively regulate marijuana production and sales.

For some, money talks: Why let drug cartels rake in untaxed profits when a cut could go into government coffers?

There are other threads in the growing acceptance of pot.

People think it's not as dangerous as once believed. They worry about high school kids getting an arrest record. They see racial inequity in the way marijuana laws are enforced. They're weary of the ""war on drugs.""

Opponents counter with a 2012 study finding that regular use of marijuana during teen years can lead to a long-term drop in IQ, and another study indicating marijuana use can induce and exacerbate psychotic illness in susceptible people. They question the notion that regulating pot will bring in big money, saying revenue estimates are grossly exaggerated.

They reject the claim that prisons are bulging with people convicted of simple possession by citing federal statistics showing only a small percentage of federal and state inmates are behind bars for that alone.

They warn that baby boomers who draw on their own innocuous experiences with pot are overlooking the much higher potency of today's marijuana.

In 2009, concentrations of THC, the psychoactive ingredient in pot, averaged close to 10 percent in marijuana, compared with about 4 percent in the 1980s, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

""If marijuana legalization was about my old buddies at Berkeley smoking in People's Park once a week I don't think many of us would care that much,"" says Sabet, who helped to found Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a group that opposes legalization. ""It's really about creating a new industry that's going to target kids and target minorities and our vulnerable populations just like our legal industries do today.""

___

So how bad, or good, is pot?

J. Michael Bostwick, a psychiatrist at the Mayo Clinic, set out to sort through more than 100 sometimes conflicting studies after his teenage son became addicted to pot, and turned his findings into a 22-page article for Mayo Clinic Proceedings in 2012.

For all of the talk that smoking pot is no big deal, Bostwick says he determined that ""it was a very big deal. There were addiction issues. There were psychosis issues.

But there was also this very large body of literature suggesting that it could potentially have very valuable pharmaceutical applications but the research was stymied"" by federal barriers.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse says research is ongoing.

Dr. Nora Volkow, the institute's director, worries that legalizing pot will result in increased use of marijuana by young people, and impair their brain development.

""Think about it: Do you want a nation where your young people are stoned?"" she asks.

Partisans on both sides think people in other states will keep a close eye on Colorado and Washington as they decide what happens next.

But past predictions on pot have been wildly off-base.

""Reefer Madness,"" the 1936 propaganda movie that pot fans turned into a cult classic in the 1970s, spins a tale of dire consequences ""ending often in incurable insanity.""

The recently reintroduced measure would shield from federal prosecution people acting in accordance with their states’ marijuana laws, including new Colorado and Washington laws that allow adult recreational use of the drug.

“The prospects are much better now,” said Rohrabacher, whose co-sponsors include Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Oakland), a Bay Area liberal who is usually about as far apart ideologically from Rohrabacher as anybody in Congress.

Still, Rohrabacher has his work cut out for him. The House last year soundly rejected, by a 262-163 vote, an effort he led to block the use of federal funds to prevent states from implementing medical marijuana laws. Only 28 Republicans supported the measure.

Rohrabacher has a libertarian bent but became more interested in the medical benefits of marijuana after having to spoon-feed his dying mother because of her loss of appetite. He has talked about the relief that marijuana might have afforded her.

He has been emboldened by a recent Pew Research Center poll that showed respondents, by nearly 2 to 1, believe the federal government should not enforce federal laws prohibiting the use of marijuana in states where it is legal.

Perhaps as important as the shifting public opinion, he said in an interview, is his colleagues’ eagerness to erase Washington’s red ink. Substantial majorities of Republicans and Democrats in the Pew survey regarded federal enforcement of anti-marijuana laws as not worth the cost.

“If people of the states recognize what a waste of limited resources this is, then the federal government should respect what the people of those states want for their own criminal justice system,” Rohrabacher said.

Since 1996, when California became the first state to legalize the drug’s use for medical treatment, 17 other states and the District of Columbia have approved medical marijuana measures. Last year, Colorado and Washington state voters opted to allow recreational users to possess an ounce of marijuana. A move is underway to put a measure on the Alaska ballot to permit recreational use of the drug.

Efforts are underway in other states, including Idaho, Illinois and New Hampshire, to allow medicinal use of marijuana.

Rohrabacher also is hoping to convince GOP colleagues that his bill fits with the party’s traditional support for states’ rights.

“It is time that we respect states’ rights, get serious about prioritizing our federal government’s activities, and show some common sense and compassion when dealing with the sick among us,” Rohrabacher said last year when he proposed his measure.

However, Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.), chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that oversees Justice Department spending, responded at the time: “If a state said sex trafficking is OK, would we honor that?... States, in the past, have done some things that have not been good in this country.”

The president’s drug czar, R. Gil Kerlikowske, recently said at the National Press Club that the Justice Department was responsible for enforcing the Controlled Substances Act, and “that remains unchanged. No state, no executive, can nullify a statute that’s been passed by Congress.”

Kevin Sabet, a former advisor to Kerlikowske, said Rohrabacher’s latest attempt would “likely suffer the same fate as his several previous failed attempts have over the past decade.”

Steve Fox, national political director for the Marijuana Policy Project, which promotes legalization, regards the bill as a long shot in this congressional session. But he said the legislation “sends the message that it is simply not a rational use of federal law enforcement resources to prosecute and imprison individuals who are acting in compliance with state marijuana laws.”

http://news.yahoo.com/wash-police-dogs-not-smelling-pot-anymore-075042215.html,,[],Some Wash. police dogs not smelling pot anymore,"BREMERTON, Wash. (AP) — When Dusty, a 19-month-old black Labrador, walked past a pipe full of marijuana during a recent police search of a house, he was doing exactly what his handler hoped.

The newest drug-sniffing dog on the police force in Bremerton, near Seattle, is one of a few police dogs in Washington state that are not trained to point out pot during searches. Other police departments are considering or in the midst of re-training their dogs to ignore pot as well, part of the new reality in a state where voters last fall legalized marijuana use.

""We wanted to train our dog on what was truly illegal substances, that would be heroin, methamphetamine and cocaine,"" said Dusty's handler, Officer Duke Roessel, who added that Dusty nabbed five pounds of meth during that recent search.

Police departments in Bremerton, Bellevue and Seattle, as well as the Washington State Patrol, have either put the dogs through pot desensitization training or plan not to train them for marijuana detection.

The law decriminalized possession of up to an ounce of the drug for individuals over 21 years old. It also barred the distribution and growth of marijuana outside the state-approved system.

Police say that having a K-9 unit that doesn't alert to pot will lessen challenges to obtaining search warrants because the dog won't be pointing out possible legal amounts of the drug. Traditionally, dogs are trained to alert on the smell of marijuana, heroin, crack cocaine, methamphetamine and cocaine. They can't tell which one it is or how much of each there is.

In December, the Washington Association of Prosecuting Attorneys told officers in a guidance memo that dogs that alert on pot face limitations when a search warrant is sought but those are ""not fatal to a determination of probable cause.""

The group instructed officers to point out that the dog was trained to smell pot and how that is relevant to other information when they seek a warrant, and that a ""narcotics-trained canine's alert will still be relevant to the probable cause equation.""

Story continues

In Pierce County, however, prosecutor Mark Lindquist said authorities are being cautious about the new law because judges might excise the dog sniff from their analysis of probable cause. He's also not convinced dogs can be re-trained. ""We'll need new dogs to alert on substances that are illegal,"" he said.

In January, the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission removed detecting marijuana from its canine team certification standards. The change doesn't prohibit trainers from doing so, but it's not required anymore.

But some police departments aren't making any changes. And some observers say that a state Supreme Court decision in 2010 in which the justices sided against medical marijuana patients who argued police officers no longer had probable cause to immediately arrest or investigate due to the legalization of medical pot.

Last fall's legalization law ""just made one ounce not a crime for adults. That means that any amount over an ounce is still illegal, growing marijuana is still illegal, selling marijuana is still illegal, passing a joint to somebody is still illegal,"" said medical marijuana advocate and attorney Douglas Hiatt.

For different reasons, dog trainer Fred Helfers of the Pacific Northwest Detection Dog Association agreed with Hiatt.

But having spent 20 years as a narcotics investigator, Helfers said departments who abandoned pot training are having a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. He said they may miss actual crimes being committed. ""What about trafficking? What about people who have more than an ounce?"" he said.

Nonetheless, Helfers is helping departments who want to go through the ""extinction"" training, which he said is a common method to change what substances dogs alert to. It takes about an initial 30 days plus every day reinforcements to modify the dog's behavior.

""Overall, I think there's still a large amount of agencies on a wait-and-see approach with their dogs,"" Helfers said.

Instead of treating 100 grams of cocaine the same as 1 gram of crack for sentencing purposes, the law cut the ratio to 18 to 1. Initially, the law applied only to future offenders, but, a year later, the United States Sentencing Commission voted to apply it retroactively. Republicans raged, charging that crime would go up and that prisoners would overwhelm the courts with frivolous demands for sentence reductions. Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa said the commission was pursuing “a liberal agenda at all costs.”

This week, we began to learn that there are no costs, only benefits. According to a preliminary report released by the commission, more than 7,300 federal prisoners have had their sentences shortened under the law. The average reduction is 29 months, meaning that over all, offenders are serving roughly 16,000 years fewer than they otherwise would have. And since the federal government spends about $30,000 per year to house an inmate, this reduction alone is worth nearly half-a-billion dollars — big money for a Bureau of Prisons with a $7 billion budget. In addition, the commission found no significant difference in recidivism rates between those prisoners who were released early and those who served their full sentences.

Federal judges nationwide have long expressed vigorous disagreement with both the sentencing disparity and the mandatory minimum sentences they are forced to impose, both of which have been drivers of our bloated federal prison system. But two bipartisan bills in Congress now propose a cheaper and more humane approach. It would include reducing mandatory minimums, giving judges more flexibility to sentence below those minimums, and making more inmates eligible for reductions to their sentences under the new ratio.

But 18 to 1 is still out of whack. The ratio was always based on faulty science and misguided assumptions, and it still disproportionately punishes blacks, who make up more than 80 percent of those prosecuted for federal crack offenses. The commission and the Obama administration have called for a 1-to-1 ratio. The question is not whether we can afford to do it, but whether we can afford not to."

If citizens fail, they are refused or cut off from the government assistance.

Faust-Goudeau believes the same should apply for government lawmakers; after all, they are beneficiaries of government funding, as well. Faust-Goudeau says the current bill unfairly targets the poor and...



There is a lot at risk for those who do not pass the drug test mandated by the new bill. The first failure would require drug treatment and job skills programs. That’s not too bad. If you fail a second test, however, you would lose benefits for a year. A third failure would cause you too lose welfare or unemployment benefits for life. Pretty steep, especially for someone caught in the grip of addiction. It might take several attempts to get on the road to recovery.

Senate Vice President Jeff King, R-Independence, said the basic bill is an attempt to help people with addiction to get help — and prevent state tax dollars from being used to buy illegal drugs. That sounds fair – as long as the same applies to lawmakers and government-assisted business owners. All for one, one for all. It’s the only fair thing.

I will do a happy dance if drug testing for Congress becomes a federal law. A lot of the country would celebrate, if anything, for the irony and fairness of it all. And how refreshing to see more and more mighty and brave politicians like Faust-Goudeau, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Al Franken buck the system and status quo, by taking on Goliaths like big banks and the U.S. government. Here’s to those rabble-rousers… this is what ‘for the people’ looks like.

Fox appeared at a news conference in Seattle, where he recounted how the war on drugs has ravaged his country and praised the states of Washington and Colorado for voting to legalize the recreational use of marijuana last fall.

At the news conference, former Microsoft manager Jamen Shively discussed his plans to launch a new marijuana brand named for his great-great grandfather, Diego Pellicer. He says his company is joining forces with a Washington state chain of medical marijuana dispensaries run by John Davis, the Northwest Patient Resource Center, as well as dispensaries in Colorado and California.

Shively's planned investment will total $100 million over three years, according to the Stranger.

""This historic step today is to be observed and evaluated closely by all of us, because it is a game changer,"" Fox said. ""I applaud this group that has the courage to move ahead. They have the vision, they are clear where they're going, and I'm sure they're going to get there.""

Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive who was Mexico's president from 2000-06, specified that he's not involved in the venture. He appeared at Shively's invitation. The two first met 13 years ago, when a company Shively used to run was opening a computer center in Sinaloa and Fox appeared at the inauguration, Shively said.

Shively described grand visions for his pot brand – hundreds of millions of dollars in investments, tens of millions of customers, more than 1,000 jobs just at Diego Pellicer's Seattle headquarters.

""Yes, we are Big Marijuana,"" he announced.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last March, the company wrote that it had raised $125,000 of an anticipated $625,000. Shively suggested those numbers were outdated, but did not provide different figures.

Washington and Colorado expect to begin allowing marijuana sales to adults over 21 at state-licensed stores beginning next year, but marijuana remains illegal under federal law, and the Justice Department has repeatedly said it can continue to prosecute large-scale, privately owned marijuana operations even when they comply with state law.

It isn't clear how Shively's plans for a national marijuana brand might be accomplished without running afoul of federal laws regarding the distribution of an illegal substance or conspiracy to distribute an illegal substance. He and Davis said no money from their business will travel interstate, nor will the marijuana itself, but neither of those factors would necessarily shield them from arrest.

Shively insisted that his deals with the dispensaries are structured in such a way as to minimize any risk of federal prosecution, but neither he nor Davis would explain how. Shively said he had acquired certain ""rights"" related to the dispensaries, and made the plan sound like a marketing agreement by which the stores, beginning next month, would be re-branded as Diego Pellicer.

""Neither Diego Pellicer nor our investors are exposed to any significant risk, in terms of criminal risk,"" Shively said. ""In terms of criminal risk, that is vastly mitigated. ... We're making strategic investments, but we're making them in such a way that they are not in violation of either federal or state law.""

Asked how his plan didn't constitute a federal conspiracy to distribute marijuana, Shively described his operation as ""a conspiracy to obey the law.""

His securities lawyer, Mike Moyer of the prominent Seattle firm of Dorsey and Whitney LLC, declined to elaborate.

Fox urged the reporters present to maintain a focus on the important issues at hand: the failure of the drug war, the thousands of lives lost, and the better alternative offered by legalization. He noted he'd rather be sitting at a table next to Shively than the notorious cartel leader Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman.

""This is a much better option, no doubt,"" he said.

It has been more than three months since Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he would announce his department’s response to the new statutes “relatively soon.”

So far: nothing. Mr. Holder has yet to indicate whether he will side with all nine former heads of the Drug Enforcement Administration, who published an open letter urging federal pre-emption.

On Monday, the United States Conference of Mayors passed a resolution suggesting the opposite: that the Obama administration should let the states decide this issue for themselves. “Despite the prohibition of marijuana,” the resolution reads, “and the 22 million marijuana arrests that have occurred in the United States since 1965,” some “42 percent of Americans” have used the drug.

Organized crime, the mayors continue, dominates the illegal marketplace; enforcement is not only costly, but also racially biased, with African-Americans far more likely than Caucasians to be arrested for possession despite similar rates of use across ethnic groups. In light of these facts, they say, states should be able to “set whatever marijuana policies work best to improve the public safety and health of their communities.”"

At 15, a gang member shot at him while he was shopping at a grocery store — and killed his cousin instead.

At 17, he left Honduras for the United States.

He applied for political asylum, telling a judge that if he returned home, the gang that had slain his father would kill him, too.

Now 20, working as a gardener and living with his mother and siblings in Los Angeles, the man is one of a growing number of Central Americans asking for asylum. His claim was denied, and lawyers from the Central American Resource Center in Los Angeles are helping him appeal. He asked not to be identified because he fears for his safety.

In the last five years, “credible fear” applications at the border have increased sevenfold, from just under 5,000 to more than 36,000, driven largely by an influx from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.

Advocates for the immigrants say the surge can be traced to worsening gang and drug violence in Central America. Others say people who cross the border are simply becoming more aware of asylum as an option.

“People used to think the only thing you could do was sneak across,” said Judy London, directing attorney of the Immigrants’ Rights Project at the Los Angeles pro bono law firm Public Counsel. “They’ve learned that you can just go up to a border agent and tell them you want asylum.”

With the jump in asylum applications has come concerns about possible fraud and abuse.

On Thursday, the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing to address reports that the asylum system is being exploited, including by Mexican drug traffickers.

“If indeed we allow that process to be abused … then those that we disserve the most are those who are genuinely persecuted,” said Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.).

Advertisement

Even with the recent increase, the number of asylum seekers is lower now than in the early 1990s, when a coup in Haiti and a court settlement in favor of Central Americans resulted in a flood of claims.

Most asylum applications are still made from inside the country, rather than by claiming credible fear at the border. People who are in the U.S. legally — on a tourist or business visa, for example — file “affirmative” applications, which have also increased, though not as rapidly as credible fear applications. Combined, the two categories have more than doubled in the last five years, exceeding 80,000 in fiscal year 2013. The number of people winning asylum has increased only slightly, with about 30,000 cases approved in 2012.

Advertisement

Statistics show that an immigrant’s chance of winning asylum depends largely on where he or she is from.

In 2012, more than 10,000 people from China were granted asylum, compared with just 126 Mexicans and 234 Hondurans, according to federal data. Immigration court figures, which do not include cases approved in an initial hearing by an asylum officer, show a success rate of nearly 50% for Chinese versus 1% for Mexicans.

Advertisement

Still, the process buys time. Almost 90% of credible fear applicants pass an initial screening interview, which allows them to live and work in the U.S. until their cases are resolved — often a matter of years.

To qualify for asylum, a person must have suffered persecution or have a well-founded fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. If the persecutor is not the government, the applicant must show that the government failed to offer protection.

Chinese immigrants typically claim they were persecuted by the government for belonging to an underground church or trying to have a second child. It is harder to win asylum when the oppressor is a non-state actor such as a gang.

“Central America is a war zone more violent than the days of the civil wars,” said Deborah Anker, director of the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program. “But we’ve been denying these cases systematically.”

Advertisement

U.S. foreign policy is also a factor in which asylum cases get approved, according to Bill Ong Hing, a law professor at the University of San Francisco.

“No matter what we say in terms of the law being neutral, the U.S. continues to favor applicants fleeing from quote unquote communist-dominated countries,” Hing said. “Policywise, the U.S. is trying to support the governments of Central America and Mexico; so politically, the U.S. has that in the back of its mind in asylum adjudications.”

Still, immigration attorney Eric Price tells his Mexican and Central American clients that it may be worth filing an asylum case, even if they end up losing.

“Three uncertain years in the safety of L.A. is much better than three years of certain threat in Guatemala,” Price said. Besides, he added, the denial of asylum doesn’t always result in a deportation order, thanks to an initiative by President Obama that allows immigration officials discretion in whom they deport.

At last week’s congressional hearing, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) accused some asylum seekers of “gaming the system,” adding: “They essentially get free education, free healthcare.”

Fraud has been an issue, with underground asylum industries thriving in some ethnic communities.

Advertisement

Last year in New York, 26 people, including six attorneys, were indicted on charges that they manufactured asylum claims and coached Chinese clients on how to lie to immigration authorities. One church employee allegedly provided religious training so applicants could pass as Christians.

Thomas Mayer, a San Gabriel immigration attorney, said Chinese immigrants sometimes ask him to make up a persecution story for them. He refuses, but the demand is growing.

Advertisement

To weed out impostors, Mayer administers a quiz: “Name two important Christian holidays. What is baptism? Who was John the Baptist?”

Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for a more restrictive immigration system, said asylum should be limited to those fleeing repressive governments or genocide.

“Giving asylum to all kinds of people who are just using it as a path to a green card is not right,” Krikorian said. “Only by keeping the bar high, so the only ones who get asylum are the ones who are really, really deserving, can it remain politically viable.”

But immigration attorneys say the bar can be too high.

“It doesn’t make sense to me why you have to have your feet amputated before you could qualify for asylum in the U.S.,” said David Bennion, a Philadelphia immigration attorney. He is representing the Dream 30, a group of young immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children, recently returned to Mexico or Central America and have now filed for asylum.

He is basing their claims on an untested theory: that people who have spent most of their lives in the U.S. speak and dress differently, making them targets because they are thought to have wealthy relatives.

“Judges are not shocked to hear a Chinese national say he worshiped in an underground church,” said Bruce Einhorn, a former immigration judge who directs the asylum clinic at Pepperdine University School of Law. But, he said, “a lot of judges get Mexican asylum cases and say out loud, ‘Mexico? Mexico?’”

For the time being, attorneys say, physical scars and extensive documentation are often required for a case from Latin America to be taken seriously.

The immigrant from Honduras, who is haunted by his cousin’s death, is sure he will die if he returns. The nation’s gangs, he said, are merciless: “They don’t stop bothering you until they kill you.”

She Has Covered Six Presidential Elections', 'Served As Bureau Chief In San Francisco']",Yakama tribe just says no to Washington state’s legal pot market,"TOPPENISH, Wash. — The Yakama Nation sits in the fertile heart of illegal marijuana country — Washington state’s answer to Mendocino County, minus the tie-dye.

The soil is rich. The growing season is long. And one of the biggest illegal pot grows in state history was seized here on sacred forested acres where the tribe hunts and gathers food in the shadow of Mt. Adams, also known as Pahto.

A year has passed since Washington voters legalized recreational marijuana use. State officials are poised to issue licenses to grow, process and sell what once was contraband. And the Yakama, after decades of battling substance abuse on their reservation, want no part of what will be one of the first legal recreational pot markets in America.

Which is why George Colby stepped up to the microphone during a raucous autumn meeting of the state Liquor Control Board and issued a stern warning to the officials who are creating the market and the would-be entrepreneurs who want to take part in it.

“I’m here to tell you that if you want to spend half a million dollars on growing marijuana in central Washington, I suggest you don’t do that,” the mild-mannered attorney admonished the crowd on behalf of his 10,000 clients and their 14 million or so acres east of the Cascade Mountains.

“Because we will come after you,” Colby promised. “The Yakama Nation will come after you. And under our treaty, all we have to do is pick up the phone and call the federal government and tell you to get off of our land.”

Local jurisdictions throughout Washington have considered measures to keep recreational marijuana out, at least temporarily, since voters passed Initiative 502 last year — 56% to 44% — legalizing pot and thrusting the Evergreen State into uncharted territory.

But few have arguments as powerful or needs as pressing as the Yakama Nation.

The tribe is ruled by a 158-year-old treaty prohibiting hard alcohol within its boundaries, and it runs one of the few dry casinos in America. Yet the harsh toll of drug and alcohol abuse scars nearly every family on the reservation, from Yakama Chairman Harry Smiskin’s on down.

“We do not want our people, or anyone else, to use, grow or sell marijuana on our lands,” Smiskin wrote in a recent opinion article on the seattlepi.com website. “We have had a long and unpleasant history with marijuana — just as we have had with alcohol. We fight them both on our lands.”

Concern about substance abuse dates from at least the 19th century, when the Yakama signed the Treaty of 1855 under great duress.

Today, the treaty is the tribe’s sole governing document. It protects the Yakama’s interests and is celebrated every summer with two parades, a powwow, a rodeo and a royal court.

Advertisement

Under the agreement, the Yakama reservation consists of just over a million acres; the tribe ceded more than 12 million acres to the federal government but retained the right to fish, hunt and gather traditional foods there.

The entire area is ruled by the treaty, the Yakama Law and Order Code and federal law. The first includes a ban on hard alcohol; no liquor stores exist within the reservation’s boundaries. The other two include bans on marijuana.

Alan E. Rathbun, licensing director for the state Liquor Control Board, said his agency would not issue marijuana business licenses on any federal land, including reservations.

But the Yakama Nation is “a little bit like a checkerboard,” he said, with several incorporated cities within its boundaries. The state has not assigned any of the 334 retail stores it plans to license to those cities — Toppenish, Wapato, and Harrah.

“The issue will be if an applicant chooses to seek a license in those areas” for a store, a grow operation or a processing plant, Rathbun said. “Our guess is the Yakama Nation will object. Then it will be up to the board to make a determination whether they want to issue a license there or not.”

The monthlong application period for marijuana business licenses ended Friday. Applicants have filled out the paperwork for production facilities and processing plants in Toppenish and Wapato. Applications also have been filed for pot operations just outside the border of the Yakama reservation in the tiny towns of Granger, Mabton and Zillah.

The tribe created its own database to monitor applications — not just on the reservation proper but also on the so-called ceded areas — in other words, the entire 14 million acres, more than 30% of the state.

And on Monday, “We’re going to be filing about 200 objections to applications in 10 counties that comprise the ceded and reserved areas of the Yakama Nation,” Colby said. “The citizens of the state of Washington don’t have the right to vote on what happens on tribal land.”

Every summer, Brian Frederickson soars above the reservation in a federal Drug Enforcement Administration helicopter — over forested lands closed to all but the Indians, crop rows as straight as a ruler, the small towns that dot the Yakima Valley floor.

A lieutenant with the Yakama Nation tribal police force, Frederickson is one of the most skilled “spotters” in a multiagency task force aimed at getting rid of illegal pot statewide. Each year the team has been more successful. Each year the job has become more difficult, as growers with ties to Mexican cartels go to greater lengths to hide their efforts.

“This is the different planting style they’re using now,” the burly lieutenant said as his computer screen filled with an aerial photograph showing a thick canopy of pine trees and a few pot plants peeking out beneath them. “In this grow they put a lot of effort into it. All the drip irrigation line was buried. You couldn’t see it from the air.”

Like most voters in and around the reservation, Frederickson said he opposed legalizing a substance he has worked so hard to get rid of.

“Alcohol has such an impact here,” Frederickson said. “I don’t see how anyone can logically think marijuana won’t have an impact. We went from one substance that’s legal. Now we have two to deal with.”

Eleanor Davis had a personal reason to vote against Initiative 502. A tribal elder with a deeply lined face, she spent 20 years at the Youth Treatment Center here, counseling young men and women with substance abuse problems.

Davis, 67, comes from “five or six generations of alcoholism.” She finds it easier to tally the sober members of her extended family than the ones who are still struggling.

Then there are the loved ones she lost, a list that includes the 23-year-old daughter who died of alcohol poisoning and the 21-year-old grandson — her dead daughter’s boy — who got drunk and got behind the wheel of his car after a party.

“After he passed away, that’s when I thought about what my grandmother said,” recounted Davis, who has been sober for 27 years. “You have to go out in the community, and you have to let people know.”

About alcohol. And, now, about marijuana. Because once a joint is as easy to buy as a six-pack, “It’s just going to create more damage to our people,” she said.

“And they just don’t need that.”

The agreement is the third-largest pharmaceutical settlement in United States history and the largest in a string of recent cases involving the marketing of antipsychotic and anti-seizure drugs to older dementia patients. It is part of a decade-long effort by the federal government to hold the health care giant — and other pharmaceutical companies — accountable for illegally marketing the drugs as a way to control patients with dementia in nursing homes and children with certain behavioral disabilities, despite the health risks of the drugs.

The settlement, which requires the approval of a federal judge, will also resolve accusations that the company inappropriately promoted two other drugs, the heart-failure drug Natrecor and Invega, a newer antipsychotic drug.

Much of the conduct highlighted in the case, which for Risperdal extends from 1999 through 2005, occurred while Alex Gorsky was vice president for sales and marketing and later president of the company’s pharmaceutical unit, Janssen. Mr. Gorsky became chief executive of Johnson & Johnson last year. Risperdal, which has lost its patent protection, was once one of the company’s best-selling drugs."

""I think there are too many people in jail for too long, and for not necessarily good reasons,"" Holder said in the interview, turning from the department's highly criticized crackdown on drug law enforcement. As NPR noted, almost half of the people in federal prison are serving time for drug charges.

""The war on drugs is now 30, 40 years old,"" he continued. ""There have been a lot of unintended consequences. There's been a decimation of certain communities, in particular communities of color.""

Holder hinted in the interview that the changes could include better prioritization of federal law enforcement and shortened sentences for minor drug offenses. According to NPR, Holder could announce his proposal as early as next week in a speech to the American Bar Association in San Francisco.

While Holder and the Obama administration have drawn criticism for publicly embracing a laissez-faire approach to marijuana laws but cracking down anyway, some observers believe this proposal for reform could be genuine.

""The country is in a bipartisan moment [in regard to drug policy] that makes major criminal justice reform possible,"" Bill Piper, Director of National Affairs of the Drug Policy Alliance, told The Huffington Post. ""You see it with bipartisan bills in Congress and bipartisan calls for sentencing reform. There's an opportunity that the administration realizes it can take advantage of, and I hope that they do.""

Indeed, bills like the Smarter Sentencing Act, which would lower mandatory minimums in sentencing, and the Justice Safety Valve Act, which would grant judges more leniency in imposing lesser sentences, were both introduced by bipartisan authors.

Piper also hopes the time might be right to address federal recommendations for marijuana law enforcement.

""They've been mentioning new recommendations on marijuana for the past year,"" said Piper. ""They've been slow on it for certain, but that is undoubtedly connected to drug policy. This would be a good time to address both."""

(CNN) —

Three people in Colorado may have died after smoking synthetic marijuana, state health officials fear. The Colorado Department of Public Health has launched an investigation into an outbreak of illnesses at hospitals that may be tied to the dangerous substance.

“Initial reports show approximately 75 people who reported smoking a form of synthetic marijuana may have been seen at hospitals in the Denver metro area and Colorado Springs beginning in late August,” said Dr. Tista Ghosh, interim chief medical officer for the state, in a written statement. “Several individuals were in intensive care and three deaths are being investigated as possibly associated.”

The Colorado Department of Health, with help from local health officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will attempt to figure out if the synthetic marijuana is to blame, and if so, whether all the patients were sickened by the same product or different ones.

But “don’t wait for the results of this investigation,” Ghosh urged. “If you have synthetic marijuana, stop using it and destroy it.”

Teen narrowly escapes death after smoking synthetic marijuana

Known as K2, Spice, Black Mamba, Mr. Smiley and Blaze, among other things, synthetic marijuana can have more serious consequences than regular marijuana, which is legal in Colorado. These synthetic cannabinoids are a blend of plant and herbal materials that have been sprayed with chemicals, producing an extra toxicity, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

Sold most often on the Internet, synthetic marijuana produces euphoric and psychoactive effects similar to those associated with marijuana. But doctors say there are additional side effects that may be particularly dangerous. The drug can leave patients catatonic and listless. And what makes matters worse, very little is known about synthetic marijuana or how to treat an adverse reaction or overdose.

According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, the number of calls to poison centers related to synthetic drugs soared from about 3,200 in 2010 to more than 13,000 in 2011.

“Easy access and the misperception that Spice products are ‘natural’ and therefore harmless have likely contributed to their popularity,” the NIDA website states. “Another selling point is that the chemicals used in Spice are not easily detected in standard drug tests.”

Because the chemicals used in these products have a high potential for abuse and no medical benefit, the DEA has designated five of the most common active chemicals frequently found in synthetic marijuana as Schedule I controlled substances, making it illegal to sell, buy, or possess them. But manufacturers seem to be changing the chemical compounds as fast as lawmakers enact legislation to ban them.

The CDC was sending a team of four to assist the investigation.

http://news.yahoo.com/first-state-licensed-marijuana-retailers-open-january-1-121942452--sector.html,,[],First state-licensed marijuana retailers to open January 1 in Colorado,"By Keith Coffman DENVER (Reuters) - The world's first state-licensed marijuana retailers, catering to Colorado's newly legal recreational market for pot, are stocking their shelves ahead of a New Year's grand opening that supporters and detractors alike see as a turning point in America's drug culture. Possession, cultivation and private personal consumption of marijuana by adults for the sake of just getting high has already been legal in Colorado for more than year under a state constitutional amendment approved by voters. But starting January 1, cannabis will be legally sold and taxed at specially regulated retailers in a system modeled after a regime many states have in place for alcohol sales - but which exists for marijuana nowhere outside of Colorado. For the novelty factor alone, operators of the first eight marijuana retailers slated to open on Wednesday morning in Denver and a handful of establishments in other locations are anticipating a surge in demand for store-bought weed. ""It will be like people waiting in line for tickets to a Pink Floyd concert,"" said Justin Jones, 39, owner of Dank Colorado in Denver who has run a medical marijuana shop for four years and now has a recreational pot license. Jones said he is confident he has enough marijuana on hand for Day One but less sure of inventory levels needed after that. About 90 percent of his merchandise is in smokable form, packaged in small child-proof containers. The rest is a mixture of cannabis-infused edibles, such as cookies, candy and carbonated drinks. ""People seem to prefer smoking,"" he said. FROM MEDICAL TO RECREATIONAL Washington state voters legalized recreational marijuana at the same time Colorado did, in November 2012, but it has yet to be made commercially available there. Pot designated strictly for medical use has been sold for some time in storefront shops in several of the nearly 20 states, including Colorado and Washington, that have deemed marijuana legal for health purposes. But Colorado is the first to open retail pot stores, and craft a regulatory framework to license, tax and enforce its use for recreation. Outside of the United States, Uruguay's parliament recently cleared the way for state-sanctioned marijuana sales, but the South American nation is at least months away from having a system in place. The Netherlands has long had an informal decriminalization policy, with Amsterdam coffee shops allowed to sell marijuana products to customers. But back-end distribution of the drug to those businesses remains illegal. ""It will actually be fully legal in Colorado, at least under state law, whereas in the Netherlands it's been tolerated, not actually legal,"" Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, a pro-liberalization group, told reporters earlier this month. ""Colorado is essentially the first. It's really the first in which this is explicitly legal and where marijuana is being grown legally, sold wholesale legally, sold retail legally,"" Nadelmann said. ""This is groundbreaking,"" said Mike Elliot, spokesman for Colorado's Medical Marijuana Industry Group. ""We are way ahead of Washington state, Amsterdam and Uruguay."" Critics of liberalized marijuana laws likewise view Colorado's new order as a landmark, albeit one they see in a more negative light. Kevin Sabet, co-founder of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a leading anti-legalization group, said the movement toward ending pot prohibition is sending the wrong signal to the nation's youth. ENDING PROHIBITION ""There will still need to be a black market to serve people who are ineligible to buy on a legal market, especially kids,"" Sabet said. ""It's almost the worst of both worlds."" Critics say the social harms of legalizing pot - from anticipated declines in economic productivity to a potential rise in traffic and workplace accidents - will outweigh any benefits. Legalization backers point to tax revenues to be gained and argue that anti-marijuana enforcement has accomplished little but to penalize otherwise law-abiding citizens, especially minorities. They also argue that legalization will free up strained law enforcement resources and strike a blow against drug cartels, much as repealing alcohol prohibition in the 1930s crushed bootlegging by organized crime. But Sabet counters, ""We are witnessing the birth of big marijuana,"" which he compared to the tobacco industry. Under Colorado's law, however, state residents can only buy as much as an ounce of marijuana at a time, while individuals from out of state are limited to quarter-ounce purchases. State law also limits cultivation to six marijuana plants per person. Those limits were not enough to deter a 30-year-old high school sports coach who is visiting Colorado from North Carolina but gave his name only as Matt. ""I don't really drink a whole lot, but I'd prefer to smoke a little bit and have a good time with the friends that I hang out with,"" he told Reuters on Friday. His New Year's plans include a ""Cannabition"" pot party in Denver. Marijuana remains classified an illegal narcotic under U.S. law. But in a major policy shift in August, the Obama administration said it would give states leeway to experiment with pot legalization, and let Colorado and Washington carry out their new laws permitting recreational use. The state has issued a total of 348 recreational pot licenses to businesses statewide, according to the Colorado Department of Revenue's Marijuana Enforcement Division. Of those, 136 are for retail stores, 178 for cultivation operations, 31 for manufacturing of infused edibles and other sundries, and three are for testing facilities. Last month, Colorado voters approved a combined 15 percent excise and 10 percent sales tax to be imposed on recreational pot sales, with the first $40 million raised to fund school construction projects. The Colorado Legislative Council estimates the marijuana taxation scheme will generate $67 million annually in tax revenue to state coffers. Only people over age 21 can buy recreational pot. Public use of marijuana remains illegal, as is driving while stoned. The state has set a blood-THC (the active ingredient in cannabis) limit of 5-nanogram-per-milliliter threshold for motorists. Other states are taking a wait-and-see approach to the Colorado and Washington experiments before they take the leap toward legalization, said Rachel Gillette, head of Colorado's chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. ""Colorado has found an exit strategy for the failed drug war and I hope other states will follow our lead,"" she said.

Before Joining The Times In', 'He Worked At The Philadelphia Inquirer', 'Where He Was A Reporter', 'Investigations Editor', 'At The Miami Herald', 'The Press Of Atlantic City', 'The Williamsport Sun-Gazette. He Left In']",Use of tough federal sentencing laws varies widely nationwide,"WASHINGTON — As drug dealers go, Lori Ann Newhouse was strictly small time.

A high school dropout from a little Iowa town, Newhouse had three sons, a low-paying job as a telemarketer and a relentless methamphetamine habit. On St. Patrick’s Day in 2011, Newhouse bought cold tablets used to make meth and traded them to a lab for a gram of the highly addictive drug.

Federal agents, it turned out, were watching.

Newhouse’s bust landed her in the federal system in northern Iowa, where drug sentences have been among the harshest in the nation. Prosecutors decided that a past conviction — she had been caught in a motel room with drugs and a dealer boyfriend — qualified her for a doubled mandatory minimum sentence, from five to 10 years.

Advertisement

U.S. District Judge Mark W. Bennett, a fierce critic of mandatory sentencing laws, thought that made no sense. “Newhouse is not Iowa’s Pablo Escobar,” he wrote in an opinion, referring to the infamous Colombian drug lord.

In an interview from prison in Mitchellville, Iowa, Newhouse said, “I was absolutely a nobody in that case.”

Under mandatory sentencing laws, it has become a not-so-hidden fact of life in federal courthouses that prosecutors — not judges — effectively decide how long many drug criminals will spend behind bars. The result has been federal prisons packed with drug offenders.

But Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. is now trying to steer the Justice Department away from the get-tough policies that have led to lengthy sentences for what one judge called the “low-hanging fruit” in the drug war — dime-a-dozen addicts and street dealers.

Prosecutors have considerable discretion under the laws. If they cite the amount of drugs seized in the charging document, that can trigger the mandatory minimum; if they leave it out, it doesn’t. For offenders with prior drug convictions, prosecutors can file a so-called 851 motion, named after a section in the federal code that automatically doubles a sentence — or makes it mandatory life.

Although the mandatory laws were supposed to lead to uniformity, statistics show huge variations across the country in how often prosecutors use them. Holder has instructed prosecutors to avoid using these powerful weapons against lower-level, nonviolent offenders, but, even so, they retain the authority to decide which small players get a break and which get slammed.

“It sounds really good, but it depends on how it’s carried out in the field,” Bennett said in an interview.

In the two months since Holder issued his new policy, some U.S. attorneys, including the two in Iowa, have begun to pull back, according to judges and attorneys.

“We had some terribly harsh sentences,” said Randy Murrell, federal public defender in the northern district of Florida. “It’s gone on for years, and no one had the courage and gumption to change it. I do think they are changing the policy now.”

But elsewhere, change has been slower in coming.

“We are hopeful that this will loosen up some of the policies, but we have certainly not seen it yet,” said Jonathan Hawley, the federal public defender in central Illinois, another district with a history of tough prosecutions.

The mandatory minimum drug law passed Congress in 1986, following the overdose death of University of Maryland basketball star Len Bias. The idea was to target drug kingpins and serious career drug traffickers.

“Drug kingpins — I haven’t seen one yet,” said senior District Judge Robert W. Pratt of Des Moines. Typically, he said, he handles meth users who turn to dealing in order to supply themselves.

Congress is now reconsidering the wisdom of that approach.

“There are instances where people who had a second or third strike got life in prison for a nonviolent crime,” said Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who is sponsoring a bill with Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, to allow federal judges to disregard mandatory sentences.

Prosecutors have been particularly aggressive in Iowa.

A study by the U.S. Sentencing Commission found that more than 47% of all drug defendants in Iowa’s southern federal court district ended up with mandatory minimum sentences in 2010 — the third-highest rate in the country. In the northern district, it was more than 40%, the sixth-highest rate. There’s even greater inconsistency in the use of 851 motions. In Iowa, they landed on about 80% of eligible offenders, according to sentencing commission data. In bordering Nebraska, the figure was 3%.

In a recent opinion, Bennett criticized the Justice Department for the “jaw-dropping, shocking disparity” in how prosecutors wielded the motions. He called the process “both whimsical and arbitrary, like a Wheel of Misfortune.”

Some say prosecutors will be reluctant to give up a powerful tool to break open cases — the ability to threaten recalcitrant witnesses with a long federal sentence if they don’t play ball.

“It is the underlying culture that you measure yourself with the lengths of sentences that you receive,” Brett Tolman, a former U.S. attorney in Utah, said at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.

One federal judge in Brooklyn, N.Y., said Holder’s policy didn’t go far enough to rein in prosecutors who routinely wielded 851 sentence enhancements as a “2-by-4 to the forehead” to force defendants to accept plea deals. If the Justice Department “cannot exercise its power … less destructively and less brutally, it doesn’t deserve to have the power at all,” wrote District Judge John Gleeson, a former prosecutor, in a sentencing opinion last month.

A Justice Department official said the agency would monitor drug cases across the country but was confident that prosecutors “understand that these new guidelines are aimed at ensuring federal laws are enforced more fairly, and federal resources are used more efficiently.”

The new policy has already led to some changes in Iowa.

In the southern district, the top prosecutor is Nicholas A. Klinefeldt, a former defense attorney with an unusual family history. His father is a convicted meth dealer who spent 10 years in federal prison, on a mandatory sentence doubled by an 851 motion. Klinefeldt said his office now declined smaller meth lab cases, avoided triggering mandatory minimums and rarely filed for 851 enhancements.

U.S. Atty. Sean Berry in the northern district had continued to seek tough sentences until Holder issued his memo, but said his office recently withdrew requests for double sentences for two drug offenders.

The shift comes too late for Newhouse, who received an 851 enhancement based on a state bust nine years earlier, when she was found with meth and psychedelic mushrooms.

Newhouse, 34, could have ended up with even more time. An addict since she was 15 with a string of drug-dealing boyfriends, she had other drug arrests. Prosecutors first classified her as a career offender; guidelines called for a 22-year sentence. But they decided that would be unfair and asked for 10 years, minus two years for cooperation.

“I was going to get years, regardless,” Newhouse said. “They took all that time I had to be away from my kids, and doubled it.”

Authorities said the website had been used by “several thousand drug dealers” since January 2011 to distribute hundreds of kilograms of narcotics with sales exceeding $1 billion.

Federal authorities said they had seized Bitcoin worth about $3.6 million, which they said is the largest seizure ever of the virtual currency.

QUIZ: How much do you know about the Bitcoin?

The FBI also seized the Silk Road website, which customers could access only after running the anonymity software Tor, which encrypts Web traffic and makes it difficult to determine who’s running the site, or visiting it.

Federal prosecutors said the website was operated by a man who called himself “Dread Pirate Roberts,” who was actually 29-year-old Ross William Ulbricht. FBI agents arrested Ulbricht on Tuesday in San Francisco, said Julie Bolcer, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York, which is handling the case.

In an affidavit filed in court, an FBI agent said Ulbricht had operated the Silk Road website since January 2011, using it to sell cocaine, heroin, LSD and other controlled substances to customers in the United States.

FBI special agent Christopher Tarbell also said Ulbricht had attempted to orchestrate the murder of an unidentified Silk Road user who had threatened to expose the identities of thousands of the website’s customers. The affidavit did not say whether the murder-for-hire plot was carried out.

Misguided former Rep. Patrick Kennedy to fight 'misguided' legalized marijuana","Patrick Kennedy

Apparently having nothing better to do now that he is no longer in office, former Rep. Patrick Kennedy, the eight-term congressman from Rhode Island, will unveil his personal crusade Wednesday in Denver. It's called Project SAM, Smart Approaches to Marijuana. It is anything but smart, however, what with its opposition to both medical marijuana and legalization of weed. He and those working with him say they seek a third way that ""neither legalizes, nor demonizes, marijuana.""

Thank goodness for small favors, Project SAM won't be promoting more of the arrests and lock-ups that have maimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans over eight decades for partaking of a mind-altering substance which all but the most stubborn opponents know causes harm to vastly fewer people than alcohol. That latter product has been legal in most of the nation for 80 years after a 14-year experiment with prohibition that helped make organized crime big business, exacerbated lethal violence and corrupted police departments from coast to coast as outlaw entrepreneurs sought to meet consumer demand.

Sound familiar? Just a few years after alcohol was re-legalized, marijuana was banned and has stayed that way for 75 years. Supplying the black market for the stuff is a gigantic business, both domestic and imported. The main foreign source is still Mexico, where the drug cartels whose wars have killed an estimated 50,000 people in the past seven years still get about half their profits from the marijuana trade. On the import side, the misbegotten War on Drugs launched 42 years ago by Richard Nixon has consumed a trillion (with a ""t"") dollars, which doesn't include income losses from people having their careers ruined or student loans chopped off because of marijuana convictions.

To his credit, Kennedy wants to see an end to such corrosive stupidity. But in its place, instead of legalization, he wants to impose mandatory drug treatment. That presumes everyone who uses marijuana is addicted or otherwise negatively affected. And this is, to put it plainly, bullshit. As is Kennedy's claim made Tuesday: “Marijuana destroys the brain and expedites psychosis. It’s just overall a very dangerous drug.”

For tens of millions of people, sir?

Disputing this idiocy doesn't mean marijuana isn't without health risks. It has some. Fact of life: Mind-altering substances of all kinds are dangerous to the mental health of a certain percentage of users.

But let's pretend for just a moment that legal marijuana would generate one-tenth the amount of mental illness, extra deaths, extra diseases, car and job accidents, bar fights, marital troubles, violent crimes and addictions as alcohol. I know, I know. Ludicrous. But just for the sake of argument, pretend. If someone could prove to a certainty, with psychic powers, say, that legalizing marijuana would become one tenth as deadly as legal alcohol, wouldn't that be a good reason to join Project SAM?

It might. Assuming, of course, that we were planning to crank up the old Temperance Union and fight to re-prohibit alcohol. Which we will never do.

Like alcohol, narcotics and other drugs, marijuana is not appropriate for underage individuals. People shouldn't drive, hunt or operate chainsaws while high. And, of course, some people are fools sober or high and will do things they shouldn't. But adults should not be forced to accept a misdemeanor or felony marijuana conviction on their record unless, as Kennedy is proposing, they submit to treatment that they don't need for consuming a substance that, for most users, does not cause mental problems, reduce their IQs or spur them to start mainlining heroin or smoking meth.

In the place of medical marijuana, now legal in 20 states, Kennedy wants extracted cannabinoids to be used. That's fine for ailments on which these extracts work. But that is not the case with many afflictions. There is apparently a beneficial synergy among at least some of the many chemicals in marijuana that extracts cannot achieve on their own.

How about instead of Kennedy's ""third way"" nonsense we just stop arresting people for using marijuana? Period. How about legalizing cultivation and sale under strict regulation and taxing?

Too extreme? Compared with what? The f'n War on Drugs?

Perhaps, since Patrick Kennedy has a history of alcohol, cocaine and oxycontin abuse, including driving under the influence, he might try focusing his crusade on the problems associated with substances he knows more intimately instead of one with an overdose death rate of zero and extremely low incidences of triggering violent behavior. Kennedy and the other crusaders involved with Project SAM, like former Bush speechwriter David Frum and former White House economic adviser Austin Goolsbee, who sit on its board, may be well intended. But their third-way approach is way way off the mark."
http://news.yahoo.com/wash-police-dogs-not-smelling-pot-anymore-075042215.html,,[],Some Wash. police dogs not smelling pot anymore,"BREMERTON, Wash. (AP) — When Dusty, a 19-month-old black Labrador, walked past a pipe full of marijuana during a recent police search of a house, he was doing exactly what his handler hoped.

The newest drug-sniffing dog on the police force in Bremerton, near Seattle, is one of a few police dogs in Washington state that are not trained to point out pot during searches. Other police departments are considering or in the midst of re-training their dogs to ignore pot as well, part of the new reality in a state where voters last fall legalized marijuana use.

""We wanted to train our dog on what was truly illegal substances, that would be heroin, methamphetamine and cocaine,"" said Dusty's handler, Officer Duke Roessel, who added that Dusty nabbed five pounds of meth during that recent search.

Police departments in Bremerton, Bellevue and Seattle, as well as the Washington State Patrol, have either put the dogs through pot desensitization training or plan not to train them for marijuana detection.

The law decriminalized possession of up to an ounce of the drug for individuals over 21 years old. It also barred the distribution and growth of marijuana outside the state-approved system.

Police say that having a K-9 unit that doesn't alert to pot will lessen challenges to obtaining search warrants because the dog won't be pointing out possible legal amounts of the drug. Traditionally, dogs are trained to alert on the smell of marijuana, heroin, crack cocaine, methamphetamine and cocaine. They can't tell which one it is or how much of each there is.

In December, the Washington Association of Prosecuting Attorneys told officers in a guidance memo that dogs that alert on pot face limitations when a search warrant is sought but those are ""not fatal to a determination of probable cause.""

The group instructed officers to point out that the dog was trained to smell pot and how that is relevant to other information when they seek a warrant, and that a ""narcotics-trained canine's alert will still be relevant to the probable cause equation.""

Story continues

In Pierce County, however, prosecutor Mark Lindquist said authorities are being cautious about the new law because judges might excise the dog sniff from their analysis of probable cause. He's also not convinced dogs can be re-trained. ""We'll need new dogs to alert on substances that are illegal,"" he said.

In January, the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission removed detecting marijuana from its canine team certification standards. The change doesn't prohibit trainers from doing so, but it's not required anymore.

But some police departments aren't making any changes. And some observers say that a state Supreme Court decision in 2010 in which the justices sided against medical marijuana patients who argued police officers no longer had probable cause to immediately arrest or investigate due to the legalization of medical pot.

Last fall's legalization law ""just made one ounce not a crime for adults. That means that any amount over an ounce is still illegal, growing marijuana is still illegal, selling marijuana is still illegal, passing a joint to somebody is still illegal,"" said medical marijuana advocate and attorney Douglas Hiatt.

For different reasons, dog trainer Fred Helfers of the Pacific Northwest Detection Dog Association agreed with Hiatt.

But having spent 20 years as a narcotics investigator, Helfers said departments who abandoned pot training are having a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. He said they may miss actual crimes being committed. ""What about trafficking? What about people who have more than an ounce?"" he said.

Nonetheless, Helfers is helping departments who want to go through the ""extinction"" training, which he said is a common method to change what substances dogs alert to. It takes about an initial 30 days plus every day reinforcements to modify the dog's behavior.

""Overall, I think there's still a large amount of agencies on a wait-and-see approach with their dogs,"" Helfers said.

The Obama administration said Thursday that it would not challenge laws legalizing marijuana in Colorado and Washington state as long as those states maintain strict rules involving the sale and distribution of the drug.

In a memo to U.S. attorneys in all 50 states, Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole said the Justice Department is “committed to using its limited investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent and rational way.” He stressed that marijuana remains illegal under federal law.

The memo, which was welcomed by proponents of marijuana legalization, directs federal prosecutors to focus on eight areas of enforcement rather than spending time targeting individual users. Those aims include preventing distribution of marijuana to minors, stopping the growing of marijuana on public land, keeping pot from falling into the hands of cartels and gangs, and preventing the diversion of marijuana to states where it remains illegal.

Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. called the governors of Colorado and Washington about noon Thursday to inform them of the decision. A Justice official said Holder told them that federal prosecutors would be watching closely as the two states finalize a regulatory framework for marijuana and that prosecutors would be taking a “trust but verify” approach.

Last fall, Washington and Colorado approved initiatives to legalize the possession of less than an ounce of marijuana, becoming the first states to approve the drug for recreational use. Twenty states and the District have passed laws legalizing marijuana for medicinal purposes.

Until Thursday, the administration had remained silent about the initiatives in Colorado and Washington, despite requests for guidance from state officials.

“We recognize how difficult this issue has been for the Department of Justice and we appreciate the thoughtful approach it has taken,” Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D), who opposed efforts to legalize marijuana last year, said in a statement. “Amendment 64 put Colorado in conflict with federal law. Today’s announcement shows the federal government is respecting the will of Colorado voters.”

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), in a statement with state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, said the guidance “reflects a balanced approach by the federal government that respects the states’ interests in implementing these laws and recognizes the federal government’s role in fighting illegal drugs and criminal activity.”

Proponents of marijuana legalization welcomed the new administration guidance.

“This is a very significant step forward,” said Christian Sederberg, a Denver lawyer who helped draft Amendment 64. “The simple truth is that a tightly regulated marijuana market is superior to the criminal market. ­State-regulated business will now be able to continue creating good jobs and generating tax revenue. This is what progress looks like.”

Sederberg said state lawmakers and a government-backed task force in Colorado have tried to deal with the concerns of federal officials — such as keeping pot out of the hands of minors — while setting up the regulatory framework for a marijuana market.

Sam Kamin, a University of Denver law professor and a member of the governor’s task force that helped devise Colorado’s forthcoming marijuana regulations, said Thursday’s memo represents a “big change of direction for the federal government” but one that was overdue.

“Marijuana exists in this strange place where a number of states permit it but the federal government prohibits it. For a long time, it’s been pretty untenable,” Kamin said. “For the first time . . . they’re saying that if you can do a good job with it, we will not come in with the hammer of federal enforcement.”

But he said questions remain.

The guidance steers clear of whether major banks — which have been wary of giving credit to marijuana-related businesses — can now do so without fear of legal consequences. Because marijuana remains illegal under federal law, it also means individuals still risk losing their jobs, apartments, even custody of children if they are found using a drug that is legal on the state level.

Perhaps most significant, Kamin noted, Thursday’s action represents the views of one administration — and the next one might see things differently. “This could be wiped out with a stroke of a pen,” he said.

Not everyone saw Thursday's action as a positive step.

“We can look forward to more drugged driving accidents, more school drop-outs, and poorer health outcomes as a new Big Marijuana industry targeting kids and minorities emerges to fuel the flames,"" Patrick Kennedy, co-founder of Project SAM (Smart Approaches to Marijuana), said in a statement. The group opposes marijuana legalization.

The Obama administration has long wrestled with how to respond to state laws permitting marijuana use for one reason or another.

In 2009, then-Deputy Attorney General David W. Ogden wrote a memo to U.S. attorneys saying that prosecution of significant traffickers of illegal drugs, including marijuana, remained a top priority. But he also said that the prosecution of individuals using the drug for medicinal purposes in compliance with state law “is unlikely to be an efficient use of limited federal resources.” In 2011, Cole reiterated Ogden’s stance on medical marijuana but cited the increase in large-scale commercial marijuana operations “for purported medical purposes.”

In December, Obama told Barbara Walters of ABC News that recreational marijuana use in states that have legalized the drug was not a major concern.

“We’ve got bigger fish to fry,” he said.

Thursday’s memo, while significant, makes clear that the federal government reserves the right to revisit its position in the future.

WASHINGTON  The Food and Drug Administration says some chicken meat may contain small amounts of arsenic, though the agency is stressing that the amount is too tiny to be dangerous to people who eat it.

The FDA said Wednesday that a new study by the agency shows that an ingredient in chicken feed that contains arsenic, called Roxarsone, may make its way into parts of the bird that are eaten. Previous studies have indicated the arsenic was eliminated with chicken waste.

Pfizer, which makes the feed ingredient, said Wednesday that it will pull it off the market in the United States. The FDA said it would be banned because it is a carcinogen.

Many poultry producers have already stopped feeding their birds the ingredient, which was used to kill parasites and promote growth.

The FDA said people do not need to stop eating chicken that may have been treated with the drug. Michael Taylor, FDA's deputy commissioner for foods, says the study raised ""concerns of a very low but completely avoidable exposure to a carcinogen.""

Pfizer said in a statement that its subsidiary, Alpharma, is suspending sales next month in response to the FDA findings. The company said it is not withdrawing the ingredient immediately so chicken producers have time to transition their birds off the drug.

Scott Brown of Pfizer Animal Health's Veterinary Medicine Research and Development division said the company also sells the ingredient in about a dozen other countries. He said Pfizer is reaching out to regulatory authorities in those countries and will decide whether to sell it on an individual basis.

In a study of 100 chickens, the FDA found that chickens that had eaten the Roxarsone had higher levels of inorganic arsenic — as opposed to organic arsenic, which is naturally occurring — in their livers than chickens that had not been fed Roxarsone. Inorganic arsenic is more toxic than the naturally occurring form.

Roxarsone has long been a concern for environmental groups worried about its presence in chicken waste and the resulting effects on human health in areas with high chicken production. Maryland state lawmakers have tried to force a ban in that state, saying the arsenic ends up in the Chesapeake Bay.

The National Chicken Council, which represents companies that produce and process chickens, said in a statement that the ingredient has been used to maintain good health in chickens for many years, and that it is used in ""many, but not all"" flocks.

""Chicken is safe to eat,"" the group said.

Based on reviews of court records and interviews with law enforcement officials, the Associated Press claims that Mexican drug cartel “groups have begun deploying agents from their inner circles to the U.S.”

“Cartel operatives are suspected of running drug-distribution networks in at least nine non-border states, often in middle-class suburbs in the Midwest, South and Northeast,” the report claimed.

Jack Riley, the law enforcement official in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Chicago office described the infiltration as “probably the most serious threat the United States has faced from organized crime.” Riley added, “People think, ‘The border’s 1,700 miles away. This isn’t our problem.’ Well, it is. These days, we operate as if Chicago is on the border.”

Riley believes that the increased presence of Mexican drug cartel operatives has lead to an increase in violent crime in Chicago. “They are the puppeteers. Maybe the shooter didn’t know and maybe the victim didn’t know that. But if you follow it down the line, the cartels are ultimately responsible.”

In February, Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane said that Mexican drug cartels “are taking over our neighborhoods.” In Louisville, Metropolitan Police Department Lieutenant Richard Pearson noted, “This is the first time we’ve been seeing it — cartels who have their operatives actually sent here.”

Monday’s Associated Press report comes on the heels of a story reported by Breitbart News on Sunday that examined possible connections between the Saturday murders of Kaufman Texas County District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia and an alleged alliance between the Aryan Brotherhood and Mexican drug cartels."

The store owners began lining up outside the Mile High City’s Department of Excise and Licenses before the doors opened at 8 a.m., Amber Miller, a city spokeswoman, said in an email to the Los Angeles Times.

Denver is among the 26 Colorado municipalities and counties that will allow medical marijuana businesses to begin transitioning into retail marijuana businesses on Jan. 1.

Amendment 64, which voters approved last year, legalized recreational pot use in the state for people over 21. However, retail sales of the drug are not permitted until the new year.

Miller said 315 applications, for marijuana stores, growing facilities, infused product manufacturing sites and test labs have been submitted to the city so far. Of these, 122 are for stores only, she said.

[Updated, 5:04 p.m. PST Dec. 27: As of 4:30 p.m. PST, 34 store applicants had “completed the state and city licensing processes and picked up their licenses today,” she said.]

“Those 10 stores are now fully licensed and able to open on Jan. 1 if they choose to do so,” she said. “We also have 12 grows now fully licensed and two infused product manufacturers. That is a total of 24 retail marijuana businesses that have their city and state licenses.”

The Colorado Department of Revenue’s Marijuana Enforcement Division has approved 348 retail marijuana licenses to prospective retail marijuana establishments, according to a release issued on its site on Monday.

Of the total licenses in the state, 136 were given to marijuana stores, 178 to marijuana cultivation facilities, 31 to product manufacturing facilities and three to marijuana testing facilities.

The Department of Revenue’s Marijuana Enforcement Division opened up its application process on Oct. 1, about one year after Colorado voters legalized recreational marijuana and just one month before voters resoundingly supported taxing it.

In order to be issued a license, businesses must submit required documentation, pay licensing fees and undergo background and financial checks.

They must also receive permission from local jurisdictions, which have the right to choose whether to allow retail marijuana business within their county or city limits, the release stated.

Miller said the state had administered 102 licenses to Denver store applicants thus far.

Justin Jones, owner of Dank Colorado, a medical marijuana dispensary in Denver, was one of the people waiting for his license Friday morning.

“The process went smoothly,” Jones, 39, told The Times. “It’s been very similar to what we’ve gone through in the past with getting medical marijuana licensing.”

Jones said he believed store sales would definitely increase as the market expands.

“It really is blue skies,” he said.

Marijuana sales will help Colorado’s economy, he said, noting tourism will draw in more customers and tax revenue.

Other stores are also eager for Wednesday.

Dixie Elixirs, another Denver store, has been updating its Facebook page with a 100-day “cannabis countdown.”

Mason Tvert, a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, said the impending legal sale of marijuana was significant for Denver, the state of Colorado and the United States as a whole.

“For the first time in history, adults will be purchasing marijuana from legitimate businesses instead of in the underground market,” he told The Times.

“It’s going to generate tens of millions of dollars in revenue for the state and allow law enforcement officials to spend their time focusing on other more serious crimes.”

As far as backlash, Tvert said, “I don’t think the sky is going to fall. Life will go on as usual, except those who buy marijuana will be able to do so safely.”

Tvert said he thinks other states, such as Alaska and Oregon, will be next in following similar legislation.

Colorado and Washington are currently the only states that have adopted laws permitting the sale of marijuana for recreational use.

USA TODAY

Ad advocating legalization was made for about %24350 over three days

It will not appear anywhere inside the track or on track property

Ad says marijuana is %27less harmful than alcohol%27

Fans attending a major NASCAR race this weekend will see a most unlikely video posted on a giant video screen shortly before entering the track: a pro-marijuana legalization ad.

Outside the NASCAR Brickyard 400 in Indianapolis, the same track that hosts the famed Indianapolis 500, Marijuana Policy Project, the nation's largest pro-marijuana legalization advocacy group, has purchased space to air – dozens of times over the weekend – a video that pushes the theme that marijuana is less harmful than alcohol.

It marks the first time a pro-marijuana legalization ad will appear so close to an entrance gate of a major sporting event. The Brickyard 400, in its 20th year, is regarded as one of NASCAR's biggest races.

But the video ad isn't just pro-marijuana. While it's made to look like a beer ad, its tone sounds anti-alcohol. Unlike beer, a narrator in the video says, marijuana has ""no calories,"" ""no hangovers"" and, the ad says, ""it's not linked to violence or reckless behavior.""

The video ends with this tagline: ""Less harmful than alcohol, and time to treat it that way.""

NASCAR has no affiliation with the advertiser or the company selling the inventory, and the ad will not appear anywhere on track property. NASCAR executives declined to comment.

Even then, it makes for a potentially uncomfortable pairing for NASCAR. Crown Royal whiskey is a major sponsor of the race. Miller Lite also is a sponsor.

For the Marijuana Policy Project, the Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group behind the video ad, it's a potential PR bonanza. Over the three-day weekend race, upwards of 600,000 fans may attend the race. The privately-owned track seats 225,000.

""We think it's critical that the public recognize that marijuana is objectively less harmful than alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert, who created the spot and who is a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project. ""We wanted to reach out to an audience that clearly appreciates that adults should be able to use beer and alcohol responsibly. They should also be able to use marijuana responsibly – since it's less harmful.""

He says he bought the ad space from Grazie Media for a ""non-profit"" rate of $2,200. The spot, which he says he and two staffers made with stock film footage for about $350 over three days, is scheduled to appear 72 times over the three-day period.

J. Douglas Boles, president of Indianapolis Motor Speedway, said in a statement that the track is not affiliated with Grazie Media and the ad is not on track property ""or on property over which we have any control.""

Grazie Media executives declined to comment."

USA TODAY

The Obama administration is protesting the release of convicted murderer and drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero.

A statement from Caitlin Hayden:

""We are deeply concerned by the release of Rafael Caro Quintero from prison in Mexico. He had been serving a 40-year prison term for the 1985 kidnapping, torture and murder of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique 'Kiki' Camarena.

""We have seen reports that another individual connected to Camarena's killing could also be released.

""We remain as committed today in seeing Quintero and others involved in this crime face justice in the United States as we were in the immediate aftermath of Kiki Camarena's murder and will work closely with the Mexican authorities on this.""

Some background from the Associated Press:

""Infamous drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero walked free Friday after 28 years in prison when a court overturned his 40-year sentence for the 1985 kidnapping and killing of a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent, a brutal murder that marked a low point in U.S.-Mexico relations. ...

""Mexico's Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said in a statement that he was 'worried' about the court's decision, adding that his office is analyzing whether there are any charges pending against Caro Quintero.

""Caro Quintero, 60, was a founding member of one of Mexico's earliest and biggest drug cartels. The court ruled Wednesday that he had been improperly tried in a federal court for a crime that should have been treated as a state offense. Prison officials were notified of the ruling on Thursday, and an official at the Jalisco state prosecutors' office said the drug lord left prison before dawn on Friday. The official was not authorized to speak on the record.

""News media were not alerted until hours after the release, and U.S. authorities apparently received no prior notification."""

http://news.yahoo.com/marijuanas-march-toward-mainstream-confounds-feds-123441112.html,,[],Marijuana's march toward mainstream confounds feds,"WASHINGTON (AP) — It took 50 years for American attitudes about marijuana to zigzag from the paranoia of ""Reefer Madness"" to the excesses of Woodstock back to the hard line of ""Just Say No.""

The next 25 years took the nation from Bill Clinton, who famously ""didn't inhale,"" to Barack Obama, who most emphatically did.

Now, in just a few short years, public opinion has moved so dramatically toward general acceptance that even those who champion legalization are surprised at how quickly attitudes are changing and states are moving to approve the drug — for medical use and just for fun.

It is a moment in America that is rife with contradictions:

—People are looking more kindly on marijuana even as science reveals more about the drug's potential dangers, particularly for young people.

—States are giving the green light to the drug in direct defiance of a federal prohibition on its use.

—Exploration of the potential medical benefit is limited by high federal hurdles to research.

Washington policymakers seem reluctant to deal with any of it.

Richard Bonnie, a University of Virginia law professor who worked for a national commission that recommended decriminalizing marijuana in 1972, sees the public taking a big leap from prohibition to a more laissez-faire approach without full deliberation.

""It's a remarkable story historically,"" he says. ""But as a matter of public policy, it's a little worrisome.""

More than a little worrisome to those in the anti-drug movement.

""We're on this hundred-mile-an-hour freight train to legalizing a third addictive substance,"" says Kevin Sabet, a former drug policy adviser in the Obama administration, lumping marijuana with tobacco and alcohol.

Legalization strategist Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, likes the direction the marijuana smoke is wafting. But knows his side has considerable work yet to do.

""I'm constantly reminding my allies that marijuana is not going to legalize itself,"" he says.

By the numbers:

Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have legalized the use of marijuana for medical purposes since California voters made the first move in 1996. Voters in Colorado and Washington state took the next step last year and approved pot for recreational use. Alaska is likely to vote on the same question in 2014, and a few other states are expected to put recreational use on the ballot in 2016.

Nearly half of adults have tried marijuana, 12 percent of them in the past year, according to a survey by the Pew Research Center.

Fifty-two percent of adults favor legalizing marijuana, up 11 percentage points just since 2010, according to Pew.

Sixty percent think Washington shouldn't enforce federal laws against marijuana in states that have approved its use.

___

Where California led the charge on medical marijuana, the next chapter in this story is being written in Colorado and Washington state.

Policymakers there are grappling with all sorts of sticky issues revolving around one central question: How do you legally regulate the production, distribution, sale and use of marijuana for recreational purposes when federal law bans all of the above?

The Justice Department began reviewing the matter after last November's election. But seven months later, states still are on their own.

Both sides in the debate paid close attention when Obama said in December that ""it does not make sense, from a prioritization point of view, for us to focus on recreational drug users in a state that has already said that under state law that's legal.""

Rep. Jared Polis, a Colorado Democrat who favors legalization, predicts Washington will take a hands-off approach, based on Obama's comments. But he's quick to add: ""We would like to see that in writing.""

The federal government already has taken a similar approach toward users in states that have approved marijuana for medical use.

It doesn't go after pot-smoking cancer patients or grandmas with glaucoma. But it also has made clear that people who are in the business of growing, selling and distributing marijuana on a large scale are subject to potential prosecution for violations of the Controlled Substances Act — even in states that have legalized medical use.

___

There's a political calculus for the president, or any other politician, in all of this.

Younger people, who tend to vote more Democratic, are more supportive of legalizing marijuana, as are people in the West, where the libertarian streak runs strong.

Despite increasing public acceptance of marijuana overall, politicians know there are complications that could come with commercializing an addictive substance. Opponents of pot are particularly worried that legalization will result in increased use by young people.

Sabet frames the conundrum for Obama: ""Do you want to be the president that stops a popular cause, especially a cause that's popular within your own party? Or do you want to be the president that enables youth drug use that will have ramifications down the road?""

Marijuana legalization advocates offer politicians a rosier scenario, in which legitimate pot businesses eager to keep their operating licenses make sure not to sell to minors.

""Having a regulated system is the only way to ensure that we're not ceding control of this popular substance to the criminal market and to black marketeers,"" says Aaron Smith, executive director of the National Cannabis Industry Association, a trade group for legal pot businesses in the U.S.

___

While the federal government hunkers down, Colorado and Washington state are moving forward on their own with regulations covering everything from how plants will be grown to how many stores will be allowed.

Tim Lynch, director of the libertarian Cato Institute's Project on Criminal Justice, predicts ""the next few years are going to be messy"" as states work to bring a black-market industry into the sunshine.

California's experience with medical marijuana offers a window into potential pitfalls that can come with wider availability of pot.

Dispensaries for medical marijuana have proliferated in the state, and regulation has been lax, prompting a number of cities around the state to ban dispensaries.

In May, the California Supreme Court ruled that cities and counties can ban medical marijuana dispensaries. A few weeks later, Los Angeles voters approved a ballot measure that limits the number of pot shops in the city to 135, down from an estimated high of about 1,000.

This isn't full-scale buyer's remorse, but more a course correction before the inevitable next push for full-on legalization in the state.

___

Growing support for legalization doesn't mean everybody wants to light up: Barely one in 10 Americans used pot in the past year.

Those who do want to see marijuana legalized range from libertarians who oppose much government intervention to people who want to see an activist government aggressively regulate marijuana production and sales.

For some, money talks: Why let drug cartels rake in untaxed profits when a cut could go into government coffers?

There are other threads in the growing acceptance of pot.

People think it's not as dangerous as once believed. They worry about high school kids getting an arrest record. They see racial inequity in the way marijuana laws are enforced. They're weary of the ""war on drugs.""

Opponents counter with a 2012 study finding that regular use of marijuana during teen years can lead to a long-term drop in IQ, and another study indicating marijuana use can induce and exacerbate psychotic illness in susceptible people. They question the notion that regulating pot will bring in big money, saying revenue estimates are grossly exaggerated.

They reject the claim that prisons are bulging with people convicted of simple possession by citing federal statistics showing only a small percentage of federal and state inmates are behind bars for that alone.

They warn that baby boomers who draw on their own innocuous experiences with pot are overlooking the much higher potency of today's marijuana.

In 2009, concentrations of THC, the psychoactive ingredient in pot, averaged close to 10 percent in marijuana, compared with about 4 percent in the 1980s, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

""If marijuana legalization was about my old buddies at Berkeley smoking in People's Park once a week I don't think many of us would care that much,"" says Sabet, who helped to found Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a group that opposes legalization. ""It's really about creating a new industry that's going to target kids and target minorities and our vulnerable populations just like our legal industries do today.""

___

So how bad, or good, is pot?

J. Michael Bostwick, a psychiatrist at the Mayo Clinic, set out to sort through more than 100 sometimes conflicting studies after his teenage son became addicted to pot, and turned his findings into a 22-page article for Mayo Clinic Proceedings in 2012.

For all of the talk that smoking pot is no big deal, Bostwick says he determined that ""it was a very big deal. There were addiction issues. There were psychosis issues.

But there was also this very large body of literature suggesting that it could potentially have very valuable pharmaceutical applications but the research was stymied"" by federal barriers.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse says research is ongoing.

Dr. Nora Volkow, the institute's director, worries that legalizing pot will result in increased use of marijuana by young people, and impair their brain development.

""Think about it: Do you want a nation where your young people are stoned?"" she asks.

Partisans on both sides think people in other states will keep a close eye on Colorado and Washington as they decide what happens next.

""Reefer Madness,"" the 1936 propaganda movie that pot fans turned into a cult classic in the 1970s, spins a tale of dire consequences ""ending often in incurable insanity.""

People taking advantage of the state-legal marijuana sales that begin Jan. 1 in Colorado should be aware of another new law there -- a measure passed last spring that creates a ""permissive inference"" of intoxication when a driver tests above five nanograms of THC per milliliter of blood.

Among states' legal limits for marijuana in the bloodstream while driving, Colorado's is relatively lenient. More than a dozen states have ""per se"" cannabis driving laws that hand a DUI conviction, without a trial, to anyone exceeding the state's THC blood limit. Most of those limits are set at zero. Most states have effect-based laws that require evidence of impairment due to recent ingestion of a controlled substance for a DUI conviction. Get the specifics on your state's drugged driving laws here.

There is no evidence that per se laws reduce traffic fatalities, according to a recent study by D. Mark Anderson of Montana State University and Daniel Rees of the University of Colorado. They may also ""inadvertently become a criminal mechanism for law enforcement and prosecutors to punish those who have engaged in legally protected behavior and who have not posed any actionable traffic safety threat,"" Paul Armentano of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws said in a peer-reviewed report examining the limitations of per se cannabis driving laws.

In Washington state, where recreational marijuana use is legal and a per se driving law has been passed, a growing number of drivers are testing positive for marijuana. According to the Associated Press, a State Patrol spokesman said the increase might be because ""we're testing blood we didn't test before.""

The White House has recommended that all states pass zero-tolerance per se drugged driving laws."

Asked whether consumers mistakenly believe that the shot does not produce a caffeine-related crash, Ms. Lutz said that the use of the special mark and its explanation were clear. “I don’t believe that it is misleading,” said Ms. Lutz, who added that the advertising division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus had approved the “No Crash Later” claim.

She added that another study showing the benefits of 5-Hour Energy was undergoing “peer review” for possible publication in a scientific journal. But she declined to say why the results of the study, which was apparently conducted five years ago, had not yet appeared. That study found a benefit when 5-Hour Energy was compared to a placebo like flavored water, she said.

Whatever the case, the energy drink boom has come full circle in Asia, the region where it started. Over the last decade, sales of Lipovitan D have fallen and its maker, Taisho Pharmaceuticals, has tried various strategies to revitalize the brand. Among them: bringing out Lipovitan Junior, a caffeine-free version for children.

In Thailand, Krating Daeng has suffered a similar fate. Its producer has tried to freshen up that brand by proclaiming that the Vitamin B12 in it “helps the functions of the nervous system and brain.”

Last year, the Foundation for Consumers in Thailand, an advocacy group, started a publicity campaign against energy drinks like Krating Daeng, arguing that producers were promoting unfounded health claims to push caffeine.

“This product just needed a way to add value to extend its life cycle,” said Patchara Klaewkla, an official at the foundation. “This product has been in the market for a long time.”"

USA TODAY

Gov. Pat Quinn signed the law%2C which is effective Jan. 1

A four-year pilot program will create 60 state-run dispensaries

22 %27cultivation centers%27 where plants are grown will be under strict surveillance

Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn signed one of the strictest medical marijuana laws in the nation Thursday, making the state the 20th to legalize the substance.

The measure takes effect Jan. 1 and establishes a four-year pilot program for 60 state-run dispensaries and 22 ""cultivation centers,"" under 24-hour surveillance, where marijuana plants will be grown, the Chicago Tribune reported.

Under the law, doctors will be able to prescribe marijuana for more than 30 specific medical illnesses such as cancer, AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, Crohn's disease and multiple sclerosis, according to CBS Chicago.

''It's very important we do whatever we can to ease their pain,'' Quinn said at a new medical facility at the University of Chicago. ''It's a very well-drafted bill.''

Doctors can't prescribe more than 2.5 ounces over two weeks, the Tribune said. The patient and the doctor must also have an established and ongoing medical relationship.

Illinois' policies are some of the country's strictest, said Chris Lindsey, the legislative analyst for the Marijuana Policy Project, an organization devoted to marijuana policy reform in the U.S. Unlike many other states where medical marijuana is legalized, Illinois won't allow users to grow marijuana in their homes.

And, Lindsey said, medical marijuana patients will be both fingerprinted and required to go through a background check. In most states, he said, only growers or providers have to get fingerprinted. There will also be a cap on the number of dispensaries.

Last week, New Hampshire became the 19th state to legalize medical marijuana when Gov. Maggie Hassan signed a bill into law. The District of Columbia also allows medical marijuana, and only two states, Colorado and Washington, have legalized marijuana for recreational use, according to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.

He Left In']",Use of tough federal sentencing laws varies widely nationwide,"WASHINGTON — As drug dealers go, Lori Ann Newhouse was strictly small time.

A high school dropout from a little Iowa town, Newhouse had three sons, a low-paying job as a telemarketer and a relentless methamphetamine habit. On St. Patrick’s Day in 2011, Newhouse bought cold tablets used to make meth and traded them to a lab for a gram of the highly addictive drug.

Federal agents, it turned out, were watching.

Newhouse’s bust landed her in the federal system in northern Iowa, where drug sentences have been among the harshest in the nation. Prosecutors decided that a past conviction — she had been caught in a motel room with drugs and a dealer boyfriend — qualified her for a doubled mandatory minimum sentence, from five to 10 years.

Advertisement

U.S. District Judge Mark W. Bennett, a fierce critic of mandatory sentencing laws, thought that made no sense. “Newhouse is not Iowa’s Pablo Escobar,” he wrote in an opinion, referring to the infamous Colombian drug lord.

In an interview from prison in Mitchellville, Iowa, Newhouse said, “I was absolutely a nobody in that case.”

Under mandatory sentencing laws, it has become a not-so-hidden fact of life in federal courthouses that prosecutors — not judges — effectively decide how long many drug criminals will spend behind bars. The result has been federal prisons packed with drug offenders.

But Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. is now trying to steer the Justice Department away from the get-tough policies that have led to lengthy sentences for what one judge called the “low-hanging fruit” in the drug war — dime-a-dozen addicts and street dealers.

Prosecutors have considerable discretion under the laws. If they cite the amount of drugs seized in the charging document, that can trigger the mandatory minimum; if they leave it out, it doesn’t. For offenders with prior drug convictions, prosecutors can file a so-called 851 motion, named after a section in the federal code that automatically doubles a sentence — or makes it mandatory life.

Although the mandatory laws were supposed to lead to uniformity, statistics show huge variations across the country in how often prosecutors use them. Holder has instructed prosecutors to avoid using these powerful weapons against lower-level, nonviolent offenders, but, even so, they retain the authority to decide which small players get a break and which get slammed.

“It sounds really good, but it depends on how it’s carried out in the field,” Bennett said in an interview.

In the two months since Holder issued his new policy, some U.S. attorneys, including the two in Iowa, have begun to pull back, according to judges and attorneys.

“We had some terribly harsh sentences,” said Randy Murrell, federal public defender in the northern district of Florida. “It’s gone on for years, and no one had the courage and gumption to change it. I do think they are changing the policy now.”

But elsewhere, change has been slower in coming.

“We are hopeful that this will loosen up some of the policies, but we have certainly not seen it yet,” said Jonathan Hawley, the federal public defender in central Illinois, another district with a history of tough prosecutions.

The mandatory minimum drug law passed Congress in 1986, following the overdose death of University of Maryland basketball star Len Bias. The idea was to target drug kingpins and serious career drug traffickers.

“Drug kingpins — I haven’t seen one yet,” said senior District Judge Robert W. Pratt of Des Moines. Typically, he said, he handles meth users who turn to dealing in order to supply themselves.

Congress is now reconsidering the wisdom of that approach.

“There are instances where people who had a second or third strike got life in prison for a nonviolent crime,” said Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who is sponsoring a bill with Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, to allow federal judges to disregard mandatory sentences.

Prosecutors have been particularly aggressive in Iowa.

A study by the U.S. Sentencing Commission found that more than 47% of all drug defendants in Iowa’s southern federal court district ended up with mandatory minimum sentences in 2010 — the third-highest rate in the country. In the northern district, it was more than 40%, the sixth-highest rate. There’s even greater inconsistency in the use of 851 motions. In Iowa, they landed on about 80% of eligible offenders, according to sentencing commission data. In bordering Nebraska, the figure was 3%.

In a recent opinion, Bennett criticized the Justice Department for the “jaw-dropping, shocking disparity” in how prosecutors wielded the motions. He called the process “both whimsical and arbitrary, like a Wheel of Misfortune.”

Some say prosecutors will be reluctant to give up a powerful tool to break open cases — the ability to threaten recalcitrant witnesses with a long federal sentence if they don’t play ball.

“It is the underlying culture that you measure yourself with the lengths of sentences that you receive,” Brett Tolman, a former U.S. attorney in Utah, said at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.

One federal judge in Brooklyn, N.Y., said Holder’s policy didn’t go far enough to rein in prosecutors who routinely wielded 851 sentence enhancements as a “2-by-4 to the forehead” to force defendants to accept plea deals. If the Justice Department “cannot exercise its power … less destructively and less brutally, it doesn’t deserve to have the power at all,” wrote District Judge John Gleeson, a former prosecutor, in a sentencing opinion last month.

A Justice Department official said the agency would monitor drug cases across the country but was confident that prosecutors “understand that these new guidelines are aimed at ensuring federal laws are enforced more fairly, and federal resources are used more efficiently.”

The new policy has already led to some changes in Iowa.

In the southern district, the top prosecutor is Nicholas A. Klinefeldt, a former defense attorney with an unusual family history. His father is a convicted meth dealer who spent 10 years in federal prison, on a mandatory sentence doubled by an 851 motion. Klinefeldt said his office now declined smaller meth lab cases, avoided triggering mandatory minimums and rarely filed for 851 enhancements.

Advertisement

U.S. Atty. Sean Berry in the northern district had continued to seek tough sentences until Holder issued his memo, but said his office recently withdrew requests for double sentences for two drug offenders.

The shift comes too late for Newhouse, who received an 851 enhancement based on a state bust nine years earlier, when she was found with meth and psychedelic mushrooms.

Newhouse, 34, could have ended up with even more time. An addict since she was 15 with a string of drug-dealing boyfriends, she had other drug arrests. Prosecutors first classified her as a career offender; guidelines called for a 22-year sentence. But they decided that would be unfair and asked for 10 years, minus two years for cooperation.

“I was going to get years, regardless,” Newhouse said. “They took all that time I had to be away from my kids, and doubled it.”

The California Supreme Court ruled Monday that cities can ban stores that sell marijuana

The state%27s voter-approved medical marijuana law doesn%27t prevent towns from using zoning to keep pot shops out

The ruling is in response to a 2010 ban in Riverside%2C Calif.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - California cities and counties can ban pot shops, the state's highest court ruled Monday in a unanimous opinion likely to further diminish California's once-robust medical marijuana industry.

The California Supreme Court said neither the state's voter-approved law legalizing medical marijuana nor a companion measure adopted by the Legislature prevent local governments from using their land use and zoning powers to prohibit storefront dispensaries.

The ruling came in a legal challenge to a ban enacted by the city of Riverside in 2010.

""While some counties and cities might consider themselves well-suited to accommodating medical marijuana dispensaries, conditions in other communities might lead to the reasonable decision that such facilities within their borders, even if carefully sited, well managed, and closely monitored, would present unacceptable local risks and burdens,"" Justice Marvin Baxter wrote for the seven-member court.

The advocacy group Americans for Safe Access estimates another 200 jurisdictions statewide have similar prohibitions on retail pot sales. Many were enacted after the number of retail medical marijuana outlets boomed in Southern California after a 2009 memo from the U.S. Justice Department said prosecuting pot sales would be a low priority.

However, the rush to outlaw pot shops has slowed in the 21 months since the four federal prosecutors in California launched a coordinated crackdown on dispensaries by threatening to seize the property of landlords who lease space to the shops. Hundreds of dispensary operators have since been evicted or closed voluntarily.

Marijuana advocates have argued that allowing local governments to bar dispensaries thwarts the intent of the state's medical marijuana law - the nation's first - to make the drug accessible to residents with doctor's recommendations to use it.

Riverside city lawmakers used their zoning authority to declare storefront pot shops as public nuisances and ban the operations in 2010. The Inland Empire Patient's Health and Wellness Center, part of the explosion of retail medical marijuana outlets, sued to stop the city from shutting it down.

A number of counties and cities were awaiting the Supreme Court ruling before moving forward with bans of their own.

A mid-level appeals court previously sided with the city of Riverside, but other courts have come to opposite conclusions. Last summer, a trial judge ruled that Riverside County could not close medical marijuana dispensaries in unincorporated areas because the move did not give the shops any room to operate legally under state law.

Meanwhile, an appeals court in Southern California struck down Los Angeles County's 2-year-old ban on dispensaries, ruling state law allows cooperatives and collectives to grow, store and distribute pot.

The Supreme Court's decision might not be the last word on the issue, however. Pending legislation would establish a new statewide system for regulating and licensing the medical marijuana industry and clarify the role of dispensaries in it.

Activists also are in the early stages of planning a ballot initiative that would legalize the recreational use of marijuana and regulate it like alcohol, as voters in Washington and Colorado did last year."

Attorney General Eric Holder deplored aspects of the criminal-justice system Monday.

In a speech delivered Monday to the American Bar Association meeting at its annual convention in San Francisco, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder called for a major change in the nation's criminal justice system that includes a bit of what prison and drug-war critics have been seeking for decades.

Holder noted that with the drug war entering its fifth decade, ""we need to ask whether it, and the approaches that comprise it, have been truly effective—and build on the Administration’s efforts, led by the Office of National Drug Control Policy, to usher in a new approach."" In truth, the asking has been done. And the answer is clear. The approaches have been stunningly effective if societal destruction is what one has in mind. For all the good ideas in Holder's speech, however, it was what was missing that ought to get some attention.

For instance, nowhere in Holder's speech, which included data about the damage caused to society by the war on drugs, did he directly mention the impact of law enforcement actions related to marijuana. Despite the evidence of marijuana's medicinal benefits and its generally benign effects (particularly when compared with tobacco and alcohol), the administration apparently plans, even with the reforms that Holder announced, to continue spending gargantuan annual sums to prosecute marijuana cases. This encourages state and local jurisdictions to do the same, a policy—an idiotic, counterproductive, destructive and expensive policy—that many supporters of President Obama expected to be changed years ago.

Holder made clear that changes he is proposing will not have an immediate impact and that this is ""only the beginning"":

As a nation, we are coldly efficient in our incarceration efforts. While the entire U.S. population has increased by about a third since 1980, the federal prison population has grown at an astonishing rate—by almost 800 percent. It’s still growing—despite the fact that federal prisons are operating at nearly 40 percent above capacity. Even though this country comprises just 5 percent of the world’s population, we incarcerate almost a quarter of the world’s prisoners. More than 219,000 federal inmates are currently behind bars. Almost half of them are serving time for drug-related crimes, and many have substance use disorders. Nine to 10 million more people cycle through America’s local jails each year. And roughly 40 percent of former federal prisoners—and more than 60 percent of former state prisoners—are rearrested or have their supervision revoked within three years after their release, at great cost to American taxpayers and often for technical or minor violations of the terms of their release. As a society, we pay much too high a price whenever our system fails to deliver outcomes that deter and punish crime, keep us safe, and ensure that those who have paid their debts have the chance to become productive citizens. Right now, unwarranted disparities are far too common. As President Obama said last month, it’s time to ask tough questions about how we can strengthen our communities, support young people, and address the fact that young black and Latino men are disproportionately likely to become involved in our criminal justice system—as victims as well as perpetrators. We also must confront the reality that—once they’re in that system—people of color often face harsher punishments than their peers. One deeply troubling report, released in February, indicates that—in recent years—black male offenders have received sentences nearly 20 percent longer than those imposed on white males convicted of similar crimes. This isn’t just unacceptable—it is shameful. It’s unworthy of our great country, and our great legal tradition. And in response, I have today directed a group of U.S. Attorneys to examine sentencing disparities, and to develop recommendations on how we can address them.

New policies that walk all that back about 50 paces would be welcome indeed. And there is no gainsaying the fact that doing so will not be easy.

Among the proposed changes:

• Altering the DoJ's charging policies of low-level, nonviolent drug offenders who are part of gangs or cartels so that they do not face ""draconian mandatory minimum sentences."" Sentences will be determined by individual conduct.

• Supporting bipartisan legislation introduced by Sen. Pat Leahy, Dick Durbin, Patrick Leahy, Mike Lee and Rand Paul that would end the imposition of mandatory minimums on some drug offenders.

• Increasing support for crime victims.

• Setting up a new task force to ""respond to the extreme levels of violence faced by far too many American Indian and Alaska Native children.""

Sign our petition urging Congress to abolish mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders. There has never been a better time to take action on this."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/athletics/24949120,,[],US Anti-Doping Agency offers to mentor Jamaica's anti-doping team,"Last updated on .From the section Athletics

The United States' Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) has offered to help Jamaica's anti-doping team because they feel the island's athletes have been ""let down"".

Usada's chief executive Travis Tygart said talks had already begun over a possible partnership with Jamaica.

""Jamaican athletes deserve a robust anti-doping programme,"" said Tygart.

Six Jamaican athletes have tested positive this year and the country has already been accused of ""losing its way"" on drug testing for athletes.

Drug testing in Jamaica After the World Anti-Doping Agency visit, Jamaican sport minister Natalie Neita Headley vowed to increase the current annual testing budget of around £380,000

Extra money will be used to hire more senior executives to run the anti-doping programme and to hire and train additional testers

Number of tests conducted by Jadco will be raised from 300 this year to 400 in 2014

John Fahey, president of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), earlier this week said his organisation had been aware of difficulties in Jamaica for some time, revealing one of the solutions was for the country's anti-doping team to be mentored by a more successful agency.

Paul Wright, Jamaica's most senior drug tester, also warned that the recent rash of failed tests might be the ""tip of an iceberg"".

Former Jadco (Jamaica's anti-doping commission) executive director Renee Anne Shirley raised concerns when she said the agency had conducted only one out-of-competition test in the six months leading up to the 2012 Olympic Games in London.

Her comments followed a series of positive tests for Jamaican athletes and resulted in Wada visiting the country at the end of October to assess its doping policies.

Former 100m world record holder Asafa Powell, three-time Olympic gold medallist Veronica Campbell-Brown and Olympic relay gold medallist Sherone Simpson are among six Jamaicans who have tested positive this year.

""Right now, the athletes in Jamaica are being let down by their organisation,"" said Tygart.

""Having one test out of competition prior to the London Olympic Games, if what is being reported is accurate, is unacceptable. No blood test, no human growth hormone test - that's an injustice to the fairness of the sport and tremendously letting down those athletes.

""A firm, committed play to moving forward is what we're all after.

""There have been discussions. We've talked to Wada, we've met with the Jamaican officials.

""We'll sort through whether there's a role for us to play. We're happy to help some other programmes that need some assistance."""

(CNN) —

Three people in Colorado may have died after smoking synthetic marijuana, state health officials fear. The Colorado Department of Public Health has launched an investigation into an outbreak of illnesses at hospitals that may be tied to the dangerous substance.

“Initial reports show approximately 75 people who reported smoking a form of synthetic marijuana may have been seen at hospitals in the Denver metro area and Colorado Springs beginning in late August,” said Dr. Tista Ghosh, interim chief medical officer for the state, in a written statement. “Several individuals were in intensive care and three deaths are being investigated as possibly associated.”

The Colorado Department of Health, with help from local health officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will attempt to figure out if the synthetic marijuana is to blame, and if so, whether all the patients were sickened by the same product or different ones.

But “don’t wait for the results of this investigation,” Ghosh urged. “If you have synthetic marijuana, stop using it and destroy it.”

Teen narrowly escapes death after smoking synthetic marijuana

Known as K2, Spice, Black Mamba, Mr. Smiley and Blaze, among other things, synthetic marijuana can have more serious consequences than regular marijuana, which is legal in Colorado. These synthetic cannabinoids are a blend of plant and herbal materials that have been sprayed with chemicals, producing an extra toxicity, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

Sold most often on the Internet, synthetic marijuana produces euphoric and psychoactive effects similar to those associated with marijuana. But doctors say there are additional side effects that may be particularly dangerous. The drug can leave patients catatonic and listless. And what makes matters worse, very little is known about synthetic marijuana or how to treat an adverse reaction or overdose.

According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, the number of calls to poison centers related to synthetic drugs soared from about 3,200 in 2010 to more than 13,000 in 2011.

“Easy access and the misperception that Spice products are ‘natural’ and therefore harmless have likely contributed to their popularity,” the NIDA website states. “Another selling point is that the chemicals used in Spice are not easily detected in standard drug tests.”

Because the chemicals used in these products have a high potential for abuse and no medical benefit, the DEA has designated five of the most common active chemicals frequently found in synthetic marijuana as Schedule I controlled substances, making it illegal to sell, buy, or possess them. But manufacturers seem to be changing the chemical compounds as fast as lawmakers enact legislation to ban them.

The CDC was sending a team of four to assist the investigation.

The store owners began lining up outside the Mile High City’s Department of Excise and Licenses before the doors opened at 8 a.m., Amber Miller, a city spokeswoman, said in an email to the Los Angeles Times.

Denver is among the 26 Colorado municipalities and counties that will allow medical marijuana businesses to begin transitioning into retail marijuana businesses on Jan. 1.

Amendment 64, which voters approved last year, legalized recreational pot use in the state for people over 21. However, retail sales of the drug are not permitted until the new year.

Miller said 315 applications, for marijuana stores, growing facilities, infused product manufacturing sites and test labs have been submitted to the city so far. Of these, 122 are for stores only, she said.

[Updated, 5:04 p.m. PST Dec. 27: As of 4:30 p.m. PST, 34 store applicants had “completed the state and city licensing processes and picked up their licenses today,” she said.]

“Those 10 stores are now fully licensed and able to open on Jan. 1 if they choose to do so,” she said. “We also have 12 grows now fully licensed and two infused product manufacturers. That is a total of 24 retail marijuana businesses that have their city and state licenses.”

The Colorado Department of Revenue’s Marijuana Enforcement Division has approved 348 retail marijuana licenses to prospective retail marijuana establishments, according to a release issued on its site on Monday.

Of the total licenses in the state, 136 were given to marijuana stores, 178 to marijuana cultivation facilities, 31 to product manufacturing facilities and three to marijuana testing facilities.

The Department of Revenue’s Marijuana Enforcement Division opened up its application process on Oct. 1, about one year after Colorado voters legalized recreational marijuana and just one month before voters resoundingly supported taxing it.

In order to be issued a license, businesses must submit required documentation, pay licensing fees and undergo background and financial checks.

They must also receive permission from local jurisdictions, which have the right to choose whether to allow retail marijuana business within their county or city limits, the release stated.

Miller said the state had administered 102 licenses to Denver store applicants thus far.

Justin Jones, owner of Dank Colorado, a medical marijuana dispensary in Denver, was one of the people waiting for his license Friday morning.

“The process went smoothly,” Jones, 39, told The Times. “It’s been very similar to what we’ve gone through in the past with getting medical marijuana licensing.”

Jones said he believed store sales would definitely increase as the market expands.

“It really is blue skies,” he said.

Marijuana sales will help Colorado’s economy, he said, noting tourism will draw in more customers and tax revenue.

Other stores are also eager for Wednesday.

Dixie Elixirs, another Denver store, has been updating its Facebook page with a 100-day “cannabis countdown.”

Mason Tvert, a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, said the impending legal sale of marijuana was significant for Denver, the state of Colorado and the United States as a whole.

“For the first time in history, adults will be purchasing marijuana from legitimate businesses instead of in the underground market,” he told The Times.

“It’s going to generate tens of millions of dollars in revenue for the state and allow law enforcement officials to spend their time focusing on other more serious crimes.”

As far as backlash, Tvert said, “I don’t think the sky is going to fall. Life will go on as usual, except those who buy marijuana will be able to do so safely.”

Tvert said he thinks other states, such as Alaska and Oregon, will be next in following similar legislation.

Colorado and Washington are currently the only states that have adopted laws permitting the sale of marijuana for recreational use.

After the Boston attacks%2C security was tight

Up to 80%2C000 people were expected to attend

Despite legalization%2C public consumption is still banned

DENVER (AP) — Authorities are hunting for suspects after shooting broke out during a massive marijuana celebration in Denver, leaving two people with gunshot wounds.

The gunfire scattered thousands attending Saturday's 4/20 counterculture holiday, the first since Colorado legalized marijuana.

A man and a woman each suffered non-life threatening gunshot wounds, officials said. Local media reports said a third person was grazed.

Denver Police spokesman Sonny Jackson said investigators are looking for one or two suspects, asking festival attendees for possible photo or video of the shootings.

He said police had no motive for the gunfire.

Witnesses described a scene in which a jovial atmosphere quickly turned to one of panic at the downtown Civic Center Park just before 5 p.m. Several thought firecrackers were being set off, then a man fell bleeding, his dog also shot.

""I saw him fall, grabbing his leg,"" said Travis Craig, 28, who was at the celebration, saw the shooting and said he used a belt to apply a tourniquet to the man's leg.

""He was just screaming that he was in pain, and wanted to know where his girlfriend was. She was OK. And then the cops showed up real quick, like, less than a minute. They put him on ambulance and left.""

The annual pot celebration this year was expected to draw as many as 80,000 people after recent laws in Colorado and Washington made marijuana legal for recreational use.

A sizable police force on motorcycles and horses had been watching the celebration since its start earlier Saturday. But authorities, who generally look the other way at public pot smoking here on April 20, didn't arrest people for smoking in public, which is still illegal.

Police said earlier in the week that they were focused on crowd security in light of attacks that killed three at the finish line of the Boston Marathon.

""We're aware of the events in Boston,"" said Denver police spokesman Aaron Kafer, who declined to give specifics about security measures being taken. ""Our message to the public is that, if you see something, say something.""

Stephanie Riedel, who traveled to the pot celebration from Pittsburgh, said she was dancing with a hula hoop when she heard pops. A man ran past her, then she said the crowd started screaming and running away. She was about 20 feet from the shooting and heard four or five shots.

""I couldn't make sense of what it was at first,"" she said. ""We were all having a good time and I was in the mindframe of, we're here at a peace gathering. I thought it some guys playing.""

Rapper Lil' Flip was performing when the shootings occurred.

Aerial footage showed the massive crowd frantically running from the park.

Ian Bay, who was skateboarding through Civic Center Park when shots erupted, said he was listening to music on his headphones when he looked to his right and saw a swarm of hundreds of people running at him.

""I sort of panicked. I thought I was going through an anxiety thing because so many people were coming after me,"" he said.

Before the shooting, reggae music filled the air, and so did the smell of marijuana, as celebrants gathered by mid-morning in the park just beside the state Capitol.

Group smoke-outs were planned Saturday from New York to San Francisco. The origins of the number ""420"" as a code for pot are murky, but the drug's users have for decades marked the date 4/20 as a day to use pot together.

Colorado and Washington are still waiting for a federal response to the votes and are working on setting up commercial pot sales, which are still limited to people with certain medical conditions. In the meantime, pot users are free to share and use the drug in small amounts.

A citizen advocacy group that opposes marijuana proliferation, Smart Colorado, warned in a statement that public 4/20 celebrations ""send a clear message to the rest of the nation and the world about what Colorado looks like.""

""Does the behavior of the participants in these events reflect well on our state?"" asked the head of Smart Colorado, Henny Lasley.

A smaller Sunday event scheduled at the park was canceled.

Saturday's attack recalled a similar shooting that left a police officer dead at a crowded jazz concert in Denver's City Park last summer.

The 22-year-old suspect in that case pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and faces at least 16 years in prison when he is sentenced at a hearing scheduled for June 21.

His attorneys said he was being pursued by gang members when he drew his weapon and fired.

Infographic by Jan Diehm for The Huffington Post.

People taking advantage of the state-legal marijuana sales that begin Jan. 1 in Colorado should be aware of another new law there -- a measure passed last spring that creates a ""permissive inference"" of intoxication when a driver tests above five nanograms of THC per milliliter of blood.

Among states' legal limits for marijuana in the bloodstream while driving, Colorado's is relatively lenient. More than a dozen states have ""per se"" cannabis driving laws that hand a DUI conviction, without a trial, to anyone exceeding the state's THC blood limit. Most of those limits are set at zero. Most states have effect-based laws that require evidence of impairment due to recent ingestion of a controlled substance for a DUI conviction. Get the specifics on your state's drugged driving laws here.

There is no evidence that per se laws reduce traffic fatalities, according to a recent study by D. Mark Anderson of Montana State University and Daniel Rees of the University of Colorado. They may also ""inadvertently become a criminal mechanism for law enforcement and prosecutors to punish those who have engaged in legally protected behavior and who have not posed any actionable traffic safety threat,"" Paul Armentano of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws said in a peer-reviewed report examining the limitations of per se cannabis driving laws.

In Washington state, where recreational marijuana use is legal and a per se driving law has been passed, a growing number of drivers are testing positive for marijuana. According to the Associated Press, a State Patrol spokesman said the increase might be because ""we're testing blood we didn't test before.""

The White House has recommended that all states pass zero-tolerance per se drugged driving laws."

Based on reviews of court records and interviews with law enforcement officials, the Associated Press claims that Mexican drug cartel “groups have begun deploying agents from their inner circles to the U.S.”

“Cartel operatives are suspected of running drug-distribution networks in at least nine non-border states, often in middle-class suburbs in the Midwest, South and Northeast,” the report claimed.

Jack Riley, the law enforcement official in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Chicago office described the infiltration as “probably the most serious threat the United States has faced from organized crime.” Riley added, “People think, ‘The border’s 1,700 miles away. This isn’t our problem.’ Well, it is. These days, we operate as if Chicago is on the border.”

Riley believes that the increased presence of Mexican drug cartel operatives has lead to an increase in violent crime in Chicago. “They are the puppeteers. Maybe the shooter didn’t know and maybe the victim didn’t know that. But if you follow it down the line, the cartels are ultimately responsible.”

In February, Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane said that Mexican drug cartels “are taking over our neighborhoods.” In Louisville, Metropolitan Police Department Lieutenant Richard Pearson noted, “This is the first time we’ve been seeing it — cartels who have their operatives actually sent here.”

Monday’s Associated Press report comes on the heels of a story reported by Breitbart News on Sunday that examined possible connections between the Saturday murders of Kaufman Texas County District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia and an alleged alliance between the Aryan Brotherhood and Mexican drug cartels."

I fully agree.

And yet the editorial is based on the myth that the DEA has made it “nearly impossible” for researchers to obtain marijuana for such scientific studies. To the contrary, not a single scientifically valid study by a qualified researcher has ever been denied by the DEA or, for that matter, by the National Institute of Drug Abuse. And there is ample government-grown marijuana, specifically for research, available at the marijuana farm run by the University of Mississippi. More surprising, as your editorial points out, is that there is still no scientifically valid study that proves that marijuana is effective, much less safe, as a medicine.

Advertisement

As the DEA administrator 20 years ago, I denied the reclassification of marijuana from a Schedule I controlled drug because there were no valid scientific studies showing that smoking marijuana was an effective medicine. In my decision, published in the Federal Register, I interpreted federal law and set forth a five-part test that included whether there were valid scientific studies demonstrating that marijuana was safe and effective for treating any medical condition. I noted that at that time there were none of the kind of controlled, double-blind studies that the Food and Drug Administration would require before approving a new drug application, and I clearly spelled out that this would be necessary before marijuana would be reclassified to a lower schedule that would permit its use as a physician-prescribed medicine.

Essentially, I invited those who advocate marijuana use as a medicine to conduct research and then present it to the DEA. I laid out a road map for what they needed to do. If scientifically valid studies demonstrated that marijuana was “effective” and “safe,” as the FDA defines those terms, the agency would reclassify marijuana into one of the other schedules. It is amazing that 20 years later there is still no such scientific study establishing that marijuana is effective as a medicine. And yet in the interim, the well-funded marijuana lobby, including the National Assn. for the Reform of Marijuana Laws and others, have spent tens of millions of dollars on convincing voters to pass medical marijuana initiatives based on anecdotes but not science.

The reason the FDA and the DEA have scientific standards is because snake-oil salesmen are able to sell just about anything to sick people without any scientific proof that it has a truly helpful therapeutic effect. If proponents of medical marijuana had invested even a small fragment of their money in scientifically valid studies, we would know one way or the other whether it works.

One can only conclude the marijuana proponents did not go this route because doing so would have shown that cannabis is not an effective and safe medicine. Alternatively, we are left to conclude that their agenda was not about marijuana to help sick people, but rather was getting voters to pass medical marijuana initiatives as a wedge to legalize the drug for “recreational” use.

Dana Rohrabacher has formed an unusual alliance with liberals on an unexpected topic — the defense of marijuana.

Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) and his allies have so far waged a futile effort to pass legislation that would prevent federal authorities from interfering with medical marijuana use in California and other places where pot use is permitted by state law.

Advertisement

But as more states have moved to allow the drug’s use, Rohrabacher believes his Respect State Marijuana Laws Act may be gaining momentum in Congress.

The recently reintroduced measure would shield from federal prosecution people acting in accordance with their states’ marijuana laws, including new Colorado and Washington laws that allow adult recreational use of the drug.

“The prospects are much better now,” said Rohrabacher, whose co-sponsors include Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Oakland), a Bay Area liberal who is usually about as far apart ideologically from Rohrabacher as anybody in Congress.

Still, Rohrabacher has his work cut out for him. The House last year soundly rejected, by a 262-163 vote, an effort he led to block the use of federal funds to prevent states from implementing medical marijuana laws. Only 28 Republicans supported the measure.

Advertisement

Rohrabacher has a libertarian bent but became more interested in the medical benefits of marijuana after having to spoon-feed his dying mother because of her loss of appetite. He has talked about the relief that marijuana might have afforded her.

He has been emboldened by a recent Pew Research Center poll that showed respondents, by nearly 2 to 1, believe the federal government should not enforce federal laws prohibiting the use of marijuana in states where it is legal.

Advertisement

Perhaps as important as the shifting public opinion, he said in an interview, is his colleagues’ eagerness to erase Washington’s red ink. Substantial majorities of Republicans and Democrats in the Pew survey regarded federal enforcement of anti-marijuana laws as not worth the cost.

“If people of the states recognize what a waste of limited resources this is, then the federal government should respect what the people of those states want for their own criminal justice system,” Rohrabacher said.

Advertisement

Since 1996, when California became the first state to legalize the drug’s use for medical treatment, 17 other states and the District of Columbia have approved medical marijuana measures. Last year, Colorado and Washington state voters opted to allow recreational users to possess an ounce of marijuana. A move is underway to put a measure on the Alaska ballot to permit recreational use of the drug.

Efforts are underway in other states, including Idaho, Illinois and New Hampshire, to allow medicinal use of marijuana.

Advertisement

Rohrabacher also is hoping to convince GOP colleagues that his bill fits with the party’s traditional support for states’ rights.

“It is time that we respect states’ rights, get serious about prioritizing our federal government’s activities, and show some common sense and compassion when dealing with the sick among us,” Rohrabacher said last year when he proposed his measure.

Advertisement

However, Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.), chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that oversees Justice Department spending, responded at the time: “If a state said sex trafficking is OK, would we honor that?... States, in the past, have done some things that have not been good in this country.”

The president’s drug czar, R. Gil Kerlikowske, recently said at the National Press Club that the Justice Department was responsible for enforcing the Controlled Substances Act, and “that remains unchanged. No state, no executive, can nullify a statute that’s been passed by Congress.”

Advertisement

Kevin Sabet, a former advisor to Kerlikowske, said Rohrabacher’s latest attempt would “likely suffer the same fate as his several previous failed attempts have over the past decade.”

Steve Fox, national political director for the Marijuana Policy Project, which promotes legalization, regards the bill as a long shot in this congressional session. But he said the legislation “sends the message that it is simply not a rational use of federal law enforcement resources to prosecute and imprison individuals who are acting in compliance with state marijuana laws.”

Last week, state prison officials refused a request from the compounding pharmacy that created and sold Texas the pentobarbital -- a single-dose drug used in executions -- to return the drug.

Jasper Lovoi, owner of The Woodlands Compounding Pharmacy, claims Texas authorities put him “in the middle of a firestorm” of protesters, hate calls and press requests after letting it leak that he sold eight 2.5-gram doses of pentobarbital to the state for upcoming executions.

Lovoi says he had been promised anonymity by the state.

But Jason Clark, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, said the department bought the drug vials legally and won’t return them.

Clark said the state has enough vials to carry out scheduled executions for the remainder of the year.

Death penalty states like Texas, which has executed 505 people since 1981, have been turning to compounding pharmacies to purchase lethal doses of barbiturates used in executions.

The switch comes after the drugs’ primary makers shut off supplies to states following pressure from anti-death penalty advocates.

Compounding pharmacies allow certified specialists to mix ingredients for medicine themselves and sell them. For example, if there is only an adult-dose of a particular drug available, compounding pharmacists can manipulate the active ingredients and change the dosage or strength.

However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not vouch for the validity, safety or effectiveness of drugs made in compounding pharmacies.

Earlier this year, these new go-to drug dens came under scrutiny following a deadly meningitis outbreak that was linked to contaminated injections made at a Massachusetts compounding pharmacy.

In Texas, attorneys for Michael Yowell, 43, had hoped to get a last-minute stay for their client. But minutes before he was taken to the death chamber, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit he and two other condemned prisoners had brought seeking execution delays on grounds the pentobarbital could cause unconstitutional pain and suffering.

He was pronounced dead at 7:11pm CDT (8:11 ET) in Huntsville, Texas.

Yowell was convicted of killing his parents, Johnny and Carol Yowell, in 1998 and setting fire to their home in Lubbock, Texas. According to court records, Yowell told authorities he shot his father and then beat, strangled and killed his mother. He then blew up the house.

Yowell’s grandmother, who lived with them, was killed though Yowell was not convicted in her death.

Last month, the House passed legislation aimed at regulating compounding pharmacies. The bill, which is now in the Senate, would create a national set of standards to track the distribution chain of pharmaceuticals. Proponents say the bill closes a pretty wide gap between state and federal oversight of compounding pharmacies. In the Massachusetts meningitis outbreak, 64 people died and more than 700 people got sick across 20 states from a bad batch of steroids produced at the New England Compounding Center.

Other states like South Dakota and Georgia have had similar problems with purchasing drugs directly through manufacturers.

Georgia's first use of an execution drug obtained through a compounding pharmacy was put on hold in July after the condemned inmate challenged a new state law that bars the release of information about where Georgia obtains its execution drug.

Separately, on Tuesday, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a motion made by Yowell’s attorneys who asked to supervise “every step of the execution process.”

http://news.yahoo.com/defiant-cruz-rails-against-u-fiscal-deal-wont-181038979--sector.html,,[],"Defiant Cruz rails against U.S. fiscal deal, but won't delay it","By David Lawder and Amanda Becker WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A defiant Senator Ted Cruz railed against a bipartisan U.S. Senate deal to lift the federal debt limit and reopen the government on Wednesday, but said he would not try to block or delay its passage. Cruz, a conservative Texas Republican, said he would vote against the measure because it provides no relief to Americans from what he calls the harmful effects of ""Obamacare"" health insurance reforms. However, he said that at this point there was nothing to gain from taking procedural measures to delay it. Cruz has waged a weeks-long campaign to persuade Republicans to use the threat of a government shutdown and failure to lift the federal debt limit as leverage to defund, delay, or otherwise undermine President Barack Obama's signature health care law. ""The timing of the vote will make no difference in the outcome, and so I don't intend to delay the timing of the vote. I intend to vote no,"" Cruz told reporters. ""It will be a bad deal for the American people today, tomorrow or the next day."" Under Senate rules, any senator can object to pending legislation, a move that would require a 60-vote majority to proceed to a yes or no vote. The process requires several days to complete, and with the U.S. Treasury set to exhaust its borrowing capacity on Thursday, time for passage is running short. In a campaign-style speech before cameras as the Senate deal was announced, Cruz said the bipartisan plan reflected ""the ""traditional approach of the Washington establishment of maintaining the status quo and doing nothing to respond to the suffering that Obamacare is causing to millions of Americans."" Although the health reform is aimed at providing affordable care to tens of millions of uninsured Americans, Cruz and other Republicans blame it for causing premiums to rise in some areas and for prompting companies to reduce hiring or to shift employees from full-time work to part-time work. In the end, the only Obamacare concession in Wednesday's Senate-negotiated deal was the inclusion of a provision requiring that those applying for insurance subsidies verify their income. Government-run health insurance exchanges started operating on October 1, and the deal does not alter a requirement that individuals obtain coverage starting on January 1 or pay a tax penalty. The deal still requires passage in both the Senate and House of Representatives. 'COURAGEOUS STAND' Lawmakers and aides from both parties on Capitol Hill have criticized Cruz for using his fight against Obamacare, which included a well-publicized 21-hour speech on the Senate floor, as a personal platform to seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. The Tea Party firebrand won election to the Senate only last November. Although Cruz has not announced his formal intention to run for president, some political analysts say the fame he has gained from his recent efforts has elevated him to a leading Republican contender, alongside House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, the party's 2012 vice presidential candidate, and fellow conservative Senator Rand Paul. Cruz defended his efforts to use the fiscal deadlines to try to thwart Obamacare, saying he was doing what Americans wanted. Despite the government shutdown, which has forced the temporary layoff of hundreds of thousands of government employees, and angst in financial markets as to whether the United States would default on its obligations, Cruz said the effort was worth it as it had caused ""millions upon millions of people rise up"" against Obamacare. He praised House Republicans, whose demands for Obamacare concessions - and their refusal by Democrats - forced much of the government to close on October 1. ""We saw the House of Representatives take courageous stand listening to the American people, that everyone in official Washington just weeks ago said would never happen. That was a remarkable victory to see the House engage in a profile in courage."" He blamed the failure to stop the health care law on Senate Republicans who had failed to unite in the fight over the fiscal deadlines. ""I would point out, that had Senate Republicans united, and supported House Republicans, the outcome of this I believe would've been very, very different,"" he said.

His erstwhile oratory was a melee of cringe-inducing lines ripped straight from a sit-in.

Contrary to the claims of both sides%2C Obama is not a liberal visionary.

Finally%2C he said the word %22deficit%2C%22 but don%27t hold your breath for anything there.

If the State of the Union address Tuesday night is any indication, it appears President Obama's chief speechwriter has been replaced by a cliché-generator circa 1960. His erstwhile oratory was a melee of cringe-inducing lines ripped straight from a sit-in.

The commander in chief waxed about children being important for our future and how we should be a country where ""if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead."" Which we are for the most part, anyway. Also, isn't there a rule about how many times you can use the same line in a speech? Doesn't basic etiquette and decency prevent us from ever hearing this again: ""A tax code that ensures billionaires with high-powered accountants can't pay a lower rate than their hard-working secretaries."" Yes, we know: Warren Buffett is your friend and his secretary pays a higher tax rate that he does. Is this really the only way to demonstrate the tax code needs to be reformed?

The president has only a few opportunities to speak to the nation, and he blew this one. It was so hackish, so devoid of any theme or purpose, that it makes one wonder whether part of Obama just wants to see how bad he can be before his cultists in the news media can see it. Every speech is exactly what they wish it to be, regardless of reality. His mainstream inaugural speech was treated as a liberal call to arms when it was no such thing. Of course, conservatives thought that. If Obama had announced he just joined the Tea Party, Rush Limbaugh would have seen it as proof that he was a socialist. But why liberals would confuse a boilerplate middle-of-the-road inaugural speech with Das Kapital will be forever befuddling.

Contrary to the claims of both sides, Obama is not a liberal visionary with deep desires to institute a progressive agenda. If he is, he's a miserable failure. You need look no further than his own record (starting with foreign policy) and then Tuesday night's speech for evidence. Banalities and tropes are not a governing philosophy or a plan. The immigration piece was good, but hardly a profile in courage. After all, even the GOP wants immigration reform now. There is also the small fact that Obama promised to deal with immigration in his first term.

The edict on climate change was despotic, not liberal. I believe climate change is a problem and humans contribute to it. However, 'either do what I say or I will just start issuing executive orders' that make green energy companies rich is not the kind of governing we should be lauding, regardless of party or ideological bent.

His plea on gun control was manipulative and empty. It worked thematically, but failed on substance. The only point was to make Republicans look bad, while simultaneously lecturing about compromise and the importance of working together.

Finally, he said the word ""deficit,"" but don't hold your breath for anything there. He spoke of it as if it had just magically appeared yesterday when, in fact, he has been ignoring it for four years while running it up. In that way, he's just like George W. Bush and the GOP-run Congress of yore.

That this underwhelming State of the Union – substantively and stylistically – will be treated as a serious effort reveals the bad shape our country is really in.

From Senior White House Correspondent Wolf Blitzer

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- On the third day of a new partial government shutdown, some federal workers were being sent home and President Clinton vetoed Republican-passed spending bills covering several cabinet-level agencies. Clinton objects to provisions in the measures that include aspects of the Republican legislative platform The measures would have provided funding for the Veterans Administration, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Interior Department and the Environmental Protection Agency.

A veto was expected later in the day on a bill covering the State, Justice and Commerce departments.

Meanwhile, White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta was meeting on Capitol Hill with Democrats in an effort to forge new seven-year budget proposals. Clinton said he planned to call House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole later Monday to discuss the budget impasse. At a breakfast fund-raiser in Richmond, Va., Gingrich blamed the partial shutdown on Clinton. ""The bills are on his desk,"" Gingrich said. ""The burden is on him.""

Lacking a budget agreement, White House Budget Director Alice Rivlin ordered more than 260,000 federal workers -- about 13 percent of government employees -- to suspend operations. Last month's shutdown affected 800,000 employees. Those being furloughed Monday still had to show up for work in the morning but were to be sent home immediately.

These federal employees say the shutdown hurts non-government workers, too.

""It's just stupidity,"" said government worker Maureen Allen.

""I can balance my budget in a week. They ought to be able to do it themselves,"" complained Fred Bustillos, a National Park Service employee furloughed over the weekend.

The current shutdown began at midnight Friday, when Congress did not extend a temporary spending measure put in place after the last closure. ""It's absolutely disgusting,"" Labor Department staffer Walter Martin said on the way into his office Monday morning. ""There's a lot of work to be done that's not being done.""

Before the last shutdown, congressional leaders and President Clinton promised that furloughed workers would be paid, and they were. But there have been no promises this time.

Government services affected

The administration has promised that Social Security and Medicare checks will be paid on time. However, if the second shutdown isn't over by Thursday morning, veterans' benefit checks for more than 3.3 million people would be delayed, said Ken McKinnon, spokesman for the Veterans' Affairs Department. The checks are supposed to be mailed December 29, but the department has neither the money nor the personnel to process them.

Passports also may not get processed, but as in November, postal service will not be affected and vital workers in public health and safety will stay on the job. The six-day closure that ended on November 19 was the longest in history and cost the government an estimated $750 million, more than half of it in retroactive salaries to workers who were sent home.

Sen. John Breaux, D-Louisiana, a member of the Finance Committee, predicted Monday the Senate would pass a temporary measure to keep the government in business through the end of the week while negotiators continue working. ""I think it's real possible it'll happen today,"" he said. But it was not clear whether the House would approve such a measure.

Partial Shutdown

Agencies and Departments Affected Interior Justice Commerce Veterans Housing and Urban Development Education Health and Human Services NASA EPA Labor State

Among programs that would have been killed by the bills Clinton vetoed Monday morning were his AmeriCorps community service program. The bills also contained environmental riders that critics say favor developers in the use of public lands. Clinton said the bills would undermine the nation's environment. The bills would have cut 21 percent from both the EPA and federal housing programs.

When the bills passed in the Senate last week, they did not win enough support to override a veto.

If the country wants to continue paying all its bills, that's not a realistic option for many reasons large and small, legal and practical. Here are just two:

Bills may be delayed but must be paid: Putting off payments to, say, federal contractors wouldn't save the government any money. In fact, it would cost taxpayers more money. The Treasury Department must pay those bills at some point, along with interest penalties for being late.

Spending must be slashed or taxes hiked: The Congressional Research Service estimates that over the next 12 months, the government will spend an average of $30 billion more every month than it takes in.

But if Congress hasn't raised the debt ceiling, borrowing to bridge the difference won't be possible. Instead, lawmakers would have four options to choose from that would have to be implemented abruptly:

Slash discretionary spending (including defense) by 33% every month.

Cut mandatory spending (such as spending on Social Security) by 16% every month.

Raise taxes by 12% every month.

Or some combination of all three

That's the gentle scenario.

The truth is the deficit from month to month can vary greatly. So in some periods the spending cuts or tax increases would have to be far more drastic.

For example, pretend Congress doesn't raise the debt ceiling for all of November. What then?

""The Treasury would have no choice but to eliminate its cash deficit, which will run as high as $130 billion in November,"" economist Mark Zandi told the Joint Economic Committee recently. ""The economy would quickly fall into another severe recession.""

Recessions usually increase spending because safety net expenses, such as unemployment benefits, go up. But if the government can't borrow new money to compensate, lawmakers would have to cut further or hike taxes even more. That, in turn, can dampen future growth.

You get the picture."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/23/opinion/inequality-for-dummies.html,2013-12-23 00:00:00,['Bill Keller'],Inequality for Dummies - The New York Times,"A stratified society in which the bottom and top are mostly locked in place is not just morally offensive; it is unstable. Recessions are more frequent in such countries. A widely praised 2012 book, “Why Nations Fail,” argues that historically when the ruling elites have pulled up the ladder and kept newcomers from getting a foothold, their economies have suffocated and died. “The most pernicious fact of inequality is when it translates into political inequality,” said Daron Acemoglu, a co-author of the book and a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist. “That means our democracy ceases to function because some people have so much money they command greater power.” The rich spend heavily on lobbyists and campaign donations to secure tax breaks and tariff advantages and bailouts that perpetuate their status. Not only does a dynamic economy stagnate, but the left-out citizenry becomes disillusioned and cynical. Sound familiar?

The left-left sees economic inequality as mainly a problem of distribution — the accumulation of vast wealth that never really trickles down from on high. Their prescription is to tax the 1 percent and close corporate loopholes, using the new revenues to subsidize the needs of the poor and middle class. They would string the safety net higher: expand Social Security, hold Medicare inviolate, extend unemployment insurance, protect food stamps, create more low-income housing. They would raise the minimum wage.

The center-left — and that includes President Obama, most of the time — sees the problem and the solutions as more complicated. Yes, you want to provide greater security for those without independent means (see Obamacare), but you also need to create opportunity, which means, first and foremost, jobs. Yes, you can raise taxes on the rich, but you don’t want to punish success. “You want to increase social mobility by providing an opportunity for the bottom to become rich, not forcing the rich to become poor,” said Acemoglu, who aligns more with the center than with the populists.

The center-left (I’m somewhat oversimplifying these categories) agrees on the menace of inequality, but places equal or greater emphasis on the fact that the economy is not growing the way it did for most of the last century. The sluggish growth means that not only are the poorest stuck at the bottom, but the broad middle is in economic decline. “The central economic problem is that a middle-class wage does not make a middle-class life anymore,” said Jon Cowan, president of Third Way. This diagnosis leads to somewhat different priorities. Of the arguments that pit Democrat against Democrat, three strike me as most important:

The first is how to restart the engine of growth. The populists favor putting more money in the hands of the bottom and middle, who will then spend us back to economic vigor. This is classic Keynesian thinking, largely vindicated by history. But the center-left points out that our economy is already 70 percent dependent on domestic consumers, way more than other developed countries. Liberals of all shades favor greater government investments in education, infrastructure, clean energy and other research. But they divide over policies that might unleash the energy of the private sector. In a line from his speech that was not widely quoted, President Obama said, “The fact is if you’re a progressive and you want to help the middle class and the working poor, you’ve still got to be concerned about competitiveness and productivity and business confidence that spurs private-sector investment.” While closing loopholes, Obama would also lower corporate tax rates; he would do trade deals to expand our diminishing share of foreign markets; he would shrink long-term deficits and streamline regulations.

The second argument is over entitlements. The left-left seems to believe that government investments — roads and bridges, clean energy, education, etc. — and more-generous safety-net benefits can all be had by milking the rich and cutting military spending. Most centrists would raise taxes some and cut defense spending some, but they say that unless we also curb the growth of entitlements, the stampede of baby boomers into Social Security and Medicare will crowd out everything else. Between now and 2030, the working-age population that pays into Social Security grows by 15 percent; the over-65 population that withdraws from Social Security grows by 65 percent. No one on the left favors entrusting Social Security and Medicare to the mercies of the private marketplace, as some Republicans do. But while the left tends to treat entitlements as sacred (Senator Warren and others would increase benefits for everyone, even the rich), centrists favor measures to slow the growth of entitlements: using a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) formula that more accurately reflects how people spend, cutting benefits for those who don’t really need them, possibly extending the retirement age a couple of years, and using the government’s leverage to drive down the costs of medical care. The tension between entitlements and investment is a Third Way obsession. In a column and two blog posts last year (here, and here, and here) I sympathized with the case for imposing some restraint on entitlements. I still do."
http://news.yahoo.com/yellen-didnt-tell-congress-why-matters-120140172--sector.html,,[],What Yellen didn't tell Congress and why it matters,"By Alister Bull WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The most revealing thing about Janet Yellen's widely praised Senate confirmation hearing performance last week might not have been what she said, but what she didn't say - and how she didn't say it. President Barack Obama's nominee to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve smiled and nodded her way through a two-hour hearing on Thursday without giving the Senate Banking Committee any real clues as to how she views near-term monetary policy choices. She made plain that she thought it important to maintain aggressive efforts to spur U.S. economic growth and hiring. But her comments went no further than last month's statement from the Fed's policy-setting committee. Senators asked her how long the central bank could keep buying bonds, and seemed satisfied with her mild observation that purchases could not go on forever. She provided no clues to whether she leans toward reducing them next month, or next year. Economists had not expected her to intentionally front-run decisions yet to be made by the Fed's policy-setting committee. For one thing, current Fed chief Ben Bernanke doesn't step down until January 31. Yellen is expected to comfortably secure confirmation by the full Senate to replace him. But successfully parrying questions before Congress without accidentally hinting on future policy was seen as an important first success for the 67-year-old former professor. ""She understood how to give an answer that was at least somewhat responsive to the question, without betraying any new information. It was an impressive performance,"" said Stephen Oliner, a former senior Fed economist. A second thing she didn't say anything about was her view on strengthening the Fed's forward guidance on when it might eventually raise interest rates. Here she owes a big assist to the senators. No one asked about it even though speculation is rife that the Fed will soon decide to keep rates near zero at least until the jobless rate drops to 6.0 percent. Its current threshold is 6.5 percent. Still, Yellen's performance on other issues left little doubt that if she had been asked, she would have offered an even-handed discussion on the economic literature around the issue, with scant information on where she stood. That was how she dealt with the query from Virginia Senator Mark Warner on lowering the interest the Fed pays on the excess reserves it holds for banks, which some officials think would be a way to give the economy a bit more stimulus. Yellen explained the pros and cons, reminded lawmakers that reducing IOER, as it is called, could be problematic for the money market mutual fund industry, and left them none the wiser. YELLEN FED Keeping calm under pressure is an important quality for a successful central banker. Fed watchers reckoned that it took Bernanke a year to really settle into the role, and recall the tell-tale quaver in his voice that betrayed the strain of being grilled by lawmakers. To be sure, Yellen got far kinder treatment than Bernanke often received. Perhaps that was because the Fed's Republican critics did not want to be seen baiting the first woman nominated to lead the central bank. Or perhaps they felt it would draw attention away from Obama's healthcare woes. But there was also interest in whether her reticence on shedding light on future policy might reflect a desire to avoid building expectations, which her colleagues at the Fed would subsequently have to either validate or ignore. In essence, will the Yellen Fed be more like the Bernanke Fed or the Fed under Alan Greenspan? Greenspan was much more likely to offer clues on where he wanted to lead policy. ""Greenspan would give a little wink and nod and then the committee would have to go along after the fact,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. ""It is a probably good thing for the committee overall that she can sit in front of Congress and answer questions in a way that does not make the committee feel like their next move has to deliver on expectations set by what the chairman had already said.""

About 36,000 people have received ""potential overpayments"" from the agency between December 2010 and January 2013, the Government Accountability Office reported.

Disability insurance benefits are generally available to Americans who have been determined to be physically or mentally impaired by a long-term condition that prevents them from being able to work.

To become eligible, you must go through a five-month waiting period during which your earnings must not exceed $1,000 during any given month. But the GAO found that thousands of the people who were receiving benefits had incomes exceeding this limit.

Related: The Social Security mistake that costs retirees thousands

One recipient, a physician, raked in $90,000 in overpayments over three years, even though he had earnings of as much as $22,000 per month during the five-month waiting period. Two other people have received overpayments of more than $20,000 so far this year, despite the fact they held jobs that paid substantial income during the waiting period.

Once you qualify for disability benefits, you're able to enter a trial work period, where you can return to work and continue to receive benefits -- but only for up to nine months. The GAO found, however, that some people were receiving benefits long after that nine-month trial period had ended.

In one case, a woman was given $74,000 in payments after she had been working for more than nine months, and a man was paid $57,000 in benefits following the nine-month grace period.

Related: Federal disability trust fund on the brink

While the 36,000 people the GAO determined to have received overpayments represents less than 1% of all disability insurance recipients, the watchdog said the true number of improper payments could be higher. Only the Social Security Administration can determine precise numbers by conducting detailed investigations into specific cases.

The Social Security Administration said its accuracy rate for paying disability benefits exceeds 99%, but it will look into any potential overpayments.

""While our payment accuracy rates are very high, we recognize that even small payment errors cost taxpayers,"" a spokesperson said. ""We are planning to do an investigation and we will recoup any improper payments from beneficiaries. It is too soon to tell what caused these overpayments, but if we determine that fraud is involved, we will refer these cases to our Office of the Inspector General for investigation."""

Washington (CNN) – Hey! Republicans and Democrats agreed on something! Woo hoo… er, whoa. What is this deal, exactly? The summary is written in Washington-speak. To make it easier, here’s our user-friendly version of highlights and what they mean.

The money: The deal sets the government’s spending level at $1.012 trillion for the current fiscal year and $1.014 trillion for next year. So what? Keep reading.



Budget cuts: Here’s the first reason the deal matters. Those spending levels would eliminate $45 billion in forced budget cuts (yes, “sequester”) set to hit in January and another $18 billion set to hit in 2015. It would not eliminate all of the cuts, but would erase a large chunk of them.

Wait, so does it raise spending?: Hang with us here. Simple question, not-so-simple answer. The deal would raise one kind of spending – discretionary spending – for the next two years. That’s the type of spending Congress votes on each year. It funds many government agencies. But the deal more than offsets that two-year spending increase with long-term cuts to a different type of spending – mandatory spending, or spending that happens automatically under the law. So over 10 years, the deal saves money, its writers say.

Airline fees: If you plan to take a trip , buy your tickets now and save a few bucks. The Ryan-Murray agreement would raise the TSA security charge to $5.60 for any one-way trip. So $11.20 round trip. Currently, the so-called ""9-11 fee"" is $2.50 for a nonstop flight and $5 for travel that involves connecting flights. The deal would charge the same $5.60 regardless of whether the flight plan was nonstop or not.

Federal workers: This was one of the most difficult pieces of the deal to work out. In the end, the deal requires that newly hired federal workers pay more into their pension fund. The change means that new federal workers would see a 1.3% pay cut.

The troops: Military retirees under the age of 62 will face slimmer cost-of-living increases in their retirement pay. This is phased in over three years, but ultimately cost-of-living adjustments, or COLA, will be cut by 1%.

Contractor pay: Bad news for contractors who charge the government $488,000 or more for their salaries. The deal caps what the government will pay for a contractor’s salary at $487,000.

More budget cuts, later: The deal may roll back much of the sequester during the next two years, but it extends forced budget cuts for two new years on the back end, into 2023 and 2024.

Oddball proposals: The deal contains more than a dozen other assorted provisions, a kind of nickle-by-nickle, rag-tag collection. Here are some that especially stand out.

The Death Master File: Cue the Star Wars’ Imperial March music here. Turns out the Department of Commerce keeps something called the “Death Master File,” which lists people who have died and their Social Security numbers. The budget deal would block fraud (checks going to dead people, essentially) by limiting access to the death list and raising penalties for misuse.

Prisoners shouldn’t get unemployment checks: The deal aims to block prisoners from getting government checks the law bans, like unemployment benefits, by increasing the coordination of prisoner lists.

Student loan companies: This isn’t sexy, but it is worth $3 billion, according to House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan’s office. The deal would take away automatic payment for non-profit student loan servicers, replacing it with payment that Congress determines yearly. Told you it wasn’t sexy.

Pension guarantees: And, it gets even more wonky - but also more lucrative. The federal government runs a program that guarantees the pensions for companies that participate, sensibly called the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The deal saves an estimated $7.9 billion by asking the companies to pay more money for that guarantee.

Gas and oil: The deal would make two changes that energy companies won’t like. It ends a government research program that Ryan’s office says was for private energy companies. It also ends a provision that allowed energy companies to stash funds in government accounts and earn interest above market rates."

Story highlights NEW: The White House urges Republicans to favor the middle class over tax loopholes The plan raises taxes on millionaires, ends farm subsidies and cuts defense spending An aide to Sen. Mitch McConnell says Americans oppose higher taxes Spending cuts to take effect March 1 absent congressional action to avert them

Senate Democrats proposed a $110 billion measure Thursday to put off mandatory across-the-board spending cuts set to take effect March 1.

The package made public by Senate Democratic leaders calls for replacing the so-called sequester cuts with a combination of increased tax revenue from millionaires, ending agriculture subsidies and reducing defense spending after the war in Afghanistan ends.

Republican leaders in Congress have demanded that Democrats come up with a plan for avoiding the imminent cuts, technically known as sequestration.

However, the GOP opposes any increase in tax rates or other steps to bring in more tax revenue, saying the nation needs to reduce the cost of government.

Kerry: Cuts would hit foreign aid, diplomatic security

“I would respectfully disagree that the American people are going to suddenly demand more tax hikes,” an aide to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said.

A White House statement said that opposing what it called the balanced plan by Senate Democrats would amount to prioritizing “tax loopholes that benefit the very few at the expense of middle- and working-class Americans.”

The issue extends a long-running political dispute over government spending and federal deficits that dominated President Barack Obama’s first term, as well as his successful re-election campaign last year.

Republicans were forced to concede on their steadfast opposition to increased taxes by agreeing in January to higher rates on top income earners as part of a deal to avoid some of the harshest impacts of what was known as the fiscal cliff, which included the sequester cuts and automatic tax hikes.

Napolitano: Spending cuts will hurt homeland security

That agreement put off action on the sequester cuts, which were mandated by a 2011 agreement to raise the federal debt ceiling.

The purpose of the deep cuts to all discretionary programs and the military was to motivate Congress to reach a comprehensive deficit reduction agreement that would replace it.

However, such a deal has proved impossible, leading to the imminent application of $85 billion in spending cuts for 2013 and almost $1 trillion over 10 years.

Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and other officials warn that the cuts will have a dire impact on government operations and military readiness. The Pentagon would absorb about half of the reductions.

While the White House and congressional leaders from both parties oppose sequestration, the approach for averting it has become the latest congressional showdown involving ideological differences over the size and role of government.

House Speaker John Boehner noted on Thursday that the House passed bills last year to prevent the cuts from affecting the military, but Senate Democrats never acted.

“Those days are over,” Boehner declared, but he also signaled a willingness to negotiate with the Senate over any legislation it sends over. “It’s time for the Senate to do their work. We can … if they’re willing to pass a bill, we’ll find some way to work with them to address this problem.”

Panetta: World is watching U.S. on budget

The plan unveiled Thursday by Senate Democrats would just replace the cuts through the end of this year, leaving time for possible negotiations on a broader deficit-reduction package that would eliminate sequestration entirely.

The Democrats proposed $54 billion in revenue by implementing the “Buffett rule,” a principle by billionaire financier Warren Buffett that he shouldn’t pay a lower tax rate than his secretary.

Under it, anyone with adjusted income of more than $1 million after charitable deductions would pay a minimum 30% tax rate.

Other revenue measures in the package include ending tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and closing tax loopholes for the oil industry.

In addition, the package would cut military funding starting in 2015, following the planned end of U.S. combat operations next year in Afghanistan. It would also end agriculture subsidies for a total saving of $55 billion.

“Billions in direct payment subsidies are paid out even in good times and for crops farmers aren’t even growing,” explained Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Michigan, who chairs the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry.

Panetta said Wednesday that Congress needs to put aside party and ideological divisions that he called “the greatest concern I have for our national security.”

He expressed concern over how the world will view the United States if it fails to avert sequestration.

“What (other countries) worry about is what I worry about, which is whether or not we can govern and whether or not we can face the tough decisions that have to be made and resolve those,” Panetta said.

USA TODAY

President Obama warns of default if debt ceiling is not increased

Obama again blamed the ongoing government shutdown on Republicans

Economically%2C a default would be worse than a shutdown%2C Obama says

Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified the home state of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

President Obama broadened his focus in the budget battle Thursday, saying a government default on its debts would hurt the economy worse than the ongoing government shutdown.

""As reckless as a government shutdown is ... an economic shutdown that results from default would be dramatically worse,"" Obama said during an appearance at a construction company in Rockville, Md.

Obama also called on House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to put a ""clean"" spending bill on the floor with no health care restrictions, predicting it would pass and ""the shutdown would end today.""

Boehner ""won't even let the bill get a yes or no vote because he doesn't want to anger the extremists in his party,"" Obama said.

Default would be the result if Congress does not increase the debt ceiling by Oct. 17, Obama said, noting that the debt limit allows the government to borrow money to pay its debt.

Without the authority, the United States would see its credit rating drop, while Americans would see rises in interest rates that would curb economic activity across the world, said the president.

An ""economic shutdown"" could lead to delays of Social Security checks and disability benefits, Obama said.

He told a crowd of supporters: ""Falling pensions and home values and rising interest rates on things like mortgages and student loans -- all those things risk putting us back into a bad recession.""

As the existing shutdown of government operations entered its third day, Obama again blamed Republican conservatives who want to gut the new health care bill.

""This whole thing is about one thing,"" Obama said. ""The Republican obsessions with dismantling the Affordable Care Act.""

The Republican-run House has passed temporary spending plans that include a one-year delay of Obama's health care law — a provision Obama and the Democratic-run Senate say is unacceptable. The Senate has rejected three attempts to pass a bill paying for government services while also trying to delay all or parts of the health care law.

Obama, who met with congressional leaders at the White House on Wednesday night, repeated his stance that he would not negotiate health care and budget issues until the government is reopened and the debt ceiling is raised.

Republicans, meanwhile, called Obama's no-negotiation pledge an obstacle to his goals.

""Now we hear he's off campaigning today in Rockville, rather than sitting down to get this thing solved,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. ""It's disappointing.""

Boehner said that House Republicans ""have sent bill after bill after bill to the Senate to keep the government open, and Democrats have rejected every one of them — refusing to even talk about our differences.""

In urging Boehner to call a vote on a bill without health care restrictions, Obama said the ""one way out of this reckless and damaging Republican shutdown"" is a spending plan ""with no partisan strings attached.""

Referring to Tea Party Republicans, Obama said the impasse is due to ""one faction of one party in one half of one branch of government.""

Obama spoke less than an hour after the Treasury Department issued a report saying that a default could plunge the nation into a recession worse than the near-meltdown of the financial system in 2008.

In previous weeks, the Treasury Department has warned that the debt ceiling will be breached on Oct. 17."

Thousands of federal employees are facing unpaid time off as agencies determine that they will have to furlough workers to absorb the cuts.

But other workers -- including some in the private sector -- are losing their jobs altogether, underscoring just how much daily life for many people is tied to a functioning government. Some examples:

On Monday, 250 workers at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state received pink slips, while another 2,500 others found out they're facing furloughs. Approximately 9,000 people work at the nation's most contaminated nuclear site, and the Associated Press reports that ""cleanup is likely to be slowed"" because of the budget cuts.

Continental Maritime, a contractor that repairs U.S. Navy ships, expects to lay off 185 employees, effective April 12. Other contractors have issued conditional layoff notices -- meaning that jobs are safe if Congress restores some funding to the Defense Department -- to thousands of employees.

Four-hundred eighteen contract workers tied to the Tobyhanna Army Depot in Pennsylvania are losing their jobs due to sequestration. Two-hundred sixteen people will be dismissed on April 15 and 107 on April 30, the Morning Call of Allentown, Pa., reports. The paper noted that the Tobyhanna Army Depot is losing 35 percent -- $309 million -- of its government funding through the end of the fiscal year, and that more than 5,100 of the people who work there are being forced to take 22 furlough days.

At least eight municipal employees in Monterey County, Calif., are losing their jobs as a result of a decrease in the number of military contracts.

In early March, 23 people who work with the parks and recreation and maintenance departments in Tooele County, Utah, were laid off in order to grapple with the federal budget cuts. ""I have four kids. This is my livelihood,” said Scott Chance, a 12-year employee. ""It pays my health insurance. It gives me my house.""

Engineering Services Network is an engineering and technology company and one of the top Latino-owned companies in Virginia. President and CEO Raymond Lopez Jr. told NBC Latino that he has ""lost about 20 employees through sequestration.""

The Red River Army Depot in Texarkana, Texas, announced in February that it was cutting 414 jobs -- about 10 percent of its workforce. ""I don't know how we're going to make it,"" Raymond Wyrick, whose last day was scheduled to be March 9, told CNN Money.

While people around the country deal with these furloughs, job losses and a reduction in government services like unemployment benefits and funding for domestic violence prevention, much of the debate in Washington continues to center around the fact that the White House is no longer offering tours and the Easter Egg Roll could be called off.

Congress is now working on a continuing resolution to keep the government running when the current funding runs out on March 27. It's expected to keep in place the $85 billion in sequestration cuts -- meaning workers may still face furloughs -- although federal agencies will likely get more flexibility in how to absorb those cuts.

Defense Sec. Chuck Hagel%2C a combat vet%2C said %22we can no longer put off military compensation reform.

All this reform does is make a small adjustment for younger retirees.

I stand behind the need for reform.

The Bipartisan Budget Act that Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and I drafted will soon become law. We think it's a small step toward fiscal discipline in Washington. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will reduce the deficit over the next ten years by over $20 billion. And unlike current law, it will provide much-needed relief to our already strained defense budget.

One part of the bill has become particularly controversial: the reduction in cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for working-age military retirees. The federal government has no greater obligation than to keep the American people safe and we must take care of the men and women in uniform who put their lives on the line. For that reason, Congress is understandably hesitant to make changes to military compensation.

But even hesitance has a cost. The need for reform is undeniable. Since 2001, excluding the costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the cost per service member in the active-duty force has risen by 41% in inflation-adjusted dollars.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, a combat vet himself, has said ""that we can no longer put off military compensation reform. DOD's leadership, Chairman Dempsey, the service chiefs, the service secretaries, and myself, we all know that we need to slow cost growth in military compensation. Otherwise, we'll have to make disproportionate cuts to military readiness and modernization.""

Here's what the new law will do. We make no changes for those currently at or above age 62. This reform affects only younger military retirees. Right now, any person who has served 20 years can retire —regardless of age. That means a serviceman who enlists at 18 becomes eligible for retirement at 38. The late 30s and early 40s are prime working years, and most of these younger retirees go on to second careers.

All this reform does is make a small adjustment for those younger retirees. If they retire before age 62, the annual increase in their retired pay will be 1% less than the inflation rate. In other words, their benefits will grow every year — just at a slower rate. And when the retiree hits 62, DOD will recalculate the retired pay so that it will be where it would have been if he or she had received the full inflation adjustment every year since he or she retired.

Here's an example: If a serviceman enlisted at 18 and retired at 38, under this policy his lifetime benefit would be about $1.7 million instead of $1.8 million. For a service member who retired at the average military retirement age of 44, the difference would be smaller, about $30,000 over his or her lifetime. This is a far more modest reform than other bipartisan proposals, some of which would have fully eliminated the adjustments for inflation for working-age retirees.

And to be clear, the money we save from this reform will go right back to the military. Veterans aren't Washington's piggy bank. They deserve fair compensation. And we owe them a benefit structure they can count on.

That said, when Congress was considering the bill, many raised concerns that these reforms would affect the retired pay of service members who are medically retired and those receiving survivor's benefits. So Senator Murray and I have agreed to amend the law to exclude them well before the reform takes effect in December 2015.

But I stand behind the need for reform. In 2012, Congress established the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission to examine the entire military-compensation system from top to bottom. The commission's recommendations are due in May, and the leaders of the armed-services committees in Congress have agreed to consider their recommendations and look for other ways to reform the system. That's why this reform does not take effect until the end of 2015 — it gives Congress ample time to consider alternatives.

For me, there's simply no choice between responsible reforms of military compensation and making what our military leadership has called ""disproportionate cuts to military readiness and modernization."" Every time we kick the can down the road, we put our troops' combat readiness at risk. This agreement put forward one reform option, and I invite others to do the same.

Our troops have been willing to sacrifice everything for this country. We owe it to them to give them the best equipment on the battlefield and a secure retirement when they come home.

As congressional leaders negotiate a deal to raise the nation's debt ceiling, Chris Cillizza explains why any deal they strike will probably come down to the wire. (The Washington Post)

Senate leaders said late Monday that they were closing in on a deal to raise the federal debt limit and end the two-week-old government shutdown, just days before the Treasury Department exhausts its ability to borrow.

The emerging agreement would extend the Treasury Department’s borrowing authority until Feb. 7, reopen the government and fund federal agencies through mid-January, according to aides and lawmakers familiar with the negotiations.

In the meantime, policymakers would launch a new round of talks over broader budget issues in hopes of developing a plan to replace deep automatic spending cuts known as the sequester before Jan. 15. That is when the next round of sequester cuts is scheduled to slice another $20 billion out of agency budgets, primarily from the Pentagon.

The framework under consideration includes only minor changes to President Obama’s signature health-care law, falling well short of defunding it or delaying major provisions as conservative Republicans initially sought. Instead, Republicans would get only new safeguards to ensure that people who receive federal subsidies to purchase health insurance under the law are eligible to receive them.

But talks were hung up over another provision, aides and lawmakers said: a demand by Democrats to delay the law’s “belly button tax,” a levy on existing policies that is set to add $63 per covered person — including spouses and dependents — to the cost of health insurance next year. Republicans derided the proposal as a special favor to organized labor.

Oct. 16, 2013 The sun rises on the U.S. Capitol dome as the prayer group Faithful Filibuster — Carol Busroe, Gary Cook, Jim Wallis and Ray East — pray for a solution to end the shutdown and extend the Treasury Department’s borrowing power. Melina Mara/The Washington Post Wait 1 second to continue.

Meanwhile, Democrats were resisting a GOP demand to deny Treasury Secretary Jack Lew the use of special measures to extend his borrowing power past Feb. 7. That would give Congress a firm deadline for the next debt-limit increase, with no wiggle room for Treasury Department accountants.

Despite those points of contention, Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) appeared confident that they had developed a framework that could win the approval of Congress and spare the country from a first-ever default on the national debt.

“We’ve had a good day,” McConnell said in a speech closing the Senate for the evening. “I think it’s safe to say we’ve made substantial progress and we look forward to making more progress in the future.”

Reid agreed. “We’ve made tremendous progress. We are not there yet, but tremendous progress. And everyone just needs to be patient,” he said. “Perhaps tomorrow will be a bright day.”

The big question mark Monday evening was whether the emerging agreement could win the approval of the Republican-controlled House, where a small bloc of conservatives has managed to direct GOP strategy.

While McConnell and Reid were at work on a bipartisan compromise, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) was continuing to promote a more partisan bill that would lift the debt limit for only six weeks.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) met midafternoon with McConnell and then huddled with his own leadership team. Afterward, Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) declined to say what path the House would take.

“There’s a lot of different options we still have,” McCarthy said, adding that passing the Ryan plan is “always a possibility.”

There were signs that some House conservatives were growing anxious about the Senate talks. Rep. Raúl R. Labrador (R-Idaho), one of the most hard-line conservatives in the House, accused his Senate colleagues of “pussyfooting around” in the budget battle.

“The problem with Senate Republicans is that they always want to have a fight the next time,” Labrador said on CNN.

But Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a close Boehner ally, said he was confident that McConnell would not sign off on a deal unless Boehner was convinced that it could win a broad majority of Republicans.

“McConnell, I don’t think, will deliberately put us in a bad position,” Cole said, adding that any agreement that creates a process to litigate broader budget issues would achieve an important GOP goal. “If you’re able to do that and you’re able to get some savings out of the entitlement portion of the budget, those aren’t Republican defeats. They are Republican victories.”

After weeks in which no one was negotiating about anything, Monday was a day of near-constant activity. It began with a two-hour gathering of a bipartisan group of 12 senators led by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), the primary sponsor of a separate proposal that appeared to gain strength Friday before fizzling amid Democratic opposition over the weekend.

After that meeting, the Republican members briefed McConnell and the Democrats briefed Reid. Collins said the group was “continuing to discuss the parameters of a deal” but acknowledged that “there really is a focus on leadership right now.”

Later, Reid ventured twice from his office just off the Senate floor, around the corner and down the hall to McConnell’s office, where the two spoke face to face. At midday, McConnell and Boehner met — the speaker was spied briefly as he made his way down a back hallway from his office to McConnell’s suite for a 25-minute update.

The White House had announced in the morning that Reid, McConnell, Boehner and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) would come downtown at 3 p.m. to brief the president on their progress. But that meeting was postponed amid concern that it would interrupt the talks just as they were making headway.

With lawmakers trickling slowly back into Washington after a weekend at home, Republican leaders in both chambers decided to delay briefing rank-and-file lawmakers about the day’s developments until everyone was in town Tuesday morning.

It was unclear how things would proceed from there.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), the ringleader of the failed effort to attack the health-care law, waved off questions from reporters about whether he would try to block the Senate from approving an agreement, if one were reached.

“We need to see what the details are,” he said repeatedly.

But Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), another conservative, said he has little appetite for obstruction, even if he does not like the final deal. “We need to get an agreement and open the government back up,” he said.

Still, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who has been close to the talks, acknowledged that the emerging agreement would be “a tough vote.” The misguided assault on the health-care law had diverted attention from more meaningful efforts to overhaul the tax code and rein in spending on Medicare and Social Security, he said. And now time has run out for achieving those goals.

“Let’s just spell out what’s happened: We’ve basically blown the last two months with some of our members and a lot of the House focused on a shiny object that was never going to happen,” he said. “To try to put something together in three days that has meaningful things we all would like to see in it is just not possible.”

As talks intensified, Obama warned that if the standoff is not resolved by Thursday, when the Treasury Department will run out of borrowing authority, “we stand a good chance of defaulting.”

U.S. financial markets fell slightly in morning trading but then stabilized. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average each dropped about 0.5 percent in the first 90 minutes of trading before rebounding to close with gains. In a more telling sign of market sentiment, the Vix, a measure of expected future volatility in stock markets, soared more than 12 percent before ending the trading day up 2.2 percent.

Bond markets were closed for the Columbus Day holiday. In recent days, investors have sold off short-term Treasury bills maturing later in October, fearful that there could be disruptions that prevent the government from making good on its obligations.

So why does Mr. Obama keep talking to them about a deal? Because Republicans still have powerful incentives to strike one.

Delaying steps to rein in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the subjects of Republican doomsday warnings for years, means delaying significant attempts to curb the size of the government. The longer the delay, the sharper and more immediate the changes Washington must eventually make to ease the long-term fiscal squeeze.

Even if Republicans take control of Congress and the White House in the next two elections — allowing them to put in place a budget plan without major compromises — they would then shoulder the political responsibility for the inevitable pain that comes from curbing those huge and popular programs. Much as Republicans may dislike Mr. Obama and his policies, a Democratic president can provide them a measure of political cover."

News that the insurance giant was considering joining a shareholder suit led by former Chief Executive Maurice “Hank” Greenberg provoked outrage and undermined AIG’s high-profile advertising campaign thanking America for the bailout.

The company’s board met Wednesday to listen to presentations about the federal suit by Greenberg’s Starr International Co., which alleges the U.S. government shortchanged AIG shareholders in a bailout that at one point had taxpayers on the hook for more than $182 billion.

Quiz: How well do you remember 2012?

AIG took about $125 billion of the money and the government received a 92% ownership stake in the company. Last month, the Treasury sold its last shares of AIG stock, formally ending the bailout with a $22.7 billion profit.

AIG said the board had a fiduciary responsibility to shareholders to consider joining the suit, a move that Starr had demanded. But the board quickly decided not to join the suit.

“In considering and ultimately refusing the demand before us, the board of directors properly and fully executed our fiduciary and legal obligations to AIG and its shareholders,” Robert S. “Steve” Miller, AIG’s chairman, said Wednesday.

“America invested in 62,000 AIG employees, and we kept our promise to rebuild this great company, repay every dollar America invested in us, and deliver a profit to those who put their trust in us,” he continued. “To date, AIG has returned $205 billion to America, including a profit of $22.7 billion. We continue to thank America for its support.”

Rather than looking at how meager is the pay of millions of working Americans, the execs are blaming the expiration of the payroll-tax break on Dec. 31. The Bloomberg report noted that ""For a person making $40,000 a year, that is about $15 a week."" $15 a week is wrecking WalMart? Really? Or is it the fact that nearly one in every five U.S. households earns less than $20,000 a year?



WalMart, in fact, leads the list of The 20 Companies With The Most Low-Wage Workers. As Henry Blodget pointed out, Walmart could give every single one of its 1.4 million U.S. workers a $5,000 a year raise and STILL have $17 billion in profit.



In his State of the Union address, President Obama proposed pushing the minimum wage up to a whole nine bucks an hour, or about $18,000 a year. A really serious proposal would have been $12 or more an hour. As Dean Baker explained a few days ago, if the minimum wage had kept pace with productivity growth the past few decades, it would have been $16.54 in 2012.



And let's note here the stunning news that The top 1% captured 121 percent of income gains since 2009. How is THAT possible? As a Naked Capitalism writer explained, "" How did that happen? Incomes to the bottom 99% fell by 0.4%.""

That means income inequality is getting worse faster under Obama, than it did under Dubya.

UPDATE: A big swooping tip o' the hat to PuddyTat and grover, who note in the comments below that there is also the factor of ""the negative publicity and exposure that WalMart has gotten that has increased the number of folks who won't walk in their door anymore."" Grover points to the highly interesting information that Sams Club, the membership retail warehouse owned by WalMart, is also suffering from slack sales, while its competitor, Costco, is not."

(AP Photo/ Francisco Seco)

Increasing the minimum wage is ""actually good policy,"" New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote in a blog post on Saturday.

President Obama proposed raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $9 an hour during his State of the Union address last week. While many on the right say that raising the minimum wage could make it more difficult for employers to hire people and therefore cause higher unemployment, Krugman argued in his post that this simply is not the case.

""There just isn’t any evidence that raising the minimum wage near current levels would reduce employment,"" Krugman wrote, citing a report by John Schmitt from the Center for Economic Policy and Research.

This opinion is a hotly contested one. A 2011 study from the London School of Economics found that higher minimum wages do correlate with an increase in unemployment.

That said, there are a number of ways the labor market could respond to an increase in the minimum wage that do not involve cutting jobs. The Washington Post's Wonkblog has a great summary of these effects, which you can check out here.

The federal minimum wage hasn't increased since 2009. According to a 2012 study from the Center for Economic and Policy Research, the minimum wage would actually be $21.72 an hour if it kept pace with increases in worker productivity.

The same CEPR study found that if the minimum wage kept up with inflation since it peaked in real value in 1968, it would now be $10.52 per hour.

Even if the U.S. raised the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour, the nation would still have a lower minimum wage than many countries around the world. Check out this list of 9 countries with a higher minimum wage than the U.S. below:

Michael Needham, CEO of the powerful group Heritage Action, said that he opposed conditioning a crucial vote to increase the government's borrowing authority on the group's main goal: defunding Obamacare.

Under questioning at a breakfast with reporters, hosted by the Christian Science Monitor, Needham, a product of the Stanford Business School, conceded that failure to raise the debt ceiling would indeed disrupt the global economy.

""I'm sure the markets will react negatively,"" he said, even if, as he suggested was possible, the Treasury could ""prioritize"" interest payments to foreign bondholders.

Rather than try to hold the debt ceiling vote hostage to the defunding of Obamacare, he said, the better ""tactical"" course for Heritage and other key foes of the administration is to continue to focus on annual spending -- and on allowing the full opening of government only if Obamacare is dismantled.

""No, we should raise the debt limit,"" he said, though he added that he would oppose an increase that extends until after the 2014 election, which is Obama's preferred outcome.

But with regards to the government shutdown, Needham insisted that his group would continue to oppose any continuing resolution -- no matter how short in duration -- that did not defund the health care law.

""My tactic is to focus on the CR,"" he said.

Matt Kibbe, the president and CEO of the influential conservative group FreedomWorks, also said in a Wednesday interview with The Huffington Post that the debt ceiling should be raised in order to keep the Obamacare fight focused on the continuing resolution.

""This is an emerging set of opinions that looks to be where everybody's gravitating to,"" he said.

Heritage Action, funded by small donors, corporate allies and wealthy individuals Needham refused to name -- other than the Koch Brothers, who he said had given $500,000 -- has become a powerhouse in a new generation of conservative groups.

It operates on a model developed by Evangelical activists, producing informative -- and politically inflammatory -- ""scorecards"" that rate lawmakers' ideological purity based on their many votes.

The group organized a series of public events and town halls this summer to oppose Obamacare, which the group regards as the next camel's nose under the tent of a bankrupt entitlement state.

Needham thinks that Social Security needs ""fundamental"" change and that other entitlement programs are unfairly burdening Millennials.

But he indicated at the Wednesday breakfast that his disdain for Obamacare did not extend to the debt ceiling vote.

That could give Obama and House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) at least a smidgen of room to maneuver if and when they decide to strike an overall deal: the White House could get a ""clean"" debt ceiling vote (though of short duration) and the GOP could get a concession or two on the continuing resolution to fund the government's annual spending."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/09/business/economy/feds-plan-to-taper-stimulus-effort-not-expected-until-next-year.html,2013-12-09 00:00:00,['Binyamin Appelbaum'],Fed’s Plan to Taper Stimulus Effort Is Not Expected Until Next Year,"When Mr. Bernanke first described the Fed’s tapering plans in June, investors ignored this distinction, driving up rates across the board. But the message has gradually taken hold. The movement of asset prices after recent good news, including the November jobs data, has reflected an expectation that the Fed is closer to tapering, but not to raising interest rates. “Markets are beginning to appreciate that they are separate tools,” Mr. Bernanke said last month.

Some officials think the Fed still needs to underscore this distinction when it begins to taper its bond purchases. Others now regard such an effort as unnecessary, or contend that the Fed could act after it begins to taper if investors seem to be confused.

Proponents of underscoring the Fed’s commitment to low interest rates are further fragmented about the best technique. Some, including Mr. Evans, would like to lower the threshold unemployment rate. Some would like to create a similar threshold for inflation. Some would like to make a symbolic cut in an obscure interest rate the Fed pays on bank reserves.

Instead of such concrete steps, the Fed also could seek to explain in greater detail how it will decide the timetable for increasing interest rates. This option commanded the broadest support at the Fed’s meeting in October.

A shift among officials who pushed for tapering earlier in the year has made it easier for the Fed to postpone decisions. Some of those officials now say the Fed should commit to a date to end the program rather than beginning to taper as soon as possible, because they see this as the best way to reduce confusion among investors.

“The sooner we say we’re going to end this program once we’ve purchased X, the sooner we say that, the better,” Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said on Friday. “It’s that constant uncertainty about what we’ll do at each and every meeting that I think we can eliminate this way, and we’ll be better off for it, and we’ll not sacrifice much of the benefits of the program.”

The sluggish pace of inflation also has made it easier to wait. Prices rose just 0.7 percent during the 12 months that ended in October, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. Excluding the volatile movements of food and energy prices, inflation was still just 1.1 percent over that period. That is significantly below the 2 percent pace the Fed regards as best for the economy."
http://news.yahoo.com/factbox-happen-u-government-shuts-down-234308708--business.html,,[],Factbox: What would happen if the U.S. government shuts down?,"(Reuters) - A partial shutdown of the U.S. government will begin at midnight on Monday if Republicans and Democrats fail to agree on a funding bill. In a government shutdown, spending for essential functions related to national security or public safety would continue along with benefit programs such as Medicare health insurance and Social Security retirement benefits for seniors. But civilian federal employees - from people who process forms and handle regulatory matters to workers at national parks and museums - would be furloughed. The last government shutdown ran from December 16, 1995, to January 6, 1996, putting about 800,000 federal workers on furlough. Here is a roundup of the expected impact of a shutdown. FEDERAL WORKERS Up to 1 million U.S. federal workers could face furloughs without pay beginning on Oct 1. Most federal agency workers would be furloughed, but a small number of ""excepted"" employees must continue to work. These include security workers such as air traffic controllers and prison guards. Congressional staffers could work if requested by the lawmaker or committee that employs them. Congress has previously paid federal workers for their furlough days. Federal workers could face penalties if they tried to do any work during the furlough. FINANCIAL MARKET CONSEQUENCES Apart from potential market swings, companies hoping to raise money in an initial public offering could face delays. Businesses will still be able to file certain documents to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but the agency said on Friday that processing and approving applications will be discontinued during a shutdown. ""Capital-raising will have a huge hiccup if the SEC shuts down as it has said,"" said Eric Jensen, a partner with law firm Cooley LLP in Palo Alto, California. Drug companies waiting for a decision from the Food and Drug Administration could also see delays. The FDA said it would continue ""limited activities"" related to programs that are paid for by user fees from drug approval applications. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS A shutdown lasting less than two weeks would not hurt big defense contractors, which can survive temporarily without federal contract payments, said ratings agency Standard & Poor's. But a longer shutdown could weaken the financial profiles and liquidity positions of smaller defense contractors. ""It is felt a heck of a lot more keenly by small contractors,"" said Bradley Wine, co-chair of Morrison & Foerster's government contracts practice. MEAT INSPECTORS Meat inspectors for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, considered necessary to national safety would stay on job. U.S. ARMED SERVICES All military personnel would continue in a normal duty status. But a large number of civilian employees would be temporarily furloughed, according to the Pentagon. Official furlough notices would be issued on October 1 if no agreement to fund the government has been reached. FEDERAL COURTS Federal courts will remain open for about 10 business days. By October 15, the Judiciary will need to provide more guidance. The Supreme Court, which is scheduled to start its fall 2013 session on October 7, declined to comment on whether it has plans for a government shutdown. But a court spokesman noted that in past shutdown situations, the court continued operating as normal. IRS The Internal Revenue Service has a major tax due date on October 15 for Americans who got an extension to file their 2012 taxes, which were due on April 15. The IRS will be accepting tax returns and other tax payments during a shutdown, but will suspend many other activities, including audits. About 90 percent of the IRS's 90,000 workforce would be furloughed, the agency said on Monday, meaning call centers would be closed and audits halted. HEALTHCARE LAW President Barack Obama's 2010 healthcare reform law is scheduled to debut on October 1 when people can start shopping for health insurance. Money to fund implementation of the healthcare law, known as Obamacare, has already been committed. (Complied by Washington bureau reporters.)"

Nope,"“You know, those Capitol janitors will not get as much overtime. I’m sure they think less pay, that they’re taking home, does hurt.”

— Gene Sperling, director of the White House economic council, on ABC News’ “This Week,” March 3, 2013

“On the issue of the janitors, if you work for an hourly wage and you earn overtime, and you depend on that overtime to make ends meet, it is simply a fact that a reduction in overtime is a reduction in your pay.”

— White House spokesman Jay Carney, news briefing, March 4

At a news conference last Friday, President Obama claimed that, “starting tomorrow,” the “folks cleaning the floors at the Capitol” had “just got a pay cut” because of the automatic federal spending cuts known as the sequester.

The president very quickly earned Four Pinocchios for that statement, especially after senior officials at the Architect of the Capitol (AOC), the federal agency that employ janitors on the House side, and the office of the Sergeant at Arms (SAA), which employs janitors on the Senate side, issued statements saying the president’s comments were not true.

Still, the White House has kept up its spin offensive, claiming that a cut in “overtime” was a de facto pay cut and thus the president was right — or at least not wrong.

So, we wondered: How much overtime do Capitol Hill janitors actually make?

The Facts

First of all, we should note that the White House’s story kept evolving as we reported last week’s column. It’s almost as if the president’s aides had to scramble to come up with reasons why the president could be correct, without actually knowing the facts.

So, when we forwarded to White House aides an AOC memo saying no furloughs were planned, White House aides latched onto a line about overtime reductions. For a couple of hours, we were also told that the janitors were on contract — and contracts were being curtailed. But that line of reasoning turned out to be incorrect. Then, after the statements from the Capitol were issued, there was no longer any response.

But, as seen by the quotes above, the talking point about “overtime” did not fade away.

AOC officials declined to discuss janitor compensation, but SAA officials were willing to share details. Given that the AOC and SAA janitors essentially work side by side, it is reasonable to assume that the pay statistics are roughly similar.

Bret H. Swanson, assistant sergeant at arms for operations and the manager of cleaning technicians, said 27 people are employed on the night cleaning shift and 16 people on a day shift; a majority of the cleaning takes place at night. There is a differential for the overnight shift, so the night janitors earn an average of $51,644 a year and the day janitors earn an average of $49,481.

And the overtime pay? It averaged $304 per employee in fiscal year 2012 and $388 per employee thus far in the current fiscal year. “Cleaning technicians do not earn what I would consider to be a great deal of overtime pay,” Swanson said.

In other words, overtime amounts to only pittance of the overall pay — about $6.50 a week on top of wages of $1,000 a week. That’s much different from Carney’s claim of having to “depend on that overtime to make ends meet.”

Indeed, even before the sequester was implemented, Capitol Hill janitors have already earned more overtime pay than they did in all of last year. Swanson said the higher amount so far this year is because of “the demands of beginning a new Congress and hosting a presidential inauguration during a weekend that also included a federal holiday.”

Swanson said that, as reported, SAA would work on trying to drive down overtime requirements for employees for the rest of the year. But, for the rest of the sequester, the janitors are already ahead of the game.

A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.

The Pinocchio Test

We don’t try to play gotcha here at The Fact Checker. When Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) was ridiculed for saying last week that 170 million jobs would be lost because of the sequester, we dropped our inquiry when we realized she had corrected her statement — to the official Congressional Budget Office estimate of 750,000 jobs — later in the same news conference. Everyone makes mistakes, and that’s understandable.

The quicker the mistake is cleaned up, the better. As Education Secretary Arne Duncan showed this week, a little humility, even a bit late, can be a good thing.

But a clean-up brigade shouldn’t simply try to deflect and obfuscate. Apparently, the president assumed — incorrectly — that the janitors on Capitol Hill would get a pay cut. Rather than admit an error, White House aides doubled down on their talking points about overtime being essential to their livelihood, without actually knowing the truth.

Clearly, the sequester is hurting segments of the government and will cut the pay of some government workers. It would be better to focus on those people rather than imaginary victims.

He Left The Newspaper In']",The hard question for Detroit bankruptcy judge is not about debt,"Detroit went into federal bankruptcy court on Monday hoping to prove what most people already know: It is poor and $18 billion in debt, its residents aren’t getting adequate municipal services and there is no real way to rebound without some sort of judicial protection.

But the question facing Judge Steven Rhodes, who is presiding over the nation’s largest municipal bankruptcy case, is deeper than just the facts of financial peril.

The jurist will be asked to decide whether city and state officials acted in good faith and did all that they could to avoid filing for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection. Depending on the answer, the judge can determine who will bear the pain of lost revenue, income and public employee pensions.

“There’s nothing left to do here. There is no revenue solution. … Chapter 9 is more needed here than any other possible scenario you could think of,” attorney Bruce Bennett said in his opening remarks. Witnesses “will present a mountain of evidence showing the insolvency of the city,” Bennett said, according to the Associated Press. “This is one of those cases where the data speaks very clearly and persuasively on its own. It needs no gloss.”

But in her opening statement, Jennifer Green, an attorney for Detroit’s pension funds, stressed the creditor position that months of official correspondence indicates officials were preparing for a bankruptcy filing and not taking time to negotiate with creditors, especially unions.

“It really was a forgone conclusion,” she said, according to reports from the courtroom.

The unions argue that the city’s emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, who was appointed to effectively take control of the broken city, never wanted to bargain with the pension funds and just wanted to slash benefits. Orr has said the pension funds are $3.5 billion short and he also wants to cuts health benefits negotiated in the past.

The trial is expected to last several days -- possibly spilling into the first week of November -- with top officials, including Orr and Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, expected to be among the witnesses.

The outcome could also have an impact on other possible municipal bankruptcies as the nation slowly comes out of the preceding years of economic pain.

Bankruptcy law was designed to protect those who were in financial trouble by giving them some breathing room to reorganize their operations. It also allows judges to eventually decide who gets a financial haircut. For example, will pensioners lose benefits? Or will bondholders have to settle for repayment of pennies on the dollar?

At least 100 creditors, including those holding city bonds, are among those opposing the city’s request for bankruptcy protection.

While unions argue that their members and retirees should not be penalized, other creditors argue that a cut to municipal bond value would fall like a rock onto the entire municipal market. It would send ripples of pain across the country as funding for government projects begin to dry up or become more expensive because of higher interest rates.

There are some general criteria that have to be decided for Detroit to win bankruptcy protection.

It needs to show it is insolvent -- not a big problem given that everyone agrees it is $18 billion in debt. But it must also show that it negotiated with creditors in good faith and is not just trying to use this crisis to slip in the kind of cuts it has long wanted to do.

If Rhodes grants protection, the city would likely propose a reorganization plan shortly.

If he says no, Detroit would have to bargain with its creditors, a process that would likely set records for litigation.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 340,000, declining for a second straight week, the Labor Department said on Thursday.

The prior week's claims figure was revised to show 3,000 more applications received than previously reported.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected first-time applications to rise to 355,000.

The four-week moving average for new claims, a better measure of labor market trends, also fell 7,000 to 348,750 - the lowest level since March 2008 - pointing to some firming in underlying labor market conditions.

A Labor Department analyst said no states had been estimated and there were no special factors influencing the report.

The data has no bearing on February's employment report, due on Friday, as it falls outside the survey period.

According to a Reuters survey of economists, employers probably added 160,000 jobs to their payrolls last month, a small pick-up up from January's 157,000 count. That would just be enough to hold the jobless rate steady at 7.9 percent.

Economists say job gains of at least 250,000 per month over a sustained period are needed to significantly dent the ranks of the unemployed. Job growth averaged 200,000 in the last three months.

While layoffs have subsided, companies are not in a hurry to step up hiring as domestic demand remains lackluster.

Claims remain tucked in the low end of a 330,000 to 375,000 range for this year.

High unemployment prompted the Federal Reserve last year to launch an open-ended bond buying program. The U.S. central bank said it would keep up the program until there was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.

In testimony to Congress last week, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke signaled the central bank would press forward with plans to buy $85 billion in bonds per month.

The number of people still receiving benefits under regular state programs after an initial week of aid rose 3,000 to 3.1 million in the week ended February 23. The four-week moving average of so-called continuing claims was the lowest since July 2008.

Meanwhile, nonfarm productivity fell at its fastest pace in four years in the fourth quarter, but the decline was likely to be temporary as economic growth is expected to pick up after stalling in late 2012.

Productivity fell at a 1.9 percent annual rate, the weakest pace since the fourth quarter of 2008, the Labor Department said on Thursday. A month ago it estimated that productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, fell at a 2 percent pace.

It had increased at a 3.1 percent rate in the third quarter. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the decline productivity to be revised to a 1.6 percent rate.

The drop largely reflects a surge in hiring while output continued to expand at a slower pace. The economy added about 600,000 jobs the fourth quarter, but gross domestic product only grew at a 0.1 percent rate.

Growth is expected to accelerate in the first quarter, although the pace is not expected to be above 2 percent as the economy adjusts to tighter fiscal policy.

Unit labor costs - a gauge of the labor-related cost for any given unit of output - rose at a 4.6 percent rate in the fourth quarter rather than 4.5 percent, the report showed.

Labor costs were up only 2.1 percent from a year-ago, underscoring the lack of wage-related inflation pressures in the economy and helping to keep the door open to further monetary easing by the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy.

http://news.yahoo.com/senator-irs-pay-70m-employee-081309135.html,,[],Senator: IRS to pay $70M in employee bonuses,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service is about to pay $70 million in employee bonuses despite an Obama administration directive to cancel discretionary bonuses because of automatic spending cuts enacted this year, according to a GOP senator.

Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa says his office has learned that the IRS is executing an agreement with the employees' union on Wednesday to pay the bonuses. Grassley says the bonuses should be canceled under an April directive from the White House budget office.

The directive was written by Danny Werfel, a former budget official who has since been appointed acting IRS commissioner.

""The IRS always claims to be short on resources,"" Grassley said. ""But it appears to have $70 million for union bonuses. And it appears to be making an extra effort to give the bonuses despite opportunities to renegotiate with the union and federal instruction to cease discretionary bonuses during sequestration.""

The IRS said it is negotiating with the union over the matter but did not dispute Grassley's claim that the bonuses are imminent.

Office of Management and Budget ""guidance directs that agencies should not pay discretionary monetary awards at this time, unless legally required,"" IRS spokeswoman Michelle Eldridge said in a statement. ""IRS is under a legal obligation to comply with its collective bargaining agreement, which specifies the terms by which awards are paid to bargaining-unit employees.""

Eldridge, however, would not say whether the IRS believes it is contractually obligated to pay the bonuses.

""In accordance with OMB guidance, the IRS is actively engaged with NTEU on these matters in recognition of our current budgetary constraints,"" Eldridge said.

The National Treasury Employees Union did not respond to requests for comment.

The IRS has been under fire since last month, when IRS officials acknowledged that agents had improperly targeted conservative groups for additional scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status during the 2010 and 2012 elections. A few weeks later, the agency's inspector general issued a report documenting lavish employee conferences during the same time period.

Story continues

Three congressional committees and the Justice Department are investigating the targeting of conservative groups. And key Republicans in Congress are promising more scrutiny of the agency's budget, especially as it ramps up to play a major role in implementing the new health care law.

Much of the agency's top leadership has been replaced since the scandals broke. President Barack Obama forced the acting commissioner to resign and replaced him with Werfel, who used to work in the White House budget office.

In a letter to Werfel on Tuesday, Grassley said the IRS notified the employee union March 25 that it intended to reclaim about $75 million that had been set aside for discretionary employee bonuses. However, Grassley said, his office has learned that the IRS never followed up on the notice. Instead, Grassley said, the IRS negotiated a new agreement with the bargaining unit to pay about $70 million in employee bonuses.

Grassley's office said the information came from a ""person with knowledge of IRS budgetary procedures.""

""While the IRS may claim that these bonuses are legally required under the original bargaining unit agreement, that claim would allegedly be inaccurate,"" Grassley wrote. ""In fact, the original agreement allows for the re-appropriation of such award funding in the event of budgetary shortfall.""

Werfel wrote the directive on discretionary employee bonuses while he was still working in the White House budget office. The directive was part of the Obama administration's efforts to impose across-the-board spending cuts enacted by Congress.

The spending cuts, known as ""sequestration,"" are resulting in at least five unpaid furlough days this year for the IRS' 90,000 employees. On these days, the agency is closed and taxpayers cannot access many of the agency's assistance programs.

Werfel's April 4 memorandum ""directs that discretionary monetary awards should not be issued while sequestration is in place, unless issuance of such awards is legally required. Discretionary monetary awards include annual performance awards, group awards, and special act cash awards, which comprise a sizeable majority of awards and incentives provided by the federal government to employees.""

""Until further notice, agencies should not issue such monetary awards from sequestered accounts unless agency counsel determines the awards are legally required. Legal requirements include compliance with provisions in collective bargaining agreements governing awards.""

http://news.yahoo.com/house-votes-cut-food-stamps-2-billion-232659155.html,,[],House votes to cut food stamps by $2 billion,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The House voted on Wednesday to cut food stamps by $2 billion a year as part of a wide-ranging farm bill.

The chamber rejected 234-188 a Democratic amendment to the five-year, half-trillion-dollar farm legislation that would have maintained current spending on food stamps, now called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The overall bill cuts the $80 billion-a-year program by about 3 percent and makes it harder for some people to qualify.

The food stamp cuts have complicated passage of the bill and its farm-state supporters were working to secure votes Wednesday. Many conservatives have said the food stamp cuts do not go far enough since the program has doubled in cost in the last five years and now feeds 1 in 7 Americans. Liberals have argued against any reductions, contending the House plan could take as many as 2 million needy recipients off the rolls. The White House has threatened a veto over the food stamp cuts.

The amendment by Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., and other Democrats would have eliminated the SNAP cuts and taken the money from farm subsidies instead.

""It's too big, it's too harsh and it's going to hurt so many people,"" McGovern said of the food aid cuts.

Other amendments chipped away at the program. The House adopted by voice vote an amendment to require drug tests for SNAP recipients, angering Democrats who said the tests would be demeaning to people who apply for the food aid. Lawmakers also adopted by voice vote an amendment that would end a 2004 U.S.-Mexico agreement to educate Mexican-Americans about food stamps. More amendments are expected to try and scale back the program.

Also complicating passage is growing Republican opposition to farm subsidies, some of which are expanded under the bill. Republicans have proposed amendments that would cut back dairy and sugar supports that could turn lawmakers from certain regions of the country against the bill if they were to succeed.

Story continues

The House is scheduled to continue voting on 103 amendments to the bill Thursday with a vote on passage possibly next week. As of Wednesday, it was unclear if Republicans had enough votes.

In an effort to push the legislation through, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said last week that he would vote for it, while making it clear that he did not really like it. He said he wants to get the bill to House and Senate negotiators for a potential deal, and that passing the bill was better than doing nothing.

The legislation would cut around $4 billion a year in overall spending on farm and nutrition programs. The Senate passed its version of the farm bill last week, with about $2.4 billion a year in overall cuts and a $400 million annual decrease in the SNAP program - about a fifth of the amount of the House food stamp cuts.

Democratic leaders have said they will wait to see how the House votes on the many amendments, but have so far signaled opposition to the measure. Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California argued against the food stamp cuts on the floor Wednesday and was a ""likely no"" on the bill, according to an aide. No. 2 House Democrat Steny Hoyer of Maryland called the food stamp cuts ""irresponsible.""

The chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Rep. Frank Lucas, R-Okla., told colleagues that a robust farm policy was necessary to avoid farm crises like those in the 1930s and 1980s.

""I will work with all of you to improve this draft,"" he said Tuesday. ""I ask you to work with me.""

The legislation would achieve some of the food stamp cuts by partially eliminating what is called categorical eligibility, or giving people automatic food stamp benefits when they sign up for certain other programs. The bill would end a practice in some states of giving low-income people as little as $1 a year in home heating assistance, even when they don't have heating bills, in order to make them eligible for increased food stamp benefits.

Lucas said the cuts would still allow people who qualify to apply for food stamps, they just wouldn't automatically get them.

The Oklahoma Republican has called the overall legislation the ""most reform-minded bill in decades"" because it would make needed cuts to food stamps and eliminate $5 billion a year in direct payments, subsidies that are paid to farmers whether they grow or not. The bill would expand crop insurance and makes it easier for rice and peanut farmers to collect subsidies.

The bill also sets policy for international food aid abroad, which is currently shipped from U.S. farms. The House rejected an amendment to shift around half of international food aid money to more flexible accounts that allow for cash purchases abroad.

The Obama administration has proposed shifting the way the food aid is distributed, saying it would be more efficient to make purchases closer to conflict areas.

President Obama wants to tie spending cuts to tax revenue hikes in the debt ceiling talks, but that could mean trouble for the middle class taxpayers he has pledged to protect.

""They'll have to go down to where the real money is, which is the middle class,"" said Brian Gardner, Washington policy analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, an investment bank. ""Politically, that would be very tough.""

The White House and Congress just finished a bruising fiscal cliff battle that raises taxes on the rich by $618 billion over a decade. Next up is the debt ceiling debate and dealing with the sequester -- automatic spending cuts set to kick in by early March.

Republicans want any debt limit increases to be coupled with spending cuts. In return, Democrats are demanding more revenue, mentioning closing loopholes and corporate subsidies like the $38 billion given to the oil industry over 10 years.

But to bring in significant tax revenues, lawmakers would have to tap into some politically sensitive tax deductions, said Robert Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition.

""The problem with exempting the middle class from any pain is that it's hard to make the numbers work,"" Bixby said. ""Corporate tax loopholes are not as large as the ones for individuals.""

How to raise a trillion dollars

Tax exclusions and deductions total roughly $1.1 trillion a year, but less than 10% benefit corporations, according to the Tax Policy Center. That means most cuts to those benefits would hit individuals.

So who would pay? Further restricting itemized deductions and exclusions for the rich could be one way to bring in several hundred billion dollars over a decade, but there may not be enough there to raise enough revenue to balance out the spending cuts.

Eliminating several other major tax breaks could also bring in billions a year in savings for the government, but would amount to tax increases on the middle class people that benefit from them.

For example, the largest exclusion is the one for employer health insurance, which totals $164 billion for fiscal 2014, according to the Congressional Research Service. This one spares the 60% of Americans who have employer-sponsored coverage from paying taxes on the share of health insurance premiums paid for by their companies. Without the tax break, companies might offer less generous plans.

Related: Your taxes under the fiscal cliff deal

Another tax break that helps the middle class save for retirement is the one for employer-provided pensions, which allow companies to offer tax-deferred pensions and 401(k)s. But at a cost of nearly $163 billion in revenue, this one could also be a major target for savings.

And one of the most cherished middle-class tax breaks -- the mortgage interest deduction -- costs nearly $100 billion a year. Nearly 40% of filers claiming this deduction make between $50,000 and $100,000 a year.

But major reform of any kind still faces many obstacles. The Democrats won't have a lot of leverage to negotiate any tax increases going forward, experts said. The Republicans were more willing to bend during the fiscal cliff negotiations because they were facing a massive tax hike on everyone had the Bush tax cuts expired. Now, there's no such threat.

""The incentive to support major tax reform is gone,"" said George Yin, a law professor at the University of Virginia and former chief of staff at Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation."

Council approves ‘living wage’ bill over Wal-Mart ultimatum,"Opponents David Catania (left), Muriel Bowser and Tommy Wells confer as Vincent Orange (not pictured) defends the bill to force large retail stores to pay higher wages. Wal-Mart’s threat to withdraw three planned stores did not change any legislators’ minds. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)

D.C. lawmakers gave final approval Wednesday to a bill requiring some large retailers to pay their employees a 50 percent premium over the city’s minimum wage, a day after Wal-Mart warned that the law would jeopardize its plans in the city.

The retail giant had linked the future of at least three planned stores in the District to the proposal. But its ultimatum did not change any legislators’ minds. The 8 to 5 roll call matched the outcome of an earlier vote on the matter, taken before Wal-Mart’s warning.

“The question here is a living wage; it’s not whether Wal-Mart comes or stays,” said council member Vincent B. Orange (D-At Large), a lead backer of the legislation, who added that the city did not need to kowtow to threats. “We’re at a point where we don’t need retailers. Retailers need us.”

Whether or not Wal-Mart needs the District, it had spent the past three years wanting to enter the city in a way no other business had. Activists celebrated Wednesday’s vote, saying the company, which reported net income of $17 billion on sales of $470 billion in its most recent fiscal year, could afford to pay better wages. But the council action threatens to halt several developments anchored by Wal-Mart in neighborhoods long under­served.

“Nothing has changed from our perspective,” Wal-Mart spokesman Steven Restivo said in a statement after the vote, reiterating that the company will abandon plans for three unbuilt stores and “review the financial and legal implications” of not opening three others under construction.

The company’s strategy had to this point been calibrated to avoid political conflicts in a city of liberal sentiment, where the retailer’s earlier entreaties had been met with deep skepticism.

Well before it had any solid plans to open stores in the District, Wal-Mart joined the D.C. Chamber of Commerce and began making inroads with politicians, community groups and local charities that work on anti-hunger initiatives.

The campaign was matched with cash. Through its charitable foundation, Wal-Mart made $3.8 million in donations last year to city organizations including D.C. Central Kitchen and the Capitol Area Food Bank, according to a company spokesman. Meanwhile, it has kept a prominent local lobbyist, David W. Wilmot, on a $10,000-a-month retainer to smooth relations with elected officials.

The company has not disclosed what it has spent on plans and designs for its six D.C. stores, but development and retail experts say it is probably in the hundreds of thousands of dollars and possibly as high as $1 million per location. Some of the stores have undergone major design changes since they were first announced.

Should the bill be signed by Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) and pass a congressional review period, retailers with corporate sales of $1 billion or more and operating in spaces 75,000 square feet or larger would be required to pay employees no less than $12.50 an hour. The city’s minimum wage is $8.25, a dollar higher than the federal minimum wage.

The vote sets up a high-profile veto decision for Gray, who has supported Wal-Mart’s entry into the city, arguing that the company would bring badly needed jobs and retail stores to neighborhoods in need of both. The three stores that the company has pledged definitively not to pursue are all in the city’s eastern half, in areas largely devoid of quality retail.

Gray made a particular push to have Wal-Mart anchor a development at Skyland Town Center, a site along Alabama Avenue SE near the mayor’s home that has long been eyed by city leaders for renewal.

View Graphic D.C. lawmakers gave final approval Wednesday to a bill requiring certain large retailers to pay their employees a 50 percent premium over the city’s minimum wage, a day after Wal-Mart warned the law would jeopardize their plans in the city.

Gary D. Rappaport, the project’s developer, has said Wal-Mart’s withdrawal would put those plans on ice. “If there’s not a Wal-Mart at Skyland, then Skyland is not able to go forward at this time,” he said late Tuesday.

The mayor initially called Wal-Mart’s announcement of its ultimatum “immensely discouraging” and said much the same in a letter to council members delivered Wednesday morning. “It is clear that numerous issues remain unclear about the impact of the bill on the District’s current economic development renaissance,” he wrote.

Gray, who has met recently with Wal-Mart representatives, reiterated “serious concerns over the lost jobs and retail opportunities for District residents that the bill will cause,” in a statement released after the council vote.

Before this week, Wal-Mart had made statements opposing the bill but had not directly threatened to withdraw from its plans.

Seven years ago, when the retailer moved to open its first store in Chicago and the City Council there passed a similar “living-wage” measure, the company indicated then that the bill would cause it to scale back or entirely scrap its plans to open several stores, Mayor Richard M. Daley vetoed the bill, and the council failed to override it.

The debate over the living-wage bill has been highly pitched, echoing conflicts elsewhere in the country over similar measures targeting Wal-Mart and other “big box” retailers.

Several dozen pro-Wal-Mart protesters rallied on the front steps of the John A. Wilson Building on Wednesday, while inside a larger group of living-wage supporters walked from council office to council office hoping to pick up additional votes.

“If you allow a bully to bully you, it’s never going to end,” said the Rev. Graylan Hagler, the senior pastor of Plymouth Congregational United Church of Christ and a leader of pro-living-wage group Respect DC. “There will be something else. There will always be another agenda.”

Hagler and union supporters hailed what they called the council’s resolve in the face of Wal-Mart’s warning but acknowledged that fending off a mayoral veto could prove difficult. “We’ve got some work to do,” he said.

Council member Yvette M. Alexander (D-Ward 7) said the company’s threats were credible and constituted her “worst nightmare.” She moved unsuccessfully to table the bill Wednesday before voting against it.

“This legislation is a development killer,” she said. “This legislation is a jobs killer.”

Orange, early in the debate, said the “District has arrived” as a desirable place for major retailers to locate. But council member Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4), a mayoral candidate, said that was not true throughout the city. “When I go to Skyland, we have not arrived,” she said. “That project has been some 20 years in the waiting.”

Voting in favor of the bill were Orange, Chairman Phil Mendelson (D), David Grosso (I-At Large), Anita Bonds (D-At Large), Jim Graham (D-Ward 1), Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), Kenyan R. McDuffie (D-Ward 5) and Marion Barry (D-Ward 8). Voting against were Alexander, Bowser, David A. Catania (I-At Large), Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3) and Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6).

The Labor Department report, delayed 2 1/2 weeks because of the partial federal government shutdown, reflected an economy growing at a lackluster rate. The latest job gains matched the pace since the start of summer but came in below Wall Street’s forecast for an increase of about 175,000 jobs.

The disappointing growth is likely to reinforce the hesitance of Federal Reserve officials to begin a withdrawal of its monetary stimulus program. Fed policymakers are weighing a cutback in its $85-billion-a-month purchase of bonds, but officials have been waiting for stronger employment growth.

The economy added on average about 195,000 jobs a month in the first half of this year, but growth has slowed since then to about 143,000 a month, enough to keep up with population growth and new job entrants but much too slow to absorb at a satisfactory rate many of the 11.3 million officially unemployed or help the nearly 8 million part-time workers who want more hours.

The unemployment rate has been inching down this past summer, but that’s partly the result of workers dropping out of the labor force. The labor force did not shrink in September. The latest jobless figure is the lowest since November 2008 during the depths of the Great Recession,

Job growth in September was led by retail trade, transportation and warehousing, and temporary-help industries -- with each category adding more than 20,000 jobs. The construction sector added 20,000 jobs, its strongest gain since February. Manufacturing was flat, and the once-booming leisure sector, which includes hotels and restaurants, lost 13,000 jobs over the month.

Government payrolls rose by 22,000 in September, though federal employment shrank by 6,000.

The 16-day partial shutdown of government offices and facilities, which began Oct. 1, had no direct bearing on the September employment data, but surveys and anecdotal reports indicate that the uncertainty over the budget stalemate weighed on employers and possibly their hiring decisions last month.

The increase in temporary-help employment may signal a pickup in broader hiring to come. Another so-called leading indicator, the average hours worked in a week, showed no change in September at 34.5 hours. Average hourly earnings for all private employees rose a measly 3 cents from August, to $24.09 last month.

It will take some weeks if not months before analysts can fully assess the economic impact of the government shutdown, but most economists think the temporary closure of operations and furloughs of about 800,000 employees will shave half a percentage point off economic growth in the fourth quarter. That would most likely mean fourth-quarter growth of even less than the sluggish 2% average pace since the recovery began in mid-2009.

Some reading of the shutdown’s effect on employment can be made on Nov. 8, when the Labor Department’s jobs report for October will be released, one week later than had been scheduled.

But Alaska, a state known for its vast oil resources and pro-drilling politics, is being left in the dust of this new oil surge.

The state, with its 800-mile pipeline running from the North Slope to Valdez, has fallen to fourth among oil-producing states, now trailing Texas, North Dakota and California. It's not sitting well with many there.

""There's definitely a hit to the state pride,"" said Alaska Department of Natural Resources Commissioner Joe Balash. ""There's a certain amount of embarrassment that a place as over-regulated and over-taxed as California is eclipsing Alaska.""

Production in Alaska peaked in 1988 when companies sent 2.1 million barrels of oil per day down the pipeline. Declining ever since, last year production hit a low of 526,000 barrels per day.

Everyone agrees that part of the decline is due to the natural cycle of oil field drilling. Prudhoe Bay, on Alaska's North Slope, is still the largest oil field ever discovered in the U.S. But nearly 40 years of drilling has diminished the supply of easy-to-get oil.

To date, 16 billion barrels of oil have been squeezed out of the North Slope. But officials believe the end is far from over. It's estimated there's still 10 billion barrels of oil in the ground.

So why aren't the oil giants Conoco Phillips, BP and others going after it? Here's where the great Alaska debate begins.

Republicans blame a progressive production tax which has been a windfall for the state's general fund in recent years, but which some argue chased away new development.

""The state of Alaska put together a very unfavorable tax structure,"" said Sarah Erkmann, a spokeswoman for the Alaska Oil and Gas Association. ""For many years, Alaska was not an attractive place to do business.""

In 2008, when the price of Alaskan crude shot up $35, to $96 per barrel, oil companies paid a record $6.8 billion in production taxes. The revenue has allowed the state to go on a spending spree and put $5 billion in a reserve fund. It's also built the state's Permanent Fund to $45 billion. This year, the fund paid every Alaskan $900.

The state, though, is almost totally dependent on oil taxes. There is no income or sales tax. Oil revenue accounts for 85 percent of the state's general fund.

The Republican-controlled Legislature passed a massive tax cut that will cost the state about $500 million a year. GOP Gov. Sean Parnell says the revenue hit will be temporary and should turn around the oil production decline.

""This tax change will drive billions more in investment, create more opportunities for our citizens and for America too,"" said Parnell.

But opponents call it an expensive giveaway to oil companies. They point out that oil jobs were added, even during the high-tax years, and the companies are still making huge profits in Alaska.

""Keeping a fair oil tax on the books was part of building a strong Alaska,"" said Democratic State Sen. Hollis French. ""Our concern with [the bill] is that it was not tied to more oil company investment in the state.""

A citizens group gathered enough signatures to put a referendum on the ballot next year. Alaskans will be able to decide for themselves if the tax cut is a good gamble for the state or just accelerating the drop in oil revenue."
http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/30/news/economy/shutdown-wic/index.html,2013-09-30 00:00:00,['Steve Hargreaves'],"Shutdown threatens nutrition for mothers, children","The government shutdown could make it harder for millions of women and children to get the health care they need.

That's because one of the assistance programs most vulnerable to a government shutdown is one that provides supplemental nutrition for pregnant mothers and young children.

Known as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC, the program is designed to provide low-income pregnant women, new mothers and children up to the age of five with additional healthy food in an effort to stave off adverse health effects, learning disabilities and other complications stemming from premature births or childhood malnourishment.

""No additional federal funds would be available,"" to continue the program in the event of a shutdown, the United States Department of Agriculture, which runs WIC, said on its website. ""States may have some funds available ... to continue operations for a week or so, but states would likely be unable to sustain operations for a longer period.""

Share your story: Are you worried about losing your WIC benefits?

There are just under nine million women and children on the program, according to USDA. The average monthly benefit is about $45.

That often comes on top of about $135 a month in food stamp benefits. WIC benefits mandate the money can only be spent on an approved list of healthy foods.

Suspending the program is a terrible idea, said Rev. Douglas Greenaway, head of the National WIC Association, which represents the regional offices that administer the programs.

While a suspension would only be temporary, it would send the wrong message to mothers, and perhaps convincing some that it's not worth signing up for, he said.

Greenaway said the program actually saves taxpayers money.

It costs $20,000 per pound to bring a premature child up to normal weight, he said. All told, for every $1 spent the program saves $4.21 in medical costs, he said.

And that's not even counting the long-term benefits. Children who receive WIC supplements are better prepared to enter school than those from similar socioeconomic backgrounds not in the program, he said.

""We have members of Congress who don't think the government should be in this business, whose ideology is to shrink the size of the federal government,"" said Greenaway. ""But there are huge human and health care costs for failing to fund a program like this."""

Appearing to confirm widespread expectations that Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke is not seeking a third term, Obama said this weekend that he had not made a final decision on a nomination.

An announcement would come in “the next several months,” Obama said.

Bernanke’s second four-year term as chairman ends Jan. 31 and he has not indicated he wants to be reappointed.

“I’ve narrowed it down to some extraordinarily qualified candidates,” Obama said in a New York Times interview published Sunday. Whoever Obama nominates, even if it is Bernanke, the Senate must confirm the choice.

Quiz: How well do you understand the Fed stimulus?

Obama declined to say anything more about the candidates or confirm a report last week that former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers was the front-runner for the post.

Summers, who was Obama’s top economic advisor from 2009 to 2010, and Fed Vice Chair Janet L. Yellen, are the leading contenders to replace Bernanke, according to administration officials familiar with the deliberations but who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

In the interview, Obama explained his criteria for picking a new Fed chairman, one of the most important nominations he’ll make in his second term as president. Analysts began scouring the comments for clues about which way he might be leaning.

“What I’m looking for is somebody who understands the Fed has a dual mandate, that that’s not just lip service, that it is very important to keep inflation in check, to keep our dollar sound, and to ensure stability in the markets,” Obama said.

“But the idea is not just to promote those things in the abstract,” he continued. “The idea is to promote those things in service of the lives of ordinary Americans getting better.”

Obama went on to warn against the creation of new asset bubbles, such as the one in the housing market that led to the Great Recession and financial crisis.

“And when unemployment is still too high, and long-term unemployment is still too high, and there’s still weak demand in a lot of industries, I want a Fed chairman that can step back and look at that objectively and say, let’s make sure that we’re growing the economy, but let’s also keep an eye on inflation, and if it starts heating up, if the markets start frothing up, let’s make sure that we’re not creating new bubbles,” Obama said.

Obama’s emphasis on inflation could bode well for Summers. He is viewed as being more concerned about the effect of the Fed’s stimulus policies on prices than Yellen, who has been a strong ally of Bernanke in taking unprecedented steps to reduce unemployment.

But Obama also could have been making a case for Yellen in his praise of Bernanke in the interview.

“Ben Bernanke, by the way, has done a fine job as Fed chairman,” Obama said. “And when you look at Ben Bernanke’s testimony, not just last week but over the last couple of years, what he’s consistently said is right now, our priority needs to be growing the economy faster and strengthening incomes for ordinary Americans.”

Obama had a close relationship with Summers during his time in the White House. But the president is under pressure from many Democrats to choose Yellen, who would be the first woman ever to lead the Fed.

The budget office continues to say the federal government faces a long-range budget problem — mostly caused by the costs of an aging population — but its new forecast pushes the crunch point for that problem off into a considerably more distant future: well after the 2020 presidential election.

Advertisement

The deficit projection for this year — $642 billion — is almost 25% less than the deficit the budget office had forecast as recently as February. At the new level, the annual deficit would be back to where it was before President Obama took office. It would continue to fall for the rest of Obama’s tenure, the budget office now projects. By contrast, the deficit for fiscal year 2012 came in at just over $1 trillion.

Three major factors account for most of the long-term improvement: a better economy, a continued slowdown in the rate of medical inflation — which reduces the cost of Medicare and Medicaid — and higher taxes that Congress approved as part of the “fiscal cliff” deal in January, the budget office said.

In addition, the automatic budget cuts that took effect this spring have reduced spending in the short term. The government also will benefit this year from dividend payments it is getting from the two giant housing finance agencies bailed out during the financial crisis.

The federal government’s annual deficit this year amounts to about 7% of the gross domestic product. By 2015, the budget office forecasts, the deficit will fall to just over 2% of GDP, a level that most economists would consider relatively insignificant. At that point, the deficit would begin to climb slowly again, reaching about 3.5% of GDP by the end of the decade.

Advertisement

The report also forecasts that the federal debt will shrink relative to the size of the economy for the rest of Obama’s term. The budget office expects the debt to begin to rise slowly after 2018 as the effects of an aging population increase the cost of retirement programs.

The federal deficit is the gap between what the government spends each year and its revenue, mostly taxes. The government has run a deficit almost every year for the last half-century. The federal debt represents the accumulated money that the government borrows to cover that deficit.

Advertisement

The numbers have an important political impact. Republicans have pushed for big reductions in government programs this year, arguing that the country could face a debt crisis if spending is not curtailed. The Obama administration and congressional Democrats have argued that big new reductions have less urgency because the budget picture is already getting better. The new figures from the budget office, which both parties rely on as a nonpartisan arbiter, will probably give more impetus to the Democrats’ position.

The report also signaled that the next confrontation in Washington’s budget wars may not come until late fall. Republican leaders have planned to push for budget cuts when Congress next votes on raising the federal debt ceiling. Because the debt is now growing more slowly than expected, the deadline for that vote probably won’t come until October or November, the report says.

Underscoring the political dynamic, Republicans, who trumpeted news of higher deficits during Obama’s first term, fell largely silent in reaction to the new figures.

The office of House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) declined to comment. The House Budget Committee, chaired by Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), issued a short statement calling the report a “fresh reminder of Washington’s out-of-control spending” and noting that by decade’s end the federal government will collect $5 trillion in tax revenue.

Advertisement

Liberal Democrats, by contrast, said the new numbers showed that government spending was falling too fast and that the sharply lower deficits amounted to an austerity policy that is hurting economic growth.

“It would be nice if policymakers … recognized that we need less austerity now and more health savings [and revenue] later,” Jared Bernstein, a former administration economic advisor, noted on his blog. The deficit, he wrote, “is coming down too fast given the still weak economy.”

Advertisement

Other Washington deficit hawks reacted cautiously. Maya MacGuineas, head of the Campaign to Fix the Debt, issued a statement calling the updated numbers “a good sign” but added that the country still faced a “long-term fiscal imbalance.”

“We need to keep making steady improvements to keep the good news coming,” she said.

Advertisement

The revised outlook comes as congressional Republicans are trying to figure out a budget strategy that can unite their disparate factions.

In January, GOP leaders got a deal through the House to avert the so-called fiscal cliff, but only by relying on Democratic votes. Aides to the leadership admit that no consensus exists among their members about how to raise the debt ceiling and avoid a default by the government when the deadline hits.

Advertisement

The president maintains that the debt ceiling should be raised without any conditions attached. Republicans are expected to continue to insist upon some concessions — either new budget cuts or, perhaps, a commitment to reforming the federal tax code.

“We’re going to have a big conversation with our members … to talk about a way forward,” Boehner said last week. “Dealing with the long-term structural spending problem we have, frankly, is at the core of it. But we also know we can’t cut our way to prosperity. We need real economic growth.”

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) have been meeting with members to discuss options for a tax reform plan. Camp said last month that he expected a tax plan to pass the House but did not hazard a guess about whether agreement could be reached with the Democratic majority in the Senate.

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-njs-christie-together-again-mutual-aid-073313011.html,,[],"Obama, NJ's Christie together again in mutual aid","POINT PLEASANT BEACH, N.J. (AP) — President Barack Obama casually tossed a football as Gov. Chris Christie won a stuffed bear in an arcade Tuesday along a New Jersey boardwalk, signaling the famed Jersey Shore is back seven months after Hurricane Sandy bore down with force.

Obama, with a left-handed soft toss, went 0 for 5. Christie scored a hit on the first try, prompting a high-five from the president.

""That's because he's running for office,"" Obama joked, a nod to the Republican governor's re-election campaign and the perception that Obama's visit helps Christie in Democratic-leaning New Jersey.

The odd couple of politics, Christie and Obama found common cause in Point Pleasant Beach, where about half the boardwalk was destroyed in the storm. Christie held back as Obama, dodging rain in a blue rain jacket, worked a rope line, shaking hands with a crowd that gathered for his arrival.

The trip gives Obama a chance to showcase the widely praised Federal Emergency Management Agency at a time when attention has focused on the Internal Revenue Service and its targeting of conservative groups. The president also gets to draw attention to the kind of bipartisanship that has been harder to find in the nation's capital.

White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters traveling to New Jersey with Obama that the president believes Christie ""has done an excellent job in the efforts he's undertaken.""

For Christie, the president's appearance is yet another way to showcase his beloved Jersey Shore. The Republican governor has been touting it throughout the Memorial Day weekend as a destination point that is back in business, and he broke a Guinness world record Friday by cutting a 5.5-mile-long ceremonial ribbon that symbolically tied together some of the towns hardest-hit by Sandy. The state has a $25 million marketing campaign to highlight the shore's resurgence in time for the summer season.

Both men will reprise the remarkable bipartisan tableau they offered during Sandy's immediate aftermath, when Obama flew to New Jersey just days before the November election to witness the storm's wreckage. Politically, the visit plays well for both men. Christie, seeking re-election this year, will stand shoulder to shoulder with a president popular among Democrats in a Democratic-leaning state. And Obama, dueling with congressional Republicans on a number of fronts, gets to display common cause with a popular GOP stalwart. (Obama was not scheduled to meet with state Sen. Barbara Buono, Christie's likely Democratic opponent in the governor's race.)

Story continues

Christie, in an interview with NBC on Friday, played down the politics, even when asked whether ties to Obama could hurt him among conservatives if he were to seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.

""The fact of the matter is, he's the president of the United States, and he wants to come here and see the people of New Jersey,"" Christie said. ""I'm the governor. I'll be here to welcome him.""

To be sure, New Jersey is still rebuilding. Obama is visiting those regions that have been among the first to recover — Christie ranks the recovery of the state's famous boardwalks as an eight on a scale of 10 but concedes that in other parts of the state many homeowners are still rebuilding six months after the devastating superstorm struck. Overall, the storm caused $38 billion in damages in the state, and harmed or wrecked 360,000 homes or apartment units.

But the coastal recovery is a big potential boon for the state, where tourism is a nearly $40 billion industry.

For Obama, coming off a week that had the IRS in the crosshairs of a scandal, the trip also offers an opportunity to demonstrate the work of FEMA, whose response to disasters has been met with bipartisan praise.

Indeed, inside the White House, FEMA is perceived as an example of what's best about government. The agency, panned for its response under President George W. Bush to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, has made a turnaround under administrator Craig Fugate and has been commended for its work in disasters from the Joplin, Mo., tornado in 2011 to Sandy last year.

The visit also occurs as Congress is away for a Memorial Day break, a weeklong recess that likely will silence the daily attention lawmakers, particularly Republicans, had been paying to the IRS political upheaval as well as the ongoing debate about the fatal attacks at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, last year and an investigation of media leaks that has stirred opposition from the media and many lawmakers."

The IRS was summoned to a House oversight hearing to explain how it blew through $50 million on conferences between 2010 and 2012, including spending more than $4 million on a single California conference in 2010. For the agency's many critics, it compounded frustrations which had already mounted over the agency's targeting of conservative groups.

""Not only does the IRS take your money, not give you proper answers, but then when it comes to tens of millions of dollars, use it in a way that is, at best, maliciously self-indulgent,"" said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings, of Maryland, likewise slammed the agency, specifically for spending $50,000 on ""ridiculous"" training videos, one of which was a ""Star Trek"" parody. Cummings noted that's more than many families make in a year.

Inspector General J. Russell George ticked off a list of over-the-top expenses incurred at the 2010 conference in Anaheim. He said the agency spent $35,000 on planning trips, $64,000 on gifts and trinkets including squirting fish toys, and $135,000 on outside speakers.

Faris Fink, the head of the IRS division that staged the conference and was the deputy in 2010 when he attended, apologized on Thursday for the expenses.

He said the conference was held to help train agency managers, but acknowledged it was ""not the best use of taxpayer dollars.""

Fink has the distinction of playing Mr. Spock in a cheesy but slickly produced ""Star Trek"" video that IRS employees filmed for the conference.

Fink also stayed in a room that normally cost $1,499 a night, the IG report said. A total of 132 IRS officials received room upgrades at the conference. The tax agency paid a flat daily fee of $135 per hotel room, the report said, but the upgrades were part of a package deal that added to the overall cost of the conference.

The training conference in Anaheim was held for 2,609 managers in the IRS' small business and self-employed division.

At the conference, the commissioner of the division, Christopher Wagner, stayed in a presidential suite that normally cost $3,500 a night, according to the inspector general's report. Wagner became chief of the IRS office of appeals in 2011 and retired this year.

The agency has imposed strict regulations to prevent expensive conferences in the future. And on Wednesday, the new acting head of the agency placed two officials on administrative leave for accepting free food at a party in a private suite at the IRS conference in 2010.

Pending a review, the two officials could lose their jobs, the agency said.

""When I came to IRS, part of my job was to hold people accountable,"" acting IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a statement. ""There was clearly inappropriate behavior involved in this situation, and immediate action is needed.""

This advice comes as fast-food workers from 100 cities across the nation push for $15-an-hour pay, a far cry from the wages most earn, in a mass strike on Thursday.

The tipping guide from etiquette maven Emily Post on McDonald's website lists several high-ticket suggestions for givers during the holiday season, including ""a gift from your family (or one week's pay), plus a small gift from your child"" for an au pair, ""one day's pay"" for a housekeeper and ""cost of one cleaning"" for a pool cleaner.

The site also lists suggestions for dog walkers, massage therapists and personal fitness trainers.

In an email to CNBC, McDonald's spokeswoman Lisa McComb said: ""This is content provided by a third-party partner and quotes from one of the best-known etiquette gurus, Emily Post. We continue to review the resource and will ask the vendor to make changes as needed.""

In total, the tips add up to hundreds, if not more than a thousand dollars of gift suggestions for McDonald's workers, many of whom earn just above minimum wage. To be fair, though, the restaurant chain does advise employees, ""What you give, if anything at all, should be dictated by your relationship with the serviceperson, how often you utilize the services, and most importantly, your budget.""



These tips would be far out of the budget for many employees since on average, U.S. food-preparation and serving workers, including those in fast food, earn $9 an hour, according to May 2012 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The tone-deaf advice is the latest is a series of gaffes surrounding its employee resource site. Last month, McDonald's suggested employees get out of holiday season debt by returning unopened purchases. Earlier, it published a budget guide that included no money for heat and $20 a month for health care.

Update: The McDonald's tipping article appears to have been removed by mid-afternoon Thursday following CNBC's post.

A recent inspector general audit suggests a full-blown crackdown on fraud could save $222 million a year.

The amount appears relatively small considering the government pays out roughly $70 billion in annual food stamps benefits. But negotiators will likely consider every penny of potential savings as they try to bridge the gap between the GOP-led House’s proposed $40 billion cut and the Democrat-led Senate’s $4.5 billion cut.

Food stamps, officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, are part of the larger farm bill but are being dealt with through the House’s separate Nutrition Reform and Work Opportunity bill.

House Speaker John Boehner recently said the bill “strengthens one of our nation’s welfare programs for the neediest Americans … roots out waste, fraud and abuse, encourages able-bodied adults to find work and saves taxpayers more than $39 billion.”

Among the anti-fraud measures in the bill, also known as H.R. 3102, is one that requires states to get tough on households that repeatedly ask for replacement EBT cards, which have largely replaced food stamps or vouchers as the method by which Americans purchase food at stores.

Others focus on retail “trafficking” and provide funding for pilot programs that could potentially improve existing state-federal partnerships that “identify, investigate and reduce retailer fraud.”

Some question whether targeting fraud gives enough bang for the buck.

Kansas GOP Rep. Tim Huelskamp points out that fraud accounts for a small percentage of spending for the food stamp program. Enrollment has increased by 70 percent since 2007 to serve more than 44 million low-income Americans, according to the 2012 Agriculture Department Office of Inspector General report.

“The massive growth in food stamp spending has little to do with fraud, and much more to do with a poorly designed welfare program,” Huelskamp, who has a doctorate in agriculture policy, told FoxNews.com. “We need true reform that transforms food stamps from a way of life -- and targets help to the truly needy.”

Senate Democrats are asking the negotiators, or conferees, to reject the steeper House cuts, arguing Congress should not balance the federal budget “on the backs of the most vulnerable.”

New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, this week signed a letter along with 38 other chamber Democrats and independents urging the conferees to reject eligibility changes that would “prevent millions of children, seniors and families facing a constant struggle against hunger from accessing nutritious food.”

Aside from the cuts being considered on the Hill, recipients automatically had benefits cut starting Friday when funding increases included in President Obama’s 2009 stimulus law come to an end.

The office of Oklahoma Rep. Frank Lucas, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, declined to provide information about how much H.R. 3102 would save by cutting waste, fraud and abuse.

The projected potential savings from fraud-cutting is detailed in the inspector general report, which found $3.7 million in questionable monthly payouts across 10 states.

Much of the fraud involves the owners and/or employees of smaller, so-called convenience stores exchanging or trafficking SNAP benefits for cash, cigarettes, drugs and guns.

The $222 million figure was reached by multiplying the number by 12 to get an annual amount, then by five to get an estimate for all 50 states.

The audit found some of the recipients had “erroneous” Social Security numbers; were receiving duplicate benefits in the same state; getting benefits “simultaneously” from at least one other state; listed as “disqualified from getting benefits; were “potentially deceased” or using a dead person’s Social Security number to collect benefits.

Huelskamp is proposing requirements for “able-bodied adults to be productive” and to turn food stamps into a block grant, similar to the plan in House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan’s budget proposal.

“It’s time for wholesale reform that really helps people, instead of nibbling around the edge of long overdue reform,” he said."

That sat in the back of my mind as I pondered what that meant to the normal regular buyer - looking for a home. I thought about the statement in the news broadcast that the commercial investors were buying the houses so they could ""rent them out"" and then sell them later at a price higher than they purchased the property for.

An article posted noted the following items:



Large investment firms have spent billions of dollars over the last year buying homes in some of the nation’s most depressed markets. The influx has been so great, and the resulting price gains so big, that ordinary buyers are feeling squeezed out. Now, investment companies like the Blackstone Group have swooped in, buying thousands of houses Joe Cusumano, a real estate agent in Riverside County, Calif., said that in recent months 90 percent of his business had been for companies like Invitation Homes, a Blackstone subsidiary.

In fact, private equity alternative investment firm Blackstone Group LP (NYSE: BX) is now the nation's largest owner of single-family homes. Founding partner Stephen Schwarzman recently said the firm is spending $100 million a week buying homes.

In a wide-ranging conversation, Steve Schwarzman, Blackstone Group chairman & CEO, discusses his company's pledge to support innovation and weighs in on Dell's LBO, the private equity space, and the outlook on the market. ""Blackstone is now the largest owner of individual houses in the United States,"" Schwarzman told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" Monday, pointing to his company's $3 billion portfolio of residential real estate.

Fix the Debt financier Peter G. Peterson knows a thing or two about debt: he’s an expert at creating it. Peterson founded the private equity firm Blackstone Group in 1985 with Stephen Schwarzman (who compared raising taxes to “when Hitler invaded Poland”). Private equity firms don’t contribute much to the economy; they don’t make cars or milk the cows. Too frequently, they buy firms to loot them.

90% of his business!Where does that leave the typical homebuyer? With a 10% chance - cause these investment companies have an advantage in the market that typical homebuyers do not have.""ordinary buyers are feeling squeezed out"".$100 million - per week""the nation's largest owner of single-family homes.""Residential property - not owned by owner occupants - but controlled by Wall Street.The very Wall Streeters who don't care about anyone except themselves.And now they are buying up America's residential market.

The phenomena seems to be evolving into something that is really nasty for the typical home buyer and is a god send to the large investment companies - a kinda robo-d ponzi scheme type real estate market - controlled by the bankers and Wall Street.

What has morphed is a collusion between foreclosure bankers and real estate investment companies (and real estate agents) that leaves the typical home buyer - without the purchase they want - having been screwed by big business and the banks.

The bankers and the investment firms screwed the US during the housing bubble - that ended in a lot of people losing their homes.

Now the bankers and the investment firms are in collusion again to stop people from even being able to buy a home (more on that in a minute).

Flopping

In 'flopping,' a home is purchased by insiders at a steep discount, then immediately sold for a big profit.

"" at a steep discount""But the resale doesn't necessarily happen right away - they can and will buy the home and rent it out first and then boot the renters out when the market price of the house increases.

A realtor referred to this practice as

""It's just robbery,"" she says. ""And I don't know how to stop the robbery.""

When she asked the listing agent why, she was told to ""leave it alone.""

This after clients of hers made an offer higher than the asking price and lost the purchase - BUT the house sold for WAY less to an investor - $40,000 less than her clients had offered.""leave it alone.""We can't afford to do that!

This is literally stealing - but they very seldom get caught or prosecuted.

Which is becoming the norm for big banks and Wall Street.

Let's look at it again from another perspective:

flopping involves selling an asset at less than market price (to a friendly party, of course) and then reselling it to market

Now, of course, we have to pay the price. A study released this spring by CoreLogic, a market research firm, estimates the cost of flopping will exceed $375 million this year, up 20 percent from 2010.

""less than market price (to a friendly party, of course)""Of courseBoth of those articles focused on short sales - but as I said earlier - this type of dealing may have evolved into something much more expansive.

And it's no longer limited to just a few cities - or depressed properties.

And it's not just about resale.

From an article in the Charlotte Observer - Charlotte’s Wall Street landlords move quickly to evict renters

Combined, their purchases have made Charlotte the second-busiest market in the country among single-family home investors. Over the summer, one in every five Charlotte-area homes sold was bought by an investment group.

""It's abuse what these companies are doing around Charlotte,"" she said. ""They only want the money, and that's it.""

""They have investors who want to see a rate of return,"" Gosser said.

One in five!It is all about corporate greed.Wall Street - buying up the residential market at bargain prices to turn it around and sell it at a higher price - either right away - or after they have rented it out.

Some might call this just plain old capitalism.

But when the market is rigged so that Wall Street and the Big Banks are the winners - it's not capitalism - it's cronyism.

This wall street/big bank practice does affect people who are the typical homebuyer - trying to buy a home in today's market.

Now the typical homebuyer not only has to compete with other typical homebuyers for a property, but they have to deal with an insider collusion of bankers and investment firms that have now turned residential properties for corporate profit - again.

Lets look at what this looks like based on the true experience of a typical homebuyer I know:

This was the third time that this is happened to me - but, it is the first time that I have pushed my realtor to take it to what is now the final, predictable conclusion. Every day, repeat every day - I keep 3 realty webpages open - I check them >>every 15 minutes<< for new listings or new price changes. I have been doing this now for three months. I am currently renting a room from a friend, as I have not been able to purchase a new home yet. I would venture that no one in the Metro area is following the real estate market as closely as I am - except investors. The problem I have encountered is:

A property listing will post with a dramatic change in the asking price.

I will immediately contact my realtor and tell him I want to see the property.

The first two times this happened - my realtor called me back and told me he had spoke to the listing realtor and they already had multiple offers (usually less than 1/2 hr after the price change posted on the web page, less than 1/2 hour). The first two times I let it go and did not pursue it. Yesterday - the same thing happened. A property posted with a >50% reduction in price< . I immediately contacted my realtor and told him I wanted to see the property. Fifteen minutes later he sent me this email ""I spoke with the agent and the price is correct. He has already received an offer."" Fifteen minutes - to an OFFER! This time - I pushed back, telling my realtor that the listing agent can entertain more than one offer, and I want to see the property as soon as possible. We inspected the property 3 hours later, I made a FULL PRICE OFFER-CASH, and told my realtor that I was willing to increase my offering price. Within hours, I received a call from my realtor telling me that the listing agent had received multiple offers and I would not be getting the house. I was not given the option to counter any offer the listing agent had - I was just told I wouldn't be getting the house. I am convinced that the property was already committed to another buyer >at a 50% discount< before I even set foot on the property. They had no intention of selling this home to anyone but an investment company. Someone got a hell of a deal, 50% off - and I'll bet it wasn't a citizen, it was a corporation.

""It's just robbery,"" she says. ""And I don't know how to stop the robbery.""

""It's abuse what these companies are doing around Charlotte,"" she said. ""They only want the money, and that's it.""

""They have investors who want to see a rate of return,"" Gosser said.

""They have investors who want to see a rate of return,"" Gosser said.

Someone got a hell of a deal, 50% off - it was probably a corporation.""leave it alone.""It is all about corporate greed.The collusion of bankers and investment firms- stealing what's left of the American Dream.Because"

After the Labor Department announced that a mass exodus of 663,000 workers left the U.S. workforce last month and that job creation fell 112,000 jobs short of projections, Obama’s top economic adviser Alan B. Krueger, took to the White House blog to blame the sequester:

It is important to bear in mind that the March household and payroll surveys are the first monthly surveys to look at employment since the beginning of sequestration. While the recovery was gaining traction before sequestration took effect, these arbitrary and unnecessary cuts to government services will be a headwind in the months to come, and will cut key investments in the Nation’s future competitiveness. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the sequester will reduce employment by 750,000 full-time equivalent jobs by the end of the year. Now is not the time for Washington to impose more self-inflicted wounds on the economy. The administration continues to urge Congress to replace the sequester with balanced deficit reduction, while working to put in place measures to put more Americans back to work like rebuilding our roads and bridges and promoting American manufacturing.

Krueger did not mention January’s 2% payroll tax increase, which will wipe out an entire year’s worth of wage gains by American workers. Roughly 70% of national expenditures emanate from consumers.

Kathy Bostjancic, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis for The Conference Board business research group, says the major flaw in Obama’s argument is that the sequester has not kicked in yet.

“What is even more troubling about the most recent slowdown is that it takes place even before the sequester cuts materially hit the economy,” Bostjancic stated in a press release. “This reinforces our view that the estimated 3.5 percent real GDP growth in Q1 is not likely to be sustained. Instead, we see the overall economy, led by the consumer, downshifting significantly in the second quarter, struggling to get close to 1 percent real growth.”

The need to curb Washington’s spending will have an effect on jobs, says Bostjancich, but they will likely be centered around “further contraction in government sector jobs.”

Indeed, the unemployment rate for government workers is less than half (3.6%) the national unemployment rate. Since July, the government has added 618,000 government workers to its payrolls, employing 20,633,000 individuals.

While Friday’s reporting shows a 7.6% unemployment rate, the real rate–including the millions who have given up hope and quit looking for work, are in part-time positions and needing full-time work, etc.–is closer to 15%, says billionaire former Obama supporter Mort Zuckerman. Worse, says Zuckerman, “Multiple job-holders are up by 340,000 to 7.26 million. In essence then, all of the ‘new’ positions are going to people who already are working, mostly part-time.”

To be sure, the need to slam the brakes on Washington’s reckless spending will likely shed jobs, and possibly the 100,000 to 300,000 economists project. But the 90,000,000 Americans who no longer work as of last month have myriad other factors to blame than a cut the equivalent of 0.5% of the national debt that has yet to go into effect."
http://news.yahoo.com/republicans-consider-short-term-u-debt-ceiling-increase-025328353--business.html,,[],Republicans offer plan to postpone any U.S. default,"By Richard Cowan and Thomas Ferraro WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the House of Representatives offered a plan on Thursday that would postpone a possible U.S. default, signaling new willingness to end a standoff that has shuttered large parts of the government and thrown America's future creditworthiness into question. Ahead of an afternoon meeting with President Barack Obama, House Republican leaders floated a measure to extend the government's borrowing authority for several weeks that appeared to be free of the restrictions on healthcare and spending that prompted the crisis. Their plan would not reopen the government, as Obama has insisted, but Republican leaders said they would seek a way to do so at the meeting, which is scheduled for 4:35 p.m. (2035 GMT). The White House said it would consider the offer. For the first time since the government shutdown began 10 days ago, senior lawmakers from both parties predicted they would be able to resolve their differences in a way that would allow both sides to claim victory. Outside conservative groups like Heritage Action and the Club for Growth, who have pressed Republicans to resist compromise, said they would not punish those who voted for the new plan. ""It's all going to work out,"" said Republican Representative John Mica of Florida. Investors seemed to be heartened by the developments. U.S. stocks indexes closed up 2 percent on Thursday. The dollar hit a 2-week high against major currencies and benchmark crude oil had its biggest gain in 6 weeks. The proposal is a significant shift for Republicans, who had hoped to use the disruption to undermine Obama's signature healthcare law and win further spending cuts. Those goals remain, but the Republican offer would at least push off the threat of default from October 17 until possibly the middle or end of November. One potential complication: the plan would prevent the Treasury Department from shifting funds around to postpone the day of reckoning further. The White House cautiously welcomed the offer, but reiterated that Congress must first reopen the government before budget talks can begin. ""The president is happy that cooler heads at least seem to be prevailing in the House,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters. Carney also cautioned that the White House has yet to see details of the Republican proposal. Many rank-and-file Republicans also appeared to be skeptical of Boehner's plan. Boehner's grip over his troops has been tenuous this year and many of the chamber's most conservative lawmakers have defied him repeatedly on other crucial votes. REBELLIOUS MEMBERS Boehner has taken pains to show his party's most rebellious members that he listens to their concerns. He took a different approach on Thursday, said those in the room. ""He put his best Coach Boehner voice and demeanor on and said, 'Guys, this is what we are going to do. The play has been called. I'm happy to answer questions,'"" said Republican Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma. Other Republicans left the meeting grim-faced and refused to speak with reporters. The Obama administration says it will be unable to pay all of its bills if Congress does not raise the $16.7 trillion debt ceiling by October 17. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said he would be unable to prioritize some payments over others among the 30 million transactions his department handles each week. ""It would be chaos,"" Lew told the Senate Finance Committee. The Republican plan would postpone that day of reckoning by several weeks. That would give them more time to seek spending cuts, a repeal of a medical-device tax, or other measures they say are needed to keep the national debt at a manageable level. ""It's better to negotiate and try and reach a solution than try to just win an all-out victory. That's not the way this place should work,"" said Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona. Democrats have called for a debt-ceiling hike that would extend government borrowing authority for more than a year. Still, they did not entirely dismiss the plan. ""Let's see what they have offered,"" House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said. The House could vote on the measure as early as Thursday, though the timing remained unclear. House leaders canceled a planned recess and said they would remain in Washington next week to keep working on the problem. Opinion polls indicate that Republicans appear to be getting more of the blame for the standoff. The Republican Party's approval rating now stands at a record low of 28 percent, according to Gallup, down 10 points from pre-shutdown levels. The Democratic Party's approval rating has dipped slightly to 43 percent. Business groups that have close ties to the Republican Party have also pressed for an end to the brinkmanship and some are laying plans to mount primary challenges next year to lawmakers who refuse to raise the debt ceiling. The Republican offer would do nothing to resolve conservative objections to Obama's healthcare reform law, the Affordable Care Act, which prompted the October 1 shutdown as Republicans pushed to delay or defund the law. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees have been out of work since then and individual businesses, from arms makers to motels, have begun to lay off workers as well. The Labor Department said on Thursday that 15,000 private-sector workers have filed for unemployment benefits due to the shutdown. House Republicans have passed bills that would reopen portions of the government and otherwise ease the pain of the shutdown, but they still hope to tie a full restoration of government funding to conditions that would undercut ""Obamacare,"" as it is popularly known. The latest offer could complicate efforts to reopen the government, as conservatives may feel emboldened to dig in their heels further in return for extending the debt ceiling. House Republicans offered their plan after Heritage Action, said it would not oppose a short-term increase in the debt limit. Heritage Action said, however, it wants House Republicans to return the focus of the fight over the government shutdown to demands for a rollback in Obamacare.

Bowles and Simpson were the co-chairmen of President Obama's bipartisan fiscal commission in 2010, and their recommendations came to serve as a yardstick for other debt-reduction proposals.

Since the fiscal commission disbanded, Congress and the White House have enacted about $2.7 trillion worth of savings that will occur over the next decade.

The $2.4 trillion in deficit cuts in the new Bowles-Simpson proposal would be made between 2014 and 2023 and come on top of the $2.7 trillion already passed.

Another $2.4 trillion is needed to stabilize the debt and put it on a path to fall below 70% of GDP, according to estimates by the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

Related: What you need to know about the sequester

The amount of debt reduction recommended by Bowles and Simpson is a more ambitious goal than President Obama has set.

Obama is aiming for another $1.5 trillion in savings, which would stabilize the debt at 73% of GDP by the end of the decade. And it's a less stringent, more gradual approach than the stated House Republican goal of erasing all annual deficits by 2023.

In any case, they characterize their new recommendation not as the ""best"" or the ""right"" framework. They said they see it simply as the ""minimum that policymakers must do.""

Bowles and Simpson suggest the $2.4 trillion in savings could be achieved through a combination of measures, some of which were in their original fiscal commission 2010 plan:

Taxes: Enacting tax reform that eliminates or minimizes tax expenditures. The revenue raised would be used to reduce deficits and to pay for the cost of lowering tax rates and simplifying the tax code. The new framework calls for tax reform to raise about one-quarter of the $2.4 trillion -- or $600 billion.

Medicare: Reducing Medicare and Medicaid spending by cutting payments to health care providers, changing incentives for providers and beneficiaries, and increasing premiums for high earners, among other changes. Bowles and Simpson say Medicare changes should account for another $600 billion.

Inflation-adjusted payments: Adopting a less generous and some say more accurate inflation formula, known as ""chained CPI,"" for any federal payments that are adjusted for cost of living, such as Social Security benefits. Chained CPI would also apply to inflation adjustments for income tax brackets.

Other measures: Curb farm subsidies and increase how much civilian and military personnel contribute to their health and retirement plans.

The framework calls for half of the $2.4 trillion to be raised through these savings, combined with stricter limits on discretionary spending, along with chained CPI and interest savings.

In addition, the new Bowles-Simpson framework calls for lawmakers to go beyond that $2.4 trillion for the long-term. Among other things, they recommend Congress agree to Social Security reforms this year and earmark future savings for the program.

The Bowles-Simpson recommendations are bound to draw vehement opposition.

Many Democrats oppose changes to entitlement programs unless they only affect the wealthy. And many Republicans refuse to consider raising any new revenue for deficit reduction through tax reform.

Bowles and Simpson plan to release more detailed recommendations at some point in coming weeks to flesh out their framework after consulting with members of Congress.

Since their work on the fiscal commission, they have been trying to coax lawmakers to negotiate a ""grand bargain.""

Most recently Bowles and Simpson co-founded the Campaign to Fix the Debt, a nonpartisan group advocating for debt-reduction. The campaign has a bipartisan steering committee made up of former politicians, deficit hawks and business people, and a CEO council that has drawn fire mostly from the left, but also from some business groups for its call for more revenue."

Can a flurry of presidential schmoozing change Washington from a bitterly polarized battlefield into a haven of bipartisan cooperation? Don’t hold your breath.

“We’re very far apart,” an Obama aide told me Tuesday, stating the obvious in the wake of the budget proposal from fiscal hawk Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.). The GOP wish list includes deep cuts in healthcare, education and defense spending, but no tax increases. The Democratic budget, expected this week, includes more modest spending cuts and almost $1 trillion in tax increases.

So why the charm offensive? The president’s yen for the pleasure of Congress’ company is the byproduct of an important change: Both sides in the fight are older, sadder and wiser.

That alone could mean that a “grand bargain” over spending and taxes is more possible this year than any time since 2010.

Republicans have finally noticed that they lost the presidential election (including Ryan, who was their choice for vice president) and that most voters didn’t choose their severely conservative policies. At best, Ryan noted in his budget announcement, the voters opted for “divided government. So this year, we have to make it work.”

Democrats have suffered a comeuppance too: Voters didn’t rise up in anger against the automatic “sequester” of government spending that kicked in March 1, as liberals hoped they would. That may be because most of the sequester’s effects haven’t been felt, but the short-term result was to make Obama and his party look silly — and, more important, to knock some points off the president’s popularity.

There’s been gradual movement toward the center on the substance of the budget as well as the politics. Republicans still oppose tax increases, but some senators have acknowledged that they’ll have to accept revenue increases to make a deal. And Obama has been more explicit than before about his willingness to cut future spending on Medicare and Social Security, bitter pills for liberals. The more often the president repeats that message to Democrats, the more skeptical Republicans believe he might mean it.

Finally, leaders on both sides know how to get to an agreement — or, more precisely, how not to get there — because they’ve tried so many routes before.

The short answer: Negotiations between Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) won’t work; that method failed miserably in 2011. Negotiations with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) produced a short-term deal in 2012 but probably won’t work now because McConnell, who faces a potential GOP primary challenge next year, has been adamant in his opposition to new taxes.

That leaves only this way forward: a bipartisan negotiation among senators who want to negotiate, like the “Gang of Six” who produced a budget compromise in 2011 (a deal, it must be noted, that led nowhere at the time).

“The only way we’ve been able to get anything done over the last two years is when the Senate passes something on a bipartisan basis and sends it to the House,” the Obama aide noted. Only then has Boehner allowed his House GOP majority to divide and contribute to passing legislation. Once some senators compromise, the cost of obstruction in the House increases.

That’s why Obama kicked off his charm offensive with senators — and not just any senators but Republicans who were already interested in seeing whether a deal is possible, including some fiscal moderates (Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire) and influential fiscal hawks (Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma). If it didn’t change the landscape, it may have detoxified the air.

“I think the president’s tremendously sincere. I don’t think this is just a political change in tactic,” Coburn said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “I think he actually would like to solve the problems of the country…. He’s moving in the right direction. I’m proud of him for doing it.” When was the last time you heard a Republican say something like that about Obama?

Obama needs the vote of confidence. After the failure of his negotiations to avert the sequester, three recent polls showed him in negative territory, with more voters disapproving than approving. Obama blames Republicans for the impasse, but no president ever wins by appearing powerless.

On top of that, Obama is hoping to pass new legislation on immigration and gun control. ""[If] we can build these bonds of trust, that will be useful on these other issues,” the Obama aide told me, even if a budget deal remains out of reach.

And despite Coburn’s disclaimer, there’s the ultimate political calculation: Who will voters blame?

“There’s a tendency to say, whenever agreement isn’t reached, that it’s both sides’ fault,” the aide said. “If we reach out and we put entitlements on the table and are serious about it, and the Republicans still can’t get to ‘yes,’ there is no other answer left other than Republicans just can’t get to ‘yes.’”

So don’t get too romantic about all the wining and dining in Washington. It won’t mean an end to the battles; it’s more a cease-fire while both sides warily regroup. But it’s better than nothing, and a lot better than everyone going home hungry.

Obama will announce Sylvia Mathews Burwell%27s nomination on Monday

Burwell runs the Walmart Foundation%2C the retail giant%27s philanthropic wing

Burwell has been credited with plans in the 1990s that led to a budget surplus

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Obama on Monday will nominate Walmart's Sylvia Mathews Burwell as his next budget director, a senior administration official said.

If confirmed by the Senate, Burwell would take the helm at the Office of Management and Budget at a time of heated budget battles between the White House and congressional Republicans. She would also bring more diversity to Obama's second-term Cabinet following criticism that many top jobs were going to white men.

The president will announce Burwell's nomination during a White House ceremony Monday morning, said the official, who requested anonymity in order to confirm the nomination ahead of Obama.

Burwell is a Washington veteran, having served as OMB's deputy director in the Clinton administration and chief of staff to former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. Burwell currently runs the Walmart Foundation, the retail giant's philanthropic wing, and previously served as president of the Gates Foundation's Global Development Program.

The official credited Burwell with being a principal architect of a series of budget plans in the 1990s that led to a budget surplus.

Burwell's nomination signals that the White House is trying to get back to normal business after the president and Congress failed to avert $85 billion in automatic spending cuts that took effect Friday. While the president has warned of dire consequences for the economy as a result of the cuts, the White House does not want to the standoff with Congress to keep the president from focusing on other second-term priorities, including filling out his Cabinet and pursuing stricter gun laws and an overhaul of the nation's immigration system.

Obama made quick work of filling key national security openings in his administration, but has been slower to fill other Cabinet openings, including the OMB post. Vacancies also remain at the Environmental Protection Agency, the Commerce and Energy Departments, and the U.S. trade representative.

Burwell would replace acting OMB director Jeffrey Zients, a well-liked figure in the Obama administration, who has been discussed as a contender for other top jobs."

Under federal law, the President is required to submit his budget blueprint to Congress no later than the first Monday in February. President Obama has met that deadline only once.

When asked at a press briefing Friday, White House deputy press secretary Josh Earnest wouldn’t confirm the budget’s release. “I don’t have a budget date to announce to you,” he said. It is telling that the White House didn’t inform Congress of the delay, but left the task to budget staff at the Pentagon.

A major part of a President’s job is to manage the Executive Branch and its numerous federal agencies. The President’s budget proposal is the Administration’s estimation of the resources it will need to meet its mission and priorities for the coming year. Historically, the President submits his budget before Congress gets to work on a final spending plan.

This year, however, House and Senate Budget authors will unveil their spending plans weeks ahead of President Obama. Like many other legislative deliberations, Obama will be on the sidelines.

Senate Budget Committee Ranking Member Sen. Jeff Sessions blasted the delay. “He will be submitting it after the House and Senate have produced a budget proposal and adjourned for Easter. So while the President speaks of his deep concern for American workers and families, he fails to even submit to Congress his financial plan to help those workers and families.”

Since Obama took office, the government has mostly been on auto-pilot. Senate Democrats have refused for the past four years to even bring a budget plan to the floor for a vote. This inaction has caused the government to run on a series of “continuing resolutions”, which simply extend all current spending, with modest increases, for a set period of time.

As a result, there have been no real talks about prioritizing spending nor reducing or eliminating ineffective programs. It has allowed Obama and the Democrats to give lip-service to the need to cut spending, without having to provide any specific recommendations. It’s budgetary shadow-boxing.

Obama is simply uninterested in the day-to-day workload required to successfully manage the federal government. He can’t even be bothered when federal law requires that he “show his work” to the nation.

A further 850,000 will be denied benefits in the first quarter of 2014.

Congressional Democrats and the White House, pointing to the sluggish recovery and the still-high jobless rate, are pushing once again to extend the period covered by the unemployment insurance program. But with Congress still far from a budget deal and still struggling to find alternatives to the $1 trillion in long-term cuts known as sequestration, lawmakers say the chances of an extension before Congress adjourns in two weeks are slim.

As a result, one of the largest stimulus measures passed during the recession is likely to come to an end, and jobless workers in many states are likely to receive considerably fewer weeks of benefits.

In all, as many as 4.8 million people could be affected by expiring unemployment benefits through 2014, estimated Gene Sperling, President Obama’s top economic adviser."

The rating agency's move eased the threat of a cut to the world's biggest economy.

Moody's said the federal government's debt trajectory is on track with criteria the rating agency previously laid out, even without further budget measures from Washington.

The economy is growing moderately, but it is still ""progressing at a faster rate compared with several Aaa peers and has demonstrated a degree of resilience to major reductions in the growth of government spending,"" Moody's said in a statement.

The U.S. budget outlook has brightened in recent months, alleviating some of the pressure on policymakers for more fiscal compromises.

On May 14, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said the U.S. federal budget deficit is shrinking at a faster pace than expected, and forecast this fiscal year would end with the smallest shortfall since 2008.

""We feel that we have enough information on the debt trajectory at this point to make a conclusion even without information on any possible further actions in Washington,"" said Steven Hess, Moody's lead U.S. sovereign credit analyst.

Even the possibility of further debate on raising the U.S. debt ceiling this year - allowing the government to keep borrowing money - is unlikely to hurt the rating, Hess said.

""We think that they will raise the debt ceiling, as they always have in the past,"" he said. ""But even if there's some delay, we're not too concerned about that affecting the government's ability to service its debt.""

Analysts said the affirmation means the U.S. sovereign rating could be safer now for years to come.

""We are still running sizable deficits but they are not getting worse,"" said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.

""Barring a nuclear event or the re-emergence of the debt ceiling problem, this drastically reduces the chance of a U.S. downgrade in the next couple of years,"" he added.

Last month Fitch also affirmed the U.S. sovereign AAA rating. But that agency kept a negative outlook, saying still-elevated debt levels leave the country vulnerable to shocks without more deficit reduction.

Standard & Poor's rates the country AA-plus, with a stable outlook. S&P cut the rating in August 2011 after a bruising round of debt ceiling debates in Washington raised fears of political dysfunction.

In addition, Moody's affirmed the Aaa senior ratings of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Farm Credit Banks, which the agency considers to be directly linked to the rating of the U.S. government.

While the stable outlook means the agency is unlikely to cut the U.S. sovereign rating in the medium term, Moody's noted that could change in the future.

""Without further fiscal consolidation efforts, government deficits are anticipated to increase once again over the longer term,"" the Moody's statement said.

The outlook covers the next couple years or so, Hess said. After that, he added, ""a triple-A rating is not guaranteed forever.""

There has been a slight uptick in population. But a crushing problem lurks beneath the signs of economic recovery in Chicago: one of the most poorly funded pension systems among the nation’s major cities. Its plight threatens to upend the finances of President Obama’s hometown, now run by his former chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel.

The pension fund for retired Chicago teachers stands at risk of collapse. The city’s four funds for other retired city workers are short by $19.5 billion. At least one of the funds is in peril of running out of money in less than a decade. And starting in 2015, the city will be required by the state to make far larger contributions to the funds, which could leave it hundreds of millions of dollars in the red — as much as it would cost to pay 4,300 police officers to patrol the streets for a year.

“This is kind of the dark cloud that’s coming ever closer,” Mr. Emanuel said in a recent interview, adding that he had no intention of raising his city’s property taxes by as much as 150 percent — the price tag, he says, that it might take to pay such bills. “That’s unacceptable.”

Illinois lawmakers, who make key financing and benefit choices for Chicago’s pension system, have wrestled for months without agreement on the politically troublesome matter of cutting the benefits of public sector retirees to save money. And last month, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded Chicago’s rating by an unexpected three notches as part of a broad reassessment of how pensions are affecting the financial strength of cities. That “super downgrade,” in the parlance of the bond market, left Chicago, the nation’s third-largest city, with a lower rating than 90 percent of Moody’s public finance ratings."

Now, under pressure from falling poll numbers and angry business supporters, they are seeking a compromise on the debt ceiling. Yet for now, they are still refusing to finance and reopen the government without some concessions.

Mr. Boehner and his colleagues left the White House without speaking to waiting reporters, and quickly gathered in his Capitol suite for further discussion. Their debt limit proposal could come to a vote as soon as Friday.

Before the White House meeting, administration and Congressional Democrats said they were skeptical that House Republican leaders could pass the proposal. A large faction of Tea Party conservatives campaigned on promises never to vote to increase the nation’s debt limit. And Congressional Democrats vowed to oppose any proposal that did not also fully finance a government now shuttered since the fiscal year began Oct. 1.

“We’ll see what they’re able to pass,” said Mr. Obama’s press secretary, Jay Carney.

Senate Democrats had their own White House meeting with Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. three hours before the House Republicans arrived, and the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, declined to embrace the Republicans’ debt limit proposal until he saw it. He told reporters that Democrats would not negotiate on further deficit reductions until House Republicans agreed to the measure passed by the Senate to finance and open the government through mid-November.

“Not going to happen,” Mr. Reid said. “Open the government,” he added. “There is so much pain and suffering out there. It is really tear-jerking, to say the least.”

Separately, members of the Senate’s Republican minority, who are to meet with Mr. Obama on Friday, worked on a proposal for full-year government funding — at levels reflecting the across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration, but giving agencies flexibility to shift money around. They are considering adding it to any short-term debt limit increase that the House might pass and send to the Senate."

(CNN) —

When the U.S. economy collapsed, millions of us lost our homes, our jobs, our retirement savings and our faith in the American dream. What we gained was a very clear view of the vast – and growing – divide between the rich and the rest of us.

Like many hardworking Americans earning minimum wage, Margaret Lewis knows firsthand what it’s like to live on the edge. She works as a transporter for passengers with disabilities at O’Hare International Airport. She wakes up at 1 a.m. to go to work, and spends the early morning hours pushing wheelchairs to gates and helping travelers on and off planes.

With tips, and Illinois’ minimum wage – which is $1 above the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour – Margaret makes about $18,000 a year, or $10,000 below the federal poverty limit for a household of five.

Margaret lives with her four school-age children in a three-bedroom apartment on Chicago’s South Side. Two recent shootings on her block make her fear for her children’s safety, but she cannot afford to move. Margaret is unable to pay the $850 per month rent, so she and her family perform janitorial tasks for the landlord to make ends meet. The children’s clothing is all secondhand, Margaret uses food stamps to make sure everyone is fed and when it is time to buy shoes for school, she has to save an entire paycheck.

Tuesday marked the third anniversary of the last increase in the federal minimum wage. For the last three years, while the prices of gas and milk have risen steadily and the richest 1% have enjoyed huge tax breaks, the federal minimum wage has remained frozen at $7.25 an hour, which amounts to just $15,080 a year – as long as you get paid for any time you take off. That’s more than $7,000 below the federal poverty line for a family of four. As a result, the purchasing power of the minimum wage has slowly eroded – in just three years, its real value has sunk to $6.77 per hour, a nearly 50-cent drop.

The Bush tax cuts, which are simply the perquisite of the moment for the 1%, allow for the richest to prosper at the expense of middle-class and low-income workers. While CEOs make millions and their corporations make billions as part of a so-called economic recovery, the majority of Americans are struggling to make ends meet. This struggle is exacerbated by the low federal minimum wage. As middle-class jobs are increasingly replaced by low-wage work, however, this is the economic reality for a growing number of Americans.

Unless Congress raises the federal minimum wage, economic security for workers in low-wage jobs, the fastest-growing sector, will disappear. It is incumbent on members of Congress to raise the federal minimum wage and index it to inflation, putting more money into the pockets of ordinary Americans to boost our economy and aid a real, long-term recovery.

The Rebuild America Act has been introduced in both the House and the Senate to do just that, while also raising the federal minimum wage for tipped workers, which has been a meager $2.13 since 1991. The Fair Minimum Wage Act, not yet introduced, is also a call for a more decent wage. Support for these bills is support for an economic recovery that extends to all Americans.

This legislation could make a difference for Bruce Gross, a father of three in Baltimore. He worked as a sandblaster, supporting his wife, their twin boys, daughter and two nephews, until the economy crashed. Now, Bruce makes $7.36 an hour as a telemarketer.

Bruce’s wife is sick and unable to work, leaving him as the sole breadwinner. Bruce estimates he brings home about $200 every other week and his bills are more than double that. Bruce and his family recently sat in the dark for a few days because he had to choose between paying his electric bill and buying groceries.

When things got really rough, Bruce asked neighbors if they could spare a few slices of bread and some cheese for sandwiches. He is heartbroken that he is unable to provide even basic necessities, like food and school supplies, for his children.

People who work for a living should be able to make a living from their work. Low-wage workers should not have to scrape by, while many of the companies they work for are making more money now than they were three years ago. The federal minimum wage hasn’t kept up with inflation, but CEO pay has risen 725% over the last 30 years and 80% of all real income growth has gone to the richest 1% of Americans.

The real value of the minimum wage peaked in 1968. Had it kept pace with rising living costs, the minimum wage would exceed $10.50 per hour today. Meanwhile, the U.S. economy has been reorganizing over the past 30 years away from middle-wage jobs in manufacturing and construction and toward low-paying jobs in the rapidly expanding service, retail and restaurant industries.

We have little reason to expect large corporations that are the principal employers of low-wage workers to voluntarily offer higher pay; rock bottom wages are a core profit-making strategy for retail giants and fast food chains. Nor does reality match the myth that prosperity at the top will eventually “trickle down” to workers at the bottom: corporate profits are at their highest level as a share of GDP, and wages at their lowest, since the 1950s.

Neither facts nor common sense support a federal minimum wage stuck at $7.25. It wasn’t low-wage workers who crashed the economy. It was not a raise for these workers, but rather an unquenchable thirst for profit, that led to Wall Street’s disastrous game of financial Russian roulette. Why, then, should low-wage workers pay the price?

How high must profits go before a modest wage increase isn’t raised as a specter of impending corporate doom? It’s easy to exploit such fears in this economic climate, but these tired old canards – trotted out in every minimum wage fight – are just an excuse for political inaction and continued corporate greed.

The bottom line is that people who work for a living put their money right back into our economy. What business in this country needs right now is customers and too many hardworking Americans aren’t making enough money to get by. If we raise the federal minimum wage and demand the 1% pay their fair share to reduce income inequality, we will boost our economy, help small business grow and create jobs.

What began in Manhattan eight months ago first spread to Chicago and Washington and this week has hit St. Louis, Kansas City, Detroit and Flint, Mich. On Wednesday alone, workers picketed McDonald’s, Taco Bell, Popeye’s and Long John Silver’s restaurants in those cities with an ambitious agenda: pay of $15 an hour, twice what many now earn.

These strikes, which are planned for Milwaukee on Thursday, carry the flavor of Occupy Wall Street protests and are far different from traditional unionization efforts that generally focus on a single workplace. The national campaign, underwritten with millions of dollars from the Service Employees International Union, aims to mobilize workers — all at once — in numerous cities at hundreds of restaurants from two dozen chains.

None of the nation’s 200,000-plus fast-food restaurants are unionized.

The strategists know they want to achieve a $15 wage, but they seem to be ad-libbing on ways to get there. Perhaps they will seek to unionize workers at dozens of restaurants, although some labor leaders scoff at that idea because the turnover rate among fast-food employees is about 75 percent a year. Or the strategists and strikers might press city councils to enact a special “living wage” for fast-food restaurants. Or perhaps by continually disrupting the fast-food marketplace from counter to counter across the country, they can get McDonald’s, KFC and others to raise wages to end the ruckus. The protests’ organizers acknowledge that yet another goal is to push Congress to raise the federal minimum wage and pressure state legislatures to raise the state minimums."

Boehner (R-Ohio) took direct aim at some of his tea party critics Thursday, accusing them of working against the interests of the Republican Party.

Calling the groups “misleading” and without “credibility,” Boehner pointed to the string of bipartisan deals that passed the House on its last legislative day of 2013 as the sort of “common ground” that should provide a new path for congressional work.

The House voted 332 to 94 on Thursday night to approve a two-year budget outline that would reduce the chance of another government shutdown and end the cycle of crisis budgeting that has been the scourge of Washington for much of the past three years.

The budget approval was the most prominent accomplishment of a day on which the usually moribund House also passed legislation that would extend the farm bill through January and approved the annual policy bill for the Pentagon.

That collection of legislation will head next week to the Senate, where the budget pact will have to steer a narrow path to victory through concern from GOP defense hawks who oppose a provision in the bill that would reduce military pension benefits.

View Graphic How House members voted on a two-year budget deal

With his assault on outside groups that have opposed him time and again over the past three years, Boehner gave voice to a growing feeling among congressional Republicans that their nominal allies at advocacy groups and think tanks have turned into puritanical partisans whose posture on many issues has undermined the GOP’s standing on Capitol Hill. Boehner’s remarks came amid increasingly strident clashes between establishment Republicans and Washington-based groups that claim the tea party banner, most prominently Heritage Action for America, the Club for Growth and FreedomWorks.

The 16-day federal government shutdown in October, largely orchestrated by groups such as Heritage Action, became a pivot point for many longtime Republican lawmakers to begin pushing back against more conservative newcomers.

The turning point for Boehner — who acknowledged feeling this way for several years — was an effort to sabotage the bipartisan budget deal crafted by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray (D-Wash.).

Ryan, the Republican Party’s 2012 vice presidential nominee, still engenders much respect in all ideological corners of the GOP caucus, and his plan won plaudits from senior Republicans for establishing a two-year framework that many hope will provide evidence that the House GOP is able and willing to govern.

“This is good government, it’s also divided government. And under divided government, we need to take steps in the right direction,” Ryan said on the House floor before the vote.

But those outside groups attacked Ryan for allowing an additional $63 billion in agency spending over the next two years in exchange for savings that come over the next decade.

“Frankly, I think they’re misleading their followers,” Boehner told reporters at his weekly news briefing. “I think they’re pushing our members in places where they don’t want to be. And frankly, I just think that they’ve lost all credibility.”

Hours later, Ryan’s deal won a majority of House GOP votes — 169 for it, 62 against it — unlike every other bipartisan fiscal pact in 2013, most of which barely attracted a third of the Republican caucus.

For the House GOP, the year began with an attempted coup against Boehner by House conservatives in early January and continued with a string of failed votes for the speaker and his leadership team.

Instead of the dysfunction that dominated the year, House Republicans in recent weeks had hoped to better position themselves to negotiate deals with Senate Democrats by passing legislation that was not perfect in the most conservative eyes, but that advanced their cause. But that repositioning has done little to ease tensions in the party.

Conflagrations already have occurred in a Republican primary for a special congressional election in Alabama, and more than half a dozen Senate primaries next year pit mainstream conservatives against those from the far right. Establishment groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have vowed to wade into primaries if it means electing a more traditional, business-friendly Republican.

This week’s clash over the Murray-Ryan budget served as the first big policy contest inside the fractured House Republican Conference since the shutdown. Some conservatives recoiled at both Ryan’s proposal and Boehner’s critique of the outside groups, with the central complaint focusing on the increased funding for federal agencies above certain limits that were part of a 2011 budget deal.

“The more information that gets out about this deal, the harder it is for members to vote yes and go back home and explain that vote,” said Dan Holler, a spokesman for Heritage Action. Holler warned that Boehner will risk the Republican majority if conservative voters “are not going to motivate to turn out in November 2014.”

He described Boehner’s message to conservative voters as, “We use you guys to get elected.”

One of Heritage’s staunchest allies, Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.), said he thinks Boehner’s moment of candor was prompted by the belief among some Republicans that he will not run for speaker next term. “I don’t think the speaker’s too worried; the rumor is that he’s not going to be here in a year and a half,” Huelskamp told reporters. “This would match that.”

Boehner has said that he intends to remain speaker and on Monday filed to run for reelection next year in his southwest Ohio district.

The more prominent view among House Republicans was that Ryan’s deal with Murray, while disappointing with just $23 billion in deficit reduction, would make another government shutdown highly unlikely and signals that House Republicans are trying to move beyond the past three years of fiscal brinkmanship they have engaged in with the Obama White House.

The outside groups opposing Ryan — including Heritage Action, the Club for Growth, FreedomWorks and the Senate Conservatives Fund — would instead steer House Republicans onto a familiar path, lurching from crisis to crisis, many House Republicans said.

“It's not helpful for them to say that that’s completely unacceptable. What would they like? Another government shutdown? If that’s what they want, they should run for Congress,” said Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Issa called his view “absolutely a majority of the majority.”

The battle has left some Republicans conflicted. On Wednesday, Rep. Steve Scalise (La.), chairman of the Republican Study Committee, an influential conservative caucus, fired the organization’s longtime top staffer because he was secretly collaborating with the outside groups trying to pressure Republicans to oppose Ryan’s deal. Scalise said the aide had lost the trust of lawmakers by working against their positions, but on Thursday he said that he still appreciates the help that Heritage Action and others provide in supporting conservative causes.

“I’m not sure what the speaker’s thought process is. Look, outside groups have an important role to play in this process. I support what they do and their role in the process,” he said.

Boehner, however, turned his normally staid weekly news briefing into a moment of political theater, unmatched in his speakership. Fed up after holding his tongue for three years, he lashed out in a fashion that was reminiscent of Warren Beatty’s character in the movie “Bulworth,” about a Democratic senator who lashes out at the influence of outside special interests in politics.

On Wednesday, Boehner issued a brief aside, accusing Heritage Action and others of “using” younger, less experienced GOP lawmakers. On Thursday, he delivered a more expansive critique, acknowledging that he felt pushed.

“It’s just that, you know, there just comes to a point when some people step over the line,” he said. “You know, when you criticize something and you have no idea what you’re criticizing, it undermines your credibility.”

Then he smiled and added, “Have a merry Christmas.”"

Annual federal deficits will continue to fall in the short term, the budget office reported in its yearly long-term outlook, because of the recent spending cuts in military and domestic programs and rising tax collections in a recovering economy. The report projected the deficit in 2015 to be equal to 2.1 percent of the economy’s output, or just one-fifth of the peak shortfall at the height of the recession in 2009.

But starting in 2016, deficits are projected to rise again as more baby boomers begin drawing from Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security — the fast-growing entitlement programs, which Democrats and Republicans cannot agree on how to rein in.

The accumulating federal debt, which averaged 38 percent of the gross domestic product for the 40 years before the 2008 financial crisis, would rise from 73 percent of the G.D.P. now — above what most economists consider an optimum level — to at least 100 percent in 2038."

Battered by a collapse in real estate prices, a spike in pension and retiree health care costs, and unmanageable debt, this struggling city in the Central Valley has labored for months to find a way out of Chapter 9. Now having renegotiated its debt with most creditors, cobbled together layoffs and service cuts and raised the sales tax to 9 percent from 8.25 percent, Stockton is nearly ready to leave court protection.

But what Stockton, along with pretty much every other city in California that has gone into bankruptcy in recent years, has not done is address the skyrocketing public pensions that are at the heart of many of these cases.

“No city wants to take on the state pension system by itself,” said Stockton’s new mayor, Anthony Silva, referring to the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, or Calpers. “Every city thinks some other city will take care of it.”

While a federal bankruptcy judge ruled this week that Detroit could reduce public pensions to help shed its debts, Stockton has become an experiment of whether a municipality can successfully come out of bankruptcy and stabilize its finances without touching pensions. It is an effort that has come at great cost to city services and one that some critics say will simply not work once the city starts trying to restore services and hire 120 police officers it promised to get the sales-tax increase passed."

The rivalry between Texas and California is no secret, and it goes far beyond the fact that they are the two most populous states in the nation. While neither state is monolithic in terms of its political ideology—Texas has deep-blue Austin while some inland parts of California are a startling shade of crimson—the politics of each state has been marked by radically different ideologies. California's main power bases of economic and political power include two of the places conservatives most love to hate: San Francisco and Hollywood. Meanwhile, every single statewide elected official is a Democrat, and Democrats have dominated the state legislature, despite the roadblocks along the way. In recent years, the state government has sought to invest in projects like high-speed rail and solar energy, often taxing itself for the privilege Texas, of course, is just the opposite: a conservative ideological paradise funded substantially by the oil industry, with low taxes and a belief that government is the problem, not the solution.

Because of its ideological ramifications, the rivalry between Texas and California is more than just competition for bragging rights between the nations two heaviest hitters; rather, it is ground zero in an ideological proxy war between the progressive and conservative factions of larger-scale national politics. And in recent years, as the Lone Star State was experiencing its so-called ""Texas Miracle"" while California was limping along from budget crisis to budget crisis, it was far from uncommon for conservative ideologues to point to the contrast between the two as evidence of the success of conservative economic policy.

Unfortunately for them, the tide has turned on this view. First, the so-called Texas Miracle turned out to be a sham masked by a combination of rapid population growth, high oil prices and low wages. Ironically enough, it was billions of dollars in stimulus funds that was propping up Texas' budget solvency. When that ran out and the economic crisis finally showed its full effects, the state faced a crippling budget deficit of $27 billion, and was forced to make massive cuts to Medicaid and education to stay afloat.

California, meanwhile, has been on exactly the opposite trajectory. The voters, sick of the tax revolt that had been artificially maintained by the Republican minority, voted in a series of structural reforms that loosened the minority's stranglehold in Sacramento and followed that up by passing two tax measures to promote green energy and protect our schools from further cuts. Combined with the economic recovery that has been taking place nationwide, these changes were enough to put California's budget back in the black for the first time in many years, even as Texas suffers from high poverty, low wages and a drastically failing education system.

http://news.yahoo.com/shutdown-bill-items-states-fed-agencies-065939104--politics.html,,[],"Shutdown bill has items for states, fed agencies","WASHINGTON (AP) — Here's a little secret about the bill Congress has approved ending the partial government shutdown and preventing a possible federal default: It's got goodies for some states and federal agencies too.

There's language allowing more spending for upgrading a lock in the Ohio River between Illinois and Kentucky; money to help Colorado rebuild roads washed away by last month's catastrophic floods; extra money to help the Veterans Affairs Department whittle down a backlog of disabilities claims; and permission for the Pentagon to keep helping African nations hunt a notorious warlord.

The measure, approved Wednesday by the House and Senate, has one lump of coal for lawmakers: For the sixth consecutive year it would deny them the annual cost-of-living pay raise that by law they automatically receive unless they vote to block it. Members of Congress earn $174,000 annually, and some leaders receive more.

The 35-page bill had only a handful of such narrowly aimed provisions. That's a far cry from years ago, when spending bills would be studded with hundreds of ""earmarks,"" or projects for specific states or congressional districts, often designed to ensure the votes of lawmakers.

One provision would let the government spend $2.9 billion — an increase from the current cap of $775 million — to upgrade the Olmstead lock on the Ohio River.

It gained attention because the two states it straddles are represented by two of the Senate's most powerful members: the Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, and No. 2 Democratic leader, Richard Durbin of Illinois.

Both men said they had nothing to do with the provision, and others backed that up. Aides to Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the leaders of a Senate Appropriations subcommittee that oversees water projects, said they had requested the provision.

They said President Barack Obama had requested the project in his budget this year and said it has been included in House and Senate water bills this year too.

Story continues

""This is not an earmark,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., who with McConnell struck the compromise on the overall shutdown and debt limit bill, told reporters Wednesday.

In a boon for flood-battered Colorado, the measure would lift the usual $100 million limit on Federal Highway Administration emergency highway aid to $450 million for the state. Colorado officials have said last month's flooding destroyed 200 miles of roads and 50 bridges.

The legislation, which keeps federal agencies functioning through Jan. 15, provides an extra $294 million during that period for the Veterans Affairs Department's efforts to reduce backlogged claims, along with an additional $100 million to prevent furloughs of air traffic controllers and safety inspectors, and extra money for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to continue work on two weather satellites.

It also:

—Lets the Defense Department continue assisting African forces pursue Joseph Kony, leader of the Lord's Resistance Army, a rebel group accused of atrocities.

—Provides extra money for contracts with private companies whose ships move American troops and their equipment overseas.

—Supplies $600 million for Forest Service firefighting and $36 million for Interior Department firefighting."

http://news.yahoo.com/share-young-us-adults-move-hits-50-low-050317604.html,,[],Share of young US adults who move hits 50-year low,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. mobility for young adults has fallen to the lowest level in more than 50 years as cash-strapped 20-somethings shun home-buying and refrain from major moves in a weak job market.

The new 2013 figures from the Census Bureau, which reversed earlier signs of recovery, underscore the impact of the sluggish economy on young people, many of them college graduates, whom demographers sometimes refer to as ""Generation Wait.""

Burdened with college debt or toiling in low-wage jobs, they are delaying careers, marriage and having children. Waiting anxiously for their lucky break, they are staying put and doubling up with roommates or living with Mom and dad, unable to make long-term plans or commit to buying a home — let alone pay a mortgage.

Many understood after the 2007-2009 recession that times would be tough. But few say they expected to be in economic limbo more than four years later.

""I'm constantly looking for other jobs,"" says Jeremy Bills, 27, of Nashville, Tenn., who graduated from Vanderbilt University in May 2011 with a master's degree in human and organizational development. Originally from Tampa, Fla., Bills has stayed put in his college town in hopes of finding a job in management consulting or human resources. Instead, he has mostly found odd jobs like pulling weeds and dog-sitting.

Bills says he pursued a master's degree to bolster his credentials after getting his college diploma in 2008, shortly before the financial meltdown. Instead, he finds himself still struggling financially and worrying that the skills he learned in school — where he incurred $20,000 in student loan debt — are ""kind of atrophying right now.""

""It's not like riding a bicycle. You can't just jump into a career position so many years after training,"" said Bills, who now works at a nonprofit organization making $12 an hour and is looking for a second job.

Among adults ages 25-29, just 4.9 million, or 23.3 percent, moved in the 12 months ending March 2013. That's down from 24.6 percent in the same period the year before. It was the lowest level since at least 1963. The peak of 36.7 percent came in 1965, during the nation's youth counterculture movement.

Story continues

The past year's decline in migration came after a modest increase from 2011 to 2012, a sign that young adults remain tentative about testing the job market in other cities.

By metropolitan area, Portland, Ore., Austin, Texas, and Houston were among the top gainers in young adults, reflecting stronger local economies. Among college graduates 25 and older, Denver and Washington, D.C., topped the list of destinations.

Demographers say the delays in traditional markers of adulthood — full-time careers and homeownership — may prove to be longer-lasting.

Roughly 1 in 5 young adults ages 25 to 34 is now disconnected from work and school.

""Young adulthood has grown much more complex and protracted, with a huge number struggling to reach financial independence,"" said Mark Mather, an associate vice president at the private Population Reference Bureau. ""Many will get there, but at much later ages than we've seen in the past. More and more we're seeing many young adults routinely wait until their 30s to leave the parental nest.""

The overall decline in migration among young adults is being driven largely by a drop in local moves within a county, which fell to the lowest level on record. Out-of-state moves also fell, from 3.8 percent in 2012 to 3.4 percent, but remained higher than a 2010 low of 3.2 percent.

Young adults typically make long-distance moves to seek a new career, while those who make local moves often do so when buying a home.

While homeownership across all age groups fell by 3 percentage points to 65 percent from 2007 to 2012, the drop-off among adults 25-29 was much larger — more than 6 percentage points, from 40.6 percent to 34.3 percent. That reflects in part tighter lines of credit after the 2006 housing bust. Declines in homeownership for those ages 40 and older over in that five-year period were more modest.

The District of Columbia, with its high share of young adults, had the lowest homeownership rate across all age groups at 41.6 percent, followed by New York at 53.9 percent. West Virginia had the highest homeownership rate at 72.9 percent.

In terms of births, the birth rate for all women of childbearing age — 63 births per 1,000 women — was essentially flat in 2012 from the year before.

Meanwhile, overall migration among adults 55 and older held steady at 4.4 percent from 2012 to 2013, up from a low of 4 percent in 2011. Metro areas with the biggest gains included Phoenix, Atlanta, Denver and several in Florida. Many cities in the Northeast, Midwest and coastal areas posted losses.

""The post-recession period has given a bigger boost to seniors than to young adults in their willingness to try out new places for retirement,"" said William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution who analyzed the figures. ""Many young adults, especially those without college degrees, are still stuck in place.""

""For them, low mobility might be more than a temporary lull and could turn into the 'new normal.'""

The wait continues for Eric Hall, 30, of Decatur, Ga. After picking up a master's degree in public health in 2008, Hall moved from California to the Atlanta suburb with the plan of living with his parents for about six months.

Five years later, after struggling to find work in his field and switching his career path last year from health management to teaching kindergarten, Hall has opted to remain at his parents' home until he can pay off more debt. He is now studying to earn a doctorate in education, amassing college debt of more than $110,000.

""It's a bit restraining after going away to college two times, but I'm saving and my mom's been very understanding,"" said Hall, who is optimistic he'll soon be financially stable enough to live on his own. ""Maybe next summer.""

President Barack Obama may find opposition from inside his own party if he is serious about making changes to the way Social Security benefits are distributed in order to pass a deal to replace sequestration.

A majority of the House Democrats -- 107 members -- sent Obama a letter on Friday stating that any changes to entitlements will be opposed by members of his own party.

""We remain deeply opposed to proposals to reduce Social Security benefits through use of the chained CPI to calculate cost-of-living adjustments,"" reads the letter, which was the idea of Reps. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), John Conyers (D-Mich.) and Donna Edwards (D-Md.).

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney recently said the president would be open to implementing chained Consumer Price Index (CPI), which would alter the annual adjustment in how benefits are paid to Social Security recipients by using a less generous baseline of inflation.

""He has put forward a technical change, as part of a big deal,"" said Carney. ""A technical change of CPI is possible as part of a big deal.""

He added, however, that the president is opposed to raising the eligibility age of Medicare.

Progressives have opposed chained CPI because it would reduce the benefits that senior citizens receive.

The letter stated that while House Democrats are ""committed to making the changes that will extend solvency for 75 years,"" Social Security has not negatively contributed to any of the country's fiscal problems so ""it should not be on the bargaining table.""

House Democrats reiterated in the letter their ""vigorous opposition to cutting Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid benefits in any final bill.""

In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Obama stressed the need for ""modest reforms"" to entitlements. This was met by a positive response by congressional Republicans who have long wanted changes to entitlement programs.

Ellison, co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, also told The Huffington Post on Tuesday after Obama's SOTU speech that he was concerned about possible changes to entitlements.

""I think there are things that can be done to reform social insurance, such as to engage in competitive bidding for prescription drug prices. But he didn't mention that. He just sort of raised the issue, which raised a lot of questions about what did he have in mind,"" said Ellison, who added that he liked the overall speech's focus on income inequality and concern for low-wage workers.

Lawmakers want to avoid a series of automatic deep spending cuts due to kick in March 1 unless Congress comes up with an $85-billion replacement plan.

“We have a chance to prove to the rest of the Congress that we can produce bills,” Representative Harold Rogers, the Kentucky Republican who is the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said in an interview.

The past few years have proved frustrating for members of the spending panels. With House Republicans unable to come to terms with Senate Democrats on a budget, the government has mainly functioned under a series of continuing resolutions that have taken the Appropriations Committees out of the game.

“It has been a real struggle and tough at times,” Mr. Rogers said.

While most members of Congress have scattered for the holidays, the panels’ bipartisan leadership and senior staff members have been assembling a $1 trillion measure that splits an extra $45 billion between military and domestic needs under the terms of the overarching budget deal reached this month and signed into law by President Obama on Thursday."
http://news.yahoo.com/tax-bills-rich-families-approach-30-high-123724197.html,,[],Tax bills for rich families approach 30-year high,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The poor rich.

With Washington gridlocked again over whether to raise their taxes, it turns out wealthy families already are paying some of their biggest federal tax bills in decades even as the rest of the population continues to pay at historically low rates.

President Barack Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress say the wealthy must pay their fair share if the federal government is ever going to fix its finances and reduce the budget deficit to a manageable level.

A new analysis, however, shows that average tax bills for high-income families rarely have been higher since the Congressional Budget Office began tracking the data in 1979. Middle- and low-income families aren't paying as much as they used to.

For 2013, families with incomes in the top 20 percent of the nation will pay an average of 27.2 percent of their income in federal taxes, according to projections by the Tax Policy Center, a research organization based in Washington. The top 1 percent of households, those with incomes averaging $1.4 million, will pay an average of 35.5 percent.

Those tax rates, which include income, payroll, corporate and estate taxes, are among the highest since 1979.

The average family in the bottom 20 percent of households won't pay any federal taxes. Instead, many families in this group will get payments from the federal government by claiming more in credits than they owe in taxes, including payroll taxes. That will give them a negative tax rate.

""My sense is that high-income people feel abused by being targeted always for more taxes,"" Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center, said. ""You can understand why they feel that way.""

Last week, Senate Democrats were unable to advance their proposal to raise taxes on some wealthy families for the second time this year as part of a package to avoid automatic spending cuts. The bill failed Thursday when Republicans blocked it. A competing Republican bill that included no tax increases also failed, and the automatic spending cuts began taking effect Friday.

Story continues

The issue, however, isn't going away.

Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress insist that any future deal to reduce government borrowing must include a mix of spending cuts and more tax revenue.

""I am prepared to do hard things and to push my Democratic friends to do hard things,"" Obama said Friday. ""But what I can't do is ask middle-class families, ask seniors, ask students to bear the entire burden of deficit reduction when we know we've got a bunch of tax loopholes that are benefiting the well-off and the well-connected, aren't contributing to growth, aren't contributing to our economy. It's not fair. It's not right.""

On Sunday, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said Republicans are committed to reducing the budget deficit without raising taxes again. In a separate broadcast interview, White House economic adviser Gene Sperling called that position unreasonable.

The Democrats' sequester bill included the ""Buffett Rule,"" named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett. It gradually would phase in a requirement that people making more than $1 million a year pay at least 30 percent of their income in federal taxes.

The rule targets millionaires who make most of their money from investments — capital gains and qualified dividends, which have a top tax rate of 20 percent.

""It's fairness,"" said Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo. ""We're not raising taxes with the Buffett rule as much as we are correcting an inequity in terms of, one guy can be working at one end of the hall and because he's working with hedge funds, he gets taxed at 20 percent. Another guy at the other end of the hall is on a salary at an insurance company and he has to pay (39.6 percent). That's just not fair.""

On average, households making more than $1 million this year will pay 37.2 percent of their income in federal taxes, according to the Tax Policy Center. But there are exceptions.

For example, the Internal Revenue Service tracks tax returns for the 400 highest-paid filers each year. Those taxpayers made an average of $202 million in 2009, the latest year available. Their average federal income tax rate: 19.9 percent.

That's still higher than the tax rate paid by most middle-income families, but not by much.

The middle 20 percent of U.S. households — those making an average of $46,600 — will pay an average of 13.8 percent of their income in federal taxes for this year, according to the Tax Policy Center. Over the past three decades, the average federal tax rate for this group has been about 16 percent.

The Associated Press analyzed two sets of data to compare tax burdens over time.

The CBO produces data from 1979 to 2009; the center has overlapping data from 2004 through 2013. Both get tax data from the IRS, but they use slightly different methodologies to calculate federal tax burdens.

Still, their numbers track closely enough to make some general observations. For example, it is clear that for 2013, average tax bills for the wealthy will be among the highest since 1979. It also is clear that federal taxes for middle- and low-income households will stay well below their averages for the same period.

Liberals and many Democrats say rich families can afford to pay higher taxes because their incomes have grown much more than incomes for middle- and low-income families.

Average after-tax incomes for the top 1 percent of households more than doubled from 1979 to 2009, increasing by 155 percent, according to the CBO. Average incomes for those in the middle increased by just 32 percent during the same period while those at the bottom saw their incomes go up by 45 percent.

""You've got to think about the context,"" said Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. ""We just had three decades in the United States where we had a tremendous increase in inequality.""

The growing disparity in income is a big reason why tax bills for the rich are approaching 30-year highs, Williams said. As the rich get richer, a greater share of their income is taxed at the top rate, he said.

High-income families also have been targeted by tax increases this year, including a new tax law passed by Congress on Jan. 1 as well as tax increases in the president's health care law.

The new tax law made the federal income tax more progressive, increasing the top tax rate from 35 percent to 39.6 percent, on taxable income above $400,000 for individuals and $450,000 for married couples filing jointly. Lower tax rates on income below those amounts were made permanent. Also, tax breaks for low-income families first enacted as part of Obama's 2009 stimulus package were extended through 2017.

Conservatives say raising taxes again on the wealthy would reduce their incentive to save and invest, hurting long-term economic growth.

""Raising taxes hurts the economy, and raising taxes on upper-income individuals — whether those who work for salaries or those who save and earn capital income — always hurts the economy the most,"" said J.D. Foster, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""Spite and envy are not sound bases for public policy.""

Besides, Republican leaders in Congress say, one tax increase a year is more than enough.

""Let's make it clear that the president got his tax hikes on Jan. 1,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Friday. ""This discussion about revenue, in my view, is over.""

Republicans have said the forthcoming measure, which will combine stricter eligibility standards with new work requirements, will reduce Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program spending by $40 billion over 10 years.

""House Republican leaders haven’t formally released the language of their plan, but the information they have made available makes clear that the proposal will be very harsh, denying SNAP to at least four million to six million low-income people, including some of the nation’s poorest adults, as well as many low-income children, seniors, and families that work for low wages,"" the CBPP's Dottie Rosenbaum, Stacy Dean, and Robert Greenstein said in a report published Monday.

A key part of the new legislation would stop states from waiving SNAP's work requirements for able-bodied childless adults, something more than 45 states currently do because of high unemployment. Working-age Americans without kids would have to either work 20 hours a week or engage in ""work activities"" that could include training or volunteering.

""The House will consider common-sense measures, such as work requirements and job training requirements for able-bodied adults without children receiving assistance, that enjoy broad public support,"" Doug Heye, a spokesman for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), said in an email on Monday.

The Center on Budget claims it's inaccurate to say the forthcoming proposal includes work requirements. ""In reality, they would terminate basic food assistance to people who would take any job or job training opportunity offered but cannot find one; the proposal doesn’t require states to provide jobs or job training and includes no added funds for these activities,"" the report's authors said.

The percentage of SNAP recipients who are able-bodied adults without children has risen from 6.6 percent in 2007 to 9.7 percent in 2010, or nearly 4 million people. Altogether 47 million Americans, most of them either children, elderly or disabled, receive SNAP benefits each month.

A recent Fox News poll found 94 percent of respondents were okay with food stamps going to a ""laid-off worker who wants a job and doesn’t have the money to feed his family"" but 91 percent opposed food stamps for an ""unemployed musician who doesn’t want to take a regular job which will pay him enough to live on."" A HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted in June found 40 percent of Americans favored cutting food stamps.

The House voted down a bill in June that would have reduced SNAP spending by $20 billion, denying benefits to nearly 2 million people. House Republican leaders are coming back with deeper cuts in a bid to get the bill through the lower chamber with a majority of Republican votes. Any SNAP cuts approved by the House would have to be merged with Senate legislation that has much more modest reductions.

Automatic benefits cuts for all SNAP recipients are scheduled to take effect in November, regardless of whether Congress passes new cuts, thanks to the expiration of a benefit increase from the 2009 stimulus bill."

Rep. Steve Stivers, a close Boehner ally, even floated the idea that “revenue”, i.e. higher taxes, could be part of this “bargain.”

There is no clear path to reopening government right now. Obama and Senate Democrats continue to refuse to negotiate or compromise on legislation to provide new government funding. In just two weeks, however, the federal government is set to hit its debt ceiling, exhausting its borrowing authority. After this, the government will have to pay its bills out of continuing tax collections, necessitating dramatic cuts in spending or a default on the nation’s existing debt payments.

As the government shutdown and debt ceiling issues intertwine, many in the GOP believe that only a “grand bargain” on spending and revenue is a big enough vehicle to restore government funding and lift the debt ceiling. During the last debt ceiling negotiations, in 2011, the GOP was close to agreeing to a similar “grand bargain.” The deal fell apart in the 11th hour, however, because President Obama increased his demands for new revenue.

This experience should caution the GOP against unilaterally proposing another “grand bargain” at this time. Obama and the Senate Democrats seem incapable of negotiating in good faith. The rhetoric they currently employ against Republicans does not suggest they are ready to cede ground on fiscal issues in any meaningful way. It is hard to imagine Harry Reid shifting from calling Republicans “anarchists” to treating them as honest brokers in a substantive negotiation over the nation’s fiscal policy.

Theoretically, a “grand bargain” could be a good idea, given the urgent need to reform the nation’s entitlement programs and tax code. In reality, however, with Republicans only controlling the House, any “grand bargain” is likely to be light on spending reform and heavy on tax hikes.

If Republicans take control of the Senate in 2014, which is increasingly likely, conservatives and moderate Republicans would be in a better position to push a “grand bargain” that would contain meaningful reforms that could boost the economy.

Policy considerations, however, may yield to internal GOP politics. Paul Ryan, who was granted a special waiver to continuing chairing the Budget Committee, is eager to strike a significant budget deal while he has the gavel. Rep. David Camp, too, is entering his final term chairing the Ways and Means Committee and is anxious to enact some kind of tax reform while he heads the committee. Their desire for a personal legacy will make them strong advocates for a “grand bargain,” despite the GOP’s relatively weak hand.

The GOP faces a series of tough choices over the next two weeks. So, too, do Obama and the Senate Democrats. Much of the current situation is due to the inability of the Senate to produce a regular budget over the past five years. The failed stimulus program, bailouts, expanded welfare payments and new entitlements like ObamaCare has caused government spending to skyrocket, pushing the national debt to unsustainable levels. Even a mainstream media black-out can’t forever keep those facts from the American public.

The onus isn’t on Republicans to solve the nation’s fiscal crisis. President Obama and Senate Democrats have brought us to this point. It should be up to them to steer us out of it."

As Washington continues to wrangle over the cuts, Wyrick is one of 414 workers in Texarkana, Texas, who are preparing to join the unemployment rolls.

The Red River Army Depot, where Wyrick and his fellow workers refurbish military vehicles, stands to lose $600 million from its budget starting this Friday.

A Humvee mechanic, 38-year-old Wyrick has worked at the depot for five years and makes about $47,000 a year. He worries about what it will mean for his family of three.

""I don't know how we're going to make it,"" said Wyrick, whose last day at work is March 9.

The depot is cutting 10% of its workforce of 4,000. The layoffs started on Feb 23. The rest of the employees will face furloughs, according to Cebron O'Bier, president of the union at the depot.

""Right now, the morale is way down. People are going into a panic, they don't know what they're going to do,"" Wyrick said.

He is on the front line of the forced spending cuts that will slash budgets of federal agencies. Most of the 2.1 million federal workers face furloughs.

CNN.com: Spending cut countdown

Roughly half of the cuts will come at the Pentagon -- most of its 800,000 civilian workers would start furloughs in late April.

Employees like Wyrick are among some 46,000 temporary or contract workers losing jobs nationwide, the Pentagon has said. And, like Wyrick, many of them work full-time with benefits, even though they're employed for a specific period of time and purpose. Since their jobs depend upon contracts being renewed, they're particularly vulnerable to budget cuts.

Pentagon spokeswoman Army Lt. Col. Elizabeth Robbins said agency officials regret the layoffs and are ""deeply concerned about the effects of these actions on our military readiness, as well as the immediate effects on our civilian colleagues and their families.""

The Red River Army Depot workers are puzzled over the cutbacks, because they say they save money for the Pentagon. By refurbishing older, war-torn vehicles they lead to fewer purchases of new cars and trucks for the Army.

""We overhaul various military vehicles, take them down to the smallest possible piece of material, refurbish them, and put them back together as good as a brand new vehicle,"" union president O'Bier said.

The depot is also a major economic force for the West Arkansas and East Texas area, where it is located. Employment gains at the depot helped the area rebound faster than other metropolitan areas in the region, said Kathy Deck, an economist and director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at University of Arkansas.

The unemployment rate in Texarkana was 5.7% in December, compared with the 7.8% unemployment rate nationwide, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics. Cuts at the Red River Army Depot will resonate throughout area restaurants, shops and other businesses, Deck said.

The loss will upend Wyrick's life. He's unsure if unemployment benefits will be enough to cover his home mortgage and insurance payments, not to mention basics like food and gas.

Wyrick found out that a local tire manufacturer he was hoping to ask for a job isn't hiring either. The company is cutting back because it's losing orders from the depot.

Now, Wyrick says he's looking into federal contractors who hire mechanics to work overseas.

""I grew up here and and have lived here my whole life, so a move overseas would be pretty drastic, you know, pretty drastic,"" Wyrick said."
http://news.yahoo.com/food-stamp-cuts-hit-elderly-164547526.html,,[],Food stamp cuts hit 9 million elderly and disabled people,"Cuts to the nation’s food stamp program hit 48 million Americans this week, including more than 9 million elderly and disabled people.

Nearly one in seven Americans uses the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which has doubled in cost since 2008 when Congress increased the benefits as part of the economic stimulus bill. Both Democrats and Republicans allowed the temporary benefits boost to expire on Nov. 1, and Republicans are pushing for far steeper cuts to the $80 billion program.

The average monthly decrease for a one-person household is $11. That doesn’t sound like much, but the vast majority of food stamp recipients say the assistance runs out in the first three weeks of each month, leaving them to cobble together food from other sources in the final week. The cuts amount to 16 meals a month for the average family of three, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department’s Thrifty Food Plan.

“Even though it might sound little, for some people that’s a couple of meals that they have to choose whether they eat or don’t eat,” said Bobbie Sackman, the director of public policy at the Council of Senior Centers and Services in New York City, which helps elderly people sign up for assistance. “They have to go elsewhere to find food or they’re not going to have food.”

People can turn to food pantries for additional assistance. But it’s harder for older and disabled people to fill in the gaps left by the food stamp program, since going in-person to various soup kitchens and food pantries is not an option for many of them. About 9 percent of all food stamps go to households that include senior citizens. In New York, which has a large elderly population, it’s double that.

Marc Wolfson, a disabled 62 year-old who lives in Brooklyn, spent his Tuesday afternoon calling around to various food pantries to see if any of them would deliver meals to his apartment.

One food pantry, called “God’s Love We Deliver,” told him they could drop off groceries at his apartment, but only on days when Wolfson is undergoing dialysis for his kidney disease. So the pantry had to turn him down. “They ain’t delivering it to me,” Wolfson joked.

Story continues

Wolfson has diabetes and anemia, so his diet must be low in sugar and carbohydrates and high in iron-rich foods like red meat. The first two weeks, Wolfson can manage that diet on food stamps, but then the money runs out. “The doctors want me to eat all protein,” he said. “The last two weeks the only protein I’m getting is eggs.”

Nationally, one in seven seniors lives in poverty, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. In New York City, as many as one in three elderly people are poor. As many as half of elderly people who qualify for food stamps in New York do not apply, and surveys have shown that older Americans in particular feel there is a stigma associated with the program.

Sackman said the elderly, who are often living on fixed incomes, can become “invisible” in these debates, which often focuses on why young and healthy people need assistance.

House Republicans hope to cut the $80 billion annual program further, by kicking off 3 million people each year for 10 years. Under their plan, adults without minor children must enroll in a job training program or be employed to receive the benefits. The AARP, the powerful seniors group, opposes the proposal.

“We’re really worried,” Sackman said of the proposed cuts. “This is just the start. We’re looking at a rapidly growing senior population here and across the country and a lot of poverty.”

Wolfson said he tries not to worry about whether steeper cuts could be in the pipeline. In the meantime, he plans to scour the grocery store for sales to make up for the $11 less he gets per month.

“I’ll deal with it as it’s happening,” he said. “I’m not going to dwell on it.”"

Schoen'],Businesses slash jobs as sequester impact hits,"Even before the federal spending crunch began to pinch March 1, Chi-Yeh Han Boone was already feeling the pain of the budget squeeze known as the sequester.

The co-owner and CEO of Fort Worth Gasket & Supply – which sells parts to the military – said the loss of supply contracts forced her to lay off contract workers filling orders in the company warehouse.

“If you don’t have the cash flow, with a reduction of 25 percent of revenues you have to cut staff,” Boone said.

More job cuts are on the way as the river of government spending flowing through the U.S. economy continues to slow. The $85 billion federal spending squeeze – part of a doomsday budget package originally approved last summer to force a more rational spending plan – has now lopped more than a full percentage point from gross domestic product over the past six months and eliminated tens of thousands of federal jobs.

The hit to federal payrolls is expected to show up Friday in the latest monthly job numbers for April. Most economists are expecting the report to show a net gain of 145,000 jobs, according to the economists polled by Reuters.



The pace of layoffs is expected to pick up speed this summer. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that for the full year, federal spending cuts will reduce overall employment by about 750,000 jobs. Most agencies have just gotten started.



Private economists say that budget office estimate is probably on the high side because government managers will be looking to generate whatever savings they can by temporarily furloughing workers and cutting back hours – before resorting to outright layoffs – in order to hit their 5.1 percent sequester savings mandates.

“The extent to which it’s done through hiring or through furloughs is pretty hard to get handle on,” said Chad Stone, chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “Either way, there certainly will be less hiring than would otherwise take place.”

That means Uncle Sam’s belt-tightening will weigh on the job market through the rest of the government fiscal year, which ends Oct. 1.

Though the cuts officially took effect March 1, the impact is expected to build through the summer as federal agencies work to meet the Oct. 1 deadline.



“The way the sequester is designed, it’s gradual in its nature,"" said Gregory Daco, an economist at IHS Global Insight. “You cut budget authority, but that doesn’t mean you immediately cut spending. So the actual cuts to outlays take time to materialize.”

Those cuts will also hit other spending programs that will bring indirect pressure on non-government hiring, economists say. Cuts to federally funded, state-managed unemployment insurance programs will be concentrated in the summer months. Those cuts will hit hardest in later in the summer in states that delay implementing them.

The hit to consumer spending is expected to ripple through payrolls of industries from leisure and hospitality to retailers.

“They’re going to take a secondary hit from lower disposable income from people that are receiving benefits like unemployment compensation and other federal payments,” said Brian Kessler, an economist at Moody's Analytics.

The biggest wild card in the forecast remains the ongoing political standoff over the budget. Many agencies that have yet to announce furlough plans are still scrambling to avoid service cuts.

Some may be hoping to win a “carve out” from the sequester. The Federal Aviation Administration, for example, was recently granted a budget reprieve after air traffic control tower furloughs began snarling the nation’s airports with delays. The IRS recently announced furloughs that could delay tax refunds.

While that piecemeal process may help the agencies winning a reprieve, it could slow progress on a wider solution, Stone said.

“Carving out the squeaky wheels probably reduces in the impetus to get a deal,” he said. “And it doesn’t change the cuts that have to be made. It just focuses them on a narrower set of programs with less visibility or political interests.”

If no deal is reached, the budget cuts will continue into next winter – and beyond. The current cuts are part of a 10-year “budget control” law that caps federal spending through 2022.

But those future cuts won’t be as painful. Though they slow the growth of federal spending, they don’t reduce outlays like the current round of cuts. That means they’ll have less impact on future economic growth and hiring.

“This year, the change in (federal) spending is going to tap the breaks on job creation and the recovery,” said Kessler. “Next year is sort of a lighter tap on the gas. So adjusting to that move down is what slows growth and kills jobs.”

The hope, of course, is that the private sector economy can fill in the spending gap by creating jobs faster than the government is shedding them.

But the political gridlock over the sequester may be holding back hiring there as well. Many small business owners complain that it’s just too risky to take on new workers until they get more certainty over issues like tax reform and health care spending.

Not all business owners agree.

Boone said that as her competitors pull back, she’s developing plans to draw on savings to invest in new manufacturing equipment and hire skilled staff to expand her product line.

“It is risky. It’s a long learning curve and it’s a lot of investment in hiring and equipment,” she said. “But if I don’t take the risk to invest, the result is zero. If I take the risk to invest – and work hard and learn – we might open up a new market to make up for the business that we lost.”"

The failure by Congress on Monday to renew the federal budget into a new fiscal year is expected to be followed in a few weeks — no one knows exactly when — by an even more dangerous stalemate over raising the government's borrowing authority.

""You can only see an endgame that ends with one side or the other blinking, and it's hard to predict who that will be,"" Tony Fratto, a Washington consultant and former Treasury official, told CNBC. ""They may not blink until after government has taken a day or two of not paying some bills — which some would consider a technical default.""

Such a default could wreak much deeper havoc than the ongoing government shutdown.

Though disruptive and costly, the current budget freeze is expected to have limited impact on the economy and financial markets, which so far have largely shrugged off Washington's fiscal follies.

While hundreds of thousands of government workers have been sent home, much of the government is operating under spending rules that allow most agencies to keep functioning. That's why the last 17 such shutdowns have caused little long-term damage.

If the government exhausts its legal authority to borrow, however, the Treasury says it will be forced to shut off all cash payments.

(Read more: Obama: GOP shut down government over 'ideological crusade')

That's why last week's political stalemate over the federal budget — embarrassing, pointless, infuriating, to be sure — is shaping up as a mild annoyance compared to the potential mayhem looming if Congress forces the Treasury to default on its payments.

Until Monday, many observers expected Congress and the White House to reach some sort of compromise before the budget deadline. Now, many are reconsidering the outlook for averting a debt ceiling debacle.

""The shutdown doesn't bode well for the debt ceiling negotiation,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. ""While the House Republican leadership is sort of willing to go along and have this partial shutdown, a debt ceiling standoff is much more dangerous. ""

The nation's borrowing limit currently stands at about $16.7 trillion. Unlike virtually every other country in the developed world, that cap has to be extended periodically by a special act of Congress. Though often contentious, the once-routine debt ceiling extension has recently become a political weapon of mass destruction.

Congress came close to forcing a Treasury default in July 2011, pulling back from the brink at the last minute and agreeing to a compromise. The spectacle cost the U.S. its Triple-A credit rating, but no payments were missed. Now, with Congress still dug in over a bitter fight to delay the White House's health care reform law, there's little time left to avert a freeze on government borrowing.

Unlike the hard deadline of the new fiscal year that began Tuesday, the debt ceiling deadline is more complex and dangerous because it's not clear just when it will be reached. The Treasury has been deferring some payments and tapping reserves, but last week estimated that it will exhaust those ""extraordinary measures"" in less than three weeks.

The forecast is complicated by the complexities of government spending and receipts, which don't flow in a steady stream week-in, week-out like a household paying regular monthly bills with a fixed weekly paycheck.

(Read more: 800,000 out of work as US government shuts down)

With some 80 million payments moving through the system each month, the government's revenues and expenses ebb and flow with irregular, sometimes unpredictable, peaks and troughs on both the income and payment sides of the ledger. Social Security checks typically go out at the beginning of the month, for example. Quarterly tax receipts, on the other hand, typically cluster around the middle of the month.

Treasury figures it will have just $30 billion left on hand by Oct. 17 — most likely not enough to cover all government spending that day. On a typical day, the government's bills reach $60 billion. The department faces an even bigger wild card every Thursday, when it rolls over about $100 billion in U.S. debt. If bond holders decided they wanted to be repaid rather than rolling over that paper, the Treasury would be on the hook for those redemptions.

No matter when the cash runs out, the effects of freezing payments would be much more dramatic than the government shutdown. Without Social Security checks, retirees would be forced to cut spending; many don't have a deep pool of savings to draw on. Unpaid government contractors would be forced to lay off workers.

Federal spending would fall by roughly 20 percent almost overnight. A protracted borrowing freeze would quickly tip the economy back into recession. It would also force the suspension of interest payments on the national debt for the first time in the country's history.

Such a default would have unpredictable — and potentially dire — consequences. At the very least, interest rates would likely rise to offset the risk of holding Treasuries. The ripple effects — even more difficult to predict — could spark a global credit freeze not unlike the failure of Lehman Brothers in Sept. 2008.

(Read more: Lehman a 'kindergarten show' next to any default)

Some default skeptics have argued that such an outcome is highly unlikely because the Treasury would still have enough cash coming in to pay interest on the national debt.

Even with a borrowing freeze, cash would continue to flow into the Treasury's account from tax receipts and other payments due the government. Moody's points out that interest on the debt makes up just 7 percent of federal spending, leaving plenty of money left over to pay interest to bond investors.

""However, the government would have to make painful choices as to which expenditure to cut, and there is no historic precedent that provides confidence that interest payments would be prioritized over discretionary spending,"" wrote Moody's analysts last week.

The Treasury has said it has no legal authority to decide which bills to pay and which to ignore. It's also not clear whether its payment system could be rejiggered to prioritize some payments over others.

In any case, failing to make any federal obligations would raise lasting questions about the U.S. government's ""full faith and credit.""

""Any plan to prioritize some payments over others is simply default by another name,"" Treasury Secretary Jack Lew warned in a letter to lawmakers last week.

Some default deniers also argue that President Obama has the power to override Congress and authorize the Treasury to continue borrowing, based on language in the 14th Amendment (""The validity of the public debt of the United States ... shall not be questioned."")

That's another novel theory Lew sought to slap down in a speech last month

""Raising the debt limit is Congress's responsibility because Congress, and Congress alone, is empowered to set the maximum amount the government can borrow to meet its financial obligations,"" he told the Economic Club of Washington, D.C.

Neither side is right.

Most of the pension funds in extreme crisis (including those in Illinois, Kansas, Detroit and Chicago) got that way not because of the pension system itself but rather because elected officials failed to make the annual required contributions needed to keep funds solvent. Skipping these payments was politically expedient during the Great Recession, but the unpaid bills compounded quickly.

The amounts now owed to some of the worst-funded plans, like Detroit’s, are beyond the realistic ability of their sponsoring governments to pay. This, of course, infuriates union members who note, accurately, that if the bills had been paid on time, the crisis wouldn’t exist, at least in its present proportions.

California has a different problem. Here, it is not possible for local agencies to defer or reduce their required contributions to the California Public Employees Retirement System, or CalPERS. California’s pension problems have much more to do with pension enhancements. This was a major factor, but far from the sole cause, of bankruptcies in Vallejo, Stockton and San Bernardino.

Before pension formulas were increased in 1999, the typical police and fire employee accrued 2% for each year of service as long as the employee retired at 50 or later. A person who started as a firefighter or police officer at 20, say, could retire at 50 with 60% of his or her pay. The post-1999 enhanced formula adopted by most jurisdictions statewide was 3% for each year worked if they retired at 50 or later. This meant that those same 30 years were now worth 90% of salary, a 50% jump.

2013 ENDINGS: Columnist Patt Morrison on what she won’t miss

On average, cities and counties in California pay about 35% of every police and fire salary dollar as the employer contribution to CalPERS. Employees themselves contribute an additional 8% to 12%. This is why California’s pension system is not in a crisis, despite what the anti-union critics say. Our local governments and their employees are making contributions totaling 40% to 50% of salary to keep the state’s pension system solvent.

But it’s easy to see why governments are having a hard time shouldering the financial burden. That burden has been made harder by CalPERS’ decision to slowly ratchet back its investment return and other assumptions to more conservative positions. This will further improve CalPERS’ financial situation (which is already pretty good), but employer rates will also rise. The total contributions of employer and employee may one day hit nearly 60% of a salary.

This is the part of the problem that unions have been loath to recognize.

More than 40% of the pension contribution made by cities and counties for police and fire employees is attributable to the increase from pension enhancements, which raised the payout after 30 years of employment from 60% to 90%. For a medium-sized suburb with 100 sworn police officers and 50 sworn firefighters earning an average base pay of $80,000 annually, the difference between the old pension formula and the new amounts to $1.8 million a year.

Reforms enacted last year in California trimmed back pensions for new hires to a level roughly similar to the pre-1999 levels. But the rub for employers is that because these new formulas apply only to new employees, it will take at least 10 years to realize significant savings. In the meantime, governments will be funding the higher-formula employees throughout their working life and retirement.

Still, the new pension formulas will eventually bend the cost curve downward. What they won’t do, but should, is require an increase in the percentage that employees have to pay.

It would not be unreasonable to ask the grandfathered employees to increase their contribution to, say, one-third of the employer-employee total. This might mean a very high employee contribution of 20%, but it would still be a bargain considering it buys a lifetime pension of 90% of very generous pay.

In the end, neither side’s extreme rhetoric comes close to accurately describing the situation. Conservatives who lay the blame for the bankruptcies of Vallejo, Stockton and San Bernardino solely at the feet of employee pensions must understand that many factors led to these cities’ insolvency, including huge losses of tax revenue, population flight and inflexible salary increase requirements embedded in their charters. The vast majority of cities and counties in California are not on the same path as Vallejo, Stockton and San Bernardino.

By the same token, employee unions have to accept that the enhanced benefit formulas for public safety employees are not sustainable without increased employee cost-sharing. It is true that none of these benefit enhancements was a secret deal; they were publicly adopted contracts considered in the full sunshine by elected officials only too willing to curry favor with employee unions at the time, especially police and fire unions. But there is a point at which such generosity is unsustainable when coupled with other major cost generators and tax losses, as we saw in varying degrees in San Bernardino, Stockton and Vallejo.

There is a realistic and moderate solution, however.

Conservatives need to dial down the rhetoric and stop trying to use pensions as a Trojan horse to abolish public employee unions. They also need to accept that defined-benefit pension plans with firm guarantees for the future are good public policy if managed prudently. Union members need to acknowledge that, in order to keep some very favorable benefits, they will have to contribute more of their own pay. They also need to accept that state and local governments have limits: salary, benefits and job security have to remain in line with a city’s actual resources.

That’s all it would take. If only it weren’t politically unacceptable to both sides.

State tax revenues come from some unusual sources

A sliced bagel is taxed in New York%2C but not an unsliced one

In Connecticut%2C adult diapers are tax-free%3B children%27s diapers are taxed

If you buy a bagel in New York, prepare to pay a bit more to have it sliced.

New York imposes an 8 cent tax to all ""altered"" bagels, whether it is sliced, toasted or served with a ""schmear"" of cream cheese or butter.

""Cut bagels cross the line and become a prepared meal or food sold for on-premises consumption, which is taxable,"" explains Carla Yrjanson, vice president of tax research and content for Thomson Reuters. ""Uncut bagels are typically sold for home consumption and would meet the definition of a (tax) exempt food in New York.""

Tax revenue for states often stems from unusual laws in an effort to clearly define what goods or services can be taxed. Such taxes allow states to bring in extra revenue without raising taxes across the board, said Barbara Weltman, author of J.K. Lasser's Small Business Taxes 2013.

Among some of the more unusual:

Maine: Although it is one of the country's smallest states, Maine produces the nation's biggest blueberry output. The state collects $1.50 per 100 pounds of blueberries sold.

Utah: Businesses that hire nude or partially nude workers pay an extra 10% tax for all services sold. The tax, passed in 2004, targeted erotic dancing clubs and escort services, with the revenue allocated toward treatment services for sex offenders and funding for investigation of Internet crimes against children.

Kansas: There is an amusement tax for a ride in a tethered (attached to the ground) hot air balloon. Unattached balloon rides, however, qualify as transportation and are tax-exempt.

California: The state imposes a 33% tax on fruit bought from vending machines. It is cheaper, and perhaps healthier, to stick to the fruit aisle in the grocery store.

Arkansas: A 6% tax is charged for tattoos, body piercings and electrolysis.

Alabama: The state stacks on a 10 cent tax for all 54-or-less-card decks of playing cards sold. Nevada, on the other hand, dishes out a free deck for each tax return filed.

Illinois: It charges a 5% tax on candy, on top of the state's 1.0% food tax. The 5% tax exempts candy containing flour as a means of differentiating candy from food, says Susan Hofer, a spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of Revenue. The tax was implemented in 2009, bringing in an additional $35-$41 million in revenue, she added.

Colorado: The state taxes retailers of food, meals or beverages a tax on""nonessential"" food-related items, including napkins and bibs, utensils and straws. Paper cups and disposable containers are considered essential and are not taxed.

West Virginia: It imposes taxes on glow-worms, trick noisemakers and sparklers... a tax damper on a sparkling celebration.

Maryland: It charges homeowners and businesses a sewage tax, or ""flush tax,"" of $2.50 a month.

Connecticut : Adult diapers go untaxed. Children's diapers, on the other hand, are taxed.
